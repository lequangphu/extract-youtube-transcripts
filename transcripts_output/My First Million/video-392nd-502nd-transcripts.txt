so Sam tell me this do you like watching sweaty men fight to the death in their underwear me too every weekend I I build my Saturdays around it well I think you should invest in in their Saturdays uh my pick for stocka paloa 2024 [Music] is all right we're live Sean did you just go to the uh Black Friday sale at Tommy Bahama what's going on I went into the old Dad's closet today and got a little shirt because it's a special occasion and I needed to dress up that's your version of dressing up yeah this is up dude all right what are we doing today today this is stock of paloa the first ever first annual stock of paloa which you may not know what that means because we made it up basically me and Sam said what if we did an episode where we pick a stock so each of us are going to go through the stock market we're GNA each pick a stock that we have to make a case for if you've ever seen there's a conference called the sewn conference and it's kind of like a TED talk but for stock Pickers and all the biggest names go there bill lman goes there and dren Miller and whoever chth and they all they get on stage and they make like a 20 minute case for a particular stock why they're long or why are they're bullish on something and uh those guys are good and those talks are fun we wanted to try it too and uh do it our way so the MFM style of this it's called stock aooa both me and Sam have picked a stock we do not know what each other have picked we're gonna get 20 minutes each to present and so if you're on the like just the audio podcast feed I know I've been telling you YouTube is where it's at today YouTube is for sure where it's at because we got slides your boys came prepared and I have data I got charts I have a whole bunch of stuff here so you want to go to YouTube where you're going to actually be able to see the screen and see us uh sharing slides so we got 20 minutes each to do it for the listener who are on not YouTube we have to ask them to do something when they finally go to YouTube that's right that's right if you go there and you don't hit the Subscribe button a curse is placed on your family for seven years and I don't want that for any of you guys so go ahead and hit subscribe when you're there because it's super important for your family it's a simple pitch we put all this work in and they don't have to pay us back with anything other than a subscribe on YouTube it's free and easy for them and it makes just a ton of difference to us so just go and do that all right now what are you saying okay so you're ready to begin do we need to should we just go into it uh no rules okay so we're kind of making up the rules in the fly so uh we're going to do how about 20 minutes so you get 20 minutes I'll ask questions but I'll try not to interrupt too much and then we'll do like we'll just we'll talk for about it for a few minutes afterwards and then I'll pitch and then the last 10 or however many minutes left we'll we'll each vote but then in the YouTube comments you guys actually have to vote who wins but when we say win what is win mean here because we're not exactly we're going to be you guys can like we could play a drinking game where it's like count the disclosures you're G to see the disclosure constantly of saying we have no idea what we're talking about it's just something fun and cool but how do we base win on is it by Showmanship is it by what company you think is going to have longm the best case but what does best mean a 10year well I don't know and that's part of the fun here making it up as we go we could say 10 years is it just entertainment cuz that's different well this is definitely entertainment but the entertainment has to have a foundation of you can't just be making [ __ ] up right we got to have actual good insights or good analysis presented in a in a wonderful way right the way that any presentation is sort of scored you have style points and you have substance points and we're going to take both of those factors into consideration to pick the the ultimate winner um I don't know if you have you ever gone and watched any of these by the way like you know in uh I remember when chamath went on stage in 2016 and he was like there's there's a multi-trillion dollar company hidden in plain sight and he made a case for why Amazon was going to get to three trillion by 2025 this is back in 2015 what is it now it's currently like close to two trillion and we got year a year left he's not far off um he then went up and did a case for box and I bought a [ __ ] ton of box stock and buck then just [ __ ] the bed for the next three years and if you go back all the smartest guys Bill lman he goes up there and makes a case for some housing thing terrible stocks right I went back and I actually charted how how these picks did really bad so actually we might be just as good as them because we're also going to be terrible what's considered good for these guys like is it like a batting average or it's like if you're 300 if you're you know which 30% right you're the best no I think it's just based on the the returns right so like how much you put in versus how often you're right right the multiple the multiple of those two so you know uh they just got to get enough right where the overall returns are there but we should say this first slide is the most important slide which is that this is not Financial advice this is entirely for entertainment purposes only uh my lawyer has told me to say that but it's actually true this is only for entertainment purposes I forbid you from actually investing in any of the things that we talk about I am a idiot when it comes to the stock market so if you take my financial advice I consider you an idiot too that's my disclaimer there needs to be a song where it's a what did you say throw your hands in the air and lose your like you just don't care exactly stock of paloa that's the stock OFA Anthem all right let's jump in all right my turn uh I'm gonna start my clock let's go okay so here's the general idea if you're buying one stock Sam I know you're an index fund guy right you like to go into the S&P 500 and spread out your risk uh and you're right if you're buying one stock you're taking more risk than the index and if you look back last 10 years the index has given you about a 10 and a half% annual return over a 10-year period 10 and half half perc over 10 years so that's we'd have to beat that to justify taking the additional risk of picking one stock because that's going to basically 2.7x your money in a 10e span so if you want to do a little better than double almost triple your money in 10 years just put in the SP 500 so we're looking for something that if we're going to take more risk we need to get more reward so here's what I'm I'm thinking I decided to Peg for what do I think could get me a 5x in 10 years okay 5x in 10 years double what the um what the S&B 500 is going to do so which stock did I pick Sam I'm sure you're wondering well let's ask the Oracle of Omaha AKA buff Daddy what would Warren Buffett do because I'm not a great stock picker so I wanted to go and study the great stock Pickers of all time and look at what would be their criteria what are they looking for so that I can learn from them and I went back and I learned everything I could from Moren Buffett and I realize that there's five big things that he looks for okay so you ready for the five big ones the first under understandability meaning he doesn't invest in [ __ ] he doesn't understand if it's too complicated or if it's outside of his circle of competence he's simply not investing and so the idea is is the business simple enough that an idiot like me could understand it and that ideally an idiot can even run it right such a simple business so understandability number two an economic moat so we want few competitors we want some pricing power and we want to make sure that this business is so defensible that it's going to be around in 50 years because uh you know Warren is usually a Buy and Hold investor he's he's not really trying to trade in and out and time the market he's looking for time in market and he's looking to be in the in the company for a long time um and so we want an economic mode something that's super durable all right number three competent management so management basically a strong management team is always going to be a um uh you know big benefit for anything uh for any stock okay last last two margin of safety means we got to be buying this we can't be buying this at some extreme price even if it's a great company if it's massively overpriced it's too hot in the market then we're taking too much risk so what we want to do is buy dollar bills for 80 cents right that's a that's a great margin of safety and of course lastly strong financials so high earnings low capex low debt that's really what we look for okay so this is why Warren Buffett is buying Brands not stocks I I love this line actually in my research he goes don't buy a stock buy a company subtle difference but he's looking to basically like what would what don't try to buy the stock because you think the price going to go up by the company because you think that company is going to endure and be successful and and just grow steadily for a long period of time that's a new thing that he did so it's not new for I mean he he didn't start doing that until his 60s so before he was buying stocks purely in the financials he's like I don't care what they sell and then he like met Coke and then he like invested in Washington Post and he's like oh no the brand is actually where it's at exactly he used to do the cigarette butt investing where you know if there's two Puffs left on the cigarette um okay let's do it there's value there but he he credits Charlie Munger for showing showing him that actually it's better to pay uh you know a fair price for a great business than a great price for just a fair business and so this that's why he's now invested in Apple Bank of America American Express Coca-Cola Geico these are brands that have been around for 50 years and that's what he's looking for all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what the payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the links in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM okay so simple Buffet formula just to summarize buy brands that you understand that'll be here 50 years from now that spit off cash at a fair fair price if you do all that you can hold forever you've done well so I looked and I looked and truth be told I actually started with one in mind and then reverse engineered this whole presentation but um I have one so Sam tell me this do you like watching sweaty men fight to the death in their underwear me too every weekend I I build my Saturdays around it well I think you should invest in in their Saturdays uh my pick for stocka paloa 2024 is TKO TKO is the stock that owns um WWE and the UFC and I think that TKO is a Buffett stock here's Buffett you know looking ready for Wrestlemania why is it why does it fit the criteria so understandability very easy to understand it's a holding company that owns these sports franchises that owns these leagues underneath them okay that's the that's all the business is it's it does nothing else besides that um fing is the easiest thing to understand in the world world uh I don't know if you've heard this great thing that uh that that Dana White says he goes let's say you walk out into a sports field on a Sunday and there's a soccer game over here and a basketball game over there and these guys are playing flag football and you could go look at any one of those directions you might have a favorite sport but if somebody else fight and there's a fight going on everybody's head's going to turn it is a a human nature thing that we like to watch people compete and fight um and is global everywhere in the world people don't you know if you go to China people don't know the rules of football you come to America people don't know the rules of cricket but everybody understands the concept of these two guys are going to fight each other uh everybody around the world and so it is the easiest to understand product and business the business is very simple fans pay to watch fights people pay pay-per-view Sam how much do you think you've paid in pay-per-view uh per year what are you what are you spending on your UFC fandom so uh I would probably say I um buy the five a year so that's $500 I think and then I only have a ESPN subscription like dude I don't know anything about sports I just found out that the Super Bowl is this Sunday I thought it was in November I only I pay for ESPN just for that so that's another 60 and then I attend one to three a year which is uh quite expensive that's a$ thousand dollar a show at least exactly High LTV fans okay so let's let's go through these now economic Moe um name the competitor to the UFC name a competitor to to WWE they've all come and gone Bellator was the the most well-funded competitor to to UFC it was funded by Viacom they put hundreds of millions of dollars into this thing it failed and they just sold it for you know uh less than what they put what they invested into it they sold it for 100 million bucks the number two competitor sold for 100 million the UFC sold for 4.2 billion so that's the gap between one and two uh growing up I loved WCW that was the big competitor to WWE guess what it folded and they took all the wrestlers uh aew all those things basically these two brands have over 95% market share in their Market this is total Monopoly more than Google has in the search Market do you know how popular WWE is on YouTube have have you did you look into that I have I have a couple slides later they dominate social media it's the 10th the 10th most popular channel on all of YouTube is WWE that's insane right like the fact that these two have more market share in their Market than Google has in the search Market shows you the just complete and utter dominance and the fact that competitors have come and gone people have taken their best shot and uh they haven't been able to touch them so you have you have two brands that have been around for a while and will be around for a while okay competent management we have Ari Emanuel if you've ever seen Entourage the character Ari Gold is based on on Ari Emanuel he is an absolute power player power broker in in the entertainment business you have Dana White the guy who's basically been a Founder CEO of this essentially since they bought it for two million bucks bought it for 2 million sold it for 4.2 billion and he's uh he's still going and he's still going strong this guy is an absolute animal and you have uh Egan Durban who's with silver L Partners that's their kind of institutional Capital behind this and that guy's also you know got a pretty crazy track record with multiple billion dollar um or multi-billion dollar plays like Skype and whatnot so super good management team okay margin of safety so uh I don't know if you know how much money these make but they basically the combined entities generate over a million dollars oh sorry a billion dollars a year of eida uh and it trades at about 14x so it's about a 14 billion dollar market cap company right now with four with with a billion dollars of eida um just to put this into comparison uh if UFC plus WWE two full like leagues are 14 billion the Phoenix Suns one NBA franchise just sold for 5 billion right so this this is basically three Phoenix Suns and you get the entire universe of combat sport of of uh of of you know fighting entertainment which is wrestling and UFC everything except for boxing um F1 which is uh you know to me seems super Niche like F1 is is so so Niche do you know how much F1 just sold for no idea eight and a half billion dollars and F1 has a big problem which is no matter how popular F1 is they have to pay out to all the teams the franchises so half the revenue goes to the Aston Martin team and then the Mercedes team and whoever else so UFC doesn't have any of that all the fighters are independent contractors they don't even pay him salaries there's no guaranteed salaries independent contractors who make about 15 15 to 17% of the overall Revenue goes to the fighters way less at every other sport no teams no no no rev sharing with anybody basically they get you bring that up later in your presentation we do I do have a wrist slide which is uh around that yes uh and the best part this is all Air resistant like we don't know what the hell's going to happen with ai ai is pretty clearly the next big thing and it's going to wreck a bunch of industry it's going to redo the way that insurance works and the way that cars work and the way that um you know uh software is built and and all this stuff how you going to use AI to generate like you can't use AI to make two guys fight in a in a in a ring it's not going to happen and so this is a AI proof uh industry which is nice because War Buffett buff daddy he's looking for things that are not going to change and I think this is not going to change all right last one it's growing nicely so it's growing 20% a year right now but there's also the big the big prize with any sports league is media rights deals and the media rights for both of these are coming up this year and next and so they have a chance to renegotiate and basically double uh what they're getting paid for by all the streaming companies by Netflix and by Amazon and ESPN and all the companies that want they need live sports because live sports are one of the only things that people watch concurrently and have to look at the ads because they're watching during the thing there's no DVR there's no there's no binge mode there's no streaming um and so live sports is this one of the few live sports assets that exist and the media deals are coming up and they might be a lot bigger than people think all right last few slides consistent cash flow so these are profitable companies they spit off cash uh you know they're spitting off you know a couple hundred million bucks a year free cash flow and they don't need to invest it they don't own a ton of uh real estate or they don't have to buy more machines in order to grow they just put on they just keep putting on shows it's all variable uh a couple of the risks that are worth mentioning it's got a bunch of debt they use debt to buy the the franchises these leagues and so um they still have a few billion dollars of debt and last thing uh stock performance has not been great I think uh this is one where we're going to have to Buck the trend we're gonna have to know what the market doesn't know right now and we're gonna have to to go ahead and um outperform what date did that drop so the they merged in like mid 2023 but does that drop because Vince McMahon um not just Vince McMahon I think basically what happened was they merged people didn't understand the terms they didn't understand what was going to happen what was the plan all that stuff and the Vince McMahon stuff happened at the same time got and so they dropped about 15% on the merger which is kind of crazy before they were both public and they were both trading at about eight to 10 billion in valuation and so when they merged they were supposed to be like a 20 billion do entity and they're currently trading at 14 um right after they merged so that was that's what happened last year lastly a couple other risk like you talked about Fighters not getting paid enough so their cost could go up if the fighters ever unionized and were able to collectively bargain which they haven't done but the NBA and NFL all has um and lastly I don't know what's gonna happen if Dana ever leaves he is the PowerHouse and the CEO who's driving this thing he's cashed out so he um does not own the same stake that he owned before um he's not even on if you go look at the stock violing he's not on the cap table so he said he has skin in the game still but it's not list listed anywhere so I'm not sure what he has and uh he might you know might might retire one day and I think that would be a big shock to the business like Zuck retiring or or Bezos retiring you know it can affect the business can I add a few a few wrists let me add a few wrists yeah go for it all right first Dana White is insane so he's mostly insane in a good way but there's a lot of liability there's a lot of liability in this industry because we're talking about grown men fighting in their underwear in front of millions of people the the person who likes that and runs that as well as the person who actually does that in order to be great at that you have to be insane and so what that means is there's been RIS with Dana Dana has said a lot of crazy stuff I don't even think that I'm not even going to say if I think it's right or wrong that it's irrelevant what's irrelevant is that a lot of people think it's wrong um he also got in trouble for smacking his wife uh and that was on video Vince McMahon's now in trouble for uh not even sexual harassment I think it's beyond that and then also like the third famous guy in the UFC right now Shan Strickland again I don't care if you like what he says or dislike what he says there's a lot of people who dislike what he says as it regards like the whole trans thing and gay thing and so inherently there's going to be all types of nutty people like that I think it won't impact the business at all I think it's actually going to make the business better because the people who are behind them are going to be harder behind them and I think but but I do think it will scare institutional money um and that's basically my downside and that lawsuit that that lawsuit is actually a pretty big lawsuit so I think that the only uh counter to that is usually the risks are what ifs all the things you mentioned have already happened they've already happened they've already happened uh and the business is doing fine right so like Dana has been saying crazy stuff for 20 years what okay I guess he'll just continue continue as is that's business as that's a risk that's a risk that's a what if I think there's some some risk there but but not that much in fact I would actually say um they the UFC has has shown tremendous anti fragility so for example if this is a business that depends on Live Events it's all based on live events and it survived Co it could survive anything right Live Events had to all shut down and the UFC figured out way why because founder CEO he's got the willpower the guy went to like Abu Dhabi created a bubble and start created something called fight Island and hosted the fights in a bubble on fight Island himself um you know they found a way around the pandemic I think they could find a way around but I'm an idiot keep in mind I'm an idiot I don't think that's going to impact any of the business I think all those things are going to make their business the revenue The Profit greater I just wonder how will that impact like if Fidelity or one of if one of these big companies wants to buy a huge chunk of their comp of the stock yeah yeah I think that's that's fair um all right last couple things I think the global nature of this is is underrated and so when you think about where does growth come from for these types of leagues it comes from two things one is streaming streaming deals which are getting bigger and bigger and bigger and the other is uh globalization uh I don't know if you know but the NBA does like crazy amount of work to globalize they you know have like camps all throughout Africa and India they go every summer they broadcast games they cut deals to broadcast games they will play a game in in Europe to try to get fans the NFL does the same thing they play a game in London to try to get fans there but the UFC actually like inherently has that they get champions from all over the world but they've never gone to Africa they I don't I I think maybe one time they've done one event in China basically China India and Africa are still untapped but they're proven that they have product Market fit um they have they they have fans they just haven't done the events there yet and the biggest case for this is really that these leagues de uh they develop lifelong fans um you know you've been a fan and I I would guess that 20 years from now you're probably still going to be a fan your kids might become fans uh this is how Sports works it's basically generational people watch them till they're you know my grandparents will watch sports but then they'll take their kids to the events and they'll get their kids involved and they they become fans as well the UFC is only 30 years old that's that's incredibly Young when it comes to a league like this and you know what they're better at than everyone else telling stories and creating characters they are without a doubt the best at this they kick ass compared to any of the other leagues so check this out this is on Instagram the NFL which is the biggest most profitable Sports league in the United States biggest most profitable league has 29 million followers the UFC has 39 million followers because they are better at social media and they are better at storytelling which is essentially saying they're better at the way the world works now and the NL was better at the way the world worked 20 years ago uh same thing you know here's YouTube Here's the YouTube channel has 17 and a half million subscribers for the UFC on YouTube baseball which has been around for whatever 100 years 4.9 million subscribers it's insane how they get dominated by this and so they uh you know you get to you get to ride on the back of that and the other thing is that um AR emanuel's company which bought uh bought these they're just better at negotiating media rights that's what they've been doing for their entire career for for you know actors and and television shows and whatnot better uh negotiating sponsorships if you look at where the UFC was when they bought it versus where it is now you know it was unprofitable there and growing you know growing at an okay clip now it's growing faster and more profitable and it is profitable because of the work that they've done WWE just cut a a 10year five billion doll deal with Netflix just for one of their shows which is kind of insane it's gon to go from USA Network to Netflix these are now like $300 million a year streaming deals that they're picking up and that is all Sam thank you very much ladies and gentlemen stock paloa that was very good that was very good my um bias is heavy here I I tell people they they ask like what my hobbies are if I pay attention to sports I say I pay attention to only two sports fighting and the other one's way nerdier track and field I like track and field and UFC I'm a super fan and I think there's so many super fans like me uh I don't know how that those super fans compared to the other sports I I don't know it's as strong but I'm a huge fan uh the stock it's a it's a good brand I agree I think the risks are too high though I think there I think there Dana's is do you think if someone left he could you said that on your second point it was like anyone can run it do you think someone can run it as good as him uh I do think you get the benefit of the kind of founder-led company when you have Dana there um and you would lose that if he if he left so I do think it'll it will continue to run but I don't think you'd get that X Factor back of what Dana brings to the table and what Vince McMahon brought to the table till he was how old is Vince McMahon he's like 80 or something like that the guy ran the league for like 50 years or something and he was a character he was a character on the show in the show and I think Dana is a character in the show I think Dana is the most popular UFC fighter well I think well Connor but like I think he could run this thing for like 30 more years maybe I think maybe I think that I think that running this type of league is the harder than any other league maybe F1 actually would be really challenging because they're like they kind of seem like divas but the UFC I think dealing with these types of Fighters have you ever hung out with a professional fighter or like upand cominging professional fighters I I've been around a handful of them they're insane they're insane they're they're hard to work with they're they're nuts and it would be very challenging and also the lawsuit that they have so to put that in perspective you said that they pay their Fighters 14% how much does the NFL pay their uh or the NFL and NBA are about % um that's the collective bargaining that's what they negotiated and right now you made a case that they're a monopoly that's the exact case that the lawsuit is trying to bake which is that UFC's Monopoly and that you guys you have to allow us to do collective bargaining and I I have looked into it a little bit but it seems like they've got a great case and that could meaningfully change the economics it could it could that is I I I would put that as the number one risk to to shift the economics of the business dude there's some guys like they'll say in the postf fight uh interview they're like I'm the Champion now eight months ago I was driving Uber and and I'm still driving an Uber because I don't get paid like well like to put this in perspective there's this guy named Francis Neu I think he's from Cameroon he's like the uh the American dream he came over here with nothing I think he worked in like a mine you know like a blood diamond type of mine like crazy stuff he's now Champion do you know how much money he was he was world champion in the heavyweight division of the UFC he looked like an animal when you think of a heavyweight champion this is what you want this guy to look like look like beautiful story great guy do you know how much he was getting paid per fight I feel like it was like 500k or something it was about $600,000 that's how much this guy was getting paid to fight the scariest people on Earth it's I know a mid-level engineer at Google that makes more than that it's insane the bad on the planet yeah it's insane it's it's it's insane and so that needs to change I think for there to be true longevity for the sport and if that changes there's actually going to be bad stuff for the business or at least will be less good but great presentation I uh I'm a fan of UFC I think that was a great presentation all right your turn all right now it's my turn so look we said the disclosure already that this really we don't know anything so I'm actually gonna not even focus too much on the numbers I'm going to focus on the story and I just want to put this disclosure up front now before I get into this I want to tell you a few other companies that I looked at I looked at rivian I looked at 23 me that's a total [ __ ] show I looked at Container Store cuz maybe that's the next meme stop and of course I looked at HubSpot because I own HubSpot and I'm trying to do a little pump and dump scheme I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm not going to talk about that now I was trying to think about this and I was like should we do like a Wolf of Wall Street pitch you know how he's pitching penny stocks where he's like hi John the reason I'm calling is I've got this new patent technology that has huge upside potential and little downside potential is this something where I could maybe get in on the ground floor yeah and then I realized I'm not going to do that I'm just going to tell you I'm just going to base all of everything that I'm doing here on what do I think is cool and interesting and so what do I think is cool and interesting look if you want to make great money you invest in Amazon it's a slow predictable it's going to be I think it's a great company but that sound interesting to me we all know that same with everything elon's doing at this point he's the man I can't invest in Tesla I can't invest in anything he's ever done that's dorky plus look at him I don't want to invest in that yeah I like how you use the uh pre-plastic surgery Elon one there're nice there's a point I've got a point here and then I looked at Bill Gates and I looked at this guy he like you know Microsoft also great company I like the CEO they're doing great things but we've been there done that I think it all makes money but it's a little bit boring it's not for this podcast so what is interesting look at this guy do you know who that is uh that is uh the lvmh guy right the lvmh guy we're gonna call him es cargo because I don't know how to pronounce his name what's his name Bernard Bernard all how do you say his last name Bernard uh Arnold yeah we're gonna call esar Berard Arnold as we call here on MFM the slug eaten suit wearing beautiful Frenchman that's what we're going to call this guy uh so he's great so lvmh what here's what they do this isn't my company but this is the person I got inspired by so they own 100 plus luxury Brands Dior um fenny Sephora Tiffany hublo they own luxury Brands and the reason why this guy this guy got into the luxury business and I found three quotes by him you use Warren Buffett as your kind of like rule Setter for how you're going to pitch a stock I'm going to use this guy he used to own a construction company and then he got super into luxury businesses and I'm going to explain three quotes as to why he said that so he said in luxury business you have to build on Heritage and so have you ever heard that phrase Lindy so Lindy is a popular phrase that's floating around on the Twitter circles it basically just means the time of which something has existed is directly correlated to the time that it will continue to exist so something that's been around for a long time will likely be around for a long time something that's brand new and hasn't been around for a long time can go way easier and so for in order to build a luxury brand What attracted this guy he's like I need something that can last that's been around for a long time and that means it's going to last a long time he also said luxury goods are the only area in which it's possible to make luxury margins okay High margins so I've got to find a company that has that can last a long time because it's been around for a long time it has high margins and then the final thing he says is affordable luxury those two words they don't even go together meaning what I've got to find some a product a company that sells a product that is expensive and exclusive now what fits that bill Sean originally I thought of James Bond James Bond like that's like the definition of cool guy and exclusive and like you dream wanting to be him but it's going to be impossible to attain and so the the product that and the brand that I almost chose was what something that James Bond is synonymous for do you know what that car is uh the Aston Martin I believe that is an Aston Martin and so Aston Martin that kind of that kind of that kind of got me interested Aston Martin has a strong brand but they have a [ __ ] multiple they've got a decent product but it's actually one of the least uh valuable car companies in the world I believe right now it's only trading at like $2 billion so it's not that uh big of a business now ASD Martin it's been around for a long time I think it's going to continue being around for a long time I think a lot of young men dream of having an ason Martin their margin is [ __ ] so it's been losing money so that kind of gets it out of the way I can't do that and in terms of like being exclusive and expensive it is expensive but because not that many people want an as Martin compared to all the other cars I wouldn't exactly say that it's that exclusive so ason Martin not good enough so what is good enough so I found a company that has been around for a very long time it's got huge margins in fact it's got the best margins in its industry it's very expensive and it's so exclusive that even if you wanted to buy it in many cases you cannot do I have your interest I you have me interested you had my attention and now you have my interest okay so you probably don't know who this person is do you I do not all right this man he's he's he's no longer around but he was born in the early 1900s his name is Enzo Enzo started out as a race car driver and he drove I actually believe he might have drove for uh uh Aston Martin at one point but uh he also drove for Fiat an Italian car company and he was so into race car driving that he goes this these Fiats they ain't cutting it for me I have to make my own car and I'm going to make the best car he goes I'm basically just going to make an engine and I'm going to put wheels on it and aerodynamics be damned that's what you say if you have a [ __ ] engine I'm only going to focus on the engine and he was obsessed with making an engine and eventually other people got obsessed with his engines and so in the first year he made a car for himself in the second year he sold two cars in the third year he sold only about eight cars and he kept slowly growing and eventually that company became Ferrari so Ferrari is my company and you're gonna like Enzo Ferrari Enzo Ferrari he's a crazy person he's sort of like Conor McGregor that quote that we have from Conor McGregor he goes I'm like Vincent van Gogh I've lost my mind of this game Enzo Ferrari is like that he's got this great quote where he goes a great Mania to which one must sacrifice everything without reticence without hesitation so he's one of these guys who is totally bought into his brand sort of like Dana White where he lives and breathes the [ __ ] he was known as being kind of a [ __ ] dad kind of a [ __ ] husband and all he cared about was Ferrari making it great so let me give you a little bit high level facts about Ferrari in 2023 the revenue grew 17% to about $6.5 billion dollar they're very profitable their net profit last year was 1. 3 billion now here's an interesting stats an interesting stat so Honda last year sold something like 1.2 million cars Ferrari only sold 13,000 cars their market cap now when I started working on this their market cap was a lot lower they released some really big news on Friday and their market cap skyrocketed and they are now worth 72 billion dollar that makes them roughly this eighth or seventh largest car company in the world and they're still growing at around 23% a year unfortunately their PE ratio is crazy high it's like 54 so 54 times earning which is like one of the highest but check out this look at the highest uh or the most valuable car companies in the world number one Tesla Number Two Toyota and then porsche Mercedes and then you go down to Ferrari $68 billion I think um on Friday it was like 75 billion so they're more valuable than BMW more valuable than Volkswagen more valuable than Honda and they only make something like 133 thousand cars a year isn't that insane that's crazy so here's my case as to why this is an interesting company I'm going to try and talk a little bit about the numbers but again that's not our specialty so I'm going to try to stay a little bit away from it but they are a cash cow they are the Cash Cow of the industry in fact Ferrari makes more profit per unit uh for every unit they sell they make more profit than any other car in uh maker in the business some car makers in fact like a GM they actually lose money and they hope to make money through their other models or through selling parts or fixing the cars Ferrari makes a profit on everything everything they make last year or sorry in 2021 they made over 100 Grand per unit sold the second place company that sold the profited the second most was Tesla at $6,700 and then it's saying wow so you know whatever 15x more profit per car than than the second place person but it gets even crazier so in order to make the same amount of profit profit that Ferrari makes per car Ford has to sell 900 cars okay and you think forward that's just a middle line car okay what about Mercedes Mercedes has to sell 67 BMW also has to sell 67 they make the most profit of any other car uh luxury car maker in the business and then make more profit per unit sold than any other car in the in the industry now here's the what get where it gets even crazy crazier you don't choose Ferrari Ferrari chooses you so if so did you do you know about this with Ferrari about their weight list I did not know this all right so here's how it works and there's a lot of Mystery around this like they don't even openly say like exactly how it works but let's say you want to buy a base Ferrari like the cheaper models a lot of times you can just go in and buy it but if you want to buy the more expensive one what they do is they have got a weit list and they L the weight list and and in order to buy the fancier ones oftentimes you have to buy three to four of the base models and so Jay Leno you know how Jay Len's a big car nerd yep he he openly says he goes I I refuse to buy a Ferrari because of how elitist they are you have to they're not well he's like obviously they're not the every guy every man car but you can't even buy one if you want one and you have to once you buy one if you if you're able to acquire one you have to sign paperwork that says that you're not going to put any stupid Parts on it you can't repaint it certain colors so there there's this lawsuit that just ended recently where this famous celebrity painted his Ferrari pink and they sueded him and he had to pay them $350,000 because he posted it on Instagram and they said that that hurt their reputation Justin Bieber did the same thing Justin Bieber bought a car and he did three or four things that were crazy the first thing is he just left the car at the at a hotel parking lot for like a few weeks or something while he traveled another thing that he did was I think he took like the Ferrari badge off of it you know some people debadge their C it'll be cool and so they banned them Justin Bieber can no longer buy a Ferrari if he wants to another thing is bummer for the beibs bummer for the beibs if you and if you and and just this is uh very similar to the Rolex in uh luxury watch industry so do you know that if you buy like a Rolex and they find out that you buy it at retail and you flip it for above retail oftentimes the dealer will never sell you a Rolex again Ferrari does the exact same thing so if you flip a Ferrari and you don't tell them and ask for their permission you get in trouble and so it's a big deal and they ban you and so they have so much demand that they literally ban people from buying a $500,000 item is that insane or what I mean that's like truly Pinnacle of exclusive and Elite like people are dying to have this product nothing makes me want to get in more than a wall preventing me from getting in and they do a great job of creating that wall and their brand is incredibly hard to kill so if you if you Google what are the most expensive cars ever sold at auction a recent one is a I forget it's a GTO 250 I forget which year it is but it was an 8 million car 11 of the top 15 most expensive cars ever sold are Ferrari in fact people love Ferrari so much that there's a theme park obviously in Dubai just for Ferrari B they make something so this company what did I say 7007 billion dollar a year in Revenue something like that six billion six billion 500 million of that comes from merch so a pretty substantial amount just comes from people buying Ferrari hats and this is even crazier so for every Ferrari sold something like 65% is being sold to someone who already buy or who already owns a Ferrari and has bought one from a dealer meaning their LTV is massive they've done a bunch of really crazy crazy things to prevent like or to keep their brand strong so they have this bounty program so they basically have just created a bunch of snitches so if you're in the streets and you see someone has painted their Ferrari a certain color has put a modification on it like a part that that Ferrari doesn't approve of if you report that to Ferrari you get an bance you get a little bit of money they pay you to report that people are breaking the rules they have a new bounty system it's insane now uh I talked about the Lindy effect so here's the exact definition the future life expectancy of some non- perishable things like technology or an idea is proportional to their current age thus the line effect proposes the longer a period of something has survived to exist or uh the longer something has existed the longer it's remaining life expect expectancy so Ferrari has been around it's it's going to be uh I believe they were launch in the 50 or so they're going to be around I think for an extended period of time I think Ferrari is a very hard brand to kill if you put Ferrari on a Rolex someone's going to pay extra to buy that Rolex if you put Ferrari on anything someone's going to want to pay more money to have that that item not and that's not the same case with the Honda it's often I don't I mean there's like a handful of car companies that are able to pull that off or there's a handful of any type of companies I just went to the website and put a $600 baseball cap into my cart but I need to like have a cool down period before I click by just because I think I don't know if you're selling me the stock but you're definitely selling me some Ferrari merch today it was the Hat really $600 there's yeah it's a $600 hat the cheapest hat is like $180 that's insane that's absolutely insane like I went to a kid's I went to a friend's house the other day and their kid had like a Ferrari coat that he was wearing cuz he like love he like you know and he has like Ferrari toys and they they sell so much of this stuff it's insane is it was it really a $600 hat what makes it so good does it does it does the Hat Drive the entire story you just told me made it so good D it's an insane brand and have you have youever been in a Ferrari uh I have been in a Ferrari yes a wonderful I've been in I've been in a Ferrari they're definitely cool my takeaway is that they're a [ __ ] pain in the ass to own everyone stares at you so they've U the that Ferrari red was actually formally the um it was the national racing color of Italy and Ferrari Enzo Ferrari was like oh we'll just use that and then eventually they got so popular they patented uh or they trademarked that red so that red is only for Ferrari but if you're in one of those cars you get stared at like crazy which is one of the reasons why people love driving it I hated driving it for that reason and they're loud and they are kind of rough they're [ __ ] race cars it's a race car and so if you like driving Ferrari you're going to love it I my opinion was this is a pain in the ass to drive but I get it I get the appeal Ferrari is badass but their PE ratio is insane so I don't know how much value is left to be had here but they are but they are growing they are growing consistently so if you look at if you look at their last um if you look at their last uh I think they went public in 2018 it's grown on average roughly 30% a year their stock their stock price so it's like been a pretty consistent growth they Ferrari Enzo Ferrari when he died he sold a lot of the business to Fiat and then Fiat spun it off and they built uh they took it public on on its own and so it's been very consistent since it's gone public you had a great return recently they signed a deal with Lewis Hamilton who's like the LeBron James of like F1 racing and their their their price skyrocketed because also their earnings they're like dude we're killing it so they make something like I believe their eida margin is 35% so no car company has that much that big of a margin I mean that's like ridiculous you got to do the SMART rich guy thing which is you say Ferrari is not a car company it is a luxury brand and it's priced incorrectly they're pricing it like a car company but it's actually a luxury brand right that's what all the stock Pickers do they're like Tesla it's not a car company that was my argument and then I looked at what the PE ratios of some of the other luxury Brands were you like it's actually a it's actually a AI chip company I guess based on this P multiple well my original point I was like this is a luxury company and then I looked at what the what some of the numbers were for some of the other luxury companies I was like well this is bad time if you if we would have done this if we would have done this like two or three weeks ago it it would have it would have made a little bit more sense but they just had they just released earnings on Friday and so they crushed it but there is a bunch of downsides so uh PE ratio is insane it's at an all-time high right now I think it's what did I say 55 times earning that's insane that's a lot another question when you were a kid did you have like car posters on your wall like or like a folder like a binder that had a car car on it I did not I had a life-size poster of the Rock okay well you're didn't do the pro move and prove my point but many young kids When We Were Young did you go to that book fair and you buy like a Ferrari eraser or you buy like a Porsche Lamborghini folder whatever we cared about that when we were kids and so it was very aspirational do you know that young people nowadays are barely even getting driver's licenses yeah it's like a loser move right it's like a loser move to have a driver's license and so often times I wonder are young kids even going to care about this and then finally EU regulations so Ferrari is a base in Europe the EU is cracking down so for a lot of cars they have to be hybrid I think the ruling is by like 2030 I think all cars have to be have some type of hybrid component I don't think it's going to kill Ferrari because they're already making hybrids and a large percentage of their cars something like 25% are already hybrids so I think they're going to be fine but that is a risk now beyond the stock I just want to talk about a couple lessons here for Ferrari is an amazing company to Aspire to build at at least if you wanted to build like a luxury product a great company the first thing they're [ __ ] missionaries they're not mercenaries a lot of times we talk about we use that word arbitrage if Enzo Ferrari heard that word arbitrage he would take off his leather glove and smack you in the face he would ask you about passion that's what he cares about and it's paid off he's built a brand that you know is one of the most valuable Brands known by billions of people in the world that they aspire to attain and it's all about him being a missionary he's truly bought in the the people who work there are bought in they built a brand that's aspirational now in order to do that in order to build one of those Brands you have to do something really hard something you and I struggle with something that I think every entrepreneur struggles with which is you have to say no to so many great opportunities and that's really hard so someone could have said hey Enzo what about like a $50,000 car that like Everyone likes like we would just we'd crush it like the average man would buy this and they all want it we'd kill it he said uhuh how do they say no in Italy he would say no uh I don't know how they say it but I bet I bet it's just no that's what he would say and they didn't and they've refused to do that but that's been very hard for them to do I'd imagine um because there's so much opportunity but that's just a real lesson for a builder however the last lesson is if you can say no for that long and you do build a really good luxury brand it can pay off so much I had no idea getting into this I would have thought that Ferrari was worth like 10 billion I didn't realize it was the seventh largest car company in the world only selling 10 13,000 units that's insane compared to another company like Honda or Toyota that's selling a million plus units so anyway that's my pitch for Ferrari good job give it let me let's give it up let's give it up um that's kind of insane and by the way I feel like your point about Italians not just Enzo not doing Arbitrage have you ever met an Italian running an Arbitrage like is is there an Italian affiliate marketer on Earth I don't I don't think I've ever seen one it just seems so beneath them as it should be they're the they are the luxury brand of ethnicities also they are the yeah dude you want like an old lady in the back like I so I grew up in an all Italian neighborhood by the way I grew up in St Louis for some reason St Louis has a large amount of Italians I was the only non-italian at my grade school we used to learn Italian in grade school they used to teach it to us we have to go to mass three days a week and one of those days was in Italian but you didn't know the Italian word for no I wasn't a good student but I could tell you that I could tell the Our Father Italian and and the best part was like everyone would have their old grandom like in the back of the house like rolling up these ravioli I want to hear you speak some Italian let's go don't put me on the spot bro I I you just said I could tell you the Our Father in Italian okay tell me no I don't even want to say it I'm so bad dude I got a thick I got a thick tongue just like our boy Bernard I got a tongue like a slug it's a thick Tong I can't roll my RS it's disgusting the back my first girlfriend in grade school her name was filamina like I was all in I was all in on the Italians I feel like American Italian people like Italian people who live in America are just they give it the the the wrong rep really it's sort of like it's like TexMex or whatever it's like too Americanized Italian Italians oh man it's just yeah I want like a really I want a skinny Italian with like wearing SK skinny tight jeans smoking a s constantly drinking an espresso with a buzz cut want like these Gaba goul like you know what I mean that's like The Sopranos I don't want Tony Soprano right like the Italian grandmother who still like you know smokes the cigarettes and a lot of great uh car companies are Italian you know Lamborghini is also Italian uh and I believe the story by the way do you know the story of Lamborghini he invented the Lamborghini because Ferrari wouldn't sell him a a car revenge and he was making tractors Lamborghini was a tractor maker and Ferrari wouldn't sell my car so so he made his own and so they've been [ __ ] from day one and that's why it's such a great brand you definitely sold me on how cool Ferrari is as a business um I don't think you sold me on the stock just because it's like at an all-time high and 70 billion it's at an all-time high it it also sounds like they're not trying to grow fast right that's like part of the stick is like sell only a limited number of these at insane margins and so I think that's uh you know maybe maybe one of the downsides but very cool story and also so more like MFM more more of uh inspiring for how to build a business than on great stock don't discount don't discount me listen I actually don't know how stock stocks works you know I'm a dummy how does a stock work I don't know's go back but if it's growing 20% a year and if we think that it could continue doing that but you're saying the stock price is growing 20% a year not the bus no revenue revenue revenue is growing 20% a year if revenue is consistent doesn't like that that other [ __ ] follow it does it does it does but you didn't talk about that so um you know it was on the I can go B on what you told us right the business is growing it's good just you started the pitch with for my stock analysis we're not going to be talking about numbers which was just a master isn't that what you said waren Buffett said Brads or some [ __ ] yeah something like that something like that um I do think that uh you know that's the best way right like if you didn't prepare for your speech uh in school you're just like you know what you rip up I'm not gonna read off those prepared notes I'm just gonna speak from the heart it's like you're ripping a blank piece of paper up and throwing it away dude I did prepar I I prepared a long time for this I just I just really took uh uh buff Daddy's words to heart and I looked at the brand fair enough all right it is kind of an interesting dichy here we did just pitch the two exact opposite things right yeah exactly yeah the the highest of high fashion and luxury and uh sort of the the lowest form of human behavior getting in your underwear and fighting in front of other people for their entertainment we give you the full spectrum here on MFM right we we give you everything so let me let me think about it okay so if I had to put my own money if I had to put $100,000 let's say into either Ferrari or TKO I think I would go Ferrari I think I would go Ferrari but I think TKO has significantly higher upside significantly right right so that's fair so I don't know how you want to gauge the win if I had to put my money in either I would put it in neither is my take away from stock of paloa oh I emphasis on the if I had to which I don't have to which I will not yeah which I'm not in that position and by the way I don't know if it's showed but I definitely wor worked backwards from I looked at the stock and I was like I actually what happened was I saw that they merged and I was like dude these companies have no competitors this is a true Monopoly and in tech people you know from the Peter teal school of thought really value a monopoly and it's so hard to build a monopoly like there are so few businesses that are truly a monopoly we talked about even Duck Duck Go eating into Google's market share last time but you know Google Facebook these are one of the few monopolies that exist and I was like huh it's funny that like this TKO thing is actually a monopoly but I I don't know how good of a business is I don't I don't know that's going to grow but if you're Warren Buffett and you're looking for something with a sustainable competitive advantage that would be it and so that's where I started and and to to be TR truthful I didn't even consider any other stocks I started with that then I texted Sam hey we should do a stock picking episode because I already have one picked all right I'll give you my vote there we have it unanimous unanimous decision you oh I got the vote too oh amazing well guys uh I don't know if I'm supposed to do an accepted speech now or if I should just say um I'm not surprised but uh that's that's where I stand as far as St capoa hope you guys liked it go to the YouTube comments and vote in the comments who won Sam or Sean put it in the comments we will tally them up and name the official winner after we do that and if you got any Joy from this or if there was a time that you were pulling your hair out and being like these [ __ ] idiots don't know anything about this stuff if it whatever spectrum is if you got a little emotion click click subscribe uh and uh we'll owe you one um all right that's a [Music] pod

all right Sam I want to play a game I want to start this with a game where I'm going to read you the and you don't know this by the way you didn't know I was going to do this we have the I'm going to read you the most trafficed websites in the United States and it's a simple test you're a business guy you study the business world I want you to tell me do you know who's the owner or CEO of these businesses okay all right I like this game number one google.com Sergey and Larry pagee Sergey something and Larry pagee correct uh next one YouTube um Chad h and y and Jared and one other guy Steve Chen exactly correct um Reddit Huffman and Ohanian correct uh Amazon Bezos okay number five now we're getting we're getting to the good stuff okay so first this is I think you'll get this one easy Facebook Zuckerberg okay number six PornHub uh Bastion something a German guy incorrect sir [Music] so this is the number sixth most trafficked website in the United States three billion visits um in in like in a month is it called mindgeek or Mind Freak or something mindgeek is a name of a company that owned it um however the founding story is pretty crazy and I don't know if you're a Sci-Fi guy or a fantasy guy but in in many fantasy book series there's this Con there's like this this concept like in The Lord of the Rings there's the ring or um in uh Harry Potter there's the Elder Wand and it's an idea that there's so there's these assets that are so powerful that people want to own it but whenever you own it your ownership's going to be very short-lived uh it's almost like the the the item is too powerful it sort of corrupts you and uh puts a Target on your back and other people start coming for you it's a real sticky situation one might say this is like it's Game of Thrones right everybody wants to sit on the iron throne but when you're on the Iron Throne you're not going to last very long and so this is a Game of Thrones style story for Tech that I went down a rabbit hole I want to share with you because I didn't know this story so let me tell you let me tell you how it went down okay so we rewind the clock we go back to 2005 up until then you know Internet's been out for rough been been semi- mainstream for 10 years and of course porn was popular right away but the way that all porn sites worked was it was like Yahoo it was a directory of links so you would go to um whatever I don't know Juggworld decom and it would just it would just show you a hundred links to places where you could go watch videos not the videos but to the other websites links to other websites or links to other photos mostly photos at the time it wasn't even that much video so 2005 a big milestone happens which is that YouTube launches and YouTube launches with a pretty simple proposition which is we'll make it really easy to host a video online you don't have to host it on your own servers we'll host it on our servers and then also instead of just sending somebody that file you send them a just a link and they can watch it here and we'll just have all the videos here in one place which was mindblowing sounds so obvious now but at the time was different and if you haven't read it go read the Sequoia memo of his investment uh roll off about this investment in YouTube if you want to see how like uncertain and how like small and non-obvious this was at the beginning so YouTube launches it starts to get popular now there's copycats that come out in the porn version of this red tube right just off of YouTube red tube um You Porn whatever a bunch bunch of these come out and they're all flooded with pirated content so they're just like kind of like lime wire back in the day they just take you know stuff that you're supposed to pay for and they would just upload it for free on here and they would have you know banner ads to make money and even though these were um kind of sketchy websites they were 10x better in every way so it was more private right you didn't have to go anywhere you could just have it in your bedroom um it was instantaneous right the the distance between the craving the Fulfillment of the craving were were you know one click away there was infinite variety so you didn't have to pick and choose you could just keep going till you find what you like there's infinite niches and so people discovered that people were into all kinds of weird stuff because now there was a longtail of content and it was free whereas most point at the time was pain uh because at the time there was somebody who was called the King of Porn he the guy who was sitting on the G on the Iron Throne at the time and this was the CEO of Vivid Entertainment what is and what was Vivid Entertainment they're like a Hollywood studio they're making like you know porn or normal movies no they're making porn but they're making it like in the Hollywood way where there's like an actress and there's a set and there's cameraman there's like and people buy DVDs yeah buy buy the DVD and so vivid at the time was the king this guy was known as the King of Porn he was written up at all these articles in fact the year that he was written up all these articles is the same year these new disruptive websites came out and revenue starts to fall and it falls 50% and it falls 80% it just basically goes down the drain how big was it uh it was doing tens of millions in Revenue um but there were many studios like this so they were they were the biggest one but there was like you know just like in Hollywood there's many studios all right so I don't know if you remember Google uh Google bought YouTube because YouTube was getting a had a huge lawsuit from Viacom these are like parallel stories YouTube was also flooded with pirated content because of that they were getting sued like crazy and because they were worried that they would go out of business they sold to Google for like a billion a half dollars at the same time Vivid copies that Playbook they look at what viacom's doing to YouTube they start suing the crap out of all the the website and so the first owner of the throne Vivid goes down then the second owner of the throne which was these like red tube and whatever they they start getting hammered as well because they're getting sued all right so who's the third one to pick up the the the Baton and where does PornHub come into this okay so so at the time there's three college students in Canada and they realized that this is a u that like there's a lot of traffic uh to these websites they meet of out of all things at a competitive foosball tournament and the guy who's the best fball player AKA Chief nerd uh right like sir dork um he happens to be the best programmer of the bunch and he creates a live streaming video website to stream their foosball competitions and there's not much of an audience for the Foosball competitions but he realizes as he's building all this video tech he's like hey I think we could do the same thing for porn was the intention porn or was the intention something else and porn users used it used it most so these guys made the link site so that site I talked about jug world that's their site but they made like a hundred of these um they made like a 100 directory sites just links to other websites then they see the YouTube thing and they pick up this guy Matt I think his name Matthew keer or something keer is the guy who built a video streaming site he's the best programmer so he's like I think I can can make a YouTube for for this stuff and we can instead of having these directories where we send the traffic away we could just keep the traffic and uh at the time they had already kind of like you know started to discover things they're like oh people like you know people like this people like this they were just creating other directories and eventually they looked at Vivid who was the king at the time and they were like we should make our own Vivid and so in the same office they created PornHub the website that was going to host all this stuff and they created a company called BRZ which is a oh yeah producer of content so they created a Content producer and they created the platform the network making their own shows exactly or like you know um FTX had the you know sister company that and by the way nobody knew these companies were linked so everybody thought these were two uh not only unlined companies they thought they were enemies because at the time all of the studios were hated the platforms that were giving away the content for free people didn't know that one of the biggest Studios be you know was actually the owner of one of the biggest websites at the time and so in the same way that there was FTX and Alam living in the same house you know kind of sharing funds brazers and PornHub were doing the same thing people just didn't know in fact the guy came out and was like quoted uh he was like that would be that would make no sense why would we do that that would be 100% against our core interest as brazers to do that we hate the platforms and meanwhile he was also the owner so these guys start this thing and it takes off like a rocket they they're like dude we have no idea what we fell into we were sleeping in the office we worked every single day every every weekend we couldn't hire enough this was now like 2007 or eight I think so they weren't the first mover but they were they ended up becoming the biggest mover and here's why so they basically scaled this thing better than anyone else could and one of the keys was they had brazers they had their own content that was not uh not pirated or like it was pirated but they owned it so they didn't care that they could use on the network so even when other stuff got taken down they still had more content than other people all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one is really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in thep description all right now back to MFM and so they scaled up they they go from basically like just three friends to like 80 people 150 people 250 people and they're hiring friends and family and they're like dude they're like where do we we have an office they're like no no no just they started buying houses next to each other just created a neighborhood and they're all just working out of that like that one area bootstrapped bootstrapped no no investors no nothing so just growing because Word of Mouth traffic and obviously people love what their their product and they're just coming back over and over again again and the key is that this guy keer was an SEO Savant he came out later and he goes we were the number one rank for porn and sex on Google he's like do you know how hard how competitive that is he's like I he's like that's what I did I pulled that off I became the number one search that's how we defeated all of the other things and then we had content that wasn't getting taken down so they grow it to 250 they make one of the guys Brothers the CEO they're like you're the CEO you have some business experience you do this so that guy starts doing a rollup like a private Equity rollup so he starts buying up all the other ones who are afraid of getting sued and so he's buying them up for cheap and he's just consolidating power um and just creating one big Mega Behemoth because then he could fight whoever was going to sue them because now they owned all the traffic so they had something you know they had something to to um to fight with and so he starts building this thing up and by the way there's this whole like industry is so funny because you think of it as a sketchy thing but like one of the sites for example that they bought it was called homegrown it was started as a a VHS tape Exchange for like swinger couples right like the most like Fringe Of The Fringe thing but this kid who's a Stanford NBA student buys it his mom helps him raise the money and they do a they do like a leverage buyout of this thing like it was actually kind of sophisticated under the hood even though on the surface it looked like you know these you know really sketchy gray area things but it's like Stanford NBA are buying this stuff so anyways fast forward to 2009 they've scaled it to 250 employees they're making millions and millions of dollars right they're making more money than they ever knew what to do with but they're getting par oid because they know you're sitting on the on the throne that people are going to come for you and so uh they start seeing some bad stuff right the government seizes $9 million out of one of their bank accounts just just takes it and they're like [ __ ] what do we do they start trying to move money around they hire security 247 they're followed by you know black tinted SUVs the kezer guy the SEO guy he just quits he's like I I can't take this anymore it's too stressful they're like dude you're walking away from so much money he's like I don't care I can't handle this so they finally just decide look it's too stressful we can't do this anymore let's cash out now there's not a lot of buyers for this thing right because institutional investors can't really buy this type of asset and now it's big how big like was worth over100 million do so they sell it to that guy you were referring to this guy Fabian Tillman 100 so 140 million is what they sold it to him for when what was what was his background fabian's background was I think he had also he was already um in this space so what he did was this guy was like a programming genius so at 17 he basically started he created a website that was just for internet traffic so it's like Alexa right like internet traffic sites uh St statistics sorry so he's just a nerd he loves the internet so he creates a site that tracks um successful internet uh companies which which ones are growing the fastest however you know how I started this by reading you like what's the sixth most popular website in in the United States he sees that the most popular websites are all porn websites and so he's like huh what if I create software for them so he goes to them he's like what do you need and they're like well you know one of the hard things is we uh we make money off of Affiliates but our affiliate tracking sucks so he builds an affiliate tracking tool that becomes the number one most used uh piece of code for affiliate tracking on the internet and it's being used by these porn websites and he builds that company up he's super young he's like you know 20 years old or something he sells it he's super rich now he's got hundreds of millions of dollars and so he then goes and he buys PornHub for $140 million and then he just like grows it like crazy so he in I think in I think in like three to six months he doubled the profits of the business because he's this guy's just a better operator he knew how to monetize better and he also knew how to like um to to solve the problems around the content licensing so he spends a million dollars buying content licensing rights so that they don't get uh sued anymore he changes the name he launches like a PR campaign around safe sex and he starts like you know getting in with politicians and all this stuff right and he's doing he tries to to do other stuff too he he buys celebs.com and tries to create a TMZ he tries to create like a bigger media Empire but nothing nothing can keep up with the growth of the core asset and so he's 30 you know he ends up uh 32 years old this you know the company has 500 employees and he's the biggest porn Tycoon on the planet now and this guy has sort of made it however there is one problem and this problem is that like I said this the great power corrupts and people puts a Target on his back people start coming after him and he's hard to find too right if you would look for photos of this guy Google like you actually can't see that many pictures of him right well he did a couple interviews at Tech conferences later when they started to try to like Branch out similar to how only fans has tried to Branch out and hire like musicians be like hey show behind the scenes cont content of your your music process or whatever they're trying to Branch out um he tried to do the same kind of hard when your name is Pornhub though well he created other websites right so he created separate websites altogether that he wanted to use the same team and cash to to to start but crazy stuff is happening right so like he uh he's on one hand he's figuring out how to monetize it way better and he's like oh like and then by the way he's hiring like data scientists and the data scientists are like sir we found it the best way to get a free user to pay for content is a video that is 2 minutes and 59 seconds and that is the point where a man is most committed and is willing like you know to impulsively buy something if we try to put a pay wall before that or after that it's not going to work 2 minutes and 59 seconds is what we just found as the optimal time in order to like increase revenue and they do they increase Revenue a lot oh there's one other thing I didn't mention which is along the way people start to get curious they're like okay he's building this huge Empire he's rolling up all these sites he's buying more and more sites like how much cash does this guy have how did he generate so much cash and what later comes out is that he got a $362 million loan from a unknown secret investors and it turns out that basically there was two guys who he went to all the big Banks and the big Banks were like look we can't do this we can't lend the money so he goes to privates and it turns out he raised from 125 secret lenders they their names have not been revealed except for one group their names have been revealed it was a bunch of X I don't know if it was JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley or whatever some some big Bank two Bankers from there spun out created their own like lending firm specifically to lend just to this one play they're like this is going to be so lucrative that we have to just leave our jobs quit our jobs raise money and just lend it to this guy and they lended it at a 20% interest rate and so even though he was growing and making all this money he had huge like monthly commitments because he raises 360 million at 20% interest yeah so his his his his debt payment or his interest payment is 80 or $100 million a year 60 million a year exactly and and they're and they're also under attack like the CEO he owns a $16 million house it gets burned down by arsonist and Bill Amman comes into the Fright do you want to know how Bill akman comes into this into this story so in the Game of Thrones now Bill aan comes in from Westeros and he's like he's reading an article one day this is the story I don't know how true this is but the story is he's reading an article in the New York Times and it's about a girl a teenage girl who's sent nude photos to her boyfriend the boyfriend then leaked it onto one of these websites and amman's like that's so wrong and she couldn't get it taken down and and she's felt so bullied and whatever he's got daughters he's like this is terrible and so he's like he's and so you know how right now he's on a crusade to take down Harvard take down Business Insider he goes on a crusade to take down pornhup and so he's he tries to find him he's like dude this is like some offshore Company by this German you know single owner I can't pressure him he's not a public stock I can't become an activist what can I do he's like so he thinks about it first he's stumped then he's like wait a minute what if I like you know when the US government sanctions Russia he's like what if I sanction pornhub by cutting off their flow of money so he's like hey they need payment processors and so what Bill Amman does is he goes and he immediately texts the CEO of visa and he sends him the article he's like your company is enabling this these guys are making money off of this you better do something uh about this and the CEO Visa is like dude I don't want any trouble from Bill Amman agrees that it's the wrong you know it's wrong it's not a huge portion of Visa's revenue and he texts him back I'm on it like within five minutes I'm on it one day later Visa cuts off uh pornup so does MasterCard so does you know so they they lose their ability to actually process payments until they later like you know um had to change all their policies they like now verify everybody with their license and [ __ ] like that in order to Billman has this old tweet he goes if you've been victimized by pornhub or any of their Affiliates you may be eligible for a large amount of compensation I encourage you to email this person who consules 70 plus victims who can help you pursue your claim so he like puts all his weight behind this thing this is this is pre- Israel pre Harvard pre- Business Insider yeah the PornHub is is is who he's going after Hell hath no fury like Bill akman scorned right like yeah he is he is he goes after you so the crazy part is the story doesn't end there so you I thought and you thought that PornHub was owned by a company called mindgeek and mindgeek is run by this guy Fabian Tillman however a few years ago uh or sorry three three or four years into owning it he's grown the company like crazy however he gets inou trouble for tax uh tax fraud or tax like evasion or something like that he and he's in Germany I don't know all the details around the tax thing but I know that he gets a trouble on taxes he's forced to sell in a fire sale he sells it for $77 million oh wow so the value has gone down somehow the sixth most trafficed website in America sells for $77 million that's how much morning Brew sold for like come on dude this is this is the only time where I'm allowed to go on PornHub on my work computer so I can look at their stats so according to similar web PornHub gets two billion visits a month average uh visit duration 10 minutes which is a lot and 10 pages per visit so just get a ton of traffic so it's just huge and by the way now let me tell you so this is a two adventure story aren't you curious what happened to those original Founders who sold it for the 140 million what are they doing now I'm I'm curious about them and I'm curious about who who bought PornHub to for 77 million so which one do you want do you want to know about the shadowy businessman who bought it or do you want to know about the original Founders Choose Your Own Adventure let's I want to go both but I want to go with the original for for now so if you go look at their LinkedIn now which I did what's their name so one guy's name I mean the so one is Stefan Manos another one is usam YF and then there's the guy keer um all of them if you go to their linkedin's now there is uh no mention of uh of any of this they they're like yeah we it's all about their philanthropy it's whatever but here's the interesting thing so they guy youf he sells and he's like okay I just want to get away from all this that was too stressful too sketchy it became way bigger than we started started it like we didn't intend to do that it just sort of one thing led to another I need to reset and in his reset year he's like well what do I how do I invest all this money I have and so he starts reading and he reads 150 books about investing and he comes away a Warren Buffett disciple and he's like you know what I'm gonna go into value investing and he creates a a Burkshire haway for internet companies called valf and valf is basically like constellation software uh they're just buying up profitable cash flowing uh internet companies dude and they're killing it they're killing killing it they're now they're now it's a billion dollar company now they have over a hundred million in eida every year uh just from they've acquired like whatever 50 companies or so they have like 500 million in revenues and then they have like 20 to 30% net profit margins and just listen to the guy so they create this thing called the valf group and they're like all right we're going to uh you know first they start buying up like other content websites because that's what they know and then they start studying constellation software which is the same thing that Andrew Wilkinson did and several many other people have done because constellation is like what are the ogs of this and he's like huh I read the stuff that Warren Buffett was doing on the stock market but this private private software companies is even better he goes it's 10 times better because there's only there's like 30,000 of these companies and there's no competition to buy them what year what year is this 2016 wow and so he um he starts copying their playbook and he's like look this Market is opaque it's inefficient um I think you could deploy a high rate of capital and get economics similar to what you know the Mogul of the previous times were so he's like Murdoch you know he rolled up cable and newspapers back in the 50s and 60s he's like that's what I think I'm going to be able to do with these you know profitable software companies example of their companies are nitar a cloud-based car rental software company designed to automate a bunch of the stuff or it's like a construction software business just like things that you don't even know exist but like this one has been around that's called Mal Mac practice since 2004 it started in Lincoln Nebraska it's created best-in-class software for chiropractors exactly so the first company they bought 2016 is something that sells software to small hotels then the next year they buy three the next year they buy eight now they're buying 20 to 25 a year and they're just buying them that are like they're small and the same thing that constellation does so I think constellation bought like thousands of companies during the last few years I think the average siiz constellation software business is $3 million in Revenue isn't it exactly exactly and so uh I don't know if it's revenue or EB but it's small they're not like it's not huge PE deals it's the same thing these guys are looking for companies that are 5 to 10 million in revenue and so they go uh and they they're just studing constellation they're like it's great basically you buy them you need them to run on their own individually so that it doesn't add more bloat to headquarters and they're just buying stuff all over Europe and he's like uh he goes right now my problem is I'm trying to decide between a great opportunity and a good opportunity which is just this guy's great did he part and I think he partnered with some of the other the other Founders right it was two I think two or three of them that know it was two of them Yousef and the Manos one I don't know what the keyzer guy does now they don't even mention PornHub on so if you go to Val soft.com or history like that that word's not even mentioned anywhere yeah there's parts of my history I don't mention either right like we all we get it um these guys are planning to go IP which is pretty pretty crazy so that's where these guys went which is insane now what happened to the site who bought it so the story that came out was that the you know who's the next person on the throne they said that actually the employees bought it out for 77 million like the two Executives uh bought it out but that didn't smell quite right where do these ex where do these employees get $77 million to buy this right like how much were these employees making and it turns out that there was actually somebody who was the money behind it that didn't want their name associated with it and it was this guy I don't even know how you say his name it's like the word Bernard but it's missing some letters it's just burned bergam and he's an Austrian businessman which is just already sounds [ __ ] like sick and he's uh so now he he owns the majority of this he owns the majority of this he worked in kind of like Finance for a long time Goldman Sachs he worked at Hong Kong and London and blah blah blah he bought red tube in 2013 he sold it to mindgeek originally and then now he bought the whole company back and so he is the principal owner of this thing and nobody saw it and most people kind of thought it's a kind of a dead asset because when you look at the reported financials pornham makes almost no profit and they're like geez how are these guys making hundreds of millions of dollars in Revenue but no profit one of the reasons why is this guy basically lends money to the company and takes out two million a month in just debt payments himself plus they shift Revenue around all these subsidiaries so there's all these shell companies so you don't actually they've completely officiated how much money this this entity makes and so that's who currently owns it but even he's going down now he's getting a divorce his wife has came out and is like she wants him to cut ties with the company blah blah blah and I think it's about to exchange hands again because now a private Equity Group bought it and do you want to know the name of the private Equity Group that bought PornHub yes I do ethical Capital Partners you want to know how many companies they own one this is the they formed just to buy this they named it like ethical Capital Partners is I mean that's the uh the Subway eat fresh of uh of private equity and so these guys are uh now the owners of this thing and who knows where it'll go next first of all great story that was a great story I was in thrall the whole time second look up this guy Bernard it's he has a really weird spelling there is only one photo of him that I could find and he's smoking a Sig bad yeah he just smoking a sick he looks like like if you told me that he was part of the mob I'd believe it he looks like either a mob guy or like a soccer like you know the Manchester United coach after a loss it's like one of the two uh yeah he just he's just just ripping a Sig uh in this in this photo and he uh worked at Goldman so he's also a an Acquisitions guy like he's a dealmaker that's what he does this is insane first of all I I would never trade places with any of these people maybe the original owners that is kind of cool but the last two and the new owner I would not trade places with any of them for any amount of money I would not want to go through this if you Google this guy's name it's pictures of his wife and them fighting over this stuff this sounds miserable can you imagine being married to someone who runs this company what I want to know is what is it like to work there how do you stay professional like and be try to be objective about certain stuff like you know when you're talking about um uh at uh Shephard or one of your companies and you're like hey this skew is doing a little bit better maybe we should try it in red and blue you know we have black let's just do it in red and blue as well what are the conversations like at at PornHub or or mindgeek when they're like talking about like oh this category is doing well let's explore that one a little bit further you know what I mean you know what they do right it's uh it's the Chuck-E-Cheese tokens thing so like if you ever just had to take cash out of your wallet and keep putting it into chuckecheese machines you'd be like what am I doing this is terrible but what they do is when you walk it and they exchange money for these fake tokens and then they rename everything and it feels like it's all like you know fake you know it's just it's like abstracted away that's what happens because I felt this even when we were at twitch and twitch is a lot more reputable than this obviously but at the end of the day we were in these meetings that felt like life or death high stakes everything is on the line like the world is going to end and I'm like this is like 21 year olds playing video games in their bedroom like who cares like none of this matters and like we would hire people from Harvard and MIT like the brightest of the bright and they're optimizing like you know the the mid roll ad popup of you know some stupid energy drink in the middle of this stupid video game stream but none of it feels stupid once you're in there because it becomes abstracted away and you're playing with the data the numbers and the revenue and and and you come up with all these terms for community and content and whatever and nobody uh I feel like nobody looks at the fact that we're all just making hot dogs anymore you lose sense of it I my wife worked at Facebook out of college so she went to this Ivy GLE School a smart woman she had all these make job job offers whatever and she starts working at Facebook and I'm like oh Sarah what are you working on and she started explaining to me in a really complex way I'm like oh you're just trying to come up you're just you guys just created like a little sticker emoji that you could put on photos so more people share photos and it was like it was like looking down it was like yeah yeah that's it you know what I mean like you you go to that moment where you think of like Facebook is this amazing thing of which it is but then you like start talking to individual people was like oh you create a thing that when I stick my tongue out like the cartoon's tongue goes out that's cool uh in reality you're doing it just to get people addicted more to posting and sharing stuff yeah you know that's all right it happens when we were at Camp MFM and we're talking to Mr Beast team and he's given us a tour of the facilities and our group is like billionaires and philanthropists and and we're walking through and we're like wow this is this is incredible these people are geniuses tell me how do you get people to click the thumbnail and they're like you know we increased brightness and saturation by 14% and look at how many thumbnail tests we did and we're like ah incredible work and we're so wrapped up in it and it all feels so real and then you come home and you click on his video and it'll be like train versus pit and it's like this train is going to drive into this hole or is it g to jump over we don't know it's like oh wait dude I had a friend named Ty who used to do this [ __ ] in his backyard that's Ty like oh you're locking yourself in a room for seven days like I actually know an idiot named Jake who did that without YouTube like he just did that and we were like [ __ ] Jake still in his room he's like yeah that's what he's doing but like when you're in it you can get in this reality Distortion field where you feel like you're doing God's work out there and that's what happens in all these companies dude it is still cool like like I remember El mus Elon Musk gave this talk and he's like you know you're doing someone was like you're doing all these amazing things uh you're sending people to Mars you're building cars saving the planet whatever and he's like yeah but it's also cool just to make a game that like entertains people like that's cool too so I don't want to dis discount this stuff but it is fun to put perspective on this and be like I think you just can't take yourself too seriously right it's cool to do do do your best it's cool to try to win a game how many people are going to watch the Super bowl next Sunday and it's you know a bunch of guys chasing around a ball and an arbitrary set of rules right like if you if you look like it's cool to be into it it's cool to be great at it but let's also not take ourselves too seriously let's remember like you know what this what this is it's a game or it's something fun or it's something lighthearted I've met three guys who run porn s sits some are popular some aren't popular one of them is very popular dude imagine running not popular porn site all of the downside with none of the upside you love that joke that you just made whoever is your friend who's running the unpopular for imagine how bad you have to be an execution if you can't sell boobies you can't sell anything dude dud like this guy launched one and it like within three or four days it was doing like 80 or 100,000 views a day but he was like yeah we don't make any money because the ads are horrible like there there's no way to make money on this [ __ ] and so they had like so they had traffic and all three of those guys I knew who did it they're all borderline autistic probably on the more autistic part of that line and they were like I remember like thinking and talking to them I'm like yeah but doesn't this make you feel weird this this and this and they're like yeah but the spreadsheet said this number and tomorrow it's going to say this bigger number and so all I'm just trying to I'm just looking at that spreadsheet I that just and try to make that number bigger and it just so happens that it's on this website they are all pretty black and white about that you know what I mean yeah yeah exactly yeah once you get in you start operating and by the way I remember reading once uh so max Levin who is one of the most you know brilliant people in Silicon Valley this guy you know one of the co-founders of PayPal and without Max you know there is no PayPal which you could probably say for a couple people but specifically uh anybody at PayPal will tell you that Max's technical Brilliance in fighting the uh frauders fraud yeah kept PayPal alive when any other money transmitting service just died because the frauders just had too much to gain and they were too sophisticated and as a young company it's really hard to defend against it and Max like went to war with them and actually like fended them off enough where they succeeded it's a brilliant programmer right chess whatever Master brilliant programmer blah blah blah creates PayPal this like Monumental thing his next ACT was a company called slide and slide basically made like virtual pets for Myspace it was like what it's like yeah you know like on your Myspace profile your Facebook profile we're going to make little apps like so you can you know engage with your friends and interact it's like interact how it's like well we just invented this app called [ __ ] slap where you could [ __ ] slap any one person a day on your on Facebook it's like what yeah but only one and so they then it got even Lamer didn't it it like became an adtech company well how do you monetize right like with all these things how do you monetize his ads and so they were creating slideshows and music videos tools but anyways it was stuff to go on your Myspace at Facebook profiles and they go you know Max you built slide it got really popular then the platforms kind of shut it shut down some of the capabilities and I think they ended up selling to Google for some small amount and they were like Max what'd you learn from slide small for him it was still a multi hundred million dollar exit but I think they had raised a lot of money so I don't think anybody really made too much so I I'll never forget this I read this quote and I realized oh [ __ ] this describes my life and so I've read this like 15 years ago still never forgot it they go what did you learn from slide and he said what I he goes I realize you got to be really careful what you what projects you pick because anything can be in optimized to infinity and he it's like what do you mean he goes you know we picked that we were going to do these like widgets on top of profiles and guess what like the smartest people in the world can spend every moment of every day optimizing that to make that more engaging more viral more addictive higher monetization and that's what we did we spent years of Our Lives doing that and I think that was like his big takeaway was like he didn't say but like the implied thing is like kind of like what a waste like be careful because everything can every knob can get optimized to Infinity he he became like the best pogo stick player in the world yeah like and I've felt this many times in my life and I I don't really even know how to deal with it to be honest because when you have the realization you're like [ __ ] should I just stop or I don't know I don't want to stop this is like my job this successful business should I like with my e-com store I feel this like you know you change the color of this and then you run this AB test you do it's like dude what are we doing like is this like is this what we should be doing with our time and our life and our Creative Energy and I do have that like kind of existential crisis you know every few years just think about this quote let me be your therapist for a minute as well as anyone else who in this situation which is your product doesn't have to change the world your product actually as a CEO or owner could be I create jobs for wonderful people and I give them a great place to work and like most people just want to 9 to5 and they want to play softball on the weekends and they want to make sure they've got good health insurance they want to see their kids raised and be healthy you don't need a life-changing thing all the time to have a badass thing and I don't think that it's fair to compare all these products to the Teslas or whatever are like these existential crisis things because like just having a piece of clothing item or an item of clothing that you can give to someone or that uh makes you feel good about yourself or a game just to play time I mean we just have a podcast that like you could say oh we inspire people uh sometimes we we just jerk around and it's just funny like that is also awesome it's not the right thing to say this compared to this other thing is so stupid when it's like no you could have all of those things and like I get inspired listening to music and then there's a lot of music that's just silly dumb stuff and there's some music that actually changes me there's some movies that changed me and then there's Stupid Vine skits like it's all in the same category and that's okay we can have all of that and my product could be creating a workplace that people love coming and I Inspire them or it could be uh I just have created a future for my daughter you know what I mean like so I don't think that you're product necessarily has to be the thing you're selling but the thing you're building I mean okay I feel better thank you that was good uh I feel better now I'm cating jobs out here dude no that is the truth or like you know what I mean or you're providing for your family for office with the number of jobs I've created this is great yeah yeah we have created literally half a dozen jobs this last quarter I might have to become the governor of the Philippines because I've Creed all my jobs in in the Philippines but that's all right um can I can I just show you one thing off this list though cuz I had this list pulled up of the internet sites dude look at this list just tell me the first thing that stands out to you and I bet you it's the same thing that stands out to me I'm looking at the list of the 20 most popular most visited most used websites in the United States well the first thing but this is not what you're referring to duck duck goo is number seven that's what I'm referring to dude that's is that what you're referring to what is it's more popular than Yahoo and Wikipedia and Twitter so here's the background on Duck Dogo so duck Dogo was started probably 20 years ago I think I mean or maybe maybe more but like it's not new started by this guy named Gabe I think Gabe was a mildly successful entrepreneur Successful by any means but like amongst Silicon Valley it was like a base hit I think he wrote this book called traction with Justin Mayers our friend and then he had this whole premise of privacy search where he said privacy is going to be important to people we brought this up on the pod in the very first 50 episodes we like this is so cool because what they used to do is duckduckgo.com likee stats you could see all their web traffic and it was small at first it's basically Google but you but for some it's it's Google but somehow they don't show you targeted ads so I don't actually know how they make money or what the promise is entirely you know it's it's just ads that are targeted I think it's ads that are either not targeted or it's ads that are targeted only on what you search like the term you just search for but nothing to do with you as a person so they're not cooking and collecting info on you and Hyper personalizing it to you it's just here's an ad because you're searching or here's an ad about you you're searching for a car here's a car ad but we it doesn't have to be Sam you know that that we're tracking Ino on and we talked about these guys a while ago because it's kind of weird which is like this is a significantly less good Google or at least that's like what it appeared to be and but we're like their traffic's growing like crazy what the hell is going on and now apparently they're huge I didn't realize they were this big I knew the trajectory was really really good I had no idea that they' be the fifth so it was sted 2008 by the way I am blown away by this I I might have to go read that damn book then which book traction this is real traction okay I'm in I'm in I believe you uh this is crazy yeah it is pretty wild and I've been I've been interested in Duck Duck Go but I never fully got behind it because I was like this is just an inferior uh Google but this is amazing so they say Duck Duck Go is an independent privacy company for anyone who's tired of being tracked online and wants an easy solution and actually recently they raised $100 million in funding or maybe 200 million but it was over 100 million and I heard that none of the money actually went to the company it was simply early employees selling some of their stake meaning the company does not need cash they're very profitable which makes sense because Google is like if you know I don't know how many employees Google has 100,000 they but like if you fired everyone but 50 or 100 or 200 people it probably could work pretty great I mean their main thing is like the most efficient best business model of all time so it makes sense why Duck Duck Go is so uh such a good business but this is amazing that they're what is it number seven number seven most popular website 10 years they went from 0.001% market share to now 63 they're still insane they're still tiny according to their own you know uh measurement of of marketer um which I don't know exactly how they measure that because if you look at the the uh you know Alexa rankings or the sem rankings they're getting 10 times less traffic than Google or a little bit less than 10 uh um but they're saying they're only 0 6% of search so I don't know they had a 100 billion searches in Q3 of 2022 I'm gonna go on the street and I'm gonna ask a hundred people do you use duck. go I need to know what's going on here this is crazy I think we should I'm not gonna go through my other topics I think that this this you did a wonderful job you had me in thall the whole time What's the title of this one going to be like uh Sean talks for 94 minutes straight because that's what it felt like that's every episode this one's gonna be uh this one's gonna be uh the story behind the fifth most popular website in the world um all right that's the [Music] pod

the Barbie movie is not geared towards kids if you've seen it it's not a kids movie really it's geared towards adults this is the reason why Barbie the company actually created an internal movie production company to create this movie to help sell more dolls into this kidult segment and so that was a marketing stunt for that which is kind of crazy when you think about it I didn't realize that about the Barbie movie even McDonald's came out with an adult Happy Meal they made a bigger box with full-size fries and an adult toy and they did this last year and it was like this viral marketing stunt that went crazy because everyone's like oh dude I want to go get one fans are really capitalizing on this

just to give you a sense of this right I'm 24 years old I'm the youngest person in the company I'm the newest hire in the company and six months later I got named CEO Prodigy that's pretty good pretty good right and the way to do that is you [Music] actually welcome to a new segment that we're calling it's like a Q&A but we're not calling it a Q&A we're calling it questionable advice does that mean that someone shouldn't follow the advice or that we're just answering questions and giving advice it it means whatever people needed to me and it's people asking questions us giving ADV advice the advice is a little bit questionable as well right because we're not telling you what necessarily you should do we're saying what we what we've done that works for us it may or may not work for you it may may not be the best way it's just the only way we know and so today the question we want to answer is actually different than usual normally we're always talking about starting companies starting businesses being a CEO being an owner being an investor but today it's about what happens if you're not there yet what happens if you're inside of a big company so how do you stand out inside of a big Co how do you become a superstar employee how do you become an employee that is just god tier and that opens up a whole bunch of doors for you inside of a company how many employees have you had like that every company there's always one or two there's always one or two that are just like so clear and what I did was I basically plucked what are the things that they do like what what are the things I remember that they did that stood out to me as well as a couple things I did after we got Acquired and we went to Twitch what are some things that I tried that actually I felt worked um because you know I had to spend two years inside of a bigger company for the first time in my life and I experimented I tried a whole bunch of things I'm not going to talk about the ones that failed because those were embarrassing or not useful but I will share the ones that that worked dude what's crazy is let me add two things back stories to our our perspective on this one you had someone who worked at um monkey Inferno and all the other companies that monkey infro started well you actually had a few interesting people the first interesting person was Steve Bartlett who's famous for his agency and his uh podcast Diary of a CEO I think the second person who's even more interesting is Faron a guy who started a company that's worth tens of billions of dollars I was shocked that that guy would be would would consider you a coworker that was a that was an amazing get the second point I want to add to this person and you probably you actually had a few other people that were you know Jason Hitchcock you had a few other people that are wildly successful um the second thing to add to this one of the best compliments I've received from you in the last probably 60 days is you texted me and you said how on Earth did you get Steph trong and I forget who else you named how on Earth did you brainwash them into working for you for as long as they did and that so we've had we we've each had a handful of super super stars who I don't ever use the word work for me because often time it doesn't I I hate that it's not that it's we work together on something and I'm only going to be able to have them for a little a short amount of time that's principle number one you work with you don't work for and it's actually a pretty big mentality shift which is working with somebody is a partnership it's an agreement it's a mutually beneficial Thing versus I work for you is a you know um you know there's a dominant person and there's a person who's just basically takes orders and does whatever's you know whatever they have to do you know based on the the task list and you never want to be the work for the work for is you know you a servant essentially whereas working with is a partnership but it's okay to have to be that for for a little while actually for someone who's interesting like if if like Shawn Pur doesn't have a a specific need to get done and some kid is like dude I will I'm competent I will do exactly what you say for a little while it's okay to do that for a little while but I agree in general you don't want to be that person but but yeah yeah working with is is how I consider it to be done correctly I hired a chief assf just now uh this kid basically had a job at I think like JP Morgan and he was like hey uh he just emailed me emailed me emailed me saying he wants to do stuff um he's like I can help you with this I can help you with this is there a reason you're not doing this and uh then I'd be like no not really I should do it he's like how about I come do it for you I was like I don't know about you you whatever he's like here's an example here I'm doing it blah blah blah and finally he did it and I was like cool you're going to quit your job he's like I guess can go quit right now like if you say I'm in I'll go quit and I said okay Bet and then he went and talked to his boss and he quit his job Banking and now he's my chief of staff and even for him on day one I told him this I said we work with each other and not you don't work for me because I actually want somebody who's gonna treat themselves that way because they're gonna get they're actually gonna get way more done they're going to be more productive they're gonna be a higher caliber person if they think that way it's a mindset shift did you actually say bet dude it's 22 I got to speak the language all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing p so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just Chang the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to f m the first subcategory or the first category I think we should have we both have things that involve communication and writing do you want to like name a few that you have under that category yeah okay so I'll do I'll do one simple one so write an internal newsletter people know us as the newsletter guys because you created the hustle read by millions of people I created milk road which became the biggest crypto newsletter the the newsletter thing isn't just for external um so you know you can have 100,000 subscribers a newsletter but I if you're inside of a company what you really want is 20 subscribers but they're the 20 most interesting people in the company and so what I did when I got to Twitch was there was a um a team like Bezos has something called the s team I don't know if you this Amazon's like his like 15 to 20 top lieutenants and twitch being owned by Amazon had its version of this called te team and so I got put on t team and so you know te team is like whatever 15 of the top people in the company and I go to the first meeting and you know it's it's a busy meeting they're not you know they're like oh hey welcome Sean we we just acquired the Sean want to say hi I'm like I say hi for two seconds but really I don't know any of these people and so what I did was I created a newsletter and I created it for all of the T team and then I would slowly anytime i' meet somebody interesting anywhere in the company I'd be like oh by the way I write this thing every week and only goes out to you know a select number of people um it's it's fun you'll like it I'm G to add you I'm gonna add you to the list and so they're like okay cool I'll be added whatever um and what I would do is I copied uh James clear's newsletter format James CLE does something called one 123 um guess what I wrote the 321 newsletter internally which was basically like you know um it was uh or no sorry he does 321 I did one two three so I did one photo from my camera roll so here's a photo I did two thoughts which is just like two like kind of tweet length things that I'm thinking about inside the company and three links which is just random that I've seen what type of photos uh it would be usually something like um you know not work rated so for example culture building thing like I saw John brought in this funny mug not not work related at all it would just be something about my life that's in like an interesting thing for my life and I'm not a big Instagram guy but I kind of get the idea which is a photo can say a lot about you and what you're interested in and all it could kind of brag a little bit like okay my kid learned how to ride a bike this weekend yeah exactly such a good dad you know like here's what I'm doing and so you know like for example I did one photo that was this list that my um my niece had made she's seven and she she wrote her like routine she's like Ellie's day and then it was um Eat Play Sleep eat play play sleep and I was like somehow the seven-year-olds got it figured out what are the rest of us doing and right like that's the life you got to live and so people loved it they were like oh yeah that's so true blah blah blah and so would just one photo two thoughts Three Links I would send that out every Sunday and I wrote I said hey the way I framed it I go you know when I was a startup founder I used to send this to my uh our investors and board of advisers every Sunday I'd write like an update on kind of where my heads at well you know old old habits die hard even though I'm not a startup founder anymore I'm working at twitch um I still have this hour every Sunday I'd like to you guys are now my new my new board of advisers you guys are my new you know mentors at this company so I wanted to include you on this if you're on this list it's because I think you're one of the more interesting people in the company that I hope to to learn from and get to know over time and so that was how I started it and I wrote that thing dude I can't tell you how much juice I got out of this right because it took me about 45 minutes to write this every Sunday but now I'm getting sort of like you know every single person's attention in a very and they they know about me they learn about me they have an opinion about me not everybody loved it I'm sure I'm sure some people were like whatever I don't care about this but it didn't matter it got like forwarded up there was a guy who was like the the VP at Amazon Prime would email me like dude I love these Sunday things man he's like I wish we got to work together because he he wasn't even in the company it got forwarded to him and he was like dude these are awesome you want to like just meet this you sound great you sound awesome and that's the whole goal you want to build a brand internally and one easy hack to do this is the internal newsletter and there's actually uh I think even more implications of this so one of the greatest people I worked with was Steph Smith she's been on the Pod many times she's already doing great things and is going to go on to do even bigger things she uh there's this thing with history I read a lot of history where often times the person who writes the most popular history book or who writes history books they actually control the they control what we think of History even if it's fake she did that of course in a good way where it was very tactical she actually could she was the best Google Sheets maker and a really good Google Slides maker and so she would dictate how the Google sheet for the projects that she ran and then eventually other projects how they looked and that actually dictated what we tracked which d things that we do yeah and but she would make these I don't know did I ever tell you the sheet that we had for Trends did I ever show you that no I I'll just show it to you sometime but she made this beautiful sheet it autofilled and like I was like oh thanks for doing this this is amazing you should do this for all these other things but she basically controlled the information flow and so if anyone had a question if anyone wanted to know anything they had to go to her and she wasn't doing this for bad reasons but be she was basically a very powerful person because of that reason and so you need to get really good at presenting your work and you need to be really really loud about it but you have to be great at presenting your work making presentations writing stuff controlling the Google Sheets and making them look presentable and making them work well that is incredibly important and not not enough people think about that 100% 100% the winners right history right and and uh and also the other thing is you want to be a maker not a taker so most people in companies are just takers of plans so somebody else writes the plan somebody else makes the doc somebody else creates the dashboard and you just sit on the receiving end of it what I would do you know when I was at these companies is I would always write my own versions of the plans and this was partly for practice because I wanted to if I want to be the CEO well then I should get reps doing the things that the CEO is doing he's writing an annual plan cool I'm GNA write one too what would I say and you write it and then you compare to what they wrote and you see things that they did better and you see some things that maybe they missed out on and so being a plan writer being a proposal writer being a uh update writer is going to be the thing that actually sharpens your skill so that you if you want to be a leader what most people think is I'll wait till I'm promoted and then I'll start doing leader things that's not really how it works right you start doing leader things and then you get recognized and promoted and so if you want to one day be the leader you got to be the plan maker not the plan Taker and you you want to write your own version of all the things that all the key key stuff the annual plan the quarterly update the um the launch guide whatever whatever it is for a given project the next thing I would say is and this is actually challenging for a lot of people I have a feeling it wasn't challenging for you because you're a very competent person but it's important to be a to to be loud and when I say loud I don't mean that you have to talk a lot but I just mean you have to make sure everyone knows the cool that you're doing and there's a fine line between being selfish and stealing other people's stuff and taking too much credit and then also being loud but it's important to be loud to let everyone know these are all the amazing things that are happening and you have to present that in a really wonderful way where it shows progress and it shows even if you screwed stuff up here's the swings we took I think I always had this problem I I noticed it particularly amongst the women who worked for me I would always have to encourage them I'd be like dude you got to speak up you got to be louder about this this is really awesome you are not inserting yourself into the conversations nearly enough that you should this is really really talented amazing work so I think being loud is incredibly important to sticking out within a company yeah exactly you want to work in public so you want to you know present the things that you're doing and like you said it's not all bragging so for example you know people would would would report in a format that's sort of like here's the here's what went well here's what didn't do well here's the screw-ups that we had this week and some of the things we learned from that are what we're going to do to fix it so like it doesn't have to just be everything I did was great and I'm the best and I did everything you know it was all me me me me it's not that however you're totally right that you're really only rewarded for for what people know about if you're if what you're doing can't be measured or isn't seen it might as well have not existed inside of a big company and for a lot of people that's very uncomfortable to do they wish the world worked differently where it was just purely purely Merit based and everything was equally visible it's just not true like if a tree falls in the forest and there's no one there right like you know you need to be able to to highlight what you're up to and uh you know carve out 10% of your time to doing that let me tell you one more thing that's uh a bit unrelated but very controversial and it took me hard it took me a long time and I had to go through a lot of tough challenges to learn this titles matter did you I imagine when you started your early companies and maybe you still do this now you like dude I don't care about titles you can call yourself anything you want it it means nothing to me this is a flat organization but titles actually matter for an employee and they matter because of the job that you have there but also the job that you can get elsewhere so give me an example because I would disagree with this I don't think they matter that much what's what's the example you're thinking of where it mattered okay so if you want to be called the head of something um that's actually really important for the employee it's actually scary for the employer because you want to say you you if you give someone the head of marketing you can't hire someone above them or if you do there's going to cause tension however for the employee if they go and work at a new company they're going to now say look I was already head of marketing at this company I need to be CMO or I need to have something of equal seniority additionally within the business if you if it's the head of blank I'm the head of marketing everything that go happens within that I need to have my say or I need to have my finger on the pulse with that um titles I actually think are a really important thing they seem not important to an entrepreneur because you say these things like oh it doesn't matter we're all working together but I actually think they're I they matter for the employee so I would say in my opinion the logos matter so there's a funny thing that happens where it's like you I bet you're guilty of this too let's say you're uh you're building um Hampton now it's like a community or membership based product if you see oh this person ran Community or memberships at whatever YPO YPO Soho house whatever no known known Thing versus unknown brand for some reason we just sort of attribute all of the success of that company to like this person must be a winner because that company's a winner even if they had very little to do with the winning of that company that the secondary Step At The Hustle I had a guy who worked at Facebook and he wanted to join us and I was like oh you're in and we hired him and he was it was horrible but I totally fell victim to that I've done that all I do that all the time this happens to me with live streaming people are like oh you worked at twitch oh we we need somebody we're doing live streaming so it'd be amazing to have you on board because of your experience at twitch they don't know my experience at twitch they don't know what the hell I was doing there I learned way more about live streaming at my startup that they don't know about that was actually building live streaming that was working in that space But if all I had was that unknown startup name I would have gotten zero credit for being like know live streaming expert guy and so I think logos matter a lot and just getting a win a winner logo unfortunately that stamp that stamp is is cool um the thing no different than having Harvard or an Ivy League an ivy oh if you're good enough to pass that bar you're good enough and and one is enough one is enough that's the key I think one problem people get into is they go logo collecting one is enough if you if you got Harvard awesome you don't need to also go get you know another NBA from some other place or if you have Facebook you don't have to make the next one Google you can make the next one a little higher varant variance because the Facebook will carry the other thing I'd say is managers matter so when we got acquired by twitch we were getting interviewed by people and we got interviewed by several people when we were joining and they were like they were supposed to be diling the acquisition but I was also dilc in them because I was like dude I know that managers matter people don't quit jobs they quit managers and also if you're stuck under a manager who doesn't have a lot of respect in the org you're not even going to get to see a lot of the interesting that goes on or even if you do stuff it's going to be buried under however much clout that manager has and so they first tried to put me under somebody and I was like no no no no I'm not working for that guy and they're like what what's what's the problem I was I was like nice guy I'm not working for him and they were like I was like is there anybody else cuz uh you know maybe these two people I liked them they see because they clearly like you know were buds with the CEO and had more more like they were doing all the interesting projects and this guy's over here working on trust and safety or maintenance of something or like you know Plumbing under the under the bridge like I'm not trying to work on all those boring those boring projects or with that guy that guy has no respect in in the org and I think managers matter pick somebody you're going to learn a lot from but also somebody who got who has some surface area that you can get done and switch if you if you if you don't like where you're at try to actively switch um all right I have a different one wait hold on dude when I sold to the when I sold the hustle to HubSpot it was uh the the the plan early on was I'm out of the picture and I'm just going to do the Pod but they were like all right how about like VP of marketing and you report to this guy and I was like yeah can we give me like a lower title and you can make Brad who's my VP make him the VP and I'll report to him and it it was just like way better but I was like yeah let's let's breing it down and not I'm not gonna be a VP all right now there's something I call the five perent rule I learned this from foran so when we got acquired by twitch we're sitting there and we were supposed to work on X right we were we were at that time a taker we got acquired to do this let's do this and uh FR wasn't very motivated and I was like dude come on let's try to do a good job here right like we don't have to totally sandbag this I get it it's not like the same as when it was our company and this might become the next big thing but like you seem totally checked out and he was like no no no I'm I'm not checked out with the company he's like but look at this they pulled up the overall company dashboard he goes best case scenario this thing that we're building best case scenario which of these metrics changes and I'm looking at the key the number one dashboard for the company the the key kpis overall ones I was like well none of these go to page three there's subdivision subdivision and then this one and he's like cool so let's say all right let's say we change that one how much do you think that changes the overall picture like he's like don't you think that we should at least like if we do a great job what we should do should make at least a 5% impact in the company and I was like my ego gets involved I'm like yeah of course 5% that's SS low actually he's like yeah he's like I just think we're capable of doing something that's going to at least move the needle 5% he's like he's like I feel like if I did something and it didn't even whatever we did if we did a good job if we if we succeeded but it couldn't even move the needle 5% he's like I kind of feel like that was like a waste of time and that's what I learned this 5 per Rule and we we immediately switched to something that would do that and it was such a good decision I wouldn't have done this but in the same way that nval says you want to place a absurd hourly rate on your time so that you value your time and you put a price tag on your time this actually is also inside of a company you need to put a price tag on your projects that you simply will not work on projects that can't move the needle for the ACT for the company because if not why am I here what is the point and if you carry yourself with somebody who can actually move the deal for the company it's sort of self-fulfilling you will become that person who actually can do that simply like you just raised your standard and now that's what you do dude you you you were lucky to have fon course Fon I don't know if he was he the co-founder or was he one of the first hires at App 11 so app 11's a a adtech company $5 billion market cap at 130 billion market cap amazing guy so he joined the company before he was even App 11 he was not one of the co-founders he was just like a random engineer that they hired they had like eight people he was like person nine within a couple months they were like all right this guy's the guy right he stood out like a superstar does this guy's the guy let and they went to him they're like hey I think we kind of built this team wrong now that we see you and we look at the other eight people we hired before you that are above you like we realize we did this backwards can you like fire all these people and rehire a new team of people like you he's like okay so he did that he ends up getting like a you know co-founder Equity stake in the thing you know becomes It Go ends up going public it's like a 20 billion dollar company you know years later same thing happens I hire him at at Monkey Inferno as Android engineer only right so there's like you know above him there's director of engineering above him is the CTO above him is me within a couple months I was like oh this guy is a superstar like I you know Android engineer is simply the wrong title and I told him I said look uh you're GNA end up in a different role just give me a month to figure this out and within a month we had switched it up where he ended up becoming CTO and we basically rebuilt the whole team around him he sort of has like a master sensei like a like a that type of wisdom to him where for some reason whenever he says something I believe him and I and I think he is actually right a lot more importantly all the engineers you'll ever hire will believe them right this guy's a leader of Engineers which is like extremely valuable um let me give you another another principle all right here's a simple one fix your Zoom setup just don't look like dog on every call in fact you should look incredible on every call it doesn't cost that much to do it like you could do it with an iPhone app there's an iPhone app called camo you can download that's what I'm recording on right now by the way and you could be DSLR quality from your from your iPhone if that's all you have if you want to get one better just get a light right like a light off Amazon that's 50 bucks and that app will set you in the top 1% of people at work of in terms of how you look when you show up do that and have also buy a podcasting mic uh your mic can be you know a Yeti a Blue Yeti microphone if you need even better would be these like sure microphones you just just look good and sound good because like no matter how good your ideas are if it's wrapped up in a crap sand sandwich it's going to just come across poorly and um it's the you know is the digital equivalent of dressing good and uh I think people really underestimate this I think you make this like a rule at your company right I I try to make it a rule and I'll give it I'll get really tactical I'm using a sh M I'm traveling right now this is my travel kit a sure mv7 USB mic that's $200 an iPhone with a $50 camo subscription and $150 Elgato key light that's that's my setup when I travel so if you think looks good enough that's what it is yeah it's going to be better than most people's like up the nose shot with the crappy audio and like you know sitting in a closet somewhere so so try try on that well furcon actually is a great example of this and a few other people really did a good job at this I think that when you get into a group whether it's work or any other type of group oftentimes the most confident person is not usually the smartest person but the most confident person wins and I think confidence is displayed in a way of saying things like this is uh this is the path we're going to go down this is what we're going to do I have a 60% chance certainty that this is actually going to work my logic is this this and this but this is this is the answer at least this is the answer for us to try and I think that at a company when you work with a small company like any company I've run you work with the CEO or the owner um at a larger company you know it'll it'll it'll go up to the owner somehow or the CEO but it still matters with managers and BPS and like that but the confident person that says this is the way and they dictate the way and they explain their reasoning and they're confident about it and you start believing in them you still have to be right more than you're wrong but the most confident people I think typically succeed the most I agree I'll give you two things one the thing you just described is like U I think it's called the McKenzie pyramid principle are you aware of this no so basically most people get communication wrong inside of a company because they bury the lead so what they'll normally do is they'll say beginning middle end like a story and in the end is the conclusion the end is the takeaway what we should do it's what's what what we decided whatever but busy people inside companies which are most of the leaders inside companies they don't like that format they want the opposite they what they want is to say my recommendation is we should do this for these three reasons number one number two and number three and I believe those three reasons because we have evidence underneath this this we do not have evidence for but we will but it's a reversible decision and this third thing blah blah blah right you stack the the main conclusion first and then you you like a pyramid underneath you support it with your supporting arguments and that's just a simple communication thing to flip another communication thing to flip that I learned was um there's if you want to become a more clear Communicator use the what why so what framework EMT from twitch taught me this so basically it's what happened or what's going to happen so you know if it's past looking what happened it's if it's forward looking what we're going to do why it happened why we why we're going to do it and the last one is so what so you know let's just give an example um what happened is the the metrics let's say uh you know revenue is down 10% this month why because last month we did this extra promotion so we kind of knew it would artificially inflate last month's Revenue this month is actually normal if look at the overall trend line um nothing to worry about here so what um so we're going to continue doing this and actually we're going to consider doing those extra promotions every other month because they seem to Prov provide a boost or whatever all right like you just you get the idea what why so what just is a generically useful template or outline like you can write that on your paper before you figure out what are you going to say in this email or how you going to write this document just write what why so what and you should be able to bullet point under that and then that's 80 to 90% of the material is already done at that point and I find what helps is if you put a confidence level in there because a lot of times people think well if you're confident you're saying that there's a 99 or 100% chance that whatever is gonna you're say is going to happen is going to happen you shouldn't do that you should say I'm actually you should be really conservative and say like you know 65% 70% like I'm I'm fairly certain or sometimes you're like I'm actually I actually think there's a 30% chance that this works but if it does work the outside returns are quite huge and if it doesn't work it's reversible in these ways and so I think you need like a little bit of a uh uh I don't know how you would say it like a an easy Landing if you fail Superstars do three things number one they think in probabilities not certainties that's what you just described the second thing is that they manage expectations which is the second thing you just said which is you don't need to overpromise and underd deliver in fact you know under promise and overd deliver is a better mindset and uh I remember one time going into a meeting and uh this is something I learned from my dad we were going to a big partnership pitch meeting and we thought we thought they have this thing and with our technology they're going to get this huge yield this huge result and the result is like a hundred times better than their current thing so I was like oh slam dunk put that on the slide baby 100 times better and we go into the meeting and I my dad puts up the slide and I notice that he's changed it and it only says three times better and I'm like dude you messed up like what happened why' you do that and he's like he's like did you see their faces about three times better they were over the moon that other stuff is now my dry powder like I can beat if I could beat the three times even better if I said a 100 times and we came in at 80 times better it would be seen as we did not deliver on what we promised he's like and so you know what whatever forever you know forget the exact you know numbers here the the principle holds true which is only sell to the amount you need to sell that like gets them to agree to Greenlight the thing or take action but don't over promp beyond that even if you think it's capable because you'd always rather beat your numbers uh beating your numbers is is like you know how you exceed expectations and it makes you trust them more and so here's an example so and I'm looking at the deck now so Google uh whoever's listening you guys can Google Uber uh C deck so in 2008 Uber was just getting started they're raising only $200,000 and on slide 20 they have a deck or a slide that says potential outcomes and they say best case scenario becomes a market leader with over a billion dollars in annual revenue realistic scenario gets 5% of the top cities and we make around 20 or $30 million a year in profit worst case we stay a 10ar 100 Client Services business and just saves some time for San Francisco base Executives versus when you see a slide deck from a pitch and it like everything is like up to the right you're like right dude I don't trust you now because you are saying something outlandish like this and you're saying it with a huge High degree of certainty right so uh yeah anyway the confidence thing on the confidence thing is people think confidence comes from answers no confidence comes through asking intelligent questions um any leader knows that you could tell a person's quality of thinking by the quality of their questions and it always stands out if somebody asks you a question that's on point or breaks the frame of how you're thinking about things um that person always stands out in a meeting even though they didn't deliver some like you know very boastful confident conclusion and so you know an example of this would be you're in a meeting and it's kind of a messy it looks like you know options A and B both suck um instead of just saying no we need to do a or no we need to do B somebody who asks a different question that's like you know um what would an easy solution look like here right hey what's the simple thing we're missing right I'm just going to ask this out loud let's see if there's see if there's an answer because if there is that might be quite valuable to us right now or um you know we've been saying this thing uh just want to say this out loud is that true do we have the data to support that like somebody who's questioning assumptions or breaking frames with their questions or that says you know we're trying to solve this problem feels like we're solving it from scratch we're not the only ones who have this problem how do other people solve this or how have we solved this in the past what's worked for us and anybody who's asking questions like that that are going to cut to the answer faster you stand out that's a that's a different way of showing confidence versus just saying me me me I I have the answer dude I I the one question that I love that all my employees hate is they'll give this like 12 month plan or something I'm like yeah how do we do this in like four weeks right that question question some of the best people they they frame that question nicely they say this this guy floran I used to work with he would always say this he'd be like I'm gonna say something you could beat me up if you think this is a terrible idea uh you know you feel free to beat me up but I just want to say it and then he'll say the thing and it's such a disarming way of bringing up an idea that might be countered to way the the flow is going or whatever because you're always like oh FL we're not you we're not don't worry we're not going to beat you up about this idea but he would say that right or um you know this other guy Dan he would he would do this thing he's now the CEO of twitch he would do this thing in meetings where he'd say you know he'd slow everybody down he'd be like you know it's one thing we could say is a b and c he'd like lay out an argument real quick he's like it's one thing to say this it's another thing if we were gonna say you know DF and he would just like frame it so slowly for everybody cuz usually it's the person who can kind of like synthesize the arguments like what I'm hearing you're saying is a and c I just want to make sure that it's is it ab and c and not actually de andf and the person who would bring that Clarity to the meeting was always like the essential person right they're the person who everybody thinks that they're on the way out because they actually help you you know figure out the solution where it felt like everybody was just talking in circles what uh you want to do one or two or three more uh yeah okay here's an easy one let's say you're inside of a company today but you want to go start a company someday you need to start creating your own version of the Midas list which is who are the five most interesting people inside this company the people that you would want to recruit later on what I did was I I just I said at the beginning I said while I'm here at this job here's what I want out of this by the time I leave these doors I want to have the following I said and I wrote down a list one of them was like I want to learn one or two things about leading a company that I don't know today because these people have managed bigger teams and it better than I I'm sure that that I do it so I want to at least have one or two key things that I can take away as a manager number two I want to have the respect of the CEO I want him to be able to say dude if you leave here and you tell me you're gonna go start a company I want him to uh want to write the first check I think that would just be a a signal that I did well when I was here would EMT do that for you uh yeah he actually slacked me one time he was like Hey I out of the blue he's he basically slacked me that exact same thing he was like uh I wish we going I wish we'd be able to keep you forever I don't think that's going to happen uh you know if you ever do decide to do something I'd love to you know you know I'd love to back you in that and I was like oh man what a compliment thank you that's actually I showed him actually I was like that was on my list of things I said I wanted out of this experience so that's a cool full circle moment um the third one is you want I I said I want to walk out of here with five people five more people in my talent rod decks that I could reach out to if I ever needed to hire and um and that's what I did I was like oh this girl in data science massively underrated like she's the real one who delivers the work she's kind of Junior here but man she would be somebody I would poach right away or this guy over here on the sales team God that guy was smooth um if I ever have a thing for sales I know who to who to contact and actually right now with one of our new companies um I'm trying to fill a role and those are the people I went to first to be like hey I have no idea if you're available but I made this list before of who are the five people I would love to work with someday and you were on it and hey that day is here uh you know what what are you up to now and let's let's chat and so that's I think another good thing if you ever want to start a company like just pay attention to who are the hitters here because your talent roled is what kind of becomes a limiting factor as you try to build new companies right like I'm sure you have people that you know you'd love to speed dial and bring on board to a new thing and I think you did this with Hampton right like I notic there's some people there that were at the hustle because that's the experience you had yeah I think that you actually asked was it you who said something like a really good question ask yourself is if you're starting your like let's say your thing's only going okay if you were if you were starting it again would you would you'd have to ask yourself would I hire the same people and do it the same way and for many cases you say no I would change this this and this and then your advice to them was like well just do that right now do that yeah yeah but the but the other answer is okay well when you do it again now you have your list I think uh you know in the mafia they use the phrase and then succession kind of stole the phrase where they say like oh he's a serious person and a serious person means you call them hitters but in the mafia and the mob like I read all these books on it and they say uh oh he's serious he's serious yeah that guy's serious and so or they'll say he's not a serious person you don't want to mess with that person so you want to find serious people I have two other little ones uh real fast ones one is find a paper cut problem so I've noticed that a lot of people who do well in companies they do this in the first two weeks when they join they find something that's just been an annoyance that nobody's ever fixed or nobody's got to um because it's not that important it's never the most important thing and they just go clean that up voluntarily I call this the paper problem like what's the thing that's just been given to us paper cuts it's kind of annoying but you're not bleeding out you're not dying you don't have to go to the hospital and if somebody fixed it you'd be like dude thank you for doing that like you know it would actually stand out a lot um I know several people that did this they they go to a company and they immediately identify like oh here's some annoyance that two people have referenced I bet this annoys everybody and actually I think if I just spent one Saturday working on this I could fix it and they did that and it just like boost their stock so much when I was in seventh grade I had a job at a bakery and I would like clean the floors and wash dishes and there was a corner or there was a shelf where we'd have to like put these dyed dishes and the Shelf was broken and we hired another janitor to work with me and I remember like I had worked there for like eight months and this shelf was always broken it was a pain in the ass and like within the first week this guy fixed that shelf and I immediately thought that's the way to do things you right exactly did it right and by the way you get rewarded for doing the things you didn't have to do right like if you just do your job that's called your job you do not get like extra recognition or reward or or any kind of bonus points for doing your job so you by definition you have to find something that is beyond your job or doing your job beyond what was asked uh if you really want to get this to stand out it's a very simple obvious principle but take that and make it actionable by like go look for it right as soon as you start looking for it you'll see it right it's it's it's a thing that the guy who's been there for eight months has been ignoring he's become he's just accepted it it's become a blind spot for them but for a new person if you're noticing you'll see it right away and you just go fix that thing and you get so much yeah this guy's head janitor now I mean it worked out out but honestly if you're gonna be a janitor be the head janitor like be the best janor be the best goddamn janitor anybody's ever seen I got one practical one and then one fun one practical one is the other problem you want to find is the A+ problem at any given time in any company there is the A Plus problem it is the thing that the PE that's keeping you know the the exec team up at night they're worried about it what I did was I just found the A+ problem and I would only work on that I would just work on that you know I would do my my main job kind of like you know 70% is good or 50% is good or sometimes 0% is good I would just put it on pause because honestly it didn't even matter relative to the A+ problem and uh you know I took a little more risk than most people because I didn't care if I ever got fired like it was you know thank you please fire me invest my shares that would be a dream but by the way we had a friend who uh is at a company and he goes there was layoffs this week at our company and sadly I was not impacted exactly um so finally a probably work on it I remember um I think I've told this story before um I was at a company and basically a competitor was like attacking them and like what was you know stealing their top customer basically and I figured well that's probably the A+ problem probably thinking everybody's thinking about and so I just did some analysis did wrote up a two-page doc and I sent it to the CEO I was like hey you know I have no idea who's working on this but you know I was curious so I dug in and here's what I found and immediately got like text inted into a group chat like hey Sean's in on this now and I think that that's that's really what you want right is you want to be working on the interesting things because that's what the highest caliber people are doing it's where the highest impact is you might as well you have only have so many hours in the day might as well work on the higher impact stuff with the most interesting High Caliber people that's how you get better um what's your last fun one the last fun one is you got to create a brand for yourself so like you have a little story right there's all these moments inside companies where it's like you do introductions or uh you're at some team offsite and uh you know you have two choices you're either going to blend in or you're going to stand out the best way to stand out is to be yourself but the the way to be yourself is to just remove the filter and so what was your brand so I think there's been a couple yeah like when I was at Monkey Inferno just to give you a sense of this right I'm 24 years old I'm the youngest person in the company I'm the newest hire in the company and six months later I got named CEO Prodigy that's pretty good pretty good right and the way to do that is you actually you know you make an impact but you also got to build some sort of brand for yourself and so mine was I was going to be sort of like um the action like basically just like take Massive Action on everything so whatever the thing was I would be like all right cool I'm going to take action on it a immediately B I'm going to do the that nobody else wants to do like I'm going to go further oh we got to do this or we don't know if people will like this who cool give me the Prototype I'm going to go talk to some people I would go to the mall and I would talk to people and I get feedback and i' come back with like written feedback it was just a that nobody else really wanted to do and it just built this thing like I'm going to consistently take action I'm G have a higher bias for action than anybody else and I would talk about that I'd be like yeah like I don't really know uh you know I remember this one guy did this intro and he said this thing this guy stood up and he goes I don't know anything about art or politics I don't know he goes I don't know anything about art I don't know anything about politics hell I don't even know where the remote is in my house the remote for the TV is in my house but the one thing I know is how to structure deals and today I'm going to tell you about how to structure deals and I was like wow what an intro what a what a fantastic intro it like always stood out to me and I thought you know what as much as your brand is going to be that you're good at X Y and Z you could say how bad you are or how little you know about you know these other three things and just be honest about it and almost poke fun at yourself so I would tell people like look I have the least experience of anybody in this room that's obvious I have never worked on any of this stuff before I don't know how to code I don't know how to design but I'm gonna make myself useful the way the way I'm going to do that is it seems like what you guys need is help actually getting your product into people's hands and getting feedback quickly and actually iterating from there so I'm GNA go crazy on that all right what you guys are going to get in the next six weeks is me going crazy on that sound good and they're like they're like great it's like Warren Buffett says look for partners who have an high IQ who are ethical and have a lot of energy and I I I did the same thing where I was like well I actually don't know if I'm high IQ two out of three a bad yeah yeah I don't know I definitely am ethical and I and I have a ton of energy so my wheels are spinning fast if you guys just want to put me in the right direction I'll go ahead and the car will run and it'll run quickly and I'll get you what you need I had the exact same brand as you and when we got acquired I just was like Hey I'm a startup guy inside this big company I'm the I'm I'm a startup guy I've only ever worked in startups I don't know anything about a big company honestly I'm going to probably make some mistakes that are things that are obvious that you should do in a big company but the thing I hope hope to bring to the table is I'm just going to keep working the way I know how as an entrepreneur I'm just going to just do that here and uh you guys tell me what parts of that are working for you guys or what are not right that's part of the brand but the other part is like stand out a little bit I remember sitting in an offsite is like oh um how about everybody just share you know how things are going and it was like person one said this like boring thing about like you know they just immediately went into like work mod right like you know they were like you know here's what I'm doing here's the problem I'm having here's what I'm doing here's the problem I'm having here I have this employee who's doing this and every was just kind of bitching and moaning and telling a very Bland story and I just decided when it's going to come my term I don't know what's gonna come out of my mouth but it's not gonna be that and so I just told a story that was more funny it was poking fun of myself about something that I had done recently and a mistake that I had made so instead of blaming my team or my whatever I just told her I was like you know here's where my head's at because all you they weren't saying like give us a team update they were just saying like you know let's all be present just share what's on our mind how you're feeling right now and so I did that and that stood out at the break everybody was like dude I love that story um and you know the the lesson there is really like take a bit of a risk and don't take yourself too seriously inside companies because I think there's a tendency to try to button up and blend in and uh I would say that's not what the best people do I don't think that's what I don't think that's how the best people act we have this guy at Hampton named Doug and Doug is a very stereotypical engineer so he's very black and white and because of that he's done a very good job of just being honest constantly and so if someone's trying to me I'll just be like uh what's Doug think Doug what do you think and he'll just be like that's stupid or he won't say that way he'll be like I don't think that's the right way I think this is the right way and for these reasons or he'll be like uh I don't like I don't exactly understand like branding but I think that a lot of people like this this this and this and they like it for these reasons therefore that way is or is not the right way and it's just what it's Doug I just always want to know what's Doug think about this he's very analytical and he's very honest and he doesn't because he's you know like a normal engineer he doesn't exactly understand what's hurting my feelings or what isn't hurting my feelings and I love that about him I love that i' always want Doug in my life people who just don't me and they'll say something like that's stupid that's not stupid and I appreciate that that's his brand so th those are our tips how to become I don't know a superstar inside of a company how to stand out how to make a name for inside of a company and if you're uh if you're if you're listening on on iTunes or uh Spotify go to the YouTube and a subscribe because we're about to cross 400,000 and B comment other questions that you have for the new segment questionable advice if we get any good questions we'll do it I like how you said the YouTube that's how my dad says it too that's cool go to the YouTube yeah when I look at when I hold my phone to take a picture I use two hands as well yesterday I go I'm like posting ay trying to post a Tik Tok a day and I love doing it I saw what you said yeah that was great every time I post a Tik Tok I feel like I ate I like reverse my age by one month I'm just getting younger just by TiK ToK by Tik Tok if you want to be young you do as the young people do you gota like and you're G you're squinting your eyes you're gonna hold your phone with two hands and you're gonna like look down on it that's how it feels right now turn the damn thing off all right that's the pod [Music]

I I was in the sauna this morning thinking about you guys how we like it and I was just I was just thinking how grateful I am just there's so many cool people that have uh I don't know just crossing our paths across our whole life just made me kind of a little emotional but also just happy we're supposed to get touchy feely at the end not not not at the beginning YouTube stats show that touchy feely at the end works but at the beginning people just [Laughter] [Music] bounce all right Noah we're live we've got Noah Kagan one of my dearest friends one of the ogs of internet marketing of Entrepreneurship on on on the uh on the internet one of my uh Inspirations you run this company called uh app suuma it does like 80 million in Revenue now you're a YouTuber you have what one point something million subscribers and you're here to promote a book which you've clearly placed a right in front of you I didn't even see that there give us some of the the sort of wisdom bombs or Insight bombs from the book so give me give us some of the the the key ideas or highlights that you think uh you know you want people to take away when they read the book all right Sean I have a quote of you in the book I don't know if you actually said this though great ask me while but so we we kind of read this book like a tech startup where we did like surveys and beta testing and all this stuff and so one of Sean's quotes Sean I hope you said this yeah I'm saying yes either way don't worry I got you back show me an experimenter and over the long run I'll show you a future winner that's true I did say that yes thank God I was gonna have to have to reprint the entire tens of thousands of books uh from the you know what I will say from the surveys that we've done and what people said the results that they got uh number one thing is this now not how idea and it just means just [ __ ] start right away but people get so especially with you guys see so many people listen to your show and they're like I don't know I want to listen to more shows I need to go listen to these like fake YouTube gurus gurus that are out there that don't even run real businesses uh but realizing they can actually do things like right now like how do I get a buck right now just go get a dollar venmo NOA at Noah Kagan go get it from a friend go get it from your uncle and I think people are waiting to be ready and they're just never ready and people like yourselves me who ultimately have gotten into somewhere of wealth we're just doing [ __ ] you used to have this course called the monthly 1K I tell people there's two courses that I paid for that changed my life and it was uh Noel's copyrighting course and then it was your monthly 1K course I remember I bought this when I was 20 23 years old I think it was $300 and it was like a really big deal for me to buy that and I started a a business based off of it that was like making thousands of dollars a month and then I shut it down and one of the first lessons in the book was to go to a coffee shop and ask for a discount and I was petrified to do that I remember I was so afraid to do that but I did do it and then you talked about uh emailing people or calling people and getting customers before you even build a thing which at the time now everyone talks about that but at the time I was like that was it kind of blew my mind and during that period of my life it was all about action and so I don't know if I could show my feet here because I don't know if I can move well I won't even try it but I got I I I went and bought I uh basically a sewing needle do you guys know what stick and poke is do you know what a stick and poke is Sean sounds like a jail cell tattoo it is listen you get a sewing needle and you get the thread and you wrap it around the edge of a pencil so just the needle is sticking out and then you go and buy India Inc for five bucks and you dip it in the the the the needle and you just put all these little dots and I've got the word act on my left foot and the word now on my right foot and this was when I was so partying and drinking a lot so I was a little I was inebriated when I did this but and I was like every day this I was like this course is so good every day when I wake up in bed and my and I could see my feet and I put my feet down you know at the end of the bed at the edge of the bed when I get up in the morning I'm going to see AC now and that's my whole like life you know for business at least my mantra for business and I remember it like taking your course and I was like it's all about action [ __ ] planning business plans are stupid business cards are stupid llc's are stupid it's all about action social media yeah dud that's the ROI Sam that's the ROI right there he made you get tatted up that's the ROI dude I thought he was gonna say his tattoo is act Noah I thought it was gonna say Noah not now dude those are some feet yeah dude some people some people would would look at it and they're like what's act and I was like yeah I got sat on the other foot I just love testing be mad on his ass yeah no so number one for the book now not how just what can you do to date I don't think people realize how much more [ __ ] they can do in a date the second thing is what you just said which is the power of asking like the upside of asking is like I got it on private jet the upside of asking and we teach it through the coffee Challenge and other examples coffee challenge is what you did which is you asked for discount so I did it I did the coffee challenge last week I did a a YouTube video where I tried to do the coffee challenge I got rejected a t T and you know what you get rejected you're like oh [ __ ] guess what that's okay let's go forward dude this is such an immigrant mentality and this is why I love or children of immigrants uh no you're you've got immigrants uh your your father and then Sean has an immigrant family most my best friends do they all have this energy where they ask for [ __ ] that I was so embarrassed to do and then I hang out with sea for a little while and I see how he negotiates I hang out with Neville for a little while it's just like this this Shameless ability to go and ask for stuff and it totally changed my perspective on I I used to be so embarrassed like I would go out to eat and if you if I ordered a pizza and you brought me like chicken parmesan I'd be like n [ __ ] it whatever just give it to me I'm not going to say [ __ ] to this person I'm not I'm not going to complain at all and then I started hanging out with these guys and uh it totally changed my perspective on just being like ruthless about asking for things and it and it 100% worked I mean that's all business is right business is like hey will you be my sponsor for your guys show necessarily or will you be my customer will you be my partner or will you be my employee it's an Ask uh so at Camp MFM um so this is a slide I don't if you can see it so this this is Joe gabia the founder of Airbnb and he he gave us a a impromptu presentation off his phone so he had he basically had like some old presentation he had given that he kind of like found slides on his phone he started he basically started screen sharing from his phone onto the TV and he goes um he he was like oh this was our sales formula so this is the Airbnb Founders sales formula and it's s SW S Plus WC equals m Mo so I don't know if you can if you've ever heard that he's like anybody heard this before like no he goes no so here's what it stands for some will some won't who cares move on and he's like this is the sales formula once you realize that some will say yes some won't who cares move on he's like now you have the entrepreneurial sales formula the ultimate formula that will serve you but did he tattoo that on his ass no do you know that airb Airbnb is like it's It's featured in the book it's also a great example of how to get started super [ __ ] quickly you guys know how they started on uh Craigslist right they they they they had like a designers conference was in town so they had a designers conference and they sent an email to the designers conference saying hey does anyone want to stay on our couch that was how they tested the business that's now worth $100 billion and I think that when you start realizing like there's other ways of doing this you don't have to do like some Silicon Valley funded way you start realizing like hold on Facebook started that way in a weekend Airbnb did a lot of other companies can too all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like 250 million dollars a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually sign up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right all right now back to MFM so Sean and I lived in San Francisco for a long time he's still there we've had I probably have had 10 Silicon Valley friends and I imagine Sean has had more and they message us and they're like hey uh you know I used to in invest in VC stuff you know I invest in startups and they'll see what Sean's doing a little bit about investing in cash flowing businesses and they're like can you teach me how to do that that is so much better or like they they want to just make profits now as opposed to you know waiting 12 years to sell business and it there there is definitely the shift it seems like that's happening have you had that Sean where a bunch of your friends are hollering at you about that uh no they're not like asking me how to do it's pretty straightforward how to do it I don't think that's the question I think uh but you are right that a bunch of basically it's the losers of the Silicon Valley Lottery right the winners are like you know you hang out with Joe gby he's not asking me about how to invest in cash flowing businesses right he's not he's not he's not trying to find you know the next uh 10% compounding or whatever uh it's but it's the rest of us it's the 99% of the population who played the Silicon Valley lottery for 10 12 15 years and then we're like all right I am smart but God can I play a game with a little bit higher odds of success because guess what I don't actually need three trillion dollar to be happy um you know I'd actually just like to be financially free and I'd like to use all this business knowledge I have but in a way that's not 95% based on luck and variance which is what I would call most Silicon Valley startups and so yeah there's definitely a shift to doing things that just work uh maybe buying companies that already work and making them work better and also uh people realizing that it's a lot more funny to have it's a lot more fun to have money now than it is to maybe have money out an IPO 10 years from now and so sure all those are definitely on Trend as far as I can tell you said most of these companies succeed by luck and variance yeah I think if you put if I put a hundred uh of my friends from Silicon Valley in a room and I said uh you know and what ended up happening is that let's say five to seven of them ended up doing the thing we were all trying to do we're all trying to build a billion dollar company and maybe five to seven of them did it I don't think it's because those five to seven were smarter or more talented or harder working than the other hundred um what the two things that I think they did do is Project selection Market selection so I think they picked the right idea in the right Market um but it's not that they're better at doing that necessarily it's not that they those guys had a different Insight or a a higher skill at picking um you know they they happened to pick or the thing that they were curious about happened to be on Trend or happened to be the thing that were the bigger opportunity was so I think that's one um and the second is you know the there are you know still like 12 you know Plinko bounces of the of the puck as they go right like talking to the Airbnb guy my biggest takeaway was this company should have died like seven times and I actually give them credit because I think they are in the top 0.001% of like grit and resilience that they actually did have a different thing that pushed them through but most of the people I know that made it it they didn't have the same uh number of times it could have failed once they once they got going uh if that makes sense so anyways I guess I don't think out of the batch of a hundred people that the difference between the winners and losers was Intelligence or Talent or hard work I don't believe that that's what was the difference I would agree with that I think these people figure things out but it is interesting because right now we glorify this person that like it's not working for a hundred years and then finally like the light bulb works you know it's it's interesting we glorify that but a lot of it is like for you guys and myself how many things have you guys done that did not work I mean at least 15 20 projects that I've tried that did not work right some are a day project and some were two years projects or three years yeah I mean I've I've done many many many things and uh like three have taken off this podcast being one of them yeah so like 30 10% have worked I think we think that the people are smarter though Sean we're like oh these people must know something I don't know and like I I talked to a bunch of CEOs when I came back to appsumo because I left for a few years and I remember I interviewed like the founder the CEO of udemy at the time and all these other like famous kind of CEO people I was like these people aren't that much better than us and I think we that takes some time to recognize though and then you it does maybe they have more experience which is stuff we can learn over time you're fascinating right now I think because you've you run one of these companies that was talked about a ton when you first launched it because you were one of the early guys in you you're kind of in this world with Tim Paris and REM me and so you were part of the kind of the Zeitgeist in 2008 to 2014 maybe and then you started this company appsumo which is like Groupon for software discounts and you've kind of been quiet or at least the company has been quiet appsumo but it's one of those stories where you're like what's going on with thatso and then you find out that they're just quietly crushing it uh wherever you you know I don't know what you did in the year one but it's probably 10 years old you're at 80 million in revenue and what I admire about appsumo and what you've built there is is that you've just done the same thing for about a decade or even more and it's just been quietly crushing it how long how how old is it so it's 14 years almost 14 years old it's going through puberty so we've got some Growing Pains here but it but it's been it's been cool though to see that you're just like I think that there's a few companies like this I uh like one example and I have no idea if this is true is like you know you guys know hey.com and superhuman the email software companies yeah they do I think there's a bunch of companies that like they get a lot of hype and then they just get quiet for 5 10 however long years and they just are quietly killing it and building the business I'll give you an example of one card oh yeah about seven to 10 years ago it was really popular to create like your your personal website right you're about. me and then there was like Wix and Weebly and those were like hot weissy startups that were you know that were doing their thing Squarespace was like on every podcast advertising everywhere um and then card came out and it was just simple single page website sites I still use card today I I love this love this app for what anytime I need to make a site it's it is for me still the fastest way to make a website like I think webflow is more popular probably card's easier to use it's really hard though yeah like I need to find there should just be a Blog for low IQ people it's like hey if you're just you know let's be honest about where you're at capabilities and talent wise this is the software you should be using it's like card is is in that that bucket of really really like stupidly easy to use and they came out they were like kind of hot on product hunt and stuff like that like in the kind of when Indie hacking was like had a little moment then they kind of disappeared nobody really talking about them for a while and I met the founder one time and he's told me the numbers and they were just crushing it and I was like what he goes yeah I know he goes actually a really random thing happened he's like every like political movement uh started using cards so like during the campaign like 2016 2020 thousands of websites got created using card to promote like election stuff or any cause it was it became like a thing for causes um he's like yeah that drove a ton of growth during that period and now and I think they just raised like a venture round 10 years later like they bootst for 10 years and then raised like a single round from investors because they kind of couldn't deny like hey this is now much bigger than a two-person project we should probably like I don't know hire an employee and see what we they had two people for 10 years right yeah this guy AJ and I think one other guy then that was it and then now they rais a little money now they're trying go for it but it was this company that you heard about then you just didn't hear about it for seven years but that didn't mean it went away it just meant like it's out of the you know Tech crunch or whatever I think there's something not talked about about longevity right like just doing it over over and over and over and over and over for a very long time I think the second thing is really Market selection right like we've stuck with it 15 years almost but really it's also we chose a good market right like software went from 10 deals our first year give or take to not like how many software products out there 100,000 Plus and more coming uh and so something when people are starting businesses it's like okay well is this something that's gonna be bigger maybe in the future and then how do you at least be mindful of that as you start did you bootstrap it or did you raise money I bootstrapped so you've bootstrapped it 14 years in 80 million so it's profitable I don't know how wildly profitable or just sort of profitable I can share the numbers I'm happy to talk about it okay great let's do it in terms of net revenue I think we ended it was 76 something was the actual final at the end of the year and that's like gross revenue meaning you give everything you give a percentage to the software companies but he said net so that's after you paid out the software company right so gross sales is 70 6.7 net revenue was 56 wow pretty good and then profit was 7.5 and what do you do with that profit that's like Noah's piggy bank or where does it go yeah no no it doesn't go there so what we do is it's been the same approach we've had so we copy Amazon we if you actually look at our net profit over the past literally 14 years years it's like 05% net income margin uh and so what we do is in Q4 we try to spend all the profit we have so that that every year gets bigger and bigger so take everyone on the team to Mexico ads servers sponsorships if we can hiring investors prepaying for things whatever we can within tax rules and pay the team distribution and then whatever's left after that then me and my partner get some distribution wait what so what what's what's confusing about that uh what's confusing about that is um what's the point wait so you're but you're including your paying yourself out of it right like what's the point of running this business for 14 years without the profits is my my question he he included he included his distribution and then you prepay ads for the next year yeah you you try to invest everything as much as you can theoretically if it's a if you think it's a positive investment so that the next year is bigger yeah but it's pretty hard to do that I we do that for our Ecom business it's pretty hard to pay $7 million ahead of time so what's the big ch no we spend like I think almost $2 million distributed back to the team just so that they have bonuses um and for the first F just for what was interesting though first five years I didn't pay myself anything right it was like how do I put everything back in even though we were doing pretty good in terms of the business like the business hit right away which most businesses don't you guys know that like you try a lot of things and not all them work uh but after I think year six I was like I got nothing to show I don't think I'm gonna go public no one's trying to buy us like I'd like to have some money in the bank so I think well were you broke I mean because like before this you'd ran um what was it called game kick uh or kick flip kick flip was one of them and then Gambit and then you were with mint and then you were famously with Facebook um were you cash poor for a long time no I've never been broke I had a million dollars at 30 from day jobs I think that's kind of like not recognized by most people meaning one I was super cheap right so I lived on floors for a year that's a good way to save money lived at my mom's house lived in my aunt's house so just as as cheap as possible I did get two paydays one payday was from the Gambit payments company so I think I made around 350,000 that was payments for Farmville and all those annoying games uh and then the conferences so those plus just being really conservative with the cash like it was about a million dollar liquid around 30 could you tell the Facebook story I know you've told this before but like I said I think a lot of this is buried in your blog that people nobody's reading blogs anymore and so I don't want this I don't want the story to go Untold what what happened with Facebook how did you kind of blow like a hundred million doll payday it was more a few hundred million do payday every year it's also it was a good it was thanks for rubbing it do you know this word shorten Freud yes yeah pleasure in other people's pain right it's like one of my favorite words it's like they have a word for that I think is just kind of the wild thing about it I mean you know it's funny I posted on Twitter some of these like old Facebook memories like me and Zuck and moskovitz and Bosworth who's now the CTO or Chris Cox um Charlie ker Adam D'Angelo it was it was you know Arrington from TechCrunch it wasn't it was a special time man it was a really special time so how did you get there what were you doing what was it like and what happened uh I worked at Intel had a day job but I was always building stuff on the side so I was always kind of just doing things like built college up.org gslist for college students no one used that ninjak card.com discount cards for college students that did really well uh and then I was putting on conferences so on 27 I was basically just really wanting to get the hell out of a day job and have an my own business so I sent in my resume cold but the differentiator was that I sent in mockups so I I took Facebook and I was like here's Facebook Maps if we ever have a Facebook Maps feature so if you want to go see your friend here's how it would look and they were like wow you have a bunch of businesses for college students and you're doing you're showing us what you would do here and you're not a designer right so you're you're scrapping these mockups together you paid somebody what' you do no that was myself so I think I was either using Google Slides I don't know if that was around probably Microsoft Paint like I'm talking super basic it doesn't have to be fancy Google Slides is probably that and canva are probably the best free things you could use did you just cold email Zuck or how how who' you send it to no no no I so I was going to quit Intel in December because I was waiting for my health insurance to kick in I wanted to get my HSA payment and then I just saw the job listing there I didn't know anyone there and so you you send that in they're like cool you go what was your first impression walking into the office I I guess what what was it like back then cuz what and what year was this for Facebook this was 2005 I think one of the things for people out there if you want to get a job which I think could be cool is just go look at where you're using all the time you know if you're listening to a podcast if you're working on a proct to be clear though it is work people think that at AB suumo they're like I'm gonna come party with you guys like you realize like 90% of our day sitting on computer working 10% yeah we do a lot of cool stuff but um when I came in there it was chaotic I mean I posted one of these photos it was a good memory where like there's cables everywhere the desk were kind of all over the place um but it felt like there's something special happening it felt like there's like holy [ __ ] we're we're on a mission that no one else is a part of and we know where this is going and then we have this this truly fearless leader that that seemed like a savant that was he's definitely awkward as hell but uh I was really impressed about you know what he was able to do and how big he was thinking about this company would could be what numbers were was he throwing around yeah so a few crazy things crazy things that people forget though he copied connect you I don't know if anyone remembers this in a weekend he copied someone else and then emailed out his uh emailed out to his uh dorm and that's how it got going so I think people think these big companies start very complicated no he copied someone else launched it it worked then he kept going and then he changed his vision so some of the crazier things that I recall was at a very early time he rejected a billion dollar sale which now maybe sounds a lot little but imagine like Sean you're what 30 something 30 35 yeah 35 you're 24 years old and there's like hey I'm gonna give you a billion dollars this was Yahoo I think all of us would take that in a heartbe I took a $100,000 job so I think I was going to take the billion dollar to offer to I heard this crazy story where they're like I think it was Yahoo that was offering to buy him where you know zuck's sitting there and all the Yahoo gray hairs are talking to him and they make the offer and he was like hey can you guys leave the room so we could discuss this and Peter Teal's in there and the executives leave the room and everyone's looking at Zuck like all right so let let's take this and he goes so I just wanted to like sit in here and pretend like we're talking about this cuz obviously we're not going to take this deal by the way you're totally making this up that's not what happened I that's what I heard I I read a blog post on it the story is they got the offer then there was the next board meeting at the next board meeting he was like which is like where Peter teal and others were he was like okay bit of housekeeping we got to discuss you know we're supposed to talk about this got this offer obviously not going to take it and they were like whoa whoa whoa maybe we should Mark that's a lot of money we should talk about this that's what they said but even that I think is Sean don't let facts get in the way of a good story well I think there's even more revisionist history which which is interesting here because then later there's another story that Zuck actually accepted an offer from I think it was I think it was Yahoo and um is either yaho or Microsoft I don't remember and then they reneged they came back and tried to negotiate down uh so like you know he took 1.2 and then they came back and said no it's going to be like 900 or something there's another story like that and so none of these are congruent because Peter teal tells the story right that's where that was the source of that story where he was just trying to say how Zuck is this you know he was this like Visionary um you know balls of steel turned down the billion dollar offer but then there's this other story where he kind of took it and I'm like well and they're like he wanted Revenge because they they negotiate him down like but wait he said yes so I don't really know what the truth is but I know there's a lot of this BS in startup lore where people make up stories that make somebody sound more more uh Brave or I would you know someone asked me a few days ago like is Zuck good or bad and I think he's good I think people might have negative impression but he was he he's he's ambitious but I think he always at least when I was there had good intentions of being ambitious it wasn't like I need to manipulate the media he's probably like what are you talking about it's just an algorithm I don't know like change it up again we'll fix it no can I about the environment because I remember once in when I lived in San Francisco we were I was doing a startup I thought I was doing a I thought this is it we're we're all we're just like every other startup we're in the race we're in the hunt we're going to make the next big thing and then I went to a friend's office who was doing a startup and they actually had product Market fit and like the market was pulling their product they were growing faster they could handle yes and I walked into that office which was smaller way less nice you know didn't have like didn't have it wasn't super organized they had like you know people were sitting on the floor and like there was just like people everywhere there's cables everywhere it was like a different vibe is the company still around yeah yeah it it's it actually sold uh for you know a few hundred million dollars and so I walked home and I remember thinking on my way home oh [ __ ] we're just playing house like that's what it's supposed to feel like when it's working I didn't even actually realize it till I stepped foot in there but that's a totally different energy they have it and we don't and um did you feel that when you went into the Facebook Office 100 per. I felt it I've been lucky to feel it a few times at mint I felt it appsumo feels it and I think it inside at Facebook one my boss got fired the day I I I started so I walked in and my boss is walking out which is a really strange you know I just left Intel which you know I had you know eight meetings a day and I had all this training it was horrible and I you know I go into a room and zuck's like your your boss Doug who ended up founding good RX you guys know good RX yep oh wow pretty pretty pretty impressive um I just fired him because he wanted he's a lot of guys from Facebook came from Yahoo and he's like he tried to sell the company so it's my company I fired him welcome to Facebook and then I just grabbed literally a corner of a desk and it was like all right well what should I work on right and it it's literally like a stark contrast from Intel where like everything is regimented and uh it was amazing I think the thing that was interesting that others didn't know is that we saw the internal metrics about the growth so we knew there was something happening that others didn't see in terms of like I think we're at 10 million the day I started by the day I got fired it was about 50 million uh so we just saw that like wow this growth but the threats were serious like Google was a threat which people you know kind of forget today Myspace was a huge threat uh and obviously now those things aren't even really talked about what were you doing the the math when you were thinking about how much your Stock's eventually going to be worth where you're like man this might make $10 million my whole thing was that I just thought the equity is going to be insanely value I didn't know at mint I had a very specific number I thought it would sell for which I was accurate there Facebook I was like I don't know the limit because zuck's Vision was to connect the entire world and his whole his quote was like we want to be a toll booth for the internet I remember that and that was inspiring it was nice you know even at absum now I'm now like okay what are we excited about and we're excited to promote software like we love promoting software it's like his was like I want to connect the entire world are you imagine showing up to work and he's connecting the entire world and and what he did a lot of really clever things which was how do I reduce all distractions so like he paid for all of our parking tickets uh he paid for all of our cleaning he paid for us to live close he paid for like everything so all we had to do is focus on work and that wasn't normal back then right like uh to like pay your parking tickets and be like hey there's G just bring your laundry here sh like shut up about your life and just bring your laundry here and just work because uh yeah we when we were hanging out with Mr Beast Jack Smith said this the other day he go we were hanging out and he goes I like how he just has no disregard for social Norms because we were like how' you hire this guy or like how do you train people and he's like they move in with me basically like they just I attach them to my hip they follow me everywhere we work seven days a week and then after six months like now you could start to give your ideas because you now you have now fully absorbed me and they're like all right well I don't think I could isn't there like California labor laws like how does this work and um and and I think it was right the absolute disregard for social norms I've now learned is like a very very positive attribute or signal in highly Highly Successful People sounds like Ze was kind of like that too I don't know if that I think asking and doing things that you believe I think you guys are very good at that but there's also I think negatives like I remember this guy Dan died in a b a tree fell on him during one of the work days he was biking and a treat killed him and I'm like okay are we gonna put a bike wreck outside are we gonna have a moment and there was not even any acknowledgement it was like let's just work and I just thought that was that was insane yeah I mean there's a price to pay for being crazy like that right like there's pros and cons yeah I mean it's special to be a part and you have to think like we had Harvard phds in Customer Support like imagine that like people that wanted to be there so badly doesn't matter your degree you just come work there and so being in that environment was really special and just like learn seeing all this amazing talent that that was there and that has left to go do really cool things and so why did they fire you it's funny I was actually looking at the pictures I was fired at basically because of Coachella like you you dipped out I was like I was drunk and high at Coachella and then for me I I was blogging about Facebook because I was so excited about it I think go find things you're excited about it and tell the world about it if you think it's a good thing that that's how I've always felt with the stuff I do and I let uh Arrington at Tech crunch know like hey Facebook's opening up to Microsoft and corporate emails in the morning I think you should write about it and get and talk about it because Facebook wasn't going to do any press and he wrote about it that night and then I emailed Zuck and some of the other e team and I let him know what I did so I think it was that and then I I think for me I also felt frustated you you guys have seen these people where for me at 30 people when it was like No just figure things out so I was like all right I'm going to help build mobile with slee or I'm going to help build ads or I'm gonna help do the status update thing which they didn't even want to do it was just fun it was very like there's a lot to do there and and I was also probably more immature and then as I got older and it grew I I didn't want to be in meetings I didn't want to do excel project management I didn't want to have long discussions with 30 people about basic ideas when did it become corporate I mean at that point it was 150 people it felt very corporate to me it felt very you know and if you look at Facebook what's the last great thing Zuck has done since 2005 besides acquiring other people what does he come up with portal that was a flopp like name one thing he's actually done besides make he's acquired he's made good decisions acquiring people I'd say that yeah just gotten bigger I mean he that's why Facebook's great it's just it's because everyone uses it I mean it's so big I remember when Sarah and my wife worked there they were like we're doing this thing in India where we put blimps or drones up in the sky and I was like why are they doing that they're like well because the only people who aren't on Facebook are the people in India who don't have internet so we're just G to go give them free internet so they can use Facebook I mean his Relentless drive towards growing to everyone is is what he's done yeah and stuff like you know the part thing is the bigger you get the harder it is to move the needle so it's like Marketplace super successful but uh kind of like who cares it's like yeah you built Craigslist inside Facebook it's fine uh you know they need need us they need to do something so big right that's why it's like the metaverse or AI like they have to go on these huge waves just to kind of like move the needle for how big Facebook is I think what what was really interesting what people can think about in their own businesses is the core really great because like Facebook Marketplace or Facebook events I was really excited to to grow and improve and monetize early on and he was just against it completely and I noticed that with appsumo or our core businesses go find cool products get a deal on them promote them that's it right but it gets very exciting to think all right could we do Mr can we do all these other options but really it's like can you do the core excellent and then start adding new things at a later point so you've had this video where you went on this plane with this guy who I think was a Commodities Trader I I think that's what he said you know and I assume he was worth hundreds of millions of dollars I know that you have a bunch of friends who are billionaires you told me ahead of time you said uh most billionaires that you know are unhappy what tell me more about like what you've noticed about hanging out with some of these like uber Uber successful people most of them didn't set out to be billionaires like you hear people online like I want to be a billionaire it's like almost every billionaire I know and I've worked for them or multi multimillionaire was just like here's something I'm curious about or excited about and yes maybe in private Equity or Finance but a lot of the entrepreneur ones it was just like stuff they're curious about all of them got rich as well in one way like I was just at FedEx this morning because I interviewed the guy from uh Kinkos he just focused on copiers that's it but a lot of newer entrepreneurs I've seen or ones that haven't had much successor like I'm going to do five different solar preneur startups this weekend it's like okay you can test five but which one's working let's just do one these billionaires just did one but they tell us to diversify and so I think that's always fascinating for me because they do one thing and this is again we kind of coming back to the appsumo story is they stuck with it for a very long period of time like think about any billionaires you know how long did it take yeah I mean 20 years 30 years a lifetime a life a career a lifetime a lifetime and we're trying to get rich in a week weekend or which you know crypto rich in a month and I think the the slow compounded growth over long periods of time is what doesn't get recognized Sean didn't you say that was like your major takeaway from your Camp MFM yeah I wouldn't say it exactly like that but um when uh I was talking to Jimmy and I was like yeah I think the thing I'm you know most the thing that's standing out to me the most as I I get out of my bubble I reassess I reflect it's the start of the new year is I think I'm spending um so much energy but I'm spreading it out I'm spreading it too thin and that's a mistake like I'm doing more and getting less and I put it differently I said I think you have a thousand times more opportunity hit you know opportunities coming to you every day and you've said yes to half the things I have so something's wrong here I think in general the more successful you get uh the more opportunities you get but the more things you should and and you should be saying no to I think horos said a nice thing about this that I I thought resonated he goes let's say you get let's say you're making 10,000 a month and now somebody comes and offers you something that's going to make you ,000 pretty easy to say no like you have a going rate if you're making 100,000 a month and somebody comes to you and says here's something that'll make you 10 grand easy to say no the hard thing is when you're making a 100 Grand and somebody comes to you and says here's a thing that can make a 100 Grand and you're like that's my rate but what happens is you now have you you've now split your focus and your basically you're you're losing life balance but you're also doubling down the amount of work you have to do only to get you know one more unit compared to where you were he's like the best people the smartest people they basically when they're at the 100 they don't say yes to the next thing that can get them a 100 or 200 they will only say yes to something that might get them you know 10x more than that and so the right way to do it is to basically say all right this gave me the right to say no to certain things and the hardest one to say no to is the one that's at the current level where you're currently at and the people who really break out get to the next level they're the ones who are able to to to say no stay focused until they see something that is truly 10x better opportunity than what they have so how are how are you changing this year Well I said DOTA a bunch of things I shut down two of the things that I was working on that were working but they were more in that like onx um 1X type of category and then every day I basically start my day with the first three hours because I was like you know the main thing I want to focus on is is making great content it's the thing I love doing the most it's the thing I think I'm I'm best at but the hard part is a deal comes on the table and now I'm spending you know the first eight hourss that day working on that deal or that investment or that opportunity or that new new idea and so I just carved out where the first three hours of the day I'm only doing content and I was like cool I want this to eventually be eight hours 10 hours a day but the thing I can control is the first three hours I'm not going to say yes to anything else I'm only going to say this and the cool part is as soon as you do the first three hours you have so much momentum the natural thing to do is just to keep going and so that's been very effective so far where are you Sean where are you going to start making content like when you keep saying content creation are you talking specifically Tex are you talking about text you blogging is coming back Sean blog.com might come back all all ideas are on the table so right now I'm just prototyping so I'm basically trying to figure out which one do I enjoy the most I knew I would enjoy podcasting um I listened to a ton of podcasts I had prototyped it so before this podcast I had recorded two other podcasts one with my roommate and brother-in-law at home where we talked about sports and never released it there's only been three listeners ever it's me and the two guys I did it with then I did another podcast at my office when I was doing a startup it was me Furon and a couple couple other guys three episodes I think they're up on YouTube Somewhere nobody ever watched them but doing that even though those podcasts went nowhere it did do one thing which it showed me oh man I really like doing this and how cool would it be if I actually like could do this all the time or it was actually you know if people actually listen to it man that would be amazing and so I had prototyped it I felt it out before I in order to know that that's actually something I wanted to do so when I say new content I'll dabble with let's say short form or or write you know I'll write a a a brief to a book like you know an outline to a book at the first two chapters because I'm trying to understand what do I want to write a book or not I don't need to commit to that because I can prototype it and feel it out first you definitely should go to the book route the problem with the book route Noah that you've seen it seems so [ __ ] hard it seems so hard everyone I know who who writes a book they describe it exactly how my friends who run marathons do where they complain constantly while they're in training they say the race is miserable and then about two weeks after the race happens or the book goes live they go all right I think I'm G to do this next book on this topic and I'm like man I just heard you complain for two years no you've been talking about this freaking book for years I think it's been way longer than four years actually I remember you talking about how you wanted to write a book forever and it took four freaking years to do this thing is it you think it's going to be worth it what's the ROI going going to be I like it I'm proud of it I think it's first off you know coming back to well and the the Roa on that I think it's going to impact people I think one person at a time I've already seen it right I've seen people read it and I'm like holy [ __ ] really you know even I think with these things like what what you guys have done with your show and Sean's like what you're exploring with yours uh your content is like what's something you're excited to do and that's kind of hard like no one's ever proud of themselves like yeah I wrode I walked five feet like but if you run a mile or if you run a marathon you're like damn that was hard but I can actually do this and I think that that that to me was really the ultimate AR in this book think can I actually face myself and work on a book and help other people and then can people do it for themselves D what did you become so political what do you mean where like I'm it's called you're like a polit you're like a politician my friend like so old Noah I gotta tell a story about old Noah I remember uh Sean one time there's a coworker who I work with who Sean you are friends with and she uh we go on to this meeting and Noah shows up shirtless he's got no shirt on he's in his house I think he's like on his couch and I'm like Noah what the [ __ ] are you doing dude like he he was this like crazy madman and that's actually what made him brilliant was like he would do all this crazy stuff and he executed crazy stuff really really really well but now when I ask what the ROI is of this you you're showing so much evolution you're talking about changing people's lives it's so funny to see you say this this stuff well one thank you I think we should all change people's lives back then too just in a different way one nip at a time yeah one a I've also I I I was going to talk about inverted my inverted nipples which I'm very self-conscious about okay no I mean look I'm maturing do I want to show up shirtless maybe if we're hanging out in AR sauna like come over but I think as you you get older you also realize like what kind of behavior do you want to do and I think that's fine uh do the book I think people have these these like [ __ ] Roi things like I want to help a million people I don't give a [ __ ] about that I don't but I am happy if like one or two or five or a thousand or 10,000 then read the book and do something for themselves um Noah we appreciate you doing this man I I forgot to I should have plugged this earlier on but I'm doing I'm buying how many how many books am I buying 30 50 books something like that so I bought a bunch of books I'm trying to do my part to help you rank up in in the list so if you go to the anti mba.com between now and February 15th to anyone who gives me their email I'll just like pick I'll randomly pick 50 of you guys and I'll send you a link to buy the book for free or to enter your uh address in and and we'll send you the book um I'm excited to see you do this I hopefully hopefully you uh impact some people which I know you will but also the the ego side of me is like hopefully you rank on some type of bestseller list which I know is also pretty cool um we appreciate you doing this uh what do you want to it's called million dooll weekend you're Noah Kagan on Twitter appsumo dcom Noah Kagan on YouTube am missing any other plug no man it's uh by the way Noah I had an experience like this that shifted my life I'm a testimonial for this even before your book came out uh I was working on a startup my very first startup we were working on it for like nine months trying to get everything right we literally had a 300 page business plan it was embarrassing letting now that I look back but we thought that meant we were you know doing everything we were dting every you know we're dotting teas and Crossing eyes out here and so uh I was like all right well at a certain point I looked at my my co-founder and I was like my co-founder he's my roommate my friend and I was like um I was like dude I feel like we just keep telling everyone we're doing a business but we don't actually do any business he's like what and I was like like how long have we been sitting here with this whiteboard and this plan and like how much we have no Revenue we've never made a dollar like I can't believe this and we just keep tricking ourselves into thinking that this is legit legit I just read the 4-Hour Work week and I was like all right this weekend we are going to make money I don't care how was like and our we set a goal for a thousand dollar I said we're gonna try to make $ thousand doll in the next you know basically was it was Friday I was like we're gonna make it by Sunday night and uh I don't care how let's go and instantly just by having that intention things started to fall together we made this website we found a product on Alibaba we got it drop shipped we made our first sale we sold basically I don't know a few hundred of these like rich bands like kind of customized wristbands like those fat like Liv strong bands um to somebody who their parents were having an anniversary and they needed like 200 of these we charged them like you know four or five bucks per we made, dollars in one weekend and I felt like the champion of the of the universe and I was like this is what business is supposed to feel like taking action actually going out there try to sell a product um moving fast don't try to perfect everything you don't need a 300 page plan and after that like literally my yeah my whole game shifted just from that one experience and so I haven't read your book yet you you sent it to me I'm going to read it but I already like in my soul am on board with what you're all about dude I did that wristband business too that's so crazy they were hot at the time right like every kid was wearing them every college kid was wearing them but I think that the thing you called out which is interesting and one that's awesome is like because you said hey I'm gonna do something and I have this limited time and you have 52 of them right so especially if you guys got kids and all this stuff you don't have a lot of time but you can make an hour or two weekend to do something and then look what you did in a weekend which you didn't do in months right yeah exactly that look what you did in the weekend that you didn't do in months that's that's how it's exactly how it felt and then I was like I either can go back to the old way or I can go this new way this action way and the action way became the way and that you know basically that became I don't know like Sam it's so funny you have that tatted on your feet like that's it's been tatted in my brain that's like the only thing you know I remember literally looking around I was at Duke and there's a bunch of smart kids at Duke I thought thought when I was in high school I was the smart kid then you go to a college with all the smart kids from those high schools and you realize oh you ain't [ __ ] and I was like all right yeah am I just GNA be like forgetta average because that's where this is going and I was like am I Really Gonna Get smarter than these people am I gonna I don't have any tal like special talents that they that nobody else has but I realize that a lot of smart people are overthinkers they hesitate they doubt they overanalyze and I was like that's my thing I'm not going to do that I'm just going to immediately take action and that will be the difference and that will be my thing and I could just that'll be the Bedrock that I can build any kind of success on rather than trying to have been like a special snowflake that was uh you know pre predestined to do great things and that just became my uh my my motto I've still got the needle bro we can change that we can we can let's T it let's Tat It Well Sean but most people who listen to your show want to make a million they don't ever make a buck they never make make that $1 and that's where they have to get you know get off their ass that was bars dude that was that was great like like good lyrics nice nice words thank you like bro you're a 40-year-old YouTuber how do you not know these things I'm learning the the vocab but dude I read this good book last night Sam you made me inspired by it it's called The Art thief and uh this guy who steals art but one of the things he said that stuck with me is like what's the first thing you look at when you wake up in the morning and I I do respect that I love that you're like well this is the area I want to improve which is you know you saw it on your feet I I don't see my feet first thing in the morning but I it's like put something on your bedside put something out where you're like first thing you see in the morning maybe it's Sean's face yeah maybe it's million dollar weekend maybe it's something but I love that idea I'm getting my whole legs done you know not you know I've got a kid now so maybe I'll do her name but uh I've got a I've got a I've got bold Fast Fun tattooed to my thighs because BFF that's kind of what I live for when it comes to business um I've got a pirate ship is that bro live laugh love is B yeah I mean that's true I moved to Austin and I found myself yeah I did the work Sean it's self love you did the work dude congratulations dude well you know the reason I like homemade tattoos is you do what you want when I found out when you go to tattoo shops you basically find an artist that you like and you're like here's kind of what I want and they're like yeah I'm just going to do whatever I want and you're like too embarrassed to like tell them exactly what what you want because this guy you want to impress them and so I basically have a whole bunch of tattoos on my legs and all throughout my body that I was just trying to trying to impress Hector my tattoo artist so so that's pretty much how it works when it comes to tattoos um no we appreciate you coming uh we'll wrap here uh that's the [Music] pod

all right this is a fun episode Sam started doing Legos and that sent us down this Rabbit Hole where he discovered two businesses that I never heard of I guarantee you never heard of it they're awesome businesses in the Lego niche of all things and then we brainstormed other things that people could do around these passionate Niche audiences that most people Overlook love it this is MFM classic MFM special if you like this podcast you're gonna love this one uh and I also had like an epiphany about 45 minutes in that kind of changed the way I think about this podcast so that's that's what I got out of this episode Sam what did you get so while searching this stuff there is a ton of twists and turns to the story the background story of how these companies started I want you guys to listen to them it doesn't happen it's the second story involving Lego you'll know exactly what I'm talking about when we get there it's about two-thirds of the way into the episode I got emotional researching this and I actually want you guys to like listen to the topics and the companies that we brought up I want you to go to their websites and see what I'm talking about you'll know exactly what I'm talking about when you get to the the part of the episode and let us know in the YouTube comments if this actually got to you like it got to me I dug it it was tons of like weird parts of the stories that I did not expect to happen anyway check it out and let us know in the YouTube comments if you actually dug this because I think you will and which parts of the stories you like [Music] best what is up Sean here with Sam your boys who are stuck at 399,000 YouTube subscribers they said we'd never get to 400 in fact there's still saying we'd never get to 400 s did you see this tweet that went viral that goes all my haters said I wouldn't make it I didn't make it they were right honestly good call by the haters it's like a legendary tweet I love that stuff um yeah we're at 399 the I I read every YouTube comment do you read and reply bro not to everyone but I I reply like it's like a I'm in line at a coffee shop I'll just go through and go through a whole episode and try to reply as many as I can yeah so uh if you're listening and you're not on YouTube do do your boys a favor and just click subscribe it means a lot to us it costs you nothing and uh we've got a good episode today we have we last time we talked we both had the same topic written down and we did it again it happened again this time uh before we get into the episode I got to tell you something how big is your house square footage uh 5600 I'm in a house right now I'm visiting family so I rented an air B&B for 2 weeks my home my normal home in Austin is uh just a little over 2,000 s ft it's not big it's nice but it's not big I'm currently renting a 7500 foot house I am losing so much stuff this is such a big house I think that even 55 would be too big for me do you like having a big house like that yeah it's great what's not to love I'll tell you one the utility bill here if I had to guess it's like 2,000 a month what's your utility bill well you're in California so you don't really use too much I don't check it uh I don't I don't look uh everything's on autopay and I don't even want to look I it's probably like ,200 $1,500 I guess wow okay so that's expensive but whatever uh but the other thing things break all the time like there's seven bathrooms here and like one of the the guy has like a Jacuzzi thing in one of his bathrooms it's not working I don't you going and using all seven bathrooms that's you you don't use half the [ __ ] the [ __ ] that's the trick that's how it breaks that's how breaks you just don't use it and so anyway I I wanted to buy a big home eventually and I'm happy I'm testing this out it's such a big house I understand the downsides to it of just like fixing things it's a pain in the butt well here's my here's my my rule number of humans plus two that's how many beds that's how many bedrooms I want in my house number of humans plus two bedrooms and one of those bedrooms turns into man cave like where I have the studio here right now this is one of the bedrooms we just converted and the other one's a guest room uh now my kids are small right now so they're like all sleeping in the same bed and stuff like that it doesn't really help but as they get older that rule is going to come into effect yeah and I think maybe my needs will change but I just wanted to test out a big house I'm shocked by how much I dislike it so farle things most people don't do this at all and you do it a lot which is where do I want to live how do I want to live do I want to live in a city do I want to live in the suburbs do I want to live in a big house small house near water you know what matters to me uh because I think a lot of people have these predefined ideas that are completely based on nothing no evidence and uh I really take a lot of inspiration from the way you test out Lifestyles you prototype like how you want to live and uh more people should do that for sure I I do it all the time and the reason I do it is because if you think about it so renting a really fancy Airbnb for a week it could be expensive let's just say it's $1,000 a night or more so let's just say let's round up and say it's 10 grand for a week that's expensive but you know what's more expensive buying a home that you only see for 24 hours and or through a 1 hour tour and being like cool this is my place now for the next 10 or 20 years that's way more expensive Andrew honestly you start to lose a little trust in yourself it's like Oh I thought this would make me happy it turns out I didn't even like this right uh I'm not listening to that guy anymore and by the way you don't have to be rich to do this lifestyle testing like I was doing this when I had you know no money because well I didn't have it it's all relative to where you're at right so it's where do I want to live I would move to like I would do a road trip and we would drive to another place live on a friend's couch but we would live there for two weeks and just kind of see okay what's it like in this place like where're I tried in Chicago then I tried in Colorado and then you know I just tested out different places in order to see where do I want to be and um I think that's a very smart way to to go about things you want to talk about Legos my man let's talk about Legos can I introduce this category with which is the following you text me and you go dude I'm playing a ton of Legos what it's like yeah every night I'm playing Legos do you do this and I was like no I don't do this but I know a bunch of other people that doing it caught my attention because I'm not sure if you know this but this is kind of becoming this like uh trendy thing so there's a bunch of like NBA players that kind of came out of the closet saying yeah this is what I do at night the closet yeah know the reputation for NBA players we're all out at the strip club after games and whatever and there's like this guy Miles Turner he's like I'm building like replica Star Wars like you know stars with with my Legos at night four or five hours a night and I got kind of interested so I looked at it by the way in college I lived with the basketball team in college they were the biggest nerds of all the athletes like they they didn't go out given them wedgies six seven wedgies well like like a Friday night was playing video games like it it was like they were the least party animal of all the athletes all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM so do you know what this category is called is it called the is it the acronym that starts in the a no no no they call them they call people like you Cults the toy industry they call you guys Cults and cads or Elder tainment is the name of this group of people that are adults buying kids toys and that sounds like a pretty fringe thing but it actually makes up 25% of all toy sales so billions and billions of dollars one one one out of every four people that go by you know let's say a set of Legos is going to be an you know older teenager or adult you know what they call for Legos for specifically for Legos it's called the I don't it's one of those words that I've see but I don't know if you're supposed to how you're supposed to say it but afol adult fan of Legos that's you're self-identified as an AF actual [ __ ] old Lego maker so so this uh this category uh like it makes up all the growth in the toy industry so toy industry if you look at how fast this growing 60% of all the growth is just coming from this one segment so it's like this like kind of this segment that's growing really fast at first I didn't understand it but then they did some surveys right because all the toy companies were like what's going on here we this is not what we planned for so several years ago they commissioned a bunch of studies and they they went and asked why are you doing this and I'm curious if you're going to say the same thing because 90% of the adults all said the same three reasons that they do it what are your reason Sam bonding with my family well in my family my wife um no no screens and we can just sit at the table and do it together while we're just talking and maybe there will be TV on in the back background but it's basically bonding without screens sitting at the table and it reminds me of my childhood that's exactly right the uh The three-word Nostalgia which you just said um anti- loneliness so bonding with with whoever you're you're doing it with and detoxing from from phone as well as kind of like an anti-anxiety angle to it like is a relaxing a relaxing activity because I'm following Direction I'm just following the directions I'm not making any decisions I'm doing what I'm told that's interesting oh okay I thought it was kind of the hands part of it but you're saying as an adult I'm constantly having to make decisions and think and it's so nice to not make decisions and just be told put this blue thing over here yeah it's like a it's like a a PG rated dominatrix you know like instead of spitting in my mouth it's telling me to like connect the these two pieces yeah some people you're into that stuff all right to each his own and so this is fascinating to me so I want you to tell me I have some more ideas around like more ex I have a bunch of examples around this trend and some ideas of what I think people could do but before we do that I just want to know what are you what are you actually doing so you're buying Lego kits like which ones and what do you what do you do so Lego is this huge company so I think they do about $10 billion doll a year in sales uh it was started in like the 20s by just an engineer and now they have got they've got movies characters it's like a it's like a Marvel almost it's like a a whole franchise I particularly like the line called Technics and Technics is cool because it's basically you'll build cars or tractors or uh a bridge and there's gears within the machine and so I'm learning how like you know like in the snow when um old cars when you spin your tires only one tire would spin sometime that's because of a rear uh differential that's like a mechanical piece and so I'm like building that and I'm understanding how transmission works I'm building I built a Land Rover that has six a six-speed transmission and I see how how gears work and so it's really fascinating to me to see these moving parts so I build Technics I've probably spent $1,500 on them so far each one is between 150 and 350 and I buy only the Technics one that that's my thing and you're you finish them in one sitting or these are like multi-week no no I one a week so but it'll take I'll sit for 2 hours and if my wife's not with me I'll listen to a podcast or something and I'll just sit there for 2 hours assembling it from like 9 to 11 just you and the voice of Scott Galloway yeah I'm just like I'm listening to like some War story so it's like just like me and me and Bonito melini as I build this Land Rover like this like 6 inch tractor yeah I love by the way how you're like yeah I built a six you know a six-speed transmission it's like no no no you didn't you really didn't I feel like you got a lot of confidence from this that like I could came down to it I now could and uh I don't think you could man so all right so you're doing this is this a fat or you think this is like a lifelong hobby for you what do you what are you thinking lifelong I could see it being lifelong wow yeah what you do with them when you're done you finished the the six-speed tractor whatever what are you going to do with this so one of the companies that I'm going to bring up but basically you tell this company that I'll I'll break down and explain what sets you have and you destroy them and you rebuild them using different plans and so you can make alternative items out of them and so that's what I intend to do ah okay all right they're not gonna sit on a shelf I'm not going to be like the 40 Old Virgin and have like dolls and packages still unused no I it it really is a enjoy the journey type of thing so once I'm done with it I'm like I don't care about it okay good um so I wanted to bring up a couple couple other examples cuz I I saw this and I was like H that's weird that's interesting about Legos and I was like no there's something to this like cult Behavior right where adults buying and doing kid things that is you know antiphone anti loneliness and uh and nostalgic and um I'm going to give you some examples of of trends that are like this so the first is calm um we're both friends with the the founders of Comm Alex and Michael and I don't know if you remember this but back in the day Comm was really struggling today Comm is like kind of very popular it's a multi-billion dollar company but back when we were living in San Francisco and hang out with Alex uh Comm was like small it was a slow grower it was not sexy nobody wanted to it was kind of a joke like a meditation app are you kidding me and Alex is very jokey and the other things he built like Million Dollar Homepage were all jokes so it's kind of like oh cool and the other guy built like a stuffed animal business before that yeah so they were definitely like non-serious serious entrepreneurs um they but I remember one time talking to Michael so Michael came to visit from London and he's like I was like so what do you do with comp because you're not even here full-time Alex is sitting in his apartment grinding away at this thing that's not really going too fast growing too fast what are you doing and he's like oh I'm work I work on new products and I'm like dude this is not like uh you know he looks at Richard Branson I was like this is not Virgin Atlantic what new products he's like no no I got a great one he goes uh I want to do um bedtime story for adults and I was like what he's like no no no I was like that's okay whatever marketing stunt I guess he's like no no I think this is going to be a thing he goes keep people are going to like he's like a lot of adults they listen to things before they sleep to help them relax and help them actually like fall asleep but they're not done very well do you uh yeah I do sometimes I have like I have like a version of white noise that I sometimes listen to or I'll just listen to podcast and fall asleep which is not the same thing but uh there's like a relax people who want a Rel a relaxation thing in fact I think one of the top podcasts in the world is just like 18 hours of sleep sounds and it's like I listen to a I listen to Family Guy when I go to bed and I just hear like Peter like I just hear that while I'm going to sleep yeah to sleep exactly and so he's like I'm gonna do the thing they ended up being sleep stories and sleep stories were one of the things that really let C take off it like exploded after sleep stories in fact I would say that c is it's less about meditation it is more about the state of being commmon and really the number one product is the Sleep stories and they got Matthew mccon to narrate this like bedtime story and he was hosting I don't know if you remember this in San Francisco he would before to prototype this he was hosting parties in San Francisco where you would go to This Woman's house and you would lay down on her carpet and you would have like a pillow and they would like set the mood and then she would just talk and put you to sleep and then everybody would go to sleep and um it was the most San Francisco thing ever and these are that was like a party it was like it was like a networking event it was like it was amazing and so but you think cm is going to have toy or you're saying the the toy is no I'm saying this is part of the same thing like adults using adults using kid product basically so bedtime stories for adults that's another version of yeah you know adults using Legos my family member I have family members I won't even say who they are they might be embarrassed who go to sleep to calm bedtime stories it what's embarrassing about that that's awesome I don't know I don't know you never know I'm not going to out someone so there's also like Moon Pals and squishmallows have you seen these yeah I know Moon pal they like basically giant stuffed animals but they're geared more towards adults than they are for kids and you see like you know 24 year-old girls in the Bronx who like have like a you know like a moon pal that they carry around little like safety blanket Funko Pop is that is that what it's called what's the Funko Funko is a publicly traded company you know that no they they're they're like a $400 million uh market cap company during the during covid when everybody was stuck at home and people started just spending money collecting or buying crypto or doing whatever Funko was like over a billion dollar because they were selling so many of these figurine doll things figurine like dolls that's all it is yeah it's just like a little a little toy um toy figure action figure no action I guess just just toy figurine that U has an oversized head and we that's funny uh we had talked about mini Brands as well like the company mini brands that makes Mini I don't even like Coke cans uh those are insane too another one have you ever been to Builder bear dude they they kill it yeah I've taken a nephew there so build-a bear is like this thing in the mall where you go build a teddy bear it's usually like you know was four kids you know that 40% of their revenue now comes from adults that's insane that's insane absolutely and they call it Build-A-Bear after dark they basically like open up at late hours and let adults come in and basically like you know do it as a date night Act ity and stuff like that it's crazy um there's more American do uh you know I don't know if you you had a sister so you would know American do but I bet Ari knows American do or had an American do American dos still crush it uh you know what American do is no is that not Barbie that's something else it's different it's a doll that's maybe three foot tall it back then they would cost $150 so it was a big deal and there it was sort of like gi. Joe but for girls and there was like an American doll student and so it looked like a little girl who was going to Harvard or American Doll astronaut or something like that it was like themed but they were supposed to be more high-end than a Barbie and more collectible I think American doll only fans Creator oh they have like new new genres that's great so they um so uh there's there's just like like even Barbie by the way do you know bar you know how the Barbie movie came about because like the Barbie movie is not not geared towards kids right like if you've seen it it's it's not a it's not a kids's movie really it's an adult it's like geared towards adults and that this is the reason why they actually bar Barbie the company actually created an internal movie production company to create this movie geared towards adults to help sell more dolls into this Kult uh like uh segment and so there's a marketing stunt for that which is kind of crazy when you think about it I didn't realize that about the Barbie movie um but like there's also tabletop gaming so you know those guys from churnin they've made like big bets on tabletop gaming which is basically board games that adults play they have like exploding kittens and they have some other ones but that's another genre even McDonald's came out with an adult happy meal I don't know if you saw this last year just a hilarious like they made a bigger box with full-size fries and an adult toy and they did this last year and it was like this viral marketing stunt that went crazy because everyone's like oh dude I want to go get one and it like went viral on Tik Tok and stuff like that brands are really capitalizing on this so I have a few ideas I want to pitch pitch you I want you to tell me you could just give me a uh genius or idiot on these this is sort of like a mini drunk ideas episode for all right all right first one you know how you've seen the stats how Millennials are just like not getting married and not having babies like it's like a lower rate than ever before yeah tamagachi for babies so basically you give you give that 28-year-old who's single and whatever you give a tamagachi that's a baby that they got to keep they got to raise and they got to take care of like tamagachi I think we're pets screw it we're just doing an actual human baby you got to take care of this thing and it literally is the same level of uh like same same like hourly needs as a baby and let's see what you got so Tom I got you for babies that's my first one so the problem with these ideas is if you would have told me about the things that are successful now that they like this is this is going to work I would have said those are all horrible ideas so this is like a really challenging category that's why I prepped You by telling you all the ones that worked before I told you my bad ideas just to kind of like frame you like Prime you for like hey I don't know man anything's possible so do I think T yes I think I think there there'd be legs for tamagachi what what happened to the company ah dude I have no idea what's tamagachi it's a it's a Japanese business yeah it's a it's based in Japan yeah I i' believe that a tamagi for babies it's a standalone device that's going to replicate having a baby all right that's number one number two did you ever use connects yeah I love connects you ever build a big ferris wheel no because connects were hard and I had a cousin I have a cousin who's the same age as me looks like me last name Puri and this guy's way smarter than me and I I'm pretty sure the reason he's way smarter than me is that his dad bought him connects when he was a little kid and he was just making connects all day every day after school I was playing Dreamcast and he was building connects guess what he does now I have a podcast he builds like self-driving cars this guy is a genius so like I'm pretty sure conect is the uh you know the number one contributing factor to this guy being a genius dude listen to this connects was sold in 2018 for only 2 $21 million I know I know crazy what I what happened how is Lego like a $50 billion company and connects sold for $21 million like what happened here and when you were describing the Lego Technics it's very similar so connects the difference was that it was more kind of like a stem kid thing where it's like sciencey and mathy where it's like you you know you have these like little like rotating wheels and mo it's almost like a motor that you're creating it's like a high functioning version of Legos that's how I describe you by the way you're you're you're a high functioning version of a Lego that basically you I take that as a compliment so I think conect should just like somebody should just reboot conects targeted at as for adults that want to do Legos basically uh the guys like you literally connects for S par that's my next idea go ahead yeah I'm in that's a that's a no-brainer I'm in so conect was acquired in 2019 and they're basically not that existent anymore because of because of a bunch of tariffs uh something like where they couldn't import them but uh yeah I'm me I think I think they sold a bunch through like Toys R R Us and then Toys R R Us went bankrupt and I think they lost a bunch of Revenue there so I think just hey little bad luck you know unfortunate bounce of the ball there and I feel like connect still is a good opportunity all right here here's my next one all right what else easier Rubik's Cube can you do a Rubik's Cube no I can't I cannot can you you kind of wish you could yeah yeah I mean what we used to do is just take the stickers off you take the stickers off and and then you put them all back in the right place and you can brag that you did it oh okay gotcha you can Al just buy it new and it's done so um what's the easiest party trick you could do like I can juggle can you do anything like that yeah um if I smoke a cigarette I could blow smoke out my ear really I swear to God yeah I've had all these your ear I've had all these surgeries in my ear and so like some pipes got rerouted and I used to be able to blow smoke out my ear dude how do we not start every podcast with that come on sandbagging us we would be at 400,000 subscribers but solving a Rubik's Cube is a close second though all right easier Rubik's Cube so I think Rubik's Cube fun little idea it's kind of like a fidget spinner anyways the way that the Rubik's Cube feels however too hard way too hard and we get it if you could do a Rubik's Cube that's fantastic that's chess where's Checkers I need a Checkers of Rubik's cubes and so um here's what I'm thinking letters on the outside and it's kind of like wle wle is a very fun game simple game you play every day you could build a daily habit I think somebody needs to take the concept of wle but put it in the form factor of a Rubik's Cube where every day you get a notification on your phone or there's a website that posts the starting letter combination and then you got to rotate it to make the word and it should take like five minutes it's like you know do you play the New York Times mini crossword no do you every day this thing's amazing it's such a fun it's 60 it's a literally like a 60-second break it's a game it's a cross word crosswords are kind of fun but a real cross cross is pretty hard and timec consuming and the when New York Times made this mini it that thing dri like millions of dollars like it's like I don't know 10% of New York times's Revenue comes from this little game app and it's mostly the New York Times mini crossword this thing is an absolute hit product all right I have two more candle pouring kits so another thing that is highly tactile highly satisfying leaves you with a result a candle um candle pouring is something I see a lot on Tik Tok I don't know exactly how it goes or how it works but I'm pretty sure this could be another like adult crap arts and crafts relaxation thing that that is accessible to many and results in you actually having something that's not just clutter and junk in your house because you could just light the candle use it melt it down and then you're done so I think a candle pouring kit uh company could do pretty well dude I'm in on that one because you'd want to buy one you you'd want to continually buy them if you got into it right um yeah and candles make a ton of money like go look at the candle mlms uh if you want to know what products work go look at what mlms work and work backwards from there so there are several multi-level marketing schemes that are based around candles which tells me there's a giant market for candles tell me one more and then I want to blow your mind with the Lego Story okay um I'm now seeing what I wrote here and I have no idea what this means so I'm G to just take this as a uh as a blank canvas for myself relaxation puddle I don't know what I meant when I wrote this this is late last night um I think what I oh I think what this is is like my kids uh one of the things you do with kids is you give them something called like sensory play so you buy this like box and you put in like Orbeez or you put in these like gel Circle things you put your hand in it's kind of this cool sensation it's like it's like very cold you they're like these like balls that you can kind of like you know um you can touch and feel but they're not like uh it's like slime you know slime's really popular for kids there's like all these things that are very tactile Play-Doh and so you I think what I was thinking here is it's very relaxing saying if you put your hands in this thing what if you could put your whole body in this thing I think is what I was thinking it's more like those uh those uh sensory deprivation tanks that people like to do in San Francisco uh and maybe other places as well I'm not sure but something you could just go lay in and it's like a super nap is really where my head was going I'm trying to yes and you but it's really hard when the premise is a relaxation puddle dude the word puddle is so underrated actually sounds great uh has all kinds of jokes and commentation very memeable word and I think that's what you want with any of these you want the idea to be so stupid that you get memed into popularity you understand what I'm saying here yeah here what you're gonna do you're gonna do it it's gonna sound ridiculous and 95% of America wants to make fun of you but then that those articles go out those memes go out and then 5% of people are like I don't know I'd try it right like you remember when that thing happened that like guys were lay on their back and they were like suntanning their butthole and they're like yeah that's the new thing I don't even think that was a thing but I think there was someone behind that that was like you know what we'll get written up everywhere automatically overnight if I say that this is a thing I've got this friend Chris who would send me so many photos of you just see his legs like as if he's not very clothed with his legs in the air and he's like just say his last name he deserves it for doing that just being healthy uh like Crocs are like this right they're intentionally ugly they're intentionally so ugly you have to talk about them and the design like stands out in a not so good way but the result of it is that uh you know gets talked about yeah like you just got to figure out what the [ __ ] a relaxation puddle is first you're just starting with the word let me tell you two crazy stories the second one is in particularly crazy and I think you're actually going to dig it because it it's going to revolve around your world so I'm a Lego fan I like doing Legos now it's my new thing there's this website called rebrickable so rebrickable is this amazing website it was clearly started by an engineer I think his name is I actually don't know what the guy's name is who started it Nathan I think his name is Nathan so Nathan was uh uh just an engineer at some company normal job in Australia he started this website that he it's actually quite complicated and what you do there there's tens of thousands of Lego kits you know and it's been around for a 100 years so there's probably hundreds of thousands of different types of Lego kits kits you tell it what type of Lego sets you have and then other designers so people who are Lego fans have created directions on how to build their own Creations it's called anoc My Own creation and it's a whole community of people who build moc's and he has roughly 30,000 people who have uploaded a variety of moc's that you can buy from $10 probably all the way up to $100 and what's interesting about this guy there's so many crazy business implications here but what's interesting about this guy is a he's an engineer and the the the people who listen to this podcast there's a bunch of Engineers out there there's a huge overlap of Ben diagram of Lego enthusiasts and this guy adds a third circle to that Ben diagram of business people and so basically it had he reveals all of his stats online and you could go to his blog and you could see it he started this company I think in 2010 and it was just a project I looked at his LinkedIn he worked as a full-time per uh had a full-time job since 20 uh until 2020 and he WR reveals every year how much page views that the website has had how many registered users it's had how many people are selling products on there so it's basically a Marketplace and so in 2023 he had 11 million users create an account on his website which is wow which is huge and so if you account for let's say 3% of people buy something that's 330,000 people or sales who bought an m so someone's directions on building something say the average sale is about 15 bucks that's about $5 million in Revenue that is uh collected and of course he gives a lot to most of it to the designer but there's people who have whole like stores on the website and it's really fascinating and his page views last year 2023 were around 160 million page views and if you look at his website he blogs every year and he says what his stats are how many page viws he's had he has and it's a very interesting blog to read because a he's being transparent about the business and B you could see how to build like a rabid community so on his blog and it's clearly a self-built Blog he's not even using Wordpress he built everything from scratch you'll see the comments saying I love this community I'm So Into uh rebrickable like Nathan you're the man like people are are rabid about this uh Niche it's incredibly fascinating and this type of guy I'm just going to stereotype him he's not a business savvy person or at least he doesn't want to be like he's not out there trying to milk this dry and make as much money as possible but this type of business that he has once you get users to a passionate following like this to your website you can sell them anything and so what Andrew Wilkinson calls us is an airport business so once you're there well while you're here we could sell you this we could sell you that it's people are here to learn and they're ready to buy and the reason why this is fascinating is because with Legos you know they cost hundreds of dollar sometimes and you want to buy a new one every month every couple months and so the market is actually quite big to build a big business this is like a a type of company that if you wanted to be a PE guy which I don't think you should because this is like a work of art to me but if you wanted to be a PE guy and buy a business that you could milk for tons of profit and you don't actually have to do that much Innovation this is one of those websites dude what a great find this is such a cool cool business yeah 10 million users and by the way look at this I looked I went to top designers we got to put this on the screen so that our 399,000 YouTube subscribers can see this the Chinese restaurant this thing is insane this is insane who who made this up this is so crazy this this is insane and the technology to build this stuff is amazing because a you could just buy anoc from someone and they'll tell you what parts or kits that you need and they they'll sell them or you could there's this like crazy algorithm that they have where you upload hundreds of different kits that you have and then you click like submit and then you see like a wheels turning and it takes like 60 seconds as if it's like doing heavy like calculations and then it'll give you a huge list of hundreds or thousands of different's that others have uploaded that you can create with the parts that you have and it'll say you have 100% of the parts need for this or you have 50% of the parts here's the other 50% that you have you can buy them here it's really fascinating and it's quite complicated I would imagine to build that you found like dork Mecca this is great it's the best not only adults doing Legos adults doing Legos who need custom customade Lego like designs this is insane uh yeah this is cool by the way this Chinese restaurant three thou 2,000 pieces 10 bucks for the for theoc what a steal it's amazing and they they there's people I like there's people in the forums saying that they're close to making a full-time living selling their moc's and so when you have a rabid base like this it's crazy fascinating to see what types of businesses you can build now this particular model is very unique to Lego but you could look at what the sneaker heads have done with shoes you know like that was like considered silly a few years ago there was a small group of people and they created marketplaces for it but this is a perfect example of how this is executed well of these Niche followings and going all in on them and building them for the community and what's interesting is check this out so in year one he had uh a million people come to the website so in year one so um so that's 80,000 people a month that's pretty good but it's it's not crazy that's pretty good his paid yous were 11 million and he started that I think in 2015 I said most recently in 2023 he had so he 11 exit so we had 11 million users and 160 million page views and you could see how slowly these types of businesses build and it would be very hard to break this company down this is they have a true moat yeah 100% should we help them with like a marketing slogan maybe dude this guy this guy's this guy's killing it man whatever he's doing I want to be part of it but let me tell you about an even let me tell you an even crazier story this actually should be a movie so there's a website called Bricklink Bricklink was started in two in the year 2000 so one of the you know early early early first website businesses first internet companies so Bricklink it originally started as brick Bay brick Bay the guy who started his name is Dan jesic so you you spelled that last name j zek do me a favor and type in Dan jnik uh on your on your uh Chrome and go to his personal website you see his personal website it looks like a geoc city uh website is he dead why is like he dead he's dead okay so let me tell you this story so Dan started he Dan was a was he they didn't explicitly say this but it sort of sounded like he was a hacker type of guy and so he was kind of like a a little bit gray hat where he was the type of guy who probably like would break into like different websites and things like that that's that's the vibe that I got from him but he was fascinated fascinated with Legos and so he built this website called brick Bay it was called brick Bay at the time because he lived in Hawaii on a bay eventually he got sued by eBay they're like you can't use Bay so we changed it to Brick link and he was kind of like reading about him I kind of got Vibes of Ross olrick the guy who started Silk Road it was one guy he was Anonymous and he would blog about all the changes he was making to the website but it was under the name admin he never used his real name and it was just him and he had a handful of volunteer admins who helped him run the site and he ran it like a community and what Bricklink does is you can buy and sell different types of Legos and so the thing about Legos is if you build a thing you don't have any more joy for it sometimes so you can pack it up in the boxes and you could sell it uh and just get a little bit of your money back and then keep going or buy rare or interesting pieces and so he ran this for 10 years and it became a good business however he died tragically no one online actually says how he died we don't know a lot of people suspected a drug overdose but we don't know but he was working on this website full-time 24 hours a day seven days a week it was like a full-time gig when he died his mother imagine like a cute old lady who like bakes cookies that's what his mom looks like and when he died his mom l you know she loved her son and she was so passionate about the community that he made that she was like well I can't let this community go away and so her and her husband uh Dan's stepdad took over the website but because it was just one guy running it they didn't even have the passwords they didn't even know how it was run and so they eventually called the web hosting site or the web hosting service and they're like hey here's what happened can you help us they gave him the passwords and they just spent three years figuring this out and trying to make the community Thrive again it did and the community stepped up and they're like we got to do this for Dan this community is too good we can't let brick uh brick link go away we love buying and selling Legos here and so they run this business for three years and it becomes a good business now Dan dies they're running it three years later a billionaire named Jay Kim bought it have you ever heard of Jay Kim no so Jay Kim if you click his Wikipedia obviously J Jay Kim is not his real name it's uh Jim Kim Jung Jun Jay Kim was basically kind of like the Marcus P Mark Pinkus of Korea so he in the 90s he was early in the internet and he created games and he became the biggest gaming company in Korea then he was a billionaire so he starts this family holding company where he buys a bunch of interesting companies and Bricklink was one of the companies that he loved another one now this is where kind of comes into your your world by the way it says at the time of his death he was the third wealthiest person in all of Korea yeah he's a big deal he's a big deal but J Kim he was like a steward for this website so they basically they didn't change much but one of the reasons why he bought it and one of the things that makes this interesting and I'll read this excerpt from uh from uh basically uh Dan the original Bricklink owner's mom wrote this beautiful tribute so if you go to Dan jes.com wrote this amazing tribute where they show pictures of Dan and him growing up and working on Bricklink so she wrote this amazing thing and I'll read part of it and she said not long before he died he developed an international monetary exchange engine called Bricklink that allowed sellers almost anywhere in the world to sell in their own currency and their customers could buy in their own currency as well and every two hours this system that he that Dan built it would update and so you can buy cross country and or across the world and your currency would automatically be updated and so everyone was getting a fair shape he built that in 2010 which is pretty fascinating and Jay Kim also owns bitstamp have you heard a bitstamp yeah crypto crypto exchange right one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world and so theas why this guy Dan and this whole story is fascinating is there's actually some weird crypto implications here where you see this overlap of like wow what this guy Dan was doing is actually like in the same world of this this whole crypto thing and he was pretty early to it and these Lego fans and if you go to uh Bricklink and see the comments they're all similar it's all a similar type of people and this business Bricklink it's fascinating and oddly Jay Kim also died under mysterious circum ances in his 50s in Hawaii where Dan died and so there's a bunch of like weird things going on with the story but Bricklink is a very fascinating company and most recently Jay Kim after he died Lego the company bought the website and they openly said we bought this website because we want to carry on this tradition we don't want anyone messing with it we don't intend to do too much with it we just want to keep it going because this is for the people wow that's pretty cool very fascinating on on this guy's website on this guy's website it says uh here's a quote from him about what he wants to do after he there's a subject there's a post on the Forum that said was called afterlife question mark who Jak Kim or or Dan uh Dan Dan he goes after I die here and go to heaven this is how I imagine it to be a place where there's infinite amount of bricks and an infinite amount of time to build them with um to build with them uh there would be all kinds of bricks for all themes so that I could get so that when I got bored of building a castle I could move on to a town or a pirate ship ship there would be lots and lots of other Lego Maniacs to share ideas and build with isn't that it's right this so great and if you read this guy Dan if if both Dan and Nathan from the other website they use these just like uh what was his name dread Pirates what what's the Silk Road guy yeah whatever they they it's a Marketplace but it's a weird movement and it's a weird diary and it's like a cult and there's a very particular leader and he is leading the charge it's a really nobody knew his name he was just called admin on he was just ad no one they kind of knew it was Dan but he never like revealed his name and it was just oh admin's doing this and it's just this weird like it all stems from like you know remember like the phone freaks like people who would like hack into um uh pay phones and then there was uh the internet and they were doing things like that now there's crypto like it's this weird chain where it's actually all quite similar it's this weird underground community and so as a business person I see these I see these things and I'm like what other products cost a lot of money have a passionate nerdy following and where you can build a large audience and then eventually sell them ev Everything and Lego fits that perfectly I think there's a few others you've named a few but it's it was actually challenging for me to find other things that were at like this but like sneaker heads are kind of one of them but there's it's just really fascinating how how big I think these businesses can be even though they appear quite Niche oh dude I I forgot Thrill of the shill so first of all the thrill of the shill is one of the chef's kiss best inventions we've had uh and unlike the gentleman's agreement which we kind of stole from somebody else the throw the shill is actually an original but I have a different thing I want to try today are you down for it yes the throw of the show by the way came up literally 30 seconds before we hit record a few weeks ago and we said how do we promote interesting stuff and you were like well we got to tell them valuable content and then hopefully they'll buy whatever we're selling just call it the throw of the show so congratulations let's hear it yeah so that so that was good but now I want to try something different have you ever read this thing that is um like this the famous Hemingway story I'm sure you have because you're a copywriter guy which is the six-word story do you know this about the guy outside holding the the poster board like the baker uh I don't know if it's that exactly but basically there was a challenge which was tell it was a six-word story contest so it was how do you tell a story in six only you only have six words and the the the lore is that they told us to Ernest Hemingway and he came up with the six word story and he won um which was for sale baby shoes never worn six words tells a tells a deep story hits you in the emotions there's another story like that where there's a homeless guy sitting outside and he says uh like I'm blind please help and a a famous copywriter writes he goes let me help you and he goes uh it's spring outside or it's springtime and then I'm blind please help and so I have a six-word challenge six-word Thrill of the shill that I'm I'm gonna hit you with all right so I'm going to do my Heming way I'm going to do this whole ad in six words here we go business for sale owner never hired and it's about this business it's a story about a business that failed and it's up for sale now and then why because the owner never hired he tried to do it all himself and he just never made the key hires that he needed to scale the business because he didn't go to support shepard.com and find amazing talent overseas to hire at a low cost five times less than the United States boom how was my story that was beautiful that was dude the Hemingway one was quite good too that I'm still thinking about that one what is it uh business I shouldn't have put Heming way before my one that I made up one minute ago maybe I should have done the alltime best against mine what was it what was the line uh business for sale owner never hired bu for sale just like the shoes for sale business for sale owner never hired I thought it was good support shepard.com that's the that's the shill the thrill was a beautiful line there we go back to the episode you know the other one that's most like this is fanfiction so watpad reminds me a lot of this where whatpad and there's also another one that's like uh some Wiki it's like a Wiki it's like a Wikipedia But fandom fan uh yeah I think Phantom like bought them or something like that but there's another one that's just straight the Wikipedia part of it um but fanfiction so people get super super super passionate about Harry Potter and about you know different um books and then kind of spin out their own their own world right like uh I remember mugglenet which was started by that guy Emerson sparts and uh you know or spats I don't know I don't know how you say his last name um they built such a huge huge website just around fans of Harry Potter it was very much like you know brick link or whatever and on that I remember I used to go on there and read people because we'd be waiting for the last book to come out and people would write their own versions of that last book and uh they would you know you would just read like a full length book that somebody just wrote in their spare time for fun and that led to some big things like you know 50 Shades of Gray came out of a fanfiction post uh just like that like it was written originally as a fanfiction post around Twilight and so fanfiction and if you people who were surprised that Wattpad was giving like hundreds of millions of visitors every month like one of the most popular websites in the world I think they sold for $ 600 million dollar to a Korean company recently two years ago maybe yeah and they weren't making any money but they weren't making much money but but the the passion and the the usage was there it was off the charts and then you know you don't have to do it much marketing because the people who are passionate about it are going to search the internet for every nook and cranny to find you know other people like who are as fanatical about it as them so there's a few attributes here that I I I'm just thinking about at the top of my head so attribute number one is they seem like jokes at first so like it's kind of silly like almost embarrassing like what do you do for a living oh I run a Lego blog like it seems silly when you talk about it uh at first but if there's enough people it's it could be pretty great the second thing is I actually think I think these types of companies you shouldn't build quickly these are slow bird businesses where you don't want to get too big too fast otherwise the Nerds the passionate ones will be like oh this is lame this is too big too mainstream getting commercial yeah but number three is if you do it right they have huge Moes and they're very very hard to kill get very loyal to them but just like actually New York Times cooking actually had this a few years ago so New York Times cooking is a similar Community like this passionate fans they had a Revolt because uh in their Facebook group someone made a change an admin made a change and they revolted I don't know if you remember this about two or three years ago uh they had 60,000 people in the New York Times cooking they changed something where like you had to get your post approved as opposed to posting on your own a change like that people revolted and so these communities you're basically a steward of the people you're not you're not you're not all the time a dictator you have to be very you have your your fans are temperamental um and so there's pros and cons to these types of companies but I do think they are very very valuable because of how hard they can be to ruin the um do you think not to be self-serving but just real real discussion do you think we can kind of do this I I kind of think that we have the makings of doing something like this but we also might eff It Up by trying to yes grow it too fast so for example one of the best tests I I remember talking to Ben once and uh one of the best tests for will somebody like MFM is this experience do you ever go to a restaurant and then you can't help it but your brain is like trying to calculate the like how much is this restaurant making like you basically start counting the tables and then you count you know you you just count the tables you figure oh this many meals per hour what's our bill our bill is this much okay average ticket is this and you end up with like what's the E of this restaurant and that if you're like that you're probably going to like this podcast it's a very high like you know overlap but being like that is weird right that's not a normal way that people are most people just go to the restaurant they look at the menu they order the food and if you're sitting down with four other people no one elide that table is going to nerd out with you like look how packed this place is like wow how much you think one of these servers is per hour and look how much the meal like you know what I mean no one you're gonna dork out with that but no one be like dude shut the [ __ ] up and just eat your chicken parm exactly and so in the same way that most of the Lego people if they went to school could not find somebody as or they go to in this adult one you go to work you're not going to find people who are trying to build the this 2000piece Chinese restaurant that they bought the blueprint for for $10 like you're not going to find your people there and so you find your people elsewhere you find it on brick Bricklink you find it on rebrickable or whatever um I think for us uh it's the same thing that person who's at that dinner the six people they're at the dinner with your you family your friends they might not want to dork out about it but you find us and the community of people that like this and you're like these are all people who want to know the Eid of the restaurant and so it becomes this like glue and you find your people and I think I've been tempted in the past to try to grow this faster and the things you do to grow it faster are sort of like dilutive you actually sell out a little you sell out a little right like it's the cringey YouTube thumbnail face it's the um you know it's the talking about a topic that might not be the thing you would actually want to dork out about like I like that this episode is basically 90% us Dorking out about these like Niche LEGO websites versus things that might be more mainstream you know talking about the Super bowl next week or whatever but it will attract the right people I I thought the Super Bowl was in November I didn't even know that I that's news to me so uh okay that's one thing the second is like a business principle I saw so somebody said this that I thought was really good they go if you want to build like a a truly a truly strong business build like a reverse funnel I was like oh that's interesting so like I always think of every business as a funnel but I always think about it from top to bottom what do you mean audience first yeah top of the funnel is people who don't know you they they they come to your website for the first time they hear your podcast for the first time they hear about your product for the first time and that's like you know they become aware of you and then they might get interested then they might actually sign up as a user then they might sign up for the paid account and the paid account is always at the bottom and I always just thought of a funnel as top to bottom and with this person was saying was they go yeah you actually want the reverse you want to build as a reverse funnel meaning you want to find like the 10 people who are most interested and passionate about what you're doing to where you know you these are your extreme hardcore users who absolutely love that you're doing this and they will use it every day and give you feedback and they'll annoy you with their feedback they'll tell all their friends their friends won't even listen it doesn't matter and they're your power power users and then you sort of go one rung up and you go to like the next hundred people who care a lot for sure but less than those 10 who are like really nuts and you go to thousand people 10,000 people 100 thousand and you you stack the funnel from the bottoms up is a way to think about building an enduring product because you're really going to find the people who need it the most who love it the most they're going to give you the best feedback to give you to get the product to be uh you know better and you're going to find you know the people who love it versus everybody else who's kind of like oh that's cool um and and I thought oh that's actually a good principle too when it comes to how to build something I don't know when you built Hampton did you did you do that yeah for sure yes how did you think about who the first let's say 10 to 20 people should be how did you decide that so at first I was like let me figure out who wants this most but then I uh I and I had ideas as to who that would be and what I found was I was like wow there's a lot of entrepreneurs in Tennessee Iowa Idaho Delaware some of these forgotten areas that aren't on the coast and I'm shocked at how lonely they are and how much they need this let's go get more of those people and so that's what we did is I didn't I thought it was going to be like cool new York or San Francisco people and turns out it was cool Kentucky guys too but like I just didn't even they weren't even part of my like they weren't even part of my vernacular I wouldn't even have thought about them and so that's what we did I think um with this podcast I think it's good that you and I have other businesses that a pay us money and B can grow faster because there's been very there's been it's been very tempting to try to do things that are inauthentic but we know they will get more views and actually we've done a good job of sticking to like being authentic but this is the this is a very that was a really good point of yours that this podcast as well as the handful of other ones there are like these nerdy things that a small group of people are really passionate about like for example did you see the meetups that people were doing for MFM I was just about to bring that up that's an example the test dude do you know they're still meeting like they're they're still meeting that's exactly right so we thought I guess uh the first mind-blowing thing was oh if me and Sam say we're going to go to some place to do a live show wow we could fill like you know a thousand to 2,000 people in a in a whatever a theater to to come watch us and it's a ton of work what's that it's a ton of work we were both just like all right let's not really do this a pressure and and you know we cool we had the moment where it was felt good but like I don't know if that's what we want to do on an ongoing basis and then somebody came to us forget her name off top my head Rachel Rachel river river and she's like hey our product does this she's like yeah our product is for creators who have a community let your community meet up without you and I was like key word without you love it um and I was like actually that kind of makes sense because again it you know while it feels good to maybe be like you know the center of attention doesn't really feel good and also that's not actually what makes something really valuable but what we'd rather do is use our content as a magnet as a Honeypot to bring in the cool guy from Kentucky and the cool girl from Illinois who they all do the restaurant thing where they start calculating restaurant revenues when when they walk into a restaurant and get them together because they're going to hit it off but it'd be hard for them to find each other and so if all we serve as is basically the finding function for those people to meet and what's cool is that they did the first Meetup but then now they've just been meeting on a monthly basis that tells me that we did something right I don't know we didn't intend to do that to be very clear like that was not none of this was intentional but that that means something went right I facetimed a few of them like they was like Hey we're doing this thing I was like all right cool I'll FaceTime and just say hi and there was people and by the way we we have like there's no like monetary thing I think it's completely free if you Google MFM and then River Meetup you'll see like the landing page I talked to people they were like yeah I drove six hours to come to this one because I'm looking for a husband or a wife like I want to meet someone who has these similar values that for some reason MFM is a proxy for uh and so I thought that was like super fascinating and they told me they go oh we're still actually doing monthly meetings because we just want to hang out with other dorks like us and I thought that was awesome by the way our our what my tagline for people that will like this is just business business nerds with a sense of humor that's the whole thing if you're a business nerd like meaning like you do business but you also in addition to the business you run you actually kind of nerd out about more business stuff you can't can't really get enough it doesn't feel like work to you to think about business or to read about businesses or learn more business stuff and then with a sense of humor because there's probably people that are you know more experienced than us that share more tactical stuff that are um you know whatever they're smart or better they're more to the point but I think the one thing we do is we try to we have a lot of fun while we do this and that rubs off and so that's the the capture of like who is the audience for us so we just dorked out on like Niche Niche passionate things I think that um this Lego [ __ ] is crazy fascinating um you'll have to go to the Dan jic site Dan jes.com just to look at this and maybe you guys will dork out over uh over this like I did and by the way if you made it this far into the Pod you're definitely one of these nerds just go ahead this is my one sellout go ahead and click subscribe on the YouTube page because you made it this far and you can actually make fun of us in the comments or let us know what you think about this Niche stuff I have one more quick one that's like kind of in the theme of kid stuff games toys have you seen the thing called pal world I know you're not a gamer but do do you know about this no what is pal World pal world is currently like the most popular PC game in the world and it came out of nowhere tell me what steam I still don't I don't understand exactly what steam is steam is like an app store but for computers the company that makes Counterstrike they in order to let people come download the new version of Counterstrike and buy it they created steam it's like a store to sell counter you know sell Counterstrike but it also sold all the other games right so now anybody can list their thing there but I can't do it on Apple well no because you're playing on a you know a razor PC or something like that so what do you need to the Apple App Store for right that's not going to work um so it's the Apple App Store but for computer games um and huge by the way like multi-billion dollar product so the number one game on Steam right now is pal World pal World in like like seven days has done 200 million in Revenue when games hit they hit like none other and by the way this thing was made like on a $10,000 budget so it was like a very very lowcost game what's interesting about this right so the game is basically uh the game to me the reason I wanted to bring this up not because I I I'm not even playing the game it's not like you play games so we don't have a lot to talk about here but I do think it's an example of the midwit meme strikes again and this is basically that the best ideas the absolute best ideas are simple and they're not just simple they're simple to the point of sounding dumb okay so simple to the point of sounding dumb what does that mean so uh to me this is uh let's see simple to the point of sounding dumb is Snapchat the next big social app it wasn't started as this like Grand intellectual theory on the future of of communication it was like What if you could send someone a picture that would like disappear in 10 seconds nudes College nudes right and people are like what would you do with that I don't know stupid [ __ ] why stupid [ __ ] because it's going to disappear in 10 seconds so I have no no filter right and then after the fact it becomes this thing that people intellectualize and they're like well see the thing is that um you know impermanence is actually the greatest form of permanence like what what are you talking about and uh and people start to get intellectual about it but that's not where the best ideas come from the best ideas come from really really simple things that can be described in just a couple words words pal world if you go look at this game what's the game the game is Pokemon with guns it's like what it's like yes and then literally the CEO he he says this he goes I'm not a Visionary I I don't know how to do that um I just try to make whatever people want and I knew that uh Pokemon yeah he didn't say Pokemon because he doesn't want to get sued but he's like yeah I had this idea of like you know you could run around and capture these little monsters but then we added guns because you know Americans love to shoot things that's insane that was like the the core idea and he was like they're like so why you know what was the decision to do this art style he's like oh I didn't even want to do that actually I wanted to do like cool 3D thing but I didn't even know that to do that you have to have like an animation rig and all this stuff he's like so I made one and I was like God that was hard I there's no way we could do this with like 10,000 characters like impossible um he's like so we had this artist that we had rejected and then we like hired her later and they're like oh oh they're like what you know what did you tell her to do she like I don't know like whatever our programmer could make like that was her mandate they're like what was your budget he's like I don't know we had like $10,000 but um we didn't really set a budget he's like you know I guess if we needed more I would have probably just gone and borrowed some more they're like tell us about the developers on your team he's like one of my developers is a guy I met like at a convenience store this kid he's like a teenager but like he told me he could code so I told him to come by and you know he works on the game he's pretty critical for the game so the founder has written this like really amazing blog post where he like explains everything that you're talking about and he's like he's kind of he's like a [ __ ] in the best possible way and he's like he basically says he goes this game shouldn't even exist uh it's the inis of proper game development and he says um he goes we had no budget uh No Sa company would ever start developing a game without a budget but pocket pair which is the developer is not a sane company and he just talks about so I started asking myself what's the budget when the balance of our bank account reached zero we could always just borrow money or release money just before the company went bankrupt we had about two years to Runway and I decided just to keep working without stressing about budget because all I was worried about was getting the game done as fast as possible and he's like quite not like a corporate Ste CEO this is like pretty awesome he's in Japan is this a Japanese guy uh yeah it's a Japanese game he basically made some money in crypto and then took the crypto money and was like all right I'm gonna start a game studio with this even though he kind of wasn't like you know equipped to do that um like right now on Steam it's the number one game that right now as we're recording this there're was over 1 million people concurrently playing the game right now in this second um like the highest was two million at a time were playing the game just concurrently it's the number one more than DOTA more than Counter Strike more than pubg more than all of them he was like uh this one lady applied but I didn't think her designs were that good so I rejected her but then she kept three months later she sent me a DM DM and I was so amazed that she was bold enough after I rejected her to keep messaging me so we hired her uh like like he just has like story after Story of like that doesn't make sense so let's do it uh but the meme the mid meme where it's like you know the idiot and the Jedi kind of think the same thing right like just like just make the game as fast as possible right or like you know if you're run out of money just try to get some more um you know what should you make it what if Pokemon had guns that' be cool right it's like versus people who are like you know trying to over overly intellectualize and overanalyze everything and um I just see this trend over over and over and over again I I truly believe did I tell you about the midwit thing I'm trying to do no what I truly believe this midwit meme explains so much of my own life and like I want to see it every day as a reminder to don't overthink it just keep it simple and just what's the obvious answer what's the obvious answer is like it's always there but it gets fogged up by my own stupidity trying to overly over architect things or like want to be an intellectual and so George Mack our friend you you know George he's awesome yeah he's a great dude very interesting thinker and so he had this idea for a like to do a super glossy like coffee table book high-end but of just like 100 midwit memes and I heard this idea and I was like that's genius I can't wait and so I messaged him and then like months later I was like dude what happened to the book and he's like oh well I didn't want to do it because you know um you know I was gonna have to do 365 his original thing was 365 like one a day 365 midwit memes he's like I didn't know I get to 365 and I thought well the you know the cost of this might be a little high I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make my money back but then you know he's like really a bestselling book is something that has these attributes and I went and studied all the bestselling books and I I learned all these commonalities between atomic habits and this and this and this and I just sent him the midw beam back after his like thousand-word like what'sapp message and I was like make the book it'll be fun right like that's obvious like just make the just do it it'll be fun who cares like you don't have to do all these things it might lose a little bit of money it's okay right like the people who bu something cool will come with this it's it's no big deal and so I'm trying to convince him to do this uh to do this book with me I'm like let's just make this book it'll take us like two weeks and it'll be fun and like anybody who actually buys this thing is going to be the exact type of person I want in my life just do it do it on your own I'm looking for an excuse to do a project with George because I really like him and also this was his idea so I don't want to steal his idea I want to convince him to do this with me if he if he really refuses I'm gonna say all right can I just do this myself and myself it's Monday day I think this episode goes live on Wednesday I forget when but whenever it goes live give him he has seven days if this doesn't get to do tweet at georgem his uh his his Twitter handle George just tweet at him at just say do it and he he he's gonna have to figure out why everybody's tweeting do it at him and I'm sure he will eventually put two two together and know this is what I'm this is why he needs to do it I uh I enjoyed this episode what do you think yeah this is fun I enjoy Dorking out over this stuff I had a great time do we wrap here is that the pod that's the Pod I feel like I learned something today yeah and I had a great time that's the mid that's the midwit meme of preparing for these things I'm like uh what gets views what what uh what will what will make more money and what will be more fun um all right that's the [Music] pod

so let's do a little public math here let's break a rule he just launched this product he had more demand than he was willing to let in he let in 5,000 people that's 20 million in ARR that he had on day one of launching this [Music] product all right what's up it's me and Sam two guys who you can't live without you know I should really think about what I'm gonna say before I start this I literally just start talking and whatever comes out of my mouth is fine and then also it's 9:00 am for me I you know I wake up I don't talk to anyone from 8 AM to 9: am so these are the first words I say period and that's what came out all right well here we are we both have one Topic in both of our lists which is very very rare that we have overlap here we both have this topic because there's a business that's sold for $500 million that is a badass story and it's called follow-up boss I had never heard of this company before I find out they sell for 500 million in cash tell me about followup B you I think you know more you know how I know about them I know about them for two reasons the biggest reason they're Hampton member and so I saw them post that they had just uh sold man this story is crazy so I had never heard of this company have you never heard of them till today so there's not really a reason why we would have heard of them other than for we're just business nerds but it's a real estate platform so it's a it's a vertical software and so basically the gist of it is that if you are a real estate agent or if you own a company that has multiple real estate agents you get leads from redin Zillow whatever else ideally you get thousands of leads per month as well as you have homes that you're selling and people who are buying homes you have to track them all it's basically kind of what HubSpot or Salesforce does but specifically for real estate agents the guy Dan he started it 12 years ago I think do you know how he started it that's what's fascinating about it I don't know how he started it but but you're right so the the gist of it is it's a niched down CRM so agents get leads they need to follow up with those leads you got to keep track of all those leads so it's a sort of HubSpot for real estate agents just zoomed in zoomed way in on that one Niche um has a pretty insane exit so how did they start it so they what was the final sale $500 million the $400 million uh up front in cash and then another 100 million earnout listen how this guy started his name's Dan he's from Australia but they live in Wyoming now so I guess it's it's technically it's a remote company but they're a Wyoming startup it's got to be one of the bigger Tech exits out of Wyoming man listen to this so he actually went through the foundation do you remember that course like 10 years ago it was like a course to teach you how to start a startup the foundation no I've never heard of that yeah that's what it was called and uh it so it's like their greatest success story I guess now but they he went to this thing and he started just trolling Facebook groups and he was like working a normal job he was a marketer at uh a normal big company and he was like I want to start a company I need some ideas and so he was like well I I've got a buddy in real estate that kind of interests me so I'm so he started joining these Facebook groups for real estate agents and he just started like skimming in all the posts of like what are people complaining about what's like a common thing and he saw this guy complain he's like man I'm paying 500 bucks a month for the software that I hate for tracking all my leads it kind of stinks like how are you guys like tracking your leads and he saw like okay that's interesting and so he partnered with a guy who's a developer a friend of his who's a developer they build an MVP they say that it took them like six six months and they only had one customer paying 150 bucks a month but he said he goes man we built like this interview that I read with him is a few years old so I don't know if it was true till the end but he's like we basically built our entire business on Facebook but not Facebook ads he goes I would just go into all these Facebook groups as the CEO and I would see them talk about like uh hey what's a good platform for this and it wasn't even related to followup web boss which was his software company he was like I was just like being helpful constantly and people would click my Facebook profile and see that I was the CEO of this one platform or this one tech company and then they would click off and buy it and I would call them and become friends with them but he became they found this idea just to trolling Facebook groups and they would see people complain about stuff and he would DM them on Facebook and be like hey I think I'm building a solution for you uh I don't care if you buy it or not but like could you just give me 10 minutes of your time so I can figure out make sure I'm solving the right problem and he did this so often that that's they came up with this idea for this software they bootstrapped the whole company I don't know how much the revenue was the the the only source that I found was uh a source that I don't entirely Trust online but it was like 28 million a year in Revenue less than a 100 employees and a huge exit don't people have to tell you the revenue when you join Hampton don't you just have this can't you just take a peek at the quick Hipp a record here but I would never cite that and so I'm so I just Googled like uh you know follow-up boss revenue and I'm just like what what can I see that's public so so I don't know yeah this this is a um an awesome story and a good example of kind of the niche down uh the niche down zoom in pivot and I think that this is a you know there's many like um business plan blueprints so for example those guys from 37 signals that what they're doing is they just go hey what's a super popular thing but has too many features we're going to make it do less it take up less of your life and that's like an as an example you know hey they email client they're like yeah just it's just going to do these things in this way less features the better less clutter the better and they're doing it again with Once where they're doing software that you only have to pay for one time no monthly recurring right so that their thing is it's the strip down version of X I don't know if you saw I don't know if you saw but the guys who started uh tough to needle came out with a new company did you see this crazy what's it called boring mattress boring mattress so the guys who created T needle they were part of the D Toc you know mattresses were like the poster boy of the D Toc wave that happened where Casper and Tu needle and purple got big raised a bunch of money burned a bunch of money kind of didn't have a great exit so these guys came back and now it's just boring. Co is the name of their website it's like this is a plain mattress our friends told us that we should tell you about all the cool benefits features that will make this quote different and quote sellable but we're not convinced we don't think he'll fall for that so here's just a really good mattress that'll last you a while No Frills and it's only $400 right or it's like it's cheap yeah 500 bucks and so that's their new thing and so there's that's one blueprint in a business is to do the same thing with less less Frills actually like you know brand less of a brand uh pump or or less features that you needed to to to use Trello is a good example of this uh all productivity apps had more and more and more features Trello was like Hey we're just G to have less features right it's just the equivalent of index cards on the internet that you can move around all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out the description all right now back to MFM there's actually another takeaway here though which is how long so you started an e-commerce company how long until you hit your first 100,000 in Revenue per month like three months probably okay uh you're involved in Shephard uh how long do you think it took them to hit their first 100,000 in in Revenue I have no idea I'm gonna guess six months yeah quick okay six months so we're talking months uh Hampton took uh a short amount of time months as well uh the hustle I think it took nine months do you know how long it took followup boss to get to 100 million in revenue or uh sorry 100,000 in monthly uh well you said they had one customer for 150 bucks like hanging by a thread for a while so is it more than a year to get to that first Milestone four years years four years four years to get to so I I was reading this interview with them it took him four years and they had 11 employees and they're at 100,000 in in monthly Revenue they say they they said around ,000 so it could have been a little bit more but what's crazy is these software companies so I don't know what their revenue was like I said I think it was between 25 and3 if you just Google like follow-up boss Revenue that's what I saw they sold for 400 to uh well potentially 500 400 upfront what's crazy is these software companies we you and I both have this thing where we want to go fast we need to learn and have a little bit of this attitude I got z% of this you are more of a stick to it kind of guy do you think I mean if you're under 100,000 in Revenue four years in are you doing this still it's hard so like all right so I have an audience now so do you think do you think you could have stuck with it it depends where I was in life if I was if it was 26 year old Sam 50% chance if it's where I am now I would say 5% chance it's it would be really hard it would be going into those meetings and be like all right guys we're gonna review the metrics today uh ear Buffs everybody we're gonna say the revenue number and then everybody has to do this and then I say we're at or 42,000 in year four and then like all right but but there's other things to be excited about but we talked to dares about this and darash is pretty uh he's pretty lowkey about it he's like it took forever in reality darash HubSpot darash is the founder of HubSpot HubSpot I think grew like actually a lot faster but he was like man the first like six years we only got to like four million or something I forget exactly what he said but he like conveyed the idea where he's like it's a slog at first at that time things just grew slower now things grow much faster right the benchmarks and the expectations are way different but you have to have faith and of course we're talking about the one that worked uh and there's a lot there's so many more that don't work but like to have that faith of like this can work and to stick to it for 10 11 12 years it if you have the right you know metrics this pays off this these software companies are so much cooler than what we typically start so I did a I remember many years ago I did a fire side chat with Michael Burch who was at the time was you know my mentor he was my boss uh he's a guy who's built four or five super successful internet companies that scaled millions of users he's basically a billionaire at this point in Silicon Valley and a bunch of entrepreneurs came over and they were asking questions one of the questions they asked was how do you know when to Pivot or persevere meaning you hear the stories about follow-up boss or Pinterest where it's like there was it was not taking off for a while and and then you know they stuck with it and then it did did pictures take a long time pictures took a long time um like the graph was you know not like some explosive social app at the beginning and um and so they and I I turned to him because I was like I want to know this answer too this is like this is I want to know what is the guy who's done it in Silicon Valley what does he what does he say and he goes this is the hardest question for any entrepreneur and is deeply personal and situational he goes for every you know one story you hear of a Pinterest that just keeps going after 12 months even though there's no signs of life you know there's a hundred people that did that and failed and you just never hear they don't get to talk at the conference right so he's like it's super hard because you have this survivorship bias to know which story should you listen to and so he's like he's like this is the one where there's no real advice you can get from somebody else the one thing that we figured out at our company was like we would set a time box we think we can hit this Milestone by this date and setting that time box is really important because it keeps you honest up front when you're super optimistic all right let's say something then we think that in the first uh like I I set one for this new company I haven't I haven't announced it yet on the Pod but I set one I said I think we can get to 500,000 ARR in the first 60 days so I think we get to 500k um of Revenue in the first 60 days and I set that now if we don't hit that doesn't mean I'm gonna like throw in the towel or shut it down it meant like but maybe no me you never know life's on the line for these companies no but but the reality is you set that so that you have to have a conversation about why you didn't hit your expectations what did what were you wrong about or what assumption did you have that was incorrect because it might be a fatal assumption or might just be oh I was just I underestimated how long it takes to do X and that's okay you could have that conversation the the thing we did uh when I worked with Michael was we asked a question what metric gives us the most Faith so what metric worries us the most and what metric gives us the most Faith so let's say four years in we don't have a million or we don't have 100,000 in Revenue that's the one that worries us the most we have very little Revenue okay but what gives us the most fi it's well of the 52 customers we do have they love it and nobody's churning right then it's like oh okay what can I hang my hat on to give myself the excuse to keep going and so I think that's a useful question to ask if you if you don't know whether I should pivot or persevere I think what metric is giving me the most faith and what metric is keeping me up at night and then you can almost kind of weigh the two against each other um you know if the thing that's giving you faith is like yeah that one guy told me he lik it it's like H that's not a very strong counter punch to the fact that the evidence on your revenue and usage side is pretty low but it feels horrible when you're in it so I posted a link in our MDB document okay so it goes to a tech crunch if you I remember it goes to Tech crunch article but I remember when we were running the hustle I looked up to B there there weren't that many media companies to look up to and so I really looked up to Business Insider and the reason I liked it was Henry BL was fairly transparent about their traffics and so Henry blet they wrote an article it looks like uh maybe six years into the company and he made a funny joke he's like we Eed out a net profit of $2,100 on revenues of 4.8 million uh it's basically enough to buy a MacBook Pro and uh and he reveals their traffic and you see that it looks like this nice like Arc where it's like or this nice graph where it's like exponentially going up but it I remember when I was running the hustle I was like well their graph looked amazing like it looked amazing but then I zoomed in on this picture and you could see that it's broken down by month and if you really focus on it what you could see is basically February of 09 they hit an all-time high and then they didn't surpass that until something like December of 09 so basically for the whole year the for 10 months yeah the whole year which I think they it looks like they started in ' 07 so for 10 months two years into the company the monthly traffic which for a site like Business Insider that's how they would gauge if they're doing a good job it basically either went down or didn't go up and when you do that every single day every single week for 10 months it feels miserable and then you zoom out and you like see like okay well it has gone up but these graphs are never a smooth going up and a lot of times sometimes I imagine for two years it'll be pretty three years for Years it'll be and then after a while it starts picking up if you do a handful of things right but that requires extreme faith and it's very very very hard to manage your emotions every day when it's like that I totally agree this is a uh Tony Robin said this thing he goes the number one choke point of any business is the psychology of the owner like every problem you think your business has if you do the root cause analysis it goes right back up to the root to the psychology of the of the owner right let's say uh oh we're not growing fast enough why because um you know we don't have uh our paid acquisition sucks why why because we the guy who's running a p acquisition has been doing it for six months in his life you don't have somebody experience why because we're not hiring the right people why because our owner hasn't made that a priority and isn't willing to spend money right or or is afraid to spend money on on talent and so everything just goes back to the psychology of the owner which is both empowering but also I think scary for some people the empowering part is it's in your control the scary part is it's my fault and it goes back you could also like go back to like what inefficiencies or uh like where does the owner or CEO where do they like suck so like for example I remember at the hustle I was always fearful of overspending and so I was cheap about and I was actually overly cheap and when there there was times when Facebook ads opened up it's like dude we got to spend more here looking back I should have spent way more but I didn't because I was being too cheap and like why am I cheap well because of all this other that I experienced in life and so like it's basically like what do they say like uh a person with money is they it's just going to like magnify the things that the traits that they already have or or like you always say that with people when they're drunk like oh your the true feelings are just going to come out right it's B the same thing is with running a company and you got to like master that inner game and it's really hard yeah for sure let's do another one um I want to talk about um let's do you have this one Peter levels is insane tell me the Peter levels is insane one that's a good headline I love this guy so Peter levels we had in the Pod I think we've only had him once but he's got an open invitation if he wants to come on again so Peter levels we both love him he uh has like four or five different businesses that he runs I think he's by himself doing it collectively his businesses probably do two million a year in sales and he's super transparent about all of it so he puts his Revenue in his bio on his uh Twitter he shares everything really fascinating thoughtful guy did you see what he did with his stock portfolio so he basically so click that tweet and you'll see it but he basically created a Google sheet and he you can kind of I don't he doesn't explicitly say it but you could do the math he says uh here's how much my stock portfolio made me um and it was up 32% so you can kind of like just do basic algebra and figure out how much he has in his portfolio and he reveals every holding that he has and I think that a I'm happy he is doing this B I would never ever do this though like it's this is like his transparency is wild but it's super fascinating to see what this guy is doing when it comes to like sharing his numbers uh out in public it's pretty pretty fascinating I got to say two things about Peter so uh first Peter come back on the Pod we miss you uh you've done a bunch of interesting stuff this plus your new AI stuff that we didn't talk about yet so I want to do that second we've had a bunch of people on this podcast some that have big names some that have you know big uh big track records or billionaires or built this hundred billion dollar company or whatever nobody body and I mean nobody has a higher approval rating amongst entrepreneurs on the internet than Peter levels have you ever met anybody that is not a fan of Peter levels I've had billionaire friends like or Associates in in a in a conversation and they'll go that guy's doing it right Everyone likes this guy put this guy's profile picture up on the on the screen go go to YouTube and just look at this guy's profile picture this is your personal branding seminar look at this guy's picture it's him on a couch in the like International pose of like guy scheming on the internet just messing around having fun on the Internet by himself he's on a couch half of his body's dangling off he's got his laptop he's no wearing no shirt he's got his laptop up on a pillow because you know the laptop starts to just Scorch you after a while and he's at this messed up angle his neck's all messed up well you know this guy is a oneman band just having fun and I this is why you're right CEOs of like you know major companies are like that guy that guy's doing it right because everybody is jealous of being able to be this guy a guy who's just one man in a laptop travels around the world builds projects whatever he wants for fun he builds cool stuff like an artist that um whatever he builds tends to have some some juice behind it because he's a very creative guy um he's had many failures but who cares and he's got a bunch of successes he's very open about them he's not trying to sell you anything Peter levels is a hero amongst makers and nobody I I will contend this nobody has a higher approval rating on the internet amongst entrepreneurs than Peter levels he's great man he's great and I think on this podcast a lot of people like oh you're talking about just big companies too often or whatever and it's like we always reiterate this is like we like people who carve their path and that path could lead to a huge exit it could lead to something really small like uh just you could just be a great artist it doesn't matter if it's a big money thing or not and Peter level is the reason why he's so fascinating is he has carved the hardest path and he sticks to it he's very value based really really really cool guy he he did a tweet that goes he goes only four out of the 70 projects I've ever done have made money and grown 95% of everything I ever did failed by hit rates only 5 per. so ship more this has 15,000 likes it is just literally a like a you know like a vs code like a a screenshot of projects that made money and grew four he's got Nomad list remote talk rebase in a YouTube Network this is before his AI I think and then here's all of his lit all of his projects and his stuff like ice cream chat tual litics gift book te Taylor telegram chatbot s startup retreats.com um places to work fire calculator I don't even know what any of these are but each one of these is like you know uh a great week it's like you know a great weekend uh that that was had by by him doing doing these projects you know that Meme where it's like uh babe wake up Shawn Pur just tweet it again or like babe wake up you know like Peter levels bot domain yeah whenever Peter replies to one of my tweets it's like one of those it's like babe wake up Peter just said he liked what I'm doing that's how I feel about this guy really cool guy and I have a theory that people ultimately what what is lacking in most people's lives is um that they don't live life on their own terms and then the way that that expresses itself is uh you have a lot of fun when you're living life on your own terms when you're just doing your not your thing you're doing your thing and if you're doing your thing you're you're having a good time Peter levels that profile picture of him on his couch like all crooked just on his laptop he's doing his thing and I feel like this is honestly it's a bit of why people like this podcast we're not the most prepared or researched or well spoken whatever but people could tell we have fun in our lives that we like we literally just do the that we want to do and we're having a good time and it might be that the things we do are not at all the things you want to do right Sam's like buying a ranch and like you know tipping cows and I don't know what all this you do I don't want to do all that stuff but I can tell that you want to do all that stuff and that's awesome it's great that you want to do all those things you know build your like gym and your Farmhouse and whatever all that good stuff I think that Peter levels is a great example of somebody who's just living life on his own terms and that is one of the most attractive traits that people have in general and it's so funny because what most people do is the exact opposite Peter level has a bunch of influence but when most people try to become influencers they uh you know strip down their personality and try to um appeal to others and and people could sniff that out yeah I I I I just think he's the best and I DM him on a regular basis he replies to me 10% of the time so Peter if this makes it to you come on the Pod man come on come back on what do you got all right uh let's do um so another person who is gone from Zero to Hero Brian Johnson have you seen the t-shirt that he wears lately don't die yeah don't die don't die that's a new that's a new brand you know what I like about it it's the same look as the Austin 316 t-shirts yes I gu should have just done Johnson 316 don't die in fact I might make Johnson 316 don't die shirts because that's who he should become um all right so I was looking the other day because I saw that Brian Johnson finally started to sell something and me and you had made a prediction about six months a year ago we said you know what I don't think Brian's doing this for the money I don't think he's doing this for the fame although he's gonna make a lot of money and I'm sure the fame you know the attention feels good in the moment very obvious prediction very obvious prediction but we said dude is this the greatest pre like pre-launch marketing stunt ever because what he did was he basically turned himself into a character and a lot of people have done this in the fitness Niche but he's not a fitness influencer he he branded himself as a longevity influencer a live forever a don't die influencer and he spent couple million bucks on tests and content and building his brand he came on pods like ours and you could look at Google Trends you could see the interest in Brian Johnson growing over time actually we should map out when our podcast was with him on that Trend because I'm curious where that was and he has built an amazing following and he's doing everything you should do as a as an influencer not that he wants to be an influencer but he's doing everything he should do like I don't know if you've seen his meetups that he's having lately these like runs that he's doing yeah they look awesome they take a people and they chant like don't die and then they like run up a hill there were something like that and then they get at the bottom and they eat like just there's a pot of lentils and they're all eating lentil it's amazing and so he's building his little cult and it's it's a great thing so he came out with his first paid product did you see it it was it it's the meal service right no no no so he came out with like a it's kind of like a meal service it's like basically it's a a part one of his blueprint diet as a you know ready to eat sort of like delivery package I think you pay 330 bucks a month and you get this thing 12,000 people applied wait wait wait but what is it how's it not you you said I you implied I was a little wrong with meal service it is a meal service then but it's just like powder right yeah yeah ex it's not like meal delivery it's not like Blue Apron but it is like you know the supplements and the drink and what whatever it's like some version some skim down version of the um of his like anti-aging protocol got it it's the blueprint self-experimentation study and there's like a level one and there there's going to be a level two level three so there's 67 interventions in this and it looks like there's a couple of powders there's a bottle of olive oil and then there's a bunch of pills I like all those things powders pills powder pills and oils send me up so he um he got 5,000 PE he got 12,000 people to apply 5,000 people paid so so let's do a little public math here let's break a rule he just launched this product he had more demand than he was willing to let in he let in 5,000 people that's 20 million in ARR that he had on day one of launching this produ and 20 million of ARR for a subscription supplements business essentially is like a $200 million business what do you think uh athletic greens is that Revenue wise they they rais at 1.2 billion in valuation 100 150 is my maybe 200 wow Max okay not you know but this is day one day one come out the gate with 20 million and this is he let in less than half of the demand that he had right so he could have been at 40 million If he if he wanted to again I don't think he's doing this for the money but godamn that's a that is an impressive start to a business and it shows that I have this phrase now that I say and my wife doesn't think it's cool and she's the only one I've tried it on but I say this I say all content is now marketing and all marketing is now content and this is what Brian Johnson did he was putting out content it happened to be marketing and that that marketing is now leading to a lot of sales um for his new protocol when you say that to your wife I can just hear the world's loudest eye roll of like she's like shut the up Sean that works on those dorks that listen to you but take out the trash Sean did you warm up the mac and cheese like I asked you to or not yeah are you talking about this is awesome it's sort of like uh have you seen that what's that movie where they talk about the biggest short and Ryan goss's character you know they're like what are you getting out of this Ryan he goes look look listen Vinnie you're getting the ice cream you're getting the nuts you're getting the chocolate syrup you're get the Whi cream and when this works out I'm gonna get the cherry on top that's my feet I just get a little bit of of this that's that's that's what uh Brian Johnson is doing with this business he's doing everything else I think actually just cause because he's a dork and he enjoys this then it just so happened that he got famous and now he's like yeah yeah that's pretty cool okay fine I'll do that too you know and I dig that and isn't it weird like why do you think we have so much trust and faith in this guy it's part of it is because he already has like the fu money and so we think like he doesn't give a he's just doing this just because but the way that he's turned himself in the character is actually really interesting in his case there was a high Bei entry he spent millions of dollars it seems doing this he also kind of lived like a Hermit for two years to like perfect this but the idea of turning yourself into a character and then doing it in front of a lot of people that's actually a really appealing that's an exciting route to go for a lot of people where it's just like you change your identity and you go all in on this and you could actually make an make a great living by doing this it's the same reason I bought shoes from knees over toes guy right I probably never bought shoes from any brand besides Nike in like 20 years and then I see this guy who's over 40 years old dunking a basketball I see what he looked like before he was doing his thing and how he had knee surg Jes undeniable proof is a very very powerful lever this guy literally just does like a somersault then he gets up and dunks the basketball and he's like this 45y old white guy which shoes he came out with like a pair of shoes um that are like you know the knees over toes like thing not great shoes by the way for the record um definitely don't buy V1 of anybody's anything um so so you know it wasn't great but I have a high amount of faith and trust in this guy because again all content at marketing so for two years years he was just putting out free content didn't sell a thing and so for two years all he did was put out very helpful content and showed an undeniable level of proof that this guy was in incredible shape that his legs were super super strong and that you know where he started to where he was is a very powerful transformation so anybody who wants to have that transformation will trust him and then when he comes out with a thing and he says hey this is what I use people will buy it and it's very very effective by the way I also bought knees over toes shoes before he came out with that shoe cup he was always wearing these other shoes and I also bought them I also bought that that white shoe that looks like it'san that's like $70 or something $45 couldn't even really get it on I have like a thick American foot or something like doesn't fit in this like European shoe dude I wore the out of them I love those shoes I like I remember seeing the picture and like Googling like what are those shoes they're not very comfortable they look cool though what are they like fuer or something like that like fugazi or it's like TCH an F I love the fugazi too man they were they were as hell um can I do a quick Thrill The Shield by the way okay go all right so basically at Hampton we've got access to all this data and so in order to grow we decide I love data you know they say data is the new oil I already mentioned I love oil I don't know how to I don't know how to make money off of it yet but somehow oil is good we've been doing these surveys where we survey different Industries and we get benchmarks for different uh different Industries right now we just did one on agencies and so we did this thing where we surveyed 60 agencies they gave us all their revenue all their profit and we did like a this cool survey where we show here's the benchmarks for profit uh per employee Revenue per employee you can find it at if you just go to join hampton.com and then you go to our blog you'll see the surveys we did one on wealth so like people say their net worth how much money they're spending each month how much income they're making each month how much they're working each week we just did one on agency so if you're an agency owner check it out but more so that's that's the shill here's the thrill part I think Sean that if I if I decide to do this have you ever heard of the have you ever I think this could work have you ever heard of like benchmarking like I I I didn't know anything about this industry do you know anything about benchmarking yeah of course I didn't know that people would ever pay for this and so there's the the most common form of benchmarking is salary benchmarking so there's a company called salary.com and then there's like 10 or 20 other ones who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars whatever I think in a couple years if I get enough data I think we could I can spin this off and create a data company where I do benchmarking for different industri and the problem that we'll be solving is let's say that you're an agency let's say you're Ecom business and you're above 50 million in Revenue you want to know are we spending the right amount for ads are we spending the right amount for employees whatever I think we can build a cool Data Business off of this so that's the thrill the shill but I just wanted to call my shot and say maybe eventually I think we're going to do this I don't think it's a calling your shot if you say maybe eventually calling your shot is I'm going to do this that's like it's like the only requirement of calling your shot is to say I'm going to do this not call my shot if I happen to be if I so happen to do this which I probably won't but it kind of work it's like if Babe brood just went like this it's at the point you just went like kind of shrugg like dude also you reminded me of something I don't mean to to rain on your your thrill or your shill here but do you remember have you seen these leaked I'm sure you've seen this because we're both internet like uh what's it called like the people who look for fossils whatever archaeologist yeah um when Mark Zuckerberg had his old like aim messages leaked when he was 19 years old starting Facebook and he Go's like these these effing idiots are actually downloading this here's the transcript he goes he just DM's a friend just because you can't wait to BR he goes yeah so if you ever need anyone if you ever need any info about anyone at Harvard just ask I have over 4,000 emails pictures addresses Social Security numbers his friend goes what how did you manage that people just submitted it I don't know why they quote trust me dumb this is Sam in his slack about Hampton he's like yeah every agency just submitted their profits their revenues their growth tactics they trust me for the record I want to say next Zuck dude dude I want to say I have access to zero of the documents that people uh submit for in order to join Hampton I've got zero access I purposely did this just like for years I purposely didn't ask your name of your Ecom business I just like I don't want to know because I don't want to accidentally say anything I have zero access to this not only because I don't want to say anything and also because I just literally don't know how to you know like use computers and like log in and I don't have a password that was the equivalent of uh you know no obla and glass like oh I got pulled over I don't even speak I don't even know how to use my computer I I can't access this stuff trust me all right let me stop making funny about that let's let's move on let's do another one all right so last year I invested in this company called consensus and they basically it was like an AI company for research for like scientific research so if you wanted to like figure out like um you know instead of like reading individual studies this website would just tell you in aggregate what many studies would show and they were only doing okay there it was basically just two guys and they were still just trying to figure it out like it it was like this sounds interesting but like I don't even know if this is going to work let's see well something happened a few weeks ago that I think is going to change their business but I think it there's an inflection so basically like when the iPhone came out the App Store happened and we heard stories about Pandora so Pandora was a company before they were the music service the App Store came out and they're like oh let's just use our service and pivot and build an app they were one of the first apps that's what made Pandora popular when covid happened there's companies like betterhelp which is like uh uh therapy online or there's like tele medicine because the laws during covid changed where a doctor can prescribe meds cross state lines there's been a lot a bunch of these right now one just happened so I think January 14th so I think it was 10 or January 10th open AI created an App Store they've kind of did done this where they've like made their own like you can make your own GPT and all this other stuff but they' they created an App Store I don't even think they said what the pricing was so with the iPhone app store I think the developer gets what 70% of the revenue Apple gets 30% open AI hasn't even said what that what it's going to be so they're still really early and so this company that I invested in they're like oh well like our thing is going okay but like what if we just like went all in on this like plugin for open AI store and so their version is basically like you just type in you ask it questions medical questions and it just gives you a slightly better answer than open AI but it's a lot better or at least enough that you want to pay for and there's not that traffic right now or not that many new apps in the open AI open AI App Store but this is one of those inflection moments so here's a two more examples so you remember honey that company that was like uh uh what do they do did coupon codes for a website and then grammarly did the same thing they both did that with the Chrome Store you have a bunch of friends because you kind of ran in that world where people did this with with the Facebook uh platform so Zinga I don't know how much money they eventually made but it was at one point a multi-billion dollar company I think right now now we're going to see like a Facebook store you're going to see like all these Mafia Wars all these like weird games I think you had a buddy what was the guy's name Dan who went to Camp FM who started like OMG pop or something like that what was that called Draw Something was the game that everybody played and it I I think he had a multi hundred million doll exit I think this is right now about to happen with the open AI like plug-in store it's really fascinating what's happening I thought this was interesting you asked the guy or somebody asked the the the founder he said I think it's going to be something between like more than the Chrome extension Market but less than the App Store you know shortterm it's awesome for marketing and functionality for users um and open AI is footing the bill on a lot of the compute costs um in the med medium term we have 2X the usage of the next biggest GPT and I think canva is the next so this is the number one GPT yeah yeah it's taking off and these guys they're smart guys but it was still when they were starting their company when we invested it was like uh I don't know hopefully we'll figure it out and there was a time where I was like you guys better figure this out soon like I don't know if this is going to work out and then this inflection happened this change happened dude this product is awesome I just went to their site I didn't do the chat gbt thing but just their app it's really cool so you go there you ask any questions so I just did are microplastics dangerous for humans and then it has all these papers but then you hit synthesize which I think is the credits that you have to buy if you but you start with 23 credits and it says summary we looked at 10 papers the study suggest microplastics are dangerous for humans and they carry toxic chemicals um contaminating ecosystems and are linked to various health issues including cancers and immune system disruptions and then it says we looked at the 14 papers yes was 43% of the time possibly 57% of the time no 0% of the time and that was the like that was the thing and then you could see below each specific paper and it's like tagged like oh this is a rigorous Journal This is highly cited um and you can kind of get AI to Summarize each of those papers this is this is a sick like this is a sick product it's cool and it but by the way just like all great stuff it did not start that way I'm mad you didn't tell me about this this is I why did I invest in this this is great it wasn't obvious by the way it's still not obvious this company just like any any startup it could still totally fail and not work no but it's a very interesting BET right like to do a verticalized Google specifically for scientific papers and AI being the the the why now of what you could do differently than you could do before this makes a lot of sense and it was uh I'll give the shout out it's consensus. apppp that's their website but the point being a consensus is great I think it's actually going to work out and these guys uh they they kind of put their head down for like 24 months and like are really starting to figure out there's going to be a lot of stuff just like them on the chat gbt store because I think when we invested in them I don't remember exactly I'm almost positive the word AI didn't come up one time like it wasn't like it was like we have this like I we know what the outcome that we want to it what we want it to be but we're not entirely sure how we're going to come to that and then they started figuring out AI got more popular and then this chat gbt store opened up and they're like like boom we found the path and I think that path is opened right now now it's more competitive than than the App Store and it's more competitive than Chrome because there's more people who are doing this stuff open AI is already huge but that inflection is happening right now this is one of those things that's happening in real time and I wanted to call out because I think open AI even said we don't even know how what payment terms we're going to give these people like we're they're still all figuring it out but this is happening this second right now there's an opportunity here for a lot of different companies they're like around like you know some celebrity relationship they like oh we don't we don't know we don't want to put a label on it yet we're just we're just exploring each other and figuring out you know who we are together and individually yeah it's definitely trying to figure it out have you seen um perplexity have you used perplexity I don't like it I don't know why people are going nuts for it it's pretty cool it's just like open AI but for some reason it's like has a science bent that's one of these companies I I don't know I don't know much about it I this is a uninformed opinion but I feel like every VC who missed like you can't get into open AI or if you could get in now it's at100 billion doll valuation there's not much money to be made as an investor there and so all the capital you know realized all the investors realized holy this is the big thing and they're like What's the next best competitor and they're like all right uh stable diffusion and perplexity and the next thing and the next thing and they get these super inflated valuations and um I don't know I'm not not really a believer in that I I think those get way ahead of the skis and I just seen that story many times this in crypto this happened in uh you know when mobile when mobile was happening and you would get you know for every Instagram you would then get the 10 superf funded other apps that didn't make any sense and um yeah I would take I would take the under or I would short that uh that uh after the Pod go to your email and type in consensus I'm almost positive that I heard about this company and you were cced on the email just I just want to put that out there I I it was a 20 it was two years ago I'm almost positive the Pod take some lighter fluid pour it over your body light them back and hope no one finds what finds out what happens we're gonna burn it down and hide it do a rant about something so I've had a realization that my world like a lot of the content I'm consuming was algorithmic all right that's pretty obvious you every what does that mean just Twitter Tik Tok whatever yeah everything I was using you'd go to um you go to Twitter it's an algorithm telling you here's the content you need to see you go to Tik Tok algorith Facebook Instagram yes all of that even uh email email is not really algorithmic exactly but it's uh you go there and it's here's what other people want you to to look at here's my problem hey here's my problem readed me right and then same thing same thing with you know all news go to a News website hey here's everybody's problems on the other side of the world here you know pay attention to this I'm calling it The intentional internet which is I started really being intentional about oh no no no no if I'm going on the internet right now what is it that I want to see what is it I'm curious about what is it that I want to learn about and then I go in and I'm stiff arming algorithms left and right uh you know I'm Marshon Lynch on that one run where he just sheds eight Defenders goes all the way and just rumbles to the end zone that's me on the internet now and I think more people should be doing this join me on the intentional internet where you get on and you don't just you're not just uh you know little puppy just eating the puppy child that the algorithms give you go on with some intent and say what is it that I'm looking for I want maybe it's I want certain type of entertainment maybe it's I want a certain type of information or I want to be inspired okay so then go look for the things that will give you that follow that way you follow 13,000 people on on Twitter the trick is you don't go to Twitter right what do you do well Twitter's not a great place for this right because if you go to Twitter you're GNA get your first things you're going to start up is the feed and you're gonna start scrolling what are you g to start reading books that's very unlike you so I make a little list I say you know what curious how this started or I want to learn more about this and then I'll go to YouTube or Google or wherever looking for that but just that adding that little paper step in between me and the internet has been very very useful and I learned a bunch of interesting things the last three days I got more out of the internet so I'm just putting that out there for anybody who what's been on your list I'll give you an example um I was doing research for one thing and I saw this name do you know this guy Eric vanven yes he's amazing I have got him oh wait are you talking about Ricky vanine or Eric uh oh maybe he's Ricky Ricky Van Ricky Facebook guy Facebook dude Dy super dreamy this guy's Drey as I've talked to him a bunch via email a handful times the internet PE budge or something no man this gu's great so this guy created College Humor yeah and then he created um a couple other things so what did he create create college humor and then he he created a few other things like cracked or whatever then he bundled it up sold it to IAC it was running media at IAC and then he you're forgetting the thing they started which one so at College Humor this was like pre- YouTube days they create this was like e-bombs World days they created a better way to host videos yeah and that's what Vimeo is which they sold the IAC IAC spun off and became a billion dollar plus publicly traded company so creates Vimeo creates College Humor goes to IAC IAC is a super interesting company with like a very cool pedigree of people that come out of it like Tinder came out of I um you know there's there's a bunch of really interesting things about I they they're sort of like the co they're the Proctor and Gamble of the internet they're a conglomerate of internet sites mostly media and then match.com I think came out of there now he's head of like create head of like video or head of creative content at Facebook and I was like oh this guy's interesting I kind of just noted it uh because I think I was thinking about college humor and um so I just who who's behind that what are they doing now and I think this this what are they doing now has been one of my threads so I'll I'll think of something that was cool and I'll be like where did they go I haven't heard about their new album what what are they working on and I'll go look at that and that's just a very it's a very useful um way to go look at things so by the way Ricky Ricky ended up marrying and I don't think they're together anymore but like if you just you could just Google like tabloids or whatever he married Allison Williams you know the famous like actress whose father is Brian Williams the famous newscaster and if you Google his name the guy's just like hanging out with like all these celebrities and stuff and he's like seems so cool like this guy's dreamy as strategy Facebook so anyways what what what's my point so I I'm I'm I have a list of cool companies or cool things that were built you know 10 years ago and I'm wondering what are those people doing now College Humor was one of them so I go look at this guy and then I'm like I'm researching Vimeo and I'm looking at him and then I'm like he gave this talk in um 2008 at this media conference and then he comes back again eight years later I don't know if you've ever seen this talk but it's a it's a I mean it gets no views on the internet but for nerds like us who create media and content on the Internet it's very interesting to see what somebody thought in 2008 which is like the iPhone has come out but it hasn't changed the world yet and like literally the presentation he's like yeah kids on their blackberries are not going to be doing XYZ and back then um you know when he created College Humor it became the number one um comedy entertainment site on the internet way bigger than Cartoon Network and all these other like incumbents okay that's interesting then he comes back eight years later and he's like here's what I got right and here's what I got wrong and one of the things he was talking about on it he's like he's like at some point people on the internet will stop leaving the internet like they won't they they'll stop using the internet as a springboard to go onto Netflix or onto get get cast into a TV show or whatever like they'll realize that their YouTube channel is worth more than than those shows and they won't want to leave um to to go do those they W view this as just a stepping stone and that's happened he basically had like four or five predictions about where where the world was going he put up the all the sites like uh Viral Nova and Upworthy and whatnot he's like right now these are the hottest sites in the world their traffic is crushing ours and they're they're getting more traffic than anybody more traffic than God it's like I think all of this is going to zero I think this is highly commoditized and it's not going to work for these reasons it was absolutely correct and so it was very interesting to learn from this guy who's kind of a master at what he does and I've done this before with like um when I looked up all the infomercial Kings so the guys who created like you know proactive that acne uh you know medicine like how did that story happen right but if I just log on the internet and I just take the the the last thing that somebody tweeted or the latest Tik Tok somebody uploaded you know I'm playing defense I'm playing their game not mine right so I'm just trying to have a little bit more intention when I when I when I use the Internet it's you know I'm not the type who's just going to go uh like total digital detox and just not use the internet but when I do use it I'm trying to use it in a bit of a healthier way so Ricky did he he predicted that the viral novas of the world are he predicted it was going to go to zero and they did yeah did I ever tell you the story about my partner Joe in Hampton um and a bunch of other stuff did I tell you a story about little things you've mentioned it before that he got like really the most trafficked Facebook referral right and then he had an offer to sell and he didn't take it or something is that the story so Joe Joe's an amazing entrepreneur so he started his first company it was an adte company he sold it for hundreds of millions of dollars when he was like 25 so he just had this like huge success at a young age then his next business he started was called the I forget exactly what it was called but a pet flow it was a pet food company and they started it before chewy except he was a little conservative and he was like we have to spend money profitably on ads and that's hard to do and so we're going to go a little bit slower chewy comes in and goes n f that we're gonna lose money for the first six or 12 months at a customer and we're going to do such a good job that they're going to come back and Joe was like that's a dumb strategy turns out it was right but in order to make uh pet flow grow he created a Blog where they just wrote content on pets and within a very very very very short amount of time they started getting 10 20 30 million people a month coming to this blog on pets and he's like ah screw that let's just do this blog and So within four years they were the most shared website on Facebook bigger than Viral Nova bigger than BuzzFeed bigger than huffpo all these Publishers that were huge in the 2014 15 era and it started getting something like 250 million uniques a month to their website and they were scaled up I think to 90 million in Revenue in four years it was a huge company I went to I cold emailed him I went to his office he had these Studios and they're like Facebook Liv is the next big thing we just built out this $250,000 studio in the in the Manhattan office and it's going to be the greatest thing ever we have 150 employees it's gonna be the biggest thing ever the problem of course that we all know was Zuck does what Zuck wants and they built this entire company little things.com on the back of Facebook and they got a an Loi to sell the business and they were literally three weeks from selling they were going to sell for hundreds of millions of dollars Facebook puts out this annual report they go we're actually changing we're pivoting from this thing to this thing and three weeks away or something like that from this deal closing for hundreds of millions of dollars the company uh backed out and within six months the business basically laid off everyone and had uh shut down all in a matter of like six or seven months of like we're on top of the world making 100 million a year to now we are not and it's a crazy crazy story if you Google like his name Joe spyer little things you'll see the story uh I think uh Inc just did some big story on it but it's pretty wild ah the lessons we learn unfortunately that's you know that's like uh it's it's cool to be like yeah you learned so much from failure but it's like God sometimes it's so painful yeah he was basically win he posted this publicly he was like I was set to make $50 million and three weeks away from it closing it went away and I he like has Crazy by what's he like to work with because you picked him as your partner for Hampton uh why'd you pick him he's the best man he's the best he's the best he's a harmonious partner he's even Kio he's very easy not like the partnership Dynamics because you've told me about those what is he what's his Edge what's he great at what's what is he like what is he amazing at you ever hang out with Israeli guys and like Israeli guys have a culture of like they're quite competent because they served in the military and they're like really good at stuff oftentimes they're good at spotting opportunities because that's also part of the culture of like just like negotiating well and like finding interesting deals he is so good at spotting opportunities and he's Technical and he's so fast I've never met someone who's like significantly faster than I am at making stuff and going all in and like he'll just find an opportunity he'll build a website for it and he's like Yep this is what I'm doing now and he pounces so fast I've never met someone who moves faster one thing that we did that was so great did you ever have this with Ben or any of your partners where you do like a um you're like look before we like hop in bed and before we get married here let's just sit down and map out what do you want your life to be like what do you want in five years and 10 years what do you want on a day-to-day basis and you like write out like how you want to live what you're willing to uh what you're willing to give up what you're not willing to give up have you ever done that not exactly but you know you told me you did that I think there's a version of that that I do but I'm not I think everything changes uh so you know it sounded really great in theory and I think it's a useful exercise just to clarify your own thoughts but I don't I think people themselves are quite incongruent in general well yeah you change you uh you change but also you don't know what you want and also you say one thing because it sounds good or you think you want it but then something comes you know something comes up and you're you know it's your stated preference versus your revealed preference I think it's very hard to get to people's revealed preferences their true preferences or their true um their true you know desires or whatever and so I think it's a good exercise to do but I don't put as much weight in it as you did I think well I think that I think that a it starts a really good conversation so like look let's be transparent just like you should with like your wife or girlfriend you're like let's talk about like what type of life that we potentially want and let's be very open about that so I think that that like creating that like let just be very clear about and we we'll acknowledge that it will change so I think it creates a great version of that but Joe's also 42 I think he's older than than me and so I would think that at that age he has a little bit of solidified the values that he stands for and so it was helpful I think if I did that exercise when I was 24 it would not have been good in fact I did do that exercise when I was 24 and it sucked I said I wanted you want to know what I said I wanted when I was 24 I said I want 10,000 employees I go wouldn't it be awesome if we had 10,000 employees and then I hired three people and and I'm like went out the window I'm like yeah that's that's know for me dog like that a going to work but so I think if you're a little bit older and you have some experience you might know a little bit more you want but when I was younger no that wouldn't have worked my uh thinking on this is the buffet thing of you want some a partner with energy integrity and intelligence I think that's the like core thing you I look for at least which is basically and in order energy is the easiest to spot and it's the easiest one to try to write off if somebody doesn't have it um meaning seems like a seems like a nice to have it's actually not a nice to have for me it's a must have for me um and so energy is the first one that shows up and it's the easiest one that I've tried to talk myself out of with certain people and that's been a mistake every single time I've done it who have you worked with that's high energy and like almost exhausts you because you're like I can't keep up su's like that uh he's super high energy but not in an exhausting way in a like I get energy from that so it's all good I don't mean exhausting like they wear you out but you're like oh my god dude like you're you're almost hard to keep up you move so fast that's inspiring yeah everybody yeah it's but it's in a good way um like pace and that they bring their own energy to the table I'm not bringing it out of them um Ben is a fun so Ben Levy who's my current business partner on the surface when you meet him he's a more quiet guy he's more reserved he's not like he doesn't come across like this huge booming personality but Ben's got that energy where he just it comes out for him like through text message or through like you know he he'll just wake up and do something or he can't sleep at night because he's thinking about something so energy reveals energy is not just being a wacky flaing arms guy it's do you have the are you driven yourself do you take action quickly do you think about things all the time or are you am I trying to force you to to am I dragging your brain into the conversation and do you get excited about things are you when an opportunity arises does your do you shift gears up so energy is the first one then it's um intelligence or competence which is like what are they great at oh this person's great at selling this person is great at building this person's great at um just pushing the ball forward every day uh whatever it is and then the last one which is integrity is the hardest one to get a feel for which is how's this person going to treat me when they have the opportunity to be selfish will they be selfish when they have the opportunity to be selfish and it's very very hard to know that you can kind of only talk to people they've worked with before or ask them questions and try to see if they're they're pretty honest about that um and then I just work with them on something first before we commit so it's like we have that conversation sure but let's like you know I would always trade an experience for a belief and if I can have an experience working with you on something for three weeks that's going to be way better than me trying to put take a leap of faith on a bunch of things you said or you wrote down in a Google doc did you just make up that word or that phrase Tony Robin special maybe quote Oh I was gonna say that's that's yours now do you uh what how late into the evening are you working on business stuff versus family time or Fitness or whatever else there is um I basically I work out in the middle of the day I work about 2 2 p.m. uh so it's basically like I've done I've done enough where I could stop working I wake up and I work I wake up I do my morning routine then I work and then I take a break to work out and then I'll either just if I've done enough that day I'll just play with my kids I'll start playing with them and just hang out if I if I have it I'll do another hour or two of work and then I do family time till about till they go to bed so they're you know usually fully asleep 8:30 or 9 and then I chill out slash work one of the two they're both kind of the same to me so some sometimes it's just like watching a show sometimes it's working or reading something and I'll do that till 11 or 12 when I go to go to sleep but between that 11 or between kid kids going to sleep and you going to bed are you on the phone talking to people ever no no no that's me time that's uh me on the internet uh I'm not talking to people no I uh I've got a bunch of friends who are like that and they even my wife she'll try to talk and I will be like I'm doing no talking that's my friend I'm doing no talking right now it's a it's a nice way of saying like I don't want to talk to you I'm doing no talking that's it this thing there's like this like unspoken rule at my house where like at 8 or 9 when she wants to like ask me like hey what dates do you want to go uh to this place and I just Mumble I go that means like dude I just shopped at Ikea all day I'm overwhelmed I can't look at anything I'm I can't think don't ask me a date I'm not thinking about anything you know we've been you know what we've been doing lately is like Legos have you ever done Legos I've never done Legos I I have a whole separate pod topic about adult Legos because I think it's a thing and you're one of those so we should talk we should actually do a full segment on it I'm so into it I'm so into it that's all I'll say I am so I just got into it in November I'm a Lego guy now I love it okay we're gonna talk about that next time I gotta jump uh this has been good this is the pod that's the pod that's the [Music] pod [Music]

there was a guy I loaned $1,000 to when I really didn't have it but he needed it more than I did I loaned it to him so I've been for months calling and sending regular mail to him he because he wasn't answering the phone it was no email those days that when I get my mail there's all the bills and there's a handwritten note and I open the note and it's from this guy apologizing to me and telling me that he was so sorry I was there for him when he really needed it and he had not been there for me and he had put in an extra $200 for interest was $1,200 and I just started crying uncontrollably and then I realized wow when I nothing I gave everything and here this is what does this mean I said I don't know what it means but I'm going to decide it means cuz I didn't give to get and I didn't give what was easy that's why I'm receiving I never felt that scarcity again since that day

dude this is a great idea this is why we started this podcast for somebody to come on and say yeah I just built a$1 million dollar Media company but guys smoking Meats is where it's [Music] at what's up we got the Three Amigos of newsletters the short story of Austin is out of college create morning Brew sold it for I think read 75 million so don't you don't have to correct me if I'm wrong but 75 million bucks you still run it hundreds of employees amazing you have a dock here of a bunch of topics yeah someone sent me this deck like last week and I I was like gonna text Sam about this I was like you know what let me wait for the Pod to talk to you guys about this this is a I feel like a my first million special so I've been super excited about a bunch of these postco get out of your house do exciting things that's not go to a bar and just drink I think that's pretty boring and there are a bunch of these in New York I don't know how if they have where you guys live but but they have uh pingpong bars and pull bars and they get more and more uh out there and I was tweeting about this and some guy sent me a deck he goes I got something interesting for you so if if you have your computer look up uh bingo Loco right this guy sends me this this deck for Bingo I'm like what the hell is this right Bingo loo uh it's basically a club meets Bingo right so boozy Bingo performers Fetti showers the the whole thing this looks like a Testo concert or something going on what is this I didn't know people played Bingo off of cruise ships like I thought Bingo was either for old people or cruise ships he sends me his deck I don't want to disclose their numbers but he goes Check out one of our competitors uh Bongo Bingo USA I'm like there's no like there's no way there's a whole industry for for Bingo Raves for Bingo parties dude the websites are exactly the same did they they just copied each other it looks like they're I again he just sent me a deck apparently people in the industry so these Bongo Bingo guys apparently preo were doing 20 million a year in Revenue no way explain this model do they own the place or they're just going in like do it a popup Bingo night at some place no I think they go all it's actually really smart right because what they do is I believe they go for pretty off nights for certain places right so you know so kns were a club or whatever wherever they had these wouldn't be that popular but they still bring that environment right they still use a lot of the infrastructure that these these venues have and they bring it seems like the whole show the confetti showers the performers everything and what I think is interesting is they keep you there with the Bingo right so there's a there's a shuffle boarding place in Brooklyn right they keep you there because you play shuffle board for you know hours and hours and you're just buying drinks and that that's like the the stick that's the hook to get you in and this the same thing game of Bingo I'm sure they have performers mid game they keep you there for seven hours you just buy a bunch of drink so I I thought this one was awesome tickets are $53 right now wow and they sell these out I I guess they must be making money off the boots right I was I was trying to do more research there's not that much information I never heard of it but they must be making their money off of the Boost well look at this ad so I went to their ad Library people of Minneapolis a bingo Rave is coming to Granada Theater March 15th which uh is a couple months out it says after a sing of sold out shows Across America big old Loco it has Minneapolis and its sites and then it's got like this Tik Tok video which literally looks like you're at like a rave and you go there and then that's the know $30 ticket and then there's like a you know what what is this basically there's a host there's music there's confetti there's um you know dance offs link lip sync battles there's a you know there's drinks basically there's alcohol this is like uh the sound it's like that on a website that's the business plan you open up a open up a deck and it just plays that sound I've got four words for you [Laughter] investors I'm sure the margins on this are crazy their costs are some some random performers in in in Bingo again I I I I played Bingo one time on a cruise ship and these guys are making what seems like 20 million bucks a year off off bingo I gota we got to figure out what we can do this next for all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worth and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out the description all right now back to MFM so you make a lot of money at morning Brew doing digital stuff and you just hit send on a little email that's easy kind of kind of easy uh why on Earth do you care about physical stuff that seems way more challenging yeah I don't know if I would ever start something in this space but it's just so fun to go see to go see the way people you know I would never think this would work in a million years I would never think Bingo uh uh own steroids Bingo uh performers would work but I think it's so interesting I love going to these things around the city to try to see how people get people hooked on these things it's so easy to hook people in a newsletter right it's it's content every day it's very different people come back to to play shuffle board or bingo so I I love these I have an idea for one can I pitch you guys one all right so I'm try you know as soon as you set this Bingo thing my brain starts the wheels start turning and Sam you'll appreciate this you like the UFC so I don't know if you remember when Conor McGregor was on his come up uh he was knocking people out he was knocking people out it was the best and this guy everyone's like what can't this guy do because everybody thought whoever the next guy he's fighting that guy's gonna neutralize him with this this and this knocks him out and I remember watching uh one you know ex USC fighter he was doing like an analysis and he's like I'm watching Connor he does all this spinning [ __ ] he does this he does this he's like I think it's all smoking mirrors he goes I think everything is just a distraction because he's trying to land the left hand and he's like you know that's every all this stuff he's throwing he doesn't care what happen happens with it he's just trying to hit you with the left hand to me this is the same business model like the Bingo it's it's like oh you hear about that Bingo business no no no you he about that alcohol business that uses Bingo to get you to the bar so similarly we got to figure out what's going to get people to the bar and get them drinking and so here's my idea I've always wanted to enter one of those eating contests I don't know if you guys have ever done one I've never actually done it but like those places where it's like if you can eat this pizza it's free and like I've always wanted to actually go do it but there's always like this problem where it's like it's like you have to pay $75 to like buy the huge Pizza it might be free but you you know whatever I would love if somebody turn this into like you know if I was in college I would have been all over this if it was like it's it's the contest is who can eat the biggest you know who can eat the most hot dogs or the biggest pizza who could finish it the fastest and you can go enter and you have to bring friends to be kind of your cheering section they're all Rowdy and drinking and cheering you on it's free to play because the pizza's not that expensive but you're going to fill up the bar with like you know whatever hundreds of people who are in the mood to kind of like binge and go extreme because that's kind of the theme of the night in a way it's like sports Meats binge eating well what's the best thing that goes with both those things binge drinking who's with me the only thing you can add is a little bit of gambling you need to have people gamble this is this is like gamble it's like gambling right it's it's it's it's Vegas meets a party so beautiful yes and there Austin I don't know if you've been doing some improv but that was a beautiful yes S I really appreciate that one good riff I follow this guy on YouTube he's called beer meets food and looks like he has uh 3.6 million subscribers have you guys seen this guy he just goes to small restaurants in England that they have like you know uh you get this free if you eat it he eats roughly 10,000 calories in each of the challenges and he Nails all of them like one time he ate like I think it was five pounds of chocolate have you seen this Sean this guy's channel it's the craziest Channel I've ever seen and I watch all videos it's one of the few YouTube channels I subscribe to this guy needs to La launch your food challenge gambling business and there's actually a bunch of these instagramers that you could do this with so uh you know there's that guy who eats the raw meat I think he's called raw meat experiment read his bio read his bio Sean his bio great so 142,000 followers he goes eating raw meat every day until I die from bacteria then it says line two seeing if I live for five days or 500 years and literally he'll just a chunk of ground beef and he just sits outside of a Whole Foods he buys the ground beef and he just eats it raw or he'll just get a chicken breast uncooked and he'll just chew it like it's a you know I don't know like a slim gym or something like that and uh I feel like these there's so many Instagram food mukbang like different variations of this like there's a lot of YouTubers that that do this where they order just an insane amount of food watch me eat and it is entertaining to do I could feel like you could get them to be like kind of guest host promotional to to do these popups I used to um when I worked uh when I moved to San Francisco I didn't have a lot and I would part-time I had like a part-time job and I worked for this guy Joe Garvey he had a company called Clash it stood for California League of Adventure scavenger hunt or something like that it was called Clash SF and he was making seven figures a year and we would host these Citywide uh scavenger hunts and they were the best it was so fun and I got to see some of the like economics of like some of these in-person stuff and I was actually pretty shocked at how great some of these could be it was a lot of work um and then we have another friend Nick Gray did you know Sean that Nick Gray had a business called Museum hack and he eventually sold it and it was doing many many millions in revenue and the way the business worked where was he eventually or at first it was just like gorilla where he was he would like go to I think it was met the the Met uh in um New York it's a free museum and people would pay $50 and he would give them tour of the museum and he would explain the the art and then eventually he hired lots of theater kids to lead these tours and he had them set up in a variety of museums throughout the country and eventually he had a partnership after they like kicked him out a bunch of times and uh he said that business was awesome dude I I love the way he described it too he uses the phrase Renegade Museum tours I just thought that was just a great way to pitch it he's like yeah I my first business I hosted Renegade Museum tours and he doesn't really explain what it is but you try to put it all together and the word Renegade I feel like is is uh underutilized underhyped word I think I'm going to try to try to bring that back into my my everyday uh vocabulary I think they made him I think time out made him the number one uh thing to do in New York and I think that's what blew him up right he blew up and then and then of course he went B to B because that's where the money and all this stuff is Right selling in you sell a consumer for 50 bucks you sell a morning Brew for 20 grand and our HR team just sides off and approves it Austin last time you were here I think we we talked about like the Creator economy and I'm almost certain all three of us were like this is going to fizzle out and has your opinion changed and I know like some things have happened in like the news or the media world that has uh got you excited tell me about that yeah I think uh last time we spoke I remember we were all talking and we're like what's the next milk Road for right milk Road for X we were all talking about that uh and we're like oh AI is popping off let's let's so want you launch the milk Road for AI milk Road for X that just got Sha all all he's all hot man you're you're you're speaking to him perfectly Austin got on the call called me skinny and now he said milk Road for hex X instead of morning Brewer hustle for x and I am this guy's a charmer I love it just trying to Hype you up Sean uh I mean look but there was 10,000 I mean there's beehives growing off the backs of of milk Road for AI and I think the the problem with these business are they their content is not very good they've all grown with these these crazy growth hacks which is great for the you know newsletter ecosystem as a whole but it's not sustainable I think there's there's nowhere Alpha in the the newsletter game everyone talks about everything and I think beehive did for newsletters what Shopify did for e-commerce right e-commerce stores started and people got super pumped they're like you know investors invested it away and then all these businesses because they're like oh Shopify makes it so easy to start an e-com store and that's awesome the problem was they made it too easy to start an e-com store where everyone started e-com store where you have to be either the absolute best or you just can't raise a bunch of money have to be okay with it being like a fine business but everyone's just pouring in again not a ton of money but a ton of people just think oh if I can just create the the milk Road for marketing the milk Road for uh AI I'm gonna have a a milk Road like exit I just I don't know what you guys think but I just don't think these newsletters have a ton of value let me ask you a different question uh you spent a bunch of time in media now how long you been doing this like s eight years something like that coming up on 10 oh my God uh wow incred a third of your life you've spent in the media business I hope you don't spend the next two-thirds of your life on the media business too if you were gonna do something different where would you go let's say media was off the table um what would you do next yeah so I think there are two types of businesses I love I think one is uh you know B2B I think you know we've all built businesses where the ltvs are like 15 bucks that's pretty tough uh I love you know selling significant Enterprise Products the other one is building into passion audiences that's I think where I'd actually go so you know we went to Camp my first Million last year and we met that guy I think his name is Al who's building for Quilters Al Don yeah um I think he does hundreds of millions of Revenue so I think I want want to find a niche there figure out you what is a weird Niche so the one I've been spending a lot of time researching I almost did something here I ended up not doing it is meat smoking I am obsessed with my Trager right d how do you use a Trager you live in an apartment in New York like on your balcony yeah on the I live on the first floor so I I have access to the common space so I don't I don't meat smoke what what even is meat smoking can you just give me that but first dud it's such a pain in the ass it is such a pain in the ass called grilling or it's different than grilling you cook you cook meat at like 200 degrees for like 10 12 hours it's like barbecuing but 10 hours and no fire and they use smoke instead I all my my Jewish friends are into this because you guys grew up eating brisket you got to wait 10 hours to eat and you've got to buy like special like wood chips for it it's a [ __ ] pain in the ass I've Got Friends that will wake up at 4 in the morning to like get their brisket started okay but I'm a Believer anything that's a huge pain in the ass that people do there's like a [ __ ] ton of money there exactly right and so there's a couple big brands in smoking there's trigger right trigger is the one I have and the thing is to Sam's Point you don't just like it's not electricity you just like turn it on and it goes you have to uh it's it's wood pellets right you literally smoke wood pellets and these pellets Trager gets you to buy the ,500 smoker but then also you're spending $50 every time you smoke Meats because you're just furing these pellets and there's a lot of meat smokers uh influencers out there these guys in Nashville guys in Texas and literally it's like how to smoke a ribey how to smoke a brisket and they have tens of millions of views and they're all like kind of sophisticated they have these rug that you put in your Meats but none of them are taking big swings right none of them are build are building the Trager competitor I want to build the Trager or the green EG competitor sell the $1,500 product sell the $50 a month $100 a month pellet and build the next Trager which I think is a multi billion dollar brand dude I'm I'm fired up I'm smoked up right now that was a good pitch and you you seem pretty lit up about that uh why did you not do this this sounds awesome I've been talking to some some meat smoking influencers uh I'm working on it the the the meat smoking boys that's what we'll call them what I like about these guys are they're just so much more downto Earth than these New York City influencers you know it's not like that the the Tik Tock 22-year-olds these are people who just love life they just want to smoke meats and if they can sell a grill even better there's there's this guy have you heard this guy um Jonathan Moses Catz no who's that so he's a he's a woodworking Creator right and he's done kind of what I'm saying but in The Woodworking Niche so what this guy has done he was a big woodworking Creator and he built some tools for and it's cool because obviously he's a woodworker so he can build them himself for his a dude his site his ssite gets so much traffic this guy kills it I bet crushes it right and so I spoke to this guy one time so I don't I don't have you know any Insider information but he crushed it and what he started to do is he started to partner with every other woodworking Creator and said hey look I'm doing you know crushing it for myself selling a bunch of whatever widgets to my audience let me make you your own custom little thing your in your woodworking Niche and I'm going to help you all sell them as well and then we can build a collective store of all our all our products and and Sean if you sell one on behalf of Sam you'll kick him an affiliate this is a big business I bet you he does 50 million a year on so it's called km tools I think right k yeah km tools I bet you this does in the 50 million range yeah I I wouldn't be surprised if it does more dude this is a great idea this is why we started this podcast for somebody to come on and say yeah I just built a100 million Media company but guys smoking Meats is where it's at this is a niche You' never really thinking about there's an opportunity here here's the here's the distribution model we're going to use I'm going to partner with these influencers and then do this kind of affiliate Network and build this competitor this is awesome we're going to call it the meat smoking Jerky Boys and we're going to this this what this this way it allows us a little bit of a lateral expansion into the beef jerky space but we're gonna call it the meat smoking Jerky Boys no dude you know that you know that um that cigarette brand that we we love The Branding of the packaging of Oklahoma smokes yeah I feel like you kind of gotta do a Oklahoma smokes or like a a Nashville Nashville smokes club uh or something like that brought to you by The Jerky Boys and uh you know I think it's all needs to come together into one Mega brand I have not seen this branding this is awesome Oklahoma smokes we're stealing this we're buying the company just to steal The Branding dude they're so good Google like some of the most popular towns in Louisiana and just pick one name that like stands out you know like tupo meats or something I'm just I'm just hoping a big meat smoking influencer Creator listens to this podcast and DMS me on Twitter and goes I'm ready to ride the back Rouge smoke company God there's just so many possibilities here um Austin I know when we started this conversation I didn't even know what smoking beats was but I'm in and hold a little check space for me on this company because I love to be a part of this you know I'm the opposite of an expert adviser here I'm actually GNA be your your in-house beginner and that's how I'm gonna add some value to you dude even Zuck into it remember remember the whole the the Zuck uh meme about uh smoking meats or whatever yeah he loves smoking Meats [Laughter] and you're you're into this I know that for a minute Austin you were talking about how you're like I want to partner with creators because I because like once you can attach with some of these folks you just you kill it is that what you would do I mean for this yeah I think that is still uh it ever it's very popular these days to partner with creators I still think that's the future I still think we're we're scratching the surface you know there's beables and Prime and and everyone talks about those and it's definitely been played out in terms of talking about but I still think ultimately you're going to walk into a liquor store you're going to walk into Target and every brand is going to have a face and Association because why wouldn't it right if there's a brand that could have nobody attached to it or a brand that could have someone attached to it why wouldn't that brand have the built-in distribution of you guys or someone you know more more widely wellknown or or just someone like I just don't see how that doesn't play out and so you know it's it's been done with the the biggest creators I think the real opportunities in the niches Sean how big do you think first of all we don't really have that many like cool interests that you could have like an MFM product in Target like what what are we gonna [ __ ] sell red Solo cups like I don't even know like what what what is there like Tupperware like uh I I don't know like what we could possibly sell be the dumbest thing that would be associated with like a notebook I don't I have no idea but MFM slinkies baby let's go how popular like what's like so bar stool has like the bar stool razor they're in uh uh stores so and they're a way bigger brand than they have frozen pizza they have like other things they have a bunch of stuff how famous do we have to be do you think in order to make a dent into like getting sales at Target so I don't think that famous if you pick the right product I actually think we're past the point or do you become more famous do you get more famous because your shit's in Target like oh my God they're actually in Target I think we're past the point where just spame is going to drive right I think that works for for a few people but I think you actually need to have a great product I think you had them on the Pod you know Danny Austin and uh her husband Jordan yeah Danny's Big but Danny's not as big as some of these other creators but her brand is worth way more than almost every brand out there because it's actually a product that has a need it's not hey we're gonna rip off you know one of the biggest brands on the planet it there's a true it's a great product Oh Sam we could have done hymns or like the trt subscriptions or something like should have said hibs that would have been our move have you ever taken it no is it good I've never taken it either I I've never tried it Austin have you you're younger than we are have you done it no I have not all right guys we know what we're doing next time we hang out yeah doing a podcast we're gonna be playing swords so I think that this is gonna be like the new newsletter thing I think that people looked at febles they looked at Prime and they looked at skims and they're like Creator brand and every Creator is like I need to do a Creator brand and every like former drop shipper is like I just need a Creator and then we win and they're all going to go do this and then they're all gonna wash out there's obviously going to be a few winners because the difference right like what Logan Paul did with prime is so different than what most creators do with their product like that guy a had like actually like a humongous audience took it everywhere built the brand sort of like Brick by Brick oh he's at WrestleMania guess what he's going to [ __ ] the guy over the head with a giant bottle of prime or like you know there's one and it was him and KSI right so they got two huge creators two big markets to pair together to go into this industry you know Mr Beast is like I'm gonna do Feasta but he's not just like hey go guys go buy my chocolate he's like I rebuilt Willy Wonka's chocolate factory for three million dollars and that's how I'm going to launch this thing I'm gonna make the product the content the content is the product there's no line between the two and you know so you know he those worked because the creators really were like actual Entre and partnered with world class operators to pull them off right like we talked about the guys behind prime those guys are monsters right those guys are in their 20s and mega billionaires for a reason have built multiple beverage brands for a reason the guy who built Conor McGregor's whiskey brand was also the guy who did like whatever two other alcohol brands that were multi-billion dollar dollar Brands and they they partnered with him to do proper 12 so and same thing Connor is like mega mega famous and went all the way with the promotion versus other people may not I think the Danny Austin story is good because it was like her real story was like postpartum I was losing hair I was ashamed of it I bought wigs for the last year I've been wearing wigs while I've been an influencer but instead I really wanted to find a product that would work and here's the product here's my before and after and it's like that's like the perfect combination of things you have high margin product you have repeat purchase because people are gonna have they have to keep applying the thing you have a visual before and after and you have a true story around the creators like actual need versus just like a nice to have and you know that is like the you know that's the the yatsi of putting these these together most people are not gonna be able to do that yeah but Austin you could do it you you youve got that operator Gene you could be one of these nerds well the thing is we're we're all doing it in the B2B space right so what we're doing is not is like okay we have one 100th the audience of a Mr Beast or a Logan Paul cool so we need to sell a product that's 100 times more expensive than a bottle of prime right he he sells his for four bucks or whatever we're trying to sell products that cost 4,000 or $40,000 or $400,000 a year by doing B2B software right that's why HubSpot did it with us and I think this is the other thing like Austin you did a thread that was like this is the new thing but it's like dude people have been doing celebrity endorsements forever the difference is that now the celebrities own Equity I'm like oh yeah people can do this wait a minute we did it that's us yeah exactly that's good for their brand right like to to help them sell a product that's worth thousands of dollars right it would be smart of us to do that not the uh the MFM whatever like Target brand nail clippers yeah leg exactly adult Legos yeah and Sam I think really that that is you and Hampton like you really are I mean it's it's a what $8,000 product like I think that is the perfect example you may not be Tony Robbins right you may not be Gary ve or maybe they're the equivalent of like the Logan Paul and B2B but you found a great product and then makes a lot of sense for your brand and your audience and so I yeah I think it's a it's a home run yeah keep Shilling speaking of Tony Robins Austin you know this episode's gonna come out right after the episode with Tony Robbins so uh yeah which is good for Austin I think that's good for Austin no I mean maybe but I I meant to start with this actually so maybe we'll cut this and put it at the beginning but you know when when you start a not to shill Hampton again I hate to do this but when you start a a Hampton session with your your group you you air grievances right everyone say c can you be honest with everyone can you really have a good dialogue and discussion or is there anything you need to get out in the open well clearly we could because I didn't say this but but I I do need to tell everyone that Monday you and I were supposed to talk like one o'clock Sean's like I'm gonna I'm gonna call you Austin I give you a call one o'clock comes by no call two o'clock comes by no call so I text you I'm like Sean what's going on you're like oh I'm prepping for the big you're texted me thanks for the call better and so I'm like Sean what the heck's going on you're like I'm I'm I'm prepping for the big guest I'm like oh Sean's hyping me up like 10 minutes later by the way that was actually Tony Robbins not you yeah so basically like he reached out or someone on his team reached out I had a thing planned and also Sean is like the biggest fan so Sean it was awesome that you got to like just hang out with a guy you admired how was it it was intense is the way I would explain it I mean when I tell you I prepared for for this not only did I basically spend every waking moment for two days just like PR preparing for this thing which I never do for podcast um I've also kind of been preparing for 10 years because I follow the guy and I'm a big fan of what he's I've been to three of his seminars like right I know a lot and there's there's kind of a curse of knowing too much going in and so like meeting your Heroes type of thing yeah it's like you want it to go well so bad it's almost like you squeeze the like don't don't squeeze the bar of soap too hard it just squirts out like if you if you want it to go so well it's going to [ __ ] out I'll tell you guys the the funny part so like interesting analogy interesting analogy it's not the bar of soap analogy you thought I was going to do I took The Road Less Traveled there so so we're getting ready for the podt it's me and Ari were sitting there and his team's like you know team is like swarming the computer setup they're like Tony will be here shortly uh you know just everything's okay and I'm like all right sweet I never get here early you know I'm like chronically late but for this one 20 minutes early so I'm sitting there for like 10 minutes and I could just feel myself getting cold I'm like like oh no I can't just sit here and I was like I got to use the [ __ ] Tony teaches you you got to be in state you want to have a Peak Performance you got to be in a peak state of course right athletes do that well guess what what's one step down from an athlete a musician what's 25 steps down from that a podcaster and so I got up and I start doing my like Tony Robbins power move where I'm like I'm basically doing this like really dorky like midback stretch to like you know unlock my [ __ ] chakras or something like that try to get some energy flowing and then I just hear Hello and it's Tony Robbins I'm like rush back to my desk like oh hey yeah sorry you're just staring at my chair there as I was doing like you know Tony Robin stretches in the corner Trying To Get Hype for this he just hears like offscreen Sean saying like I'm the man who's the man I'm the man I'm the man even better I'm visualizing thanks Tony I had a good time too you want my number let me get it for you I'm I'm working backwards from the desired end State just like you just me but he hears it off off off camera and and it went well it I mean I'm not gonna give away too much but let me just say this tears were shed and they weren't mine and if there's one mark of a successful Tony like life accomplishment I wouldn't say he cried wouldn't say what but he you know teared up and so you know I thought that that was a you know a good thing but it's really hard to interview somebody who is a stage performer like Sam you must feel like this sometimes when I'm just monologuing monologuing monologuing like right now he's on he's like a next level at that and it's all good stuff but it's like you know it's like you poke the thing and an avalanche comes out were you ever like uh all right Tony shut the [ __ ] up let me ask my next question so uh just got like only 45 minutes they were like um like you got 45 minutes with Tony and I was like 45 minutes geez this guy does n9h hour a day seminars for four days straight like what am I going to do in 45 minutes and then and I'm like hey uh you know actually it might be better if we do this in person I'm I will fly to you tomorrow and I'll be there and his team was like um no thanks uh we'll do you stay over there we'll do it this way instead but it was it was good I enjoyed it uh I do think I'm gonna just make a prediction Austin sorry to to Big Dog you with the Tony Robins thing but I'll give you this compliment I think people are going to like this episode more because the Rapport and also just like the style of stuff we talk about is so like you know on point for for what this podcast is can I ask you a different story though about a big name yeah go ahead a couple years ago you texted us that you were going to dinner with SBF and at the time SBF was the next Mark Zuckerberg SBF was multi-billionaire of the fastest growing private startup um boy Genius from MIT who wor like cargo Jorts and uh we were like Dude tell us more and you were like can't got to put way my phone right now like you know you know see you later suckers I'm going to go have dinner with SP SPF can you now two years later can you tell us the story what was it like going to dinner with SF yeah he's not gonna do anything now right he's in jail for a long time I think so maybe one day I'll get out and I'll listen to this episode I don't think I've told this story publicly uh so I'll tell it um but I have a friend investor at a big VC invested in FTX and you this is probably I don't know 2021 so SBF was BF right this is pre him obviously getting caught as being a fraud but he's at the height of his power he was whatever the stat was that top richest you know the richest person under 35 in the world the oneliner for anyone who doesn't know who SPF is Sam bakman freed he was like the Bernie made off of crypto 31y old worth2 billion do and it all came crashing down now he's in prison for fraud okay go ahead great thanks for the background um it's gonna make me look really good um so I uh didn't know that much about him though like I didn't do any research uh I'd heard him talk a couple times but I didn't know any of the stories and so my friend's like we trips to Bahamas I'm like I'm in it's for his birthday so we show up and I've been to nice places right I stayed at the Ritz Carlton I stayed all these nice places and so I thought I knew where the Rich and Famous live I was wrong this place it's called the Albany and the Bahamas this is where the Rich and Famous live like this place was there were 250 foot yachts everywhere I mean this is I I think Tiger Woods owns it uh Justin Bieber who I actually met the next day lives there Will Smith lives there like this is where the Rich and Famous live it was nuts and so I get there I'm like oh [ __ ] like yeah we're in for it so we show up we actually stayed at someone else at ftxs house they put you in the guest boat which was a pretty pretty nice guest house though no it was not a boat but it was a house and so we show up and we get get there here's the first thing I observe right it's like the penthouse coer $25 million apartment I had no idea I was walking into I walk in and there are 50 pairs of shoes laying everywhere like crappy Nikes I'm like this dude's worth 30 billion and they're all these weird Nikes laying around and my friend's like oh yeah I forgot to tell you like the entire exec team lives together in this one apartment and I'm like oh boy what are you what is going on and so obviously now we know in hindsight like you know there were articles who knows if it's true they were having orgies and all all type of of weird [ __ ] so we I knew all this like I knew some weird stuff was going on because 50 people did you get the orgy Vibe did you get like did could you smell it yeah smell but there was a weird Alpha attitude that people had towards Sam like he was clearly the alpha in the room even though he's super nerdy super techy but he just had this weird thing where people anyone who said anything looked to Sam to make sure they approved like it was clear he he was in charge he was the man and so again first thing shoes second thing you look to the left and Sam is in the kitchen cooking food which I was like oh we probably the chef cook us dinner no Sam is there cooking us food he does not turn his back his his face to us his back is to us and he starts having a full conversation with us without ever making eye contact no I contact he goes the first thing he ever says to me and my friend is so what do you think about Indian crypto changes what and I'm like what is going on Indian because he hasn't turned around yet he doesn't realize you're white guy I don't know so so in my friend know did you have an answer to that I probably said four words the entire dinner they were speaking a different a different language you know all all all crypto stuff um so I show up in the kitchen and Sam's cooking us dinner I put dinner in quotes everyone got one Beyond sausage and two Russell Sprouts that was the meal for for everyone so I think the vegan stuff's true because he cooked us all Beyond sausage right so that was pretty weird we sit down so again $20 million apartment but there's Hardware everywhere cables everywhere it was like post-apocalyptic right it was super super weird being this $20 million apartment but there's like PS3s and Xboxes like everywhere a complete mess of an apartment and so we sit down and I think the craziest thing about the dinner was Sam was a genius when it came to the things he had to know for FTX and crypto so for example Tom Brady was a like sponsored by FTX right Sam could have told you every single thing about Tom Brady could have told you his statline everything about him but I don't think Sam knew what a first down was I don't think he knew a single thing about football but if it benefited crypto he was the smartest person on the planet same thing with politicians he could go every single Senator every Supreme Court Justice he could tell you their exact stance on crypto I don't think he could tell you a single other thing about them it was incredible dude Sean you and I I don't want to I don't want to say their name because I don't want this be an insult but you and I hung out with someone who was the best in the whole world at what they do and well [ __ ] it I'll say it it was Mr Beast he was the best at whatever this is not an insult I guess it was Mr Beast you know he's the best in the world and I remember I think it was either you or me or me and someone else and I we were just shooting the [ __ ] about like a TV show that I thought everyone knew about and he had he had no idea and I was like I was just like curious about this so I asked some more pop culture stuff didn't know anything about like this normal stuff he's like sorry I just pay attention to YouTube like I that's all I do he had the exact same thing where he didn't know anything about anything outside of his expertise there's a funny uh interview with Conor McGregor on BBC it's like uh you know usually UFC gets covered by these small n Outlets but one time like he got on the main BBC they were like they were shooting the [ __ ] before the interview they were like oh how about the game you know whoever like some soccer game like some famous soccer game he's like he just laughs he's like he's like haha yeah it was great go he goes yeah it was great and they go you don't watch soccer do you he goes no I have no idea what you're talking about and go he goes do he goes um I don't know what's happening in the news I don't know what's happening in the world uh he goes I have lost my mind to the game and I only know about my [ __ ] don't give a damn about anything else and I think that's like actually kind of common for people who get like top 0.011% of like what they're trying to trying to become it's like when they asked Trump what his favorite like verse in the Bible was and he goes you know what I love all of them I love all of them yeah too hard to pick I love them all that's what Conor McGregor was like I love all the sports you seen the the video of of LeBron he's on Instagram live and people are like oh who are your favorite soccer players and LeBron's like he's like I love soccer they asked him about the team he owns they were like who are your favorite PSG players or whatever and he's like he owns the team and he's like he names one and he's like you know such as such as I mean you know so and so forth there are so many it's like etc etc such as yeah you only use the the middle words of a sentence you didn't say the subject did you get fraud Vibes when you were there or were you also tricked I mean I was totally enamored I because the perception at the ALB like there was a buzz we took a cab to the ALB and the's like oh you're going to uh you know like the AL that's where that's where FTX is headquarter like oh yeah we're like we're GNA see Sam and everyone's like oh my God everyone's like yo we one of the security guards said You know here you know you think the celebrities are famous the famous people they want to meet Sam Sam doesn't want to meet the people they want to go meet Sam like this guy he just had this Aura around him everyone wanted to meet him now in hindsight I feel like a complete [ __ ] because there were so many red flags every the whole effective altruism thing he he par you guys know about that yeah make as much money as you can to give it away yes what I heard about this never mind's like yeah you know Sam lives a really low-key lifestyle I'm like guys he lives in a 25 or2 million apartment it's the nicest apartment I've ever been in and they're all like no he only lives there because it's the most convenient to the FTF yeah yeah he lives in an orgy compound and he's he lives a lowkey life we we just throve by the FTX office there were 75 you neighborhoods in between here and the office like that doesn't add up what is going on yeah because these videos came out that was like Sam still drives his 93 Corolla and he's just like shrugs like why do I need to get a better car car and it's like oh damn this guy's full of [ __ ] you know like wow he's got like a full Olympic siiz swimming pool on his on his balcony but he he's an EA he's not spending his money there was a there was a rumor that he was uh that they're high on some type of like uh you know Aderall type of medicine that was like a patch did you see any of that [ __ ] laying around no I wish again like hindsight 2020 I wish I was looking for this stuff because I was just so enamored by this guy and how well he knew crypto but I just wish I started like digging and looking through more stuff I'm sure there was crazy [ __ ] everywhere dude you also I don't know if you probably can't say this but you went and hung out with Kid Rock as well uh which is like a crazy story you've hung out with some cool people you've had some diverse experiences yeah the Kid Rock thing I think I might spoke about that last time the Kid Rock thing was awesome he is he's obviously super interesting I he told us he is the only person to play at both President Obama and president Trump's inaugurations and he knows both them he's the only one that can heal this country he's the only one that can bring us together he he lives in this this he actually on his compound which it is a compound he has like a full bar uh and I don't mean like the the physical bar I mean like a whole pub at on his compound he also lives and I it was being constructed but he lives in a house that is a replica of the White House I'll show you guys pictures it he modeled it after the White House walk up you're like oh my God like it actually looks exactly like the White House looked like it's nuts all right everyone really quick this is Sam I'm going to do a thrill of the chill so basically I've got an ask for everyone out there I just launched this new podcast it's called MoneyWise it's a personal finance podcast for high netw worth people you can find it by looking up MoneyWise on Spotify and uh iTunes or wherever else you get your podcast but here's the deal this podcast is a ton of work and I'm only hosting the first handful of episodes I need someone to be the host of this podcast I have a feeling it's going to be pretty pretty big and it's going to be great for whoever hosts it but I need help hosting it I don't want to do all the work our first episode you can find it on whatever all those platforms it's pretty great I think it's with the guy who sold his company for $200 million and we get to hear like how he breaks down his net worth how much he spends each month all this transparent money stuff that's pretty interesting and so if you want to host it I'm actually not going to give out my contact information you've got to figure out how to contact me because that's what you're gonna have to do you're gonna have to find guests so contact me and let me know if you want to be the host of this and send me something that is impressive that shows that you have what it takes all right back to the show awesome did you ever hear the story Cody Co told on our pod about when he went to Elon musk's house for a party no it's so funny it's a very short story but I find it hilarious even though it's not meant to be a funny story he's just telling what happened but the whole idea is so funny to me so he goes he's like yeah I was hanging out with so Cody's like you know La YouTuber cool guy also makes some music so I think they were hanging out with um post Malone so he's he's had a thing with post he's like oh Elon asked us to you know come over for a party he shows him his phone he's like you want to go and he's like uh of course okay let's go so they go to El's house I was like what's it like he's like first thing no furniture in the entire place an empty house and he was like uh does anybody live here like what is this he's like no no elon's house is across the street this is like his party he hosts people here he lives over there I like oh naturally okay a stupid question by me dumb all right I won't ask he's like so we're just sitting there and he's like uh it's like a fire and they're just kind of like eating you know like uh eating marshmallows or whatever the [ __ ] and he's like he's like you know it got kind of late people are doing their own thing and he's like you know all I'm just gonna go I'm just gonna kind of dip out of here this is like you know it's it's late this was weird and he's like so he he's trying to leave he doesn't know his way out of the house so he's like trying to get out he turns the corner and it's just Elon making out with Grimes so he just turns and he opens this door and he's like he's he's like dude I thought I was G to open this door and there's just a rocket and they're like get in there's no time he like I just wanted to leave so bad you guys read the the Elon book I didn't read it I I'm kind of over Elon Sean and I are both over him hardcore but I don't want to read that book because it sounds so stressful yeah I I just finished it I read it uh over the holidays and it definitely gives you a different lens into Elon Musk you really really see the full spectrum of of who he is as a person and I think people try to draw inspiration from Elon and I think you can in little bits and pieces but to me my big takeaway from the whole book was like Elon is Hardcore like that is the one word he uses and like that is who he is he's hardcore he's extreme I don't think you can be like 70% Elon and be successful like he just has no regard for any person he works with he's basically everyone he works with right he he you know treats his family like [ __ ] he's starved from issues with his dad and my big take away it was like elon's this unique one you know one in a billion one in 10 billion people and all these people are inspired that's great but don't try to copy him because this guy is is to the extreme and I I don't think almost anyone can can be as extreme in every facet of life he doesn't sleep he doesn't vacation he has crazy relationships I mean obviously that's all public but with all uh you know he has so many kids but it's all everything's extreme every single thing he does is to the as Extreme as you can possibly do it it's it's incredible you you should read the book dude I just don't want my blood pressure to rise reading that like just hearing you talk about this because on one hand I'm like when I hear about him I'm like oh I'm soft I should step it up and then on the other hand I'm like his life sucks I do not want that and so there is that whole you can't be you can't be like him and be SE and be 70% have I told you my David goggin's point I think that's what applies here which is what you only want to be David Goggins for one hour a day that's the whole trick with David gogins you you can't be you don't want to be out on all of David gogins because he's inspiring and he's so tough and he's so like mentally strong that there's something to learn there you also don't want to subscribe to the David gogin lifestyle or even like try to emulate you know half of what he's doing you just want for one hour a day when you're working out to just shift into David goggin gear for that one hour and then never never touch it again like I don't know if you saw this post that was uh David Goggins is engaged and his Beyonce [ __ ] insane it sounds like an onion article I was just gonna say there's this video of her I didn't even know he's engaged I don't know how he's in a relationship first of all but I here's here's what I actually saw we're g put this on the YouTube just like get YouTube May delete our account are they like we just got home from dinner or something first there's a picture of his toes which is just like I don't know if you've ever seen it ex-athletes toes but they're like all nasty as hell this guy I don't even know what's going on he's literally just ripping off his big toenail because he's like ah don't need this [ __ ] anymore like and F's like no David please don't and like whatever and he's like why are his feet so jacked up because he's running hundred miles at a time and so she posts this thing she's like yeah a lot of people think that David only turns it on for the camera I just want to show you this he just he's two we two months out of uh no two weeks off of surgery for his leg where they like broke his leg and fixed it for whatever reason and um he just came home and was like I want to run 100 miles tonight and so she's following him in the car she's been with him in the car for like eight hours she's falling behind at like five miles an hour or whatever and he's just running he's he's on you know hour seven yeah hour seven it's like you know 3:00 am and he's almost done with 100 miles I think it said like I think it said like we got home from dinner and David just looks at me and goes I've got to go run 100 miles now or like I got to run a Tru what's what are they called trucks or something like that I got to go go do a truck tonight uh I forgot what they're called called but like a Ruck so I'm going for a Ruck tonight and I don't I'm this out of shape I don't even know what a Ruck is let alone running with a it's running or walking with a backpack on that has weight in it okay so he's doing 100 mile weighted run and uh you know then you see that you're like well this is [ __ ] stupid this is not the way to live right like the only the only intelligent response to that is that and so the trick with DAV goag you want to be David gagu for one hour a day the trick with Elon Musk is you only want to be Elon Musk like 15% of the time in company right when you're establishing the vision of like thinking big about what you're doing he's amazing you want to channel your inner Elon when you are um you know telling a story about your product the way he demos you know Tesla every time and sells hundreds of thousands of cars before they're even ready people pay money just to B pre to wait for the car right that's when you want to you want to reserve your thing or like when he came into Twitter was like I'm gonna do this really hard thing hardcore I'm going to do a Sprint I'm going to sleep in the office and like I'm going to make sure everybody knows if you're in this you're in this this in a hardcore way versus like dude Austin I don't know how you run your company but I was always on eggshells with my employees like like hey we got uh you know we got to do this tomorrow but if that's too much Tuesday's okay right like yeah is that okay with you I don't I just don't know what the boundaries are versus like Mr Beast or or David gogins or Elon these guys have like kind of no sense of boundaries they just they're on their mission and you're either all in or you're out and uh I think that's pretty cool and that's the part to steal yeah I think so I think the the thing to steal in particular is that Vision right Elon starts with the vision and then builds a business builds the business model that's really impressive I think the way he treats people the way he some of the things he says that could that could be in the 85% of stuff you leave out right right and actually SBF just kind of the same way the SP SPF book kind of highlighted a bunch of things uh that happened my friend read the SPF book and he was like I think I'm supposed to hatef uh you know because of everything that happened but reading this book made me like a more and it wasn't because of the spin he's like actually I found a few things I really respect about what he did he's like let's take away the fact that he was taking cut customer funds to do these things but like let's just say he was using the company's money or his own money or whatever right which he was also doing he just overextended and Ed company uh the customer funds too but they were like the fact that he was like okay if I have $1 hundred million he didn't like feel any fear towards losing it nor did he feel any attachment to it he's like great let's use the 100 million to pay off Steph Curry you know Tom Brady and whoever because we're going to build the brand that way and like co go and cut absurd deals in order to pull these things off or like there's that email that leaked of him and the guy in LA or the guy he's like I went to this dinner with this guy in La he's the most connected person I've ever seen at this dinner was whoever like you know uh Nancy Pelosi Leonardo Dicaprio and like whatever 12 other people he's like we need to give this guy $200 million to invest in his fund and I think he'll open all the doors for us after that wire him the money out please and like just the ability to throw your weight around is actually pretty badass and if you take away the fraud stuff I I know other successful people in our life that do this Andrew Wilkinson does this he throws his weight around when he wants something or he like sets his Target on someone a relationship or a a business he wants to buy or whatever he really throws his weight around in a way that I definitely don't right like Sam what he wanted to buy the hustle dude he flew me private up to his House's like oh you he's like I want to buy this company let's talk and you're like cool we could talk on the phone he's like no let's meet in person you're like I don't like to fly and Canada's far away he's like my jet will be there tomorrow let's go and uh you know he throws his weight around in a way that I think I am like often either too cheap or too afraid or or just don't even think about those options um and I'm learning to steal that part of my my game have you guys thought about that or do you guys think about how you're gonna use that I'm the same way as you I appreciate it and I'm fearful of it it's it's a very scary thing and but I when I see it I get inspired yeah I think it's a for me it's it's a conviction play right I'm more inspired by uh like I read the the Warren Buffett book for example right and he's more cerebral in the way he does it but it's the same thing it's like he sees an opportunity and he's not dipping his toe in the water he's not a a diversification guy he like oh Bank of America's going under I'm gonna buy a ton of preferred debt this is a can't lose bet and by the way I'm sitting on however many billions of dollars on my balance sheet so I'm going to own whatever 10% of Bank of America and so I love when people have conviction and they just say you know what this is it I'm taking all the chips all the social capital everything I've made and I'm doubling down on this dude your chips on the table moment right now is just praying Bill Amman doesn't crush your company because morning Brew Tak your chips and running away hiding under the table actually speaking of throwing your weight around right that's what he's doing right now he's trying to throw his weight around in a way I think I morning Brew is owned by Business Insider which is owned by Axel Springer and Bill akman is at war with bi and axel Springer Austin I'd like to hear your response to this yeah what's your official response you gotta message Bill Hackman to be like Bill same team same team like I'm all right yeah I'll save my response for the private group chats I think that uh the IDE I think you don't want to be excited to to just like plow chips into something because you're you're you're naturally going to just kind of make make an impulsive wrong decision but I do think there's a good question which is am I throwing my weight around right like am I um you know how hard how how much gas versus how much breakes am I applying to the things that I want in my life that's one of my themes I think for this year that I'm gonna I'm gonna focus on R safy has this good thing where he talks about spending and he was like and he'll messag me privately he's like what interests you and I'm like well I've got this cleaning lady that comes every two weeks I I wish they would come every day almost and he's like I'm going to challenge you to figure out what makes you happy and I want you to spend 10 times the amount that you're spending now um and so like for him it's like travel and he goes when I travel I will spend $50,000 on a trip and that's a ton of money but that I know that's what makes me happy and I'm GNA 10 times spend what I used to spend because that's what I love and that's what he was saying to me about um services like cleaning ladies things like that he goes I challenge you to spend 10 times more and that's like a miniature version of what you're talking about also what about you you made a bunch of money selling morning Brew did you use it in any way that was interesting or like improve the quality of your life meaningfully yeah the big thing for me is I love traveling I love staying at nice hotels on vacation and so I when I when I travel that that is my money dial is traveling I think remitz is two actually you were texting about this Aman Hotel what what's the deal do I need to know about this what what is it have you heard of it it's just like supposed to be the fanciest hotel ever I've heard about it like two times this year and I don't know if I just started hanging out with different people or it's new is this I'm guessing this has been around for like for like a while we're growing a lot but essentially Aman I think is the standard for customer service for any business right you know we're talking about the the milk Road for X I think the a good way to think about a business is what's the Aman verx so Aman is just the absolute top customer service I mean I think the cheapest Aman there's maybe 60 or 70 of them the cheapest one is maybe, 1500 bucks a night I think they're regularly 2500 there's one out west somewhere I think it's I'm on Arizona yeah that's what people love it's like six grand a night and people go there and they're like it was worth it what do they do why is how would that be worth it well it's beautiful for one but it's sort of like remember Sean the bear that episode like it's touching my body for six grand a night but you remember like like I remember the there was like season two episode six or something is where the guy goes and learns how to like wash the silverware perfectly it's like that and I think that that that type of Excellence helped make it popular where people are like oh I respect this craftsmanship but have you been Austin I've never been so I've never stayed at one I'm that's I'm planning my honeymoon now and that's that's our goal is they at a bunch of uh amons but I've been to a bunch when I travel so when I travel I always try to get like a drink or go to them they're also interesting because they're typically not in the heart of a city they typically are on the outskirts a little bit they actually and I think this is really cool I think they do this intentionally they make you travel there a little bit right it's not accessible and that's part of the alur is it's like a destination you have to really want to go to an amont to be at the amont now they've grown and they have one in New York city so maybe that's not quite as true but they really want you to to like be in the Aman Essence when they're there and it's

double or nothing coffee it's a coffee shop where instead of at the end where it's like do you want to tip 20% 30% whatever it just says double or nothing and it's basically you flip a coin and it's either going to be a free coffee or you're going to pay double for it and the double goes to the Baristas why is this a great idea have you ever heard the phrase asymmetric upside cuz that's what I'm offering you here a coffee really only costs a coffee shop like 40 cents or something let's say the price of the coffee was four bucks if they can get eight bucks out of every other customer here on this coin flip that's a lot of extra dollars coming through the till and and worst case scenario you're just giving up a free coffee it's only cost you 40 cents in the downside it's a good bet I think it's going to be like a slot machine we're going to slightly skew it so it's double or nothing but I didn't say it's 50/50 it's actually going to be more like a 7030 chance of upang double whatever the legal limits are for slots we're going to go all the way to that and it's a place for people who like caffeine but also like to take their chances

I cannot believe who we have here today Tony Robbins is coming on the podcast Tony Robbins is the number one life coach performance coach in the world he's the highest paying public speaker of all time this guy's built a business Empire that does 7 billion a year in Revenue um incredible entrepreneur and Coach I mean this guy's customers his clients the guys who pay him to coach them are like you know top athletes uh you know Serena Williams and Tom Brady and Conor McGregor you know um politicians Nelson Mandela Bill Clinton uh the top Traders and investors in the world Ray doio Paul tutor Jones they pay him because they know that Tony is can help be their Edge right uh he can help them level up so if he can help them level up I think we can learn a lot from him I'm going to ask about three specific things the first is I actually went to a Tony Robbins event eight years ago this is my notebook from that event uh I still have it eight years ago eight years later and the reason why is because I hate to be that guy who's like I went to a self-help semon art it changed my life but it did uh I really came out a different guy I came out a happier guy I ended up you know at the time I you know this podcast called my first million I didn't have my first million then and I came up with a plan I came up with a strategy and I stuck to it after that event I made I did it because he I made three specific shifts and so I know most of you will never go to one of his events you'll never go to the seminar it's a four-day thing it's kind of weird it's not as cool as just going to Coachella or whatever but I want to ask Tony about those specific three shifts so that you can hear from him exactly what I heard in that event that changed my life that's what we're going to do on this podcast today those same exact things that Chang my life I'm going to have him explain on the podt today it's kind of like a live coaching session we're just people pay this guy a million bucks to do this and we're going to get it for free uh also at the end of this uh Tony doesn't know this but I'm going to actually give away just under $100,000 worth of tickets to his seminar so for people who are listening to this there'll be directions at the end of how you can actually get a free ticket to go to one of his things if you so choose so that money is not your limitation so the least I could do this guys helped me out so much in my life I would love to pay it forward to the next person and uh and send them to the seminar um lastly we talk about his his new book which he's been interviewing all these billionaires right the they this Championship mindset right he works with the top 1% of the 1% and I want to know what's different what are they doing differently he tells a story about an investor who bought 40 million nickels like literally like the coin the Nickels uh why they did that and why that was such a good idea um I wanted to hear some of these stories from him hanging out with these billionaire investors um because he doesn't talk about that a lot and I I'm I nerd out about that kind of thing so enjoy this episode with Tony Robbins this is a real uh cool moment for me with this podcast to be able to do this I thank Tony for coming on and I hope you enjoy [Music] it pull this one out today uh to just do a little refresher where'd you go when didd you go I went to New Jersey it's actually a funny story I had heard oh Tony Robins is Mot motivational speaker and I kind of was like oh do I do I need motivation I don't need motivation I don't either but there was something inside me that because when you when I had watched your videos I thought well it's not just that I mean he's a he's an entrepreneur he's doing his company's doing billions in Revenue he's clearly a leader and when I went to this event I knew that it wasn't just like it wasn't just some generic self-help BS and I go and a couple things stood out right away I just want to tell you about this my experience at your event so I go and the very first thing that happens is I plan to just sit back I'm here to learn okay I'm not going to jump I'm not going to do all that dancing jumping around stuff this is my mentality 15 minutes later that's out the window I'm into it I'm having a great time uh the second thing is I notice I see these celebrities up front these are some of the most successful people I know all right uh I I hear this scream that almost sounds familiar I look over and it's Jedd Butler the guy from 300 like the Spartan I'm like all right if he's into this I I think I could be into this uh you know like you have this thing like give your neighbor a high five I turned it's Vanessa hudgin I'm like giving her a hug I had this amazing experience and when I was there it was one guy who turned and looked at me and he said first time huh because you just see this grin on my face and I was like yeah this is not your first time and he goes no I've been to five of these and honestly I was like a little discouraged I was like you got to come to this thing five times like I don't know is that how this works and I go why' you come five times he goes because when Michael Jordan's in his prime and he comes to your town you go watch him play yeah and I thought that was one of the best compliments I said Michael Jordan he said yeah he's this is the Michael Jordan he's like he does many things but he's the Michael Jordan of public speaking and after that I started looking at what you were doing differently you work with billionaires and presidents and athletes and all this stuff but every superhero has a origin story right like Spider-Man got bit by The Spider and that's you know that's where he got his powers from I think your origin story is amazing and not not a lot of people know the full story can you take me back you're 17 years old I think you're a part-time janitor and you'd never been to a seminar in your life how did you what was your spider bite how did you stumble into this that's interesting question I was already interested in personal development because I had a kind of a rough background I have four different fathers we had no money for food I had to work two jobs work as a janitor and my mom had a friend and dad had a friend that had been my my dad my dad's description was he used to be such a loser and now he's really successful and so he called and said listen I hear your son's gotten big I was I I was 51 in high school and I I was 6'2 by my senior year I grew 10 inches in a year I tell people the difference is personal growth by the way but the bottom line is he said you know I I got to move some furniture and things I heard he's big you know could he come work for the weekend for some extra money so I did I worked really hard and the guy really was impressed by their work e think so he said I'm gonna take you to lunch we go to this lunch and you know and he's saying you know I really think you go place you got a lot of drive and I said well I'd like to ask you some questions and he said okay and I said my dad used to say he used to be such a loser and now you're so successful how'd you do that you know only a kid can say this right I wasn't trying to be cute I just literally repeated it you go said what then he's like well it's kind of true and he said well I went to this seminar and I said what is this seminar I've never heard of such thing he said well a man who has really become accomplished takes 20 years of his life and teaches you in three and a half hours the best of what you need to know to make your life work I said wow that sounds really interesting I said could you get me in and he said yeah and there was no followup so I said well well will you and he said no I said why not he said well because if you don't pay for it you won't value it and at the time I was working as janer making 40 bucks a week so I said uh how how much is it he said $35 it'd be like $250 and and you today's dollars to give you an idea but it was a week's pay is all I knew and I was like are you kidding me for three hours I said no one of the guy's Rich he goes no that's not it he said he really has these tools but he said if you think it's too much then you go learn on your own experience and take 10 or 20 or 30 years and maybe never learn it at all and so long story short I made what I thought was the biggest decision of my life to take a week's pay and I went and heard Jim Ron speak and I was deeply moved I left there going okay I'm going to become president United States I'm going to start with a plan of running for junior in high school I'm going to run for student body president I'm going to be a state I was just looking to have the most impact but what it led to was me just really digging in and learning everything I could about human development and then very quickly because I was studying everything I get my hands on I came across neural linguistic programming NLP which at the time was a break through new technology of how to use language to change human emotion and behavior and I talk my way into this you know six-month class I was the only non- therapist in the class and um and after the first weekend I was just out using it I stop I'd go to literally this the program I went to was at the airport holid in in LAX and I'd go to the Denny's that was right next door afterwards and look for people to help you it's like here say I'm gonna change your life but and then gradually I started modeling and I started figuring other skills and I started challenging traditional psychologists and psychiatrists saying give me your worst patient I'll handle them in an hour and I took people with lifetime phobias you know been in therapy seven years and turned around in an hour and that built my reputation and so then I started working with athletes and then I started work with Mother Teresa Nelson Mandela and gorbachov and you know President Clinton and it just grew and grew and then along the way I used some the same skills called modeling finding out what is makes the difference in performance around businesses and I started building companies so today you know now I have 111 companies we do over S7 billion dollars in business across radically different Industries and uh but this is my mission this what I do on a daily basis here my education company is what I value most but that's kind of the journey and I've had lots of ups and downs along the way obviously it wasn't like a straight up experience by any stretch it's not a straight line but I've learned hell of a lot I've been surrounded by a lot of great people along the way all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys but we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM I don't know if you've seen this have you seen this little clip of Jim Rome talking about you no I have not let's play this all right can you play that clip Tony Robbins sat in my seminar when he was 17 17 he was on the outs with his parents and he was sleeping in his car and someone got him to come to my seminar age 17 so you don't you never know who's in the audience and he worked for me for three and a half years promoting my seminars back then called adventures and achievement three and a half years finally ran one of my offices at age 20 in Los Angeles Tony Robbins now he's a big-time Superstar bigger superstar than I am around the world unbelievable and he mastered all the stuff you know I didn't teach him to firew walk and all all that stuff but that's Tony style you know he can get by with that I couldn't do that I did say to him one time Tony you got to do water instead of fire they'll come from all over the world and knowing Tony guess what he'll probably try it it kid's unbelievable he's unbelievable so what's it like I mean hearing your Mentor you know somebody who became a friend but but start off as a you were the student he was a teacher in a way how does it feel hearing that no he was a teacher for sure he taught me some of the most important things I think the most important thing he taught me um was when I was you know I had all these different fathers and we were always broke and so he said change your mindset change it from can I earn twice as much in the same amount of time 10 times as much 50 times a 100 times a thousand times yes if you become more valuable so you have to work harder on yourself than you do on your job and he said you've got to understand whatever you do do add more value than anybody else in the marketplace of what you do and that really it it it sung to me because I always try to overd deliver in anything I did even at that stage of my life and um that's been the basis of every company that I built across all these different Industries I there's no way i' be I am without that piece so I'm indebted to Jim as my first Mentor one of the questions I wanted to ask you is you can't ask Steph Curry how do you make a jump shot it's too complicated right I can't ask you how do you be a good public speaker but I can ask you how did you get good cuz my sense is yes you had some natural gifts however I want to bet and you tell me if I'm right or wrong that from the ages of kind of like 17 when you went to that first seminar to maybe 25 26 27 I would bet that you probably got more reps in than anybody else in your field is that I I could be wrong tell me if I'm wrong I went to work for Jim Ron the personal development speaker so you would go out and make two talks maybe three talks in a month where you would go to a real estate office or a stock brokerage or someplace where you would do a talk and show them by improving themselves they could also improve their income that's usually what they were interested in and so what I did different was I went out and said I remember the guy that was number one in the in the whole company there were about a thousand employees in that company and I went up to him the first day because he was such a jerk to people I mean it's like total jerk and so I you know I've always been a kind of protective of the little guy I was a little guy I was 5-1 I was protective back then right when I was in high school so I went up to him and I just said you know what I said you're an absolute idiot and I you better remember my name I said because it'll only be a few months before I'll dwarf you and I said I'll tell you why you're lazy you do three talks a month I'm going to do three talks a day so it doesn't matter if I'm as good as you are I'm going to destroy you right and I did I booked myself uh to every kind of group you can imagine but yes you know if you know uh I I'm fortunate enough to own a piece of the Golden State Warriors and I've coached the team I I haven't been there this year again I've been had a chance but they need it but Steph is a perfect example of what you're describing because people don't know the greatest three point shooter in the league when he was you know in high school he was really good the dad trained him continuously his dad was an NBA player but his dad at one point he's the best player in the league told him we got to change your jump shots we get a jump shots we got to change it you start it too low you'll never make it the NBA and so he made him have to do this new form of jump shot and he became terrible because you're terrible when you try to do something new but he wouldn't let him play competitively until he could shoot well in this way and then now he still does it he shoots you know 500 shots a day to give you an idea 3500 shots a week think about it 14,000 shots a month 168,000 shots a year these are practice shots so he's been in the NBA 15 years he's done 2.52 million shots in practice in his entire career's only taken 15,000 shots and he's made 3,003 pointers and he's the greatest in history less than one tenth of 1% of his shots have actually shown up in a game so I always tell people you're rewarded in public for what you practice in private I think that's an amazing strategy is that is that your method to kind of learning in general how do you think about that I think of learning at two levels I think of learning as immersion the reason I do 12 hours a day for three or four days in a row most people wouldn't sit for a three-hour movie someone spent 300 million to make I can do it because I know how to engage people in all their senses in other words how much is a long time some people say 10 minutes some people say 10 years right but really a long time is when you're not enjoying yourself you know a minute can feel like eternity if you're in pain but if you're enjoying yourself time flies and so my whole mindset was I got to immerse people because that's how we learn if you're learn a language and you learn a little bit of your time in high school and college most people don't speak the language but if I took you to Italy and dropped you in Rome and said I'll pick you up in 90 days with no teacher you're GNA be speaking Italian by the time I pick you up because of the immersion so I like to immerse myself but immerse myself with someone who is the best in the world at something someone who's already done it not somebody who's teaching me intellectually like going to a university with somebody understands it but has never done it I wanted to model the very best in the world so I I would go interview with I'd go to work for people in the very early days as a janitor so I could get around them so I could learn how they think and what they do gradually I got to the point where I had these skills and so I could help people and so I'd help them but then I'd also learn from them everybody I've ever coached who calls me a coach I'm no dummy I learned from them so some of my dearest friends in the world when people started us coaching like Mark Betty off of Salesforce he came to my seminar I think four times in a row and he as big as I am he stands out and on the fourth one he came up introduced himself and said you know I'm Mark Benny off and you've convinced me to leave Oracle I'm going to start my own company that's called salesforce.com and want you come on the journey with me and I'll never forget he said to me he said we're going to do a we're going to change business around the world and I promise you we'll do a hundred million doar in business and now he's doing 35 billion right it's he worth so it's like and he's done that in 16 years you know the growth has been unbelievable so Mark says I'm his coach yeah I've learned as much from Mark or more than he's learned from me same thing with Peter goober you know Peter and I are Partners the Golden State Warriors the LA Dodgers you know we both uh invested and started with the LFC football club he's got 52 Academy Award nominations he's you know he's one of the most brilliant IM and beings that I know so I learned from him so all the people that I've coached over the years I've learned from and I've tried to do it through immersion the more you can imers yourself where you're thinking breathing doing something 18 20 hours a day the faster you're going to learn so that's how I go about it what's something you learned from Peter because he's a fascinating guy that I think most people don't you know of his work but you don't know him necessarily he's not super out there publicly talking all the time and trying to share knowledge do you have any good Peter grber stories or uh or Lessons Learned you've had now that you partner with him on some things how he thinks I say one of the most valuable principles I learned from him him and a and a friend of his when we became friends at one stage you know he said change my life I want to do some do some more things with you and he had a small group of men about 8 to 10 that had been getting together twice a year sometimes three times a year they go on these amazing trips and they just brainstorm but everybody there was the master of their Universe right so it' be like Pat Riley you know was at the time you know the winningest coach in NBA basketball uh you'd have the richest man in Canada like this amazing who and so he invited me to come on this trip with him and he said look we've never brought anybody in before you're 18 years younger than just about everybody here but you have so much to out I convince the guys let you come on the trip and if they like you maybe you come part of the group and come on a regular basis now this is I'm just starting my businesses I'm early on in my career of 30 31 years old and I'm in a place where he wants me to go off on this 12 day trip well I couldn't leave my business for 12 days in those days I was a business operator I wasn't an owner like I am today so I had to go on the trip and on the trip though it was such a push I didn't want to miss it I did it I was so stressed out because I felt like didn't belong there so uh he didn't had this conversation with me about what I want to do with my life and then he said well let me tell you the most important principle to get you there he said proximity Is Power and he and Peter B started nodding and saying this is what makes everything work and I said what do you mean proximity Is Power what do you mean by that he said to me at the time you know how many investment bankers do you know I said no I don't know maybe a dozen he goes how do you spend time with I said not he goes that's a huge mistake you must go spend time with them because as you spend time they will think of you and they will come up with deals that will help you generate the economics you want to generate if you want to run for office or do something of that nature and I said okay and so I started doing it I felt really uncomfortable and then I saw him again and he really gave me stuff and so then I did it deliberately ongoingly and for a year and a half I'd go meet people I I'm I'm not a networker per se um because I felt like I I don't know I'm not asking for something and I don't know what I can do for them I try to always be a giver and but nothing came out of I mean some good friendships and so for no business came out of and one day I got a phone call that led to a $50 million deal for me and then another day about a year later converted that into making in one single day $400 million taking a company public so I always tell people if you think about important principles one of the most important ones I learned from Peter and his friends was you've got to get in the environment where the best people in the world are on a regular basis and add value and then things will start to happen nothing accelerates more than that other than your own skills and development one of the things I got from being in proximity with you at your events immersion going there for four days and and and really soaking it all in was would you came on stage there was an energy shift every time and you you mentioned Mark Ben off I know You' talked at the Salesforce conference and I watched the video and he he said something great he goes the next guy who's coming out here he doesn't I mean Salesforce is like you know a bunch of sales reps in the audience as it's a white collar crew they're all sitting down they've been at a thing all day he says he doesn't come out to a cold room and he goes so if you if Toon's G to come out here we better are warm up right now and immediately everybody raised their standard of how they were going to show up for you and you came out and you had a certain energy with you I stole that and I started using that I said I don't come out to cold rooms anymore I raised my own standard in that way that's great but I it it's not just in the work context because um even though I went to your event because I wanted to be more successful and more ambitious whatever and I had these goals I wanted to have you know $10 million by the time I was 30 and then you know today it's like our companies this year will do like $50 million in Revenue raises it's it's it's continued to grow but the thing I took away the most wasn't any of the work stuff it was how you show up at home you had this thing that I want you to talk about called the honey I'm home energy I've been doing this now for like eight straight years since I I went to your event people don't know this explain what coming home with the Honey about that yeah that's uh it's just really simple it's just I remember my father used to come home my fora especially when the door closed there was this pause and we waited to see what kind of state he was going to be in and you could tell if he was in an unhappy State you want to kind of avoid the environment or if he'd say monkey gurus you used say this fre monkey gurus made no sense but he had so much enthusiasm and excitement in his voice that we knew it was a good day so I thought when I come home I want to make a difference so my wife and I have this little thing that we do is I come home honey I'm home and then we look for each other and we run towards each other just hug each other and kiss but it's a it's a beautiful ritual that we've you know we've been together 24 years and we still have this aliveness and passion for each other because we still put ourselves in those high energy states it's easy because of being worn down by work or environments or kids or some of your family's ill or financial pressure in your business let's say to let your state drop and then when you're around your partner that's what they experience all the time and then their State's low and then you're both filtering life through that so I think it's really important just like if you're going to get up and be a perform in a peak state if you're going to P Peak results you got to be in a peak State you got to train yourself to do it at home and then after a while it's not phony it's just like if you see an athlete they have muscles you know why do the muscle because they work out regularly well when you push yourself into a great state regularly it becomes your standard and it becomes how you feel all the time you kind of wire yourself with that it's not to say you don't have down times or frustrating times or sad times or whatever have all those things but they're not the majority of the time and if they happen you can snap out of it fast because you know how to and I think that's a huge part of what I try to teach people is that you don't have to accept how you feel and people all times say well I don't feel like it well if if I waited till I felt like it I wouldn't do 90 % of stuff I've done in my life I've learned how to make myself feel like it um because if you don't do that you're you're not going to accomplish or achieve or enjoy your life at the level that you deserve and probably desire right you said something about the 90 seconds of suffering can you explain this concept because I stole this I stole this like it's Oceans 11 and I came into I stole this framework from you and I have been using it since then I'm glad you stole it that's that's a worthy thing is still stealing life is too short to suffer I I'm not going to suffer I know how to change my state but I want to create a rule that within 90 seconds if I start to suffer I'm going to snap out of it now don't get me wrong it doesn't mean you don't get angry or frustrated or pissed off or worried or any of those things I can have all those feelings but if you train yourself to snap out of it 90 seconds and by the way in the beginning no problem 90 seconds and easy things but then life gives you some big tests right you get something feels more like 90 days than 90 seconds but you get it's like any skill like like shooting the basket you do it again and again and again you get better better and better and it's changed my life because no matter what's going on I can still find the beauty in that and in a beautiful State of Mind you'll come up with the answers much quicker than a pissed off state or a fearful state or a lousy State plus it gives a gift to everybody else who wants to be around somebody who's in a crappy state right think about it like this you know if you have a if you have cable or you have satellite and you turn the channel there's certain channels where it's all comedy other ones all drama other ones it's all horror right other ones it's you know romance well the Channel Changers your body because if you look at the greatest athletes in the world Tom Brady you know locally here in Florida you know we have a group that's won the Stanley Cup over and over gun the Tampa Bay Lightning and they're famous for coming from behind and winning so the the same group did test on them before they ever worked with me and they discovered there's a biochemistry of what they call Championship biochemistry it's where these people like Tom Brady's down by 10 points and it's the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl and he comes back the way I mean how he has this huge huge surge of testosterone which gives you total focus and drive it also makes you remember everything it's like if I ask you where you at 911 everybody remembers the moment actually where you're 811 no one knows where they were right because you don't have that surge of testosterone the energy but usually testosterone is matched by cortisol which is a stress hormone but in this case their cortisol drops through the floor so all they get is pure focus and drive now it doesn't guarantee you're going to succeed but increases your chances about 10 fold every time I get on stage I develop that biochemistry love it and uh I have so many more questions but I also I feel like your PR team I feel like there's a red dot that's going to come on me if I don't talk about your book so I want to ask you a question about this so I read the advanced copy of your book so the Holy Grail of investing it's the third of these kind of like money related books that you've been doing which has been fun because I like the business side that's obviously where I kind of nerd out yeah tell the story about the guy you you know who I think he's a billionaire who who bought millions of nickels and why this guy bought millions of nickels I think this was so fun and uh you got to tell that story let me let me give people a little background so I've written three books on finance I I started back in 201 13 because after the 2008 Dropout I've been working with Paul tutor Jones one of the top 10 financial traders in the history of the world I've coached him for 24 years he hasn't lost money during that time so I've learned a lot um but when I saw that the way we dealt with 2008 was we instead of punishing the people that almost destroyed the system we gave them more of our money it just blew my mind and so I I thought I can't change everything but I have access so I decided to write a book where I interview 50 of the smartest Financial investors in the world the most successful all self-made billionaires nobody from Lucky sperm Club they didn't inherit it they created it you know Ray do Carl icon Warren Buffett Paul Tor Jones all of them so I was interviewing a gentleman that took $30 million and turned it into $2 billion in 20082 2009 the worst economic time and um and I I asked him I said how' you do this and he went asymmetrical RIS reward I've heard that from every great investor I said okay I understand what that means but how' you do it how he did it was he saw the in the mortgages and everybody thought these mortgages were going to hold up and it real estate was going to grow forever and he knew that wasn't true and he bet against it with unique tools so he literally he could be wrong 13 times to still make money so that's how he turned that money around and made the greatest return in just about any period of time so I asked him I said his name is Kyle bass I said Kyle I said how would you explain this to like someone who's unsophisticated and how would you explain it to your kids he goes Tony I can't believe you said that I just recently asked myself the same question so I want my kids to understand this principle because that's what'll make him wealthy and he said so I fought how can I do this he said for six months I kept asking the question where can I find an investment that is so asymmetrical there's no downside and there's huge upside immediately now most people say you're an idiot to even ask that question there's no such investment right no risk no reward and he goes no he goes smart people ask questions nobody else ask I kept asking and I finally came up the answer Nicholls I said Nichols goes yes he goes here's how it works nickles to make a nickel cost 11 cents that's how screwed up our government is and he said and he said so years ago pennies used to have copper that's almost no coppernick he goes those pennies are worth two cents he said the reason is because the copper Valu is there but also now they're so unique right he said so I thought Nicholls don't never be worth less than 5 cents I want to buy as many nickels as I can because he said the Meltdown value alone would give me 30% return on day one 30% I like investment where you can't lose money and you're guaranteed at least 30% I said yeah but I've seen the rules you can't melt money anymore he goes yes I know that's what they say he said but I don't even have to melt it Tony the same thing happened to pennies is will happen to nickels he said they can't do 11 Cent 5cent nickels forever once it changes the value of these original nickels is going to be great so he went to the fed and asked how many nickels he could buy and I figet the number was millions of nickels it was truckloads of nickels he has kids unload them and put them in he said if I could push a button and convert my entire assets to nickels I do it tomorrow I can't ever lose money and I'm up at least 30% so that's e rward another good example is my friend Richard Branson and if you know Sir Richard now as they call it and Richard's a fun guy he's like um look He he'll take risk with his life he'll like get in a balloon go go on a spaceship he's like the oldest 21y old in the world that guy that guy's just having fun all the time except not when it comes to investing when it comes to investing he's like what's the downside how do we protect against the downside that's why he's so successful and so when he was going to take on British Airways with you know building his own Airlines think of the expense and the risk of buying bowling Jets 150 250 Jets so he NE negotiated for a year with Boeing till he finally got the degree that he'd buy all these Jets but a year from now if he was not able to be profitable in business or stay in the business he could return all the Jets with no credit loss no cost to him whatsoever so he had zero downside only upside that's how these guys play and then the fourth one is diversification and when I went through those and saw them with everybody what triggered this latest book The reason I decided to write this final book was I saw that waitest second the most successful people have a different asset allocation they're getting much more asymmetrical risk reward and I also my conversations with Ray doio learned a principal I asked Ry 12 13 years ago we first became friends I said you know I I prepared for like 11 hours for my interview with him was supposed to be 30 minutes and with three and a half hours because he got into it with me he was great and we became friends and I asked him one question I asked him was okay out of all things we've talked about is there one principle above all others that would be the most important investment principle that would make somebody wealthy if they practiced it he goes Tony I have wrestled with that for more than a decade and I can tell you what it is he goes I call it the Holy Grail of investing which is why that that's the title of this book it's really Rey it's not me right and I said well I've lean for what is it he said Tony in order for people to get what they want Financial Freedom they've got a compound right well in order to get higher rates of return you got to take bigger risks which then could cost you getting to the goal that's why I I said location finding that balance what's right for you is so important he said but I discovered something mathematically if you can find 8 to 12 uncorrelated Investments he said you can reduce your risk by 80% and make a slight increase in your upside he said you're eliminating 80% of the risk he go Tony that is the most important thing that's out there people don't know this but now for your audience I'm sure they understand in case they don't if you think about correlated versus non correlated stocks and bonds would be an example right when the econom is going great people want the growth that comes in stocks when thoughts going go great they expect that bonds are going to get them through it right they're not necessarily correlated so I wrote down the principle I started looking to try to find things that are not correlated it's rough in the world we're in today so much is tied together in the public markets and so sure enough as I started doing this looking around I came across an interesting statistic that blew my mind and here's what it is in the last 35 years every stock market in the world has produced a smaller return than private Equity average private equity in that same time so I'll give you an example most people know the S&P 500 the index of the top 500 companies in stock market and if you invested in the S&P over the last 35 years you had an average of a 9.2% compounded return which is amazing you know you're at 5% you're doubling your money every 14 and a half years if you're you know at 9% it's every eight years that's big jump but if you're an average private Equity not the people I interview this book people I interview this book are the 13 biggest in the world so they have like 20% or more compounded for decades one of them in this book is 37% compounded for 26 straight years I it's unbelievable right so when you're compounding that it goes crazy but the average is 14.2 per year so understand this you're compounding 50% greater every single year compounded so so what does that mean if you put a million dollar in the S&P 535 years ago and forgot about it it's worth $26 million today it's unbelievable but if you put a million dollars in the average not these guys in the average private Equity of 14.2 you have $139 million in the same money in the same amount of time so I was like whoa now what are the ultra high netw worth people have 40 4% of of their Assets in private equity and private real estate so I started digging into that area and that's what this book was all about yeah I really liked it there a great chart we should throw up it said what was the lowest fiveyear returns by asset class lowest five years so like how bad can the bad get because everybody tells you about the good nobody tells you about the bad usually and I love this one because private credit was the only one that had a positive return in its lowest five years in the last 30 years 20 years something like that so it was it was cool to see these different asset classes that most people don't have the knowledge of or the access to and I think that's the the premise of the book so who are the people what's the largest number of billionaires and most people think it's Tech and it's not and then they think it's real estate and it's not it's financial services but it's not hedge funds and it's not BC funds some BC funds but not most I very small it's private Equity because they have the money for five years so when the market goes down they don't have to sell they buy when the market goes up they sell they have the room to play right to get things done and they're not just trying to buy something with the right timing they're buying a company and making it better bringing new marketing bring in a new CEO bringing in new systems and building up and then selling it private or taking it public so they have a lot more flexibility and they're the they're the Masters of the Universe so I was like okay let's see what they're doing and my friend I said I'm getting into some of these private Equity but the very best are like you know going to a club and you're you got plenty of money and you're outside if you're not good-look you don't know everybody you're not getting in that club I don't care how much money you have right it's very similar like you know buying a Ferrari and any Ferrari yes but the newest hot sp3 you know they cost 4 million bucks you can't even buy it cuz they're all gone already by collectors who buy them before they even come out well it's very similar for the best people in private Equity I saying I've gotten a few because of my name and some relationships but the amount I'm getting is too small and he just Tony goes um I'll tell you a little secret I'll tell you where I put the majority of my money and this guy's very very wealthy very successful so I'm leaning in and he goes there's this firm in Houston Texas like it's Houston Texas I he's going to say Singapore London you know New York Connecticut right he goes yeah they're off the beaten path they're the best at this they have found a way they're the biggest in the world right now one of the three biggest and they said they found a way where you don't have to buy into the fund where you can buy into the company and own a piece of the company and you own all their funds now if you know how these funds work they make 2% on your money they tie it up for five years and you're willing to tie it up because of the greater returns right but they make 2% of your money if they don't make you anything every year so they have a built-in income that's great and then they get 20% of The Upside if they make you a bunch of money they get 20% % of that and it's not uncommon for them to go from a billion to two billion in five years so they make a 100 million fees in those five years and they make another 20% on a billion they make $300 million on a billion dollar investment that's why they're the wealthiest people in the world like I got know how to do this so I met with these guys in Houston I became a client and then I eventually invested with them I'm partner with them and then I was like man we got to get this out but nobody could take advantage of it now they can't so as a result we put it out there so you can imagine I own now 65 of the largest private Equity firms I own a piece of them as a partner in every fund that they have so and I'm not there working every day till 2 in the morning like they are in those pieces the other one I'll tell you about is you read the book so you know is sports I always wanted to own a sports team I was gr totally poor you wanted to be a baseball player right that's right you got a good memory I used to go to Dodger Stadium every once in a r Moon way off in the Deep far seats in right field the cha s you could bue and I I bled dodger blue I'm a piece of the Dodgers but to get to that point the first team I was able to make a purchase of and be a partner in was the Lac football club the soccer team there we built the stadium I got to help design it it was fun I got to with my friend Peter goober is just a genius but the amount of money time and energy and the amount of like a microscope in your bum that they do to qualify you is mindboggling right to do it so but now in all these sports teams I even have competing teams because rule was changed three years ago this is amazing only a few firms have been able to do it and the rule allows you to buy a small sliver of teams and why would you want a sports team because they're not correlated to the stock market in inflationary Times sports teams do well they've done extremely well they rais the price the hot dog people pay it doesn't matter and they used to be just putting butts in seats but that's not true anymore so I'll give you an example you know this if you read the book um my partner Peter G bought the Dodgers with a group of people Magic Johnson B group people I'm part of it now too and when they bought it they paid $2 billion doll for the fur and everybody's freaking out right I remember the news people are like this is a crazy buy because no one paid more than 800 million for a sports team and most people believe the Dodgers is worth a billion but not two billion so I went to Peter I like I know you're not dumb I know the smartest guy I know so you must know something no one else knows if we're going to do this tell me goes Tony you know I like making movies with Cliffhangers he said I want to make you wait three days CU I'm making announcement when you hear the announcer come over L A little party together they made the announcement he sold the local TV rights just the local TV rights for 7 billion made five billion on the spot so why because sports teams now are media Enterprises of the 100 best shows most watch shows last year 92 were sporting events and they'll watch the ads because everybody's cord cutting everywhere else and going and watching things you know streaming Sports the only thing live you want to see in real time for to have value for you and they can do those ads so and they buy real estate today they they are unbelievable organizations so now I'm a part of the Dodgers of the Warriors the Red Sox the Pittsburgh Penguins I mean I go on and on and on and I have the ownership benefits but I also have something that's not correlated so it's one by 8 to 12 plus on top of that you share in the revenues of every other team's media in other words it's equal share if you're a small team or a big share you keep your local media that you get to sell locally so the income streams are amazing I'll give you an example Michael Jordan we actually bought it Michael Jordan bought the Charlottes for 275 million controlling interests 12 and a half years ago he just sold us we're one of the buyers as a group of buyers for three billion that's his return on that time period in the last 10 years if you take the NBA the the Major League Baseball soccer and hockey those four together they've averaged between them 18% compounded during that time versus 11% they in the S&P 500 so just you're only doubling your return having fun having something you're part of that's really cool and people can have an experience that they once dreamed about without having billions of dollars and go through all the hell of it so there's so many opportunities like this and people can get it get the book it's at the the Holy Grail of investing.com I think there's like a free chapter so you can go download the fre chapter listen there's a free audio chapter you can listen to and then you can pre-order the book it comes out in a few weeks I know we're over but I got to ask you for one thing sure the one thing is we talked a lot about money making it and all that stuff one of the things I pulled away from you was about giving and I think you know when you when I was at the event you were talking about oh I've given I give this many meals every year I think now it's like a billion meals some insane number of because you know you remembered what it was like to not have food and a part of me was like I'm gonna do that someday I should do that I should did myself again I should do that the future when I you know when I'm rich I'm GNA do that too and I think this is probably a pretty common thing easy for him he's Rich what does it mean what does it matter to him to write a $5 million check right I wish it was just five million until well right fair enough until you told a story about giving early on and give and I I I just want you to tell this one story because I think for most people if they made it to this part this will make a bigger difference in their lives than anything else that you tell them because I know it did for me you told the story about going to the salad bar oh yeah going to a salad bar you're 24 years old and you're broke and you had a giving moment that sort of shifted you would you please just tell that one because I think giving is not something you got to wait till you're rich to do which is I think the common misconception I tell people if you won't give a dime out of a dollar you're not going to give 10 million out of 100 million or you know 100 million out of a billion don't kid yourself right and also the value of giving transforms you out of scarcity but the background on it is I was working for Jim Ron this personal development speaker and I really did well and then I did poorly for a while and I was really frustrated I was working hard I wasn't getting the return I was totally broke you know you're in business you make some mistakes and I found myself totally broke again and I'm in this 400 foot bachelor apartment in Venice California feeling sorry for myself and watching Luke and Laura on General Hospital it was just terrible and um I'm down to my final you know 1920 21 $22 I wasn't some change I haven't paid my rent and I got to figure out what to do and what to eat so my focus was okay I'm going to go to this all you can e salad bar taco bar and I'm going to load up for for the winter um and you know spend five bucks in the you know and then I didn't drive there because it was only about three miles but I couldn't pay three bucks for parking too it was just I couldn't do that so anyway long story short I get to the place it's on the water in Marena Del ra it's why I went there there's boats going by and I I can't I don't have a pot to pee in right but I'm visualizing and then my my I a stack of food this high and then the I could see the front door because where I was sitting and the front door opens and this beautiful woman walks in she was just absolutely gorgeous I couldn't help but look then I waited to see if there was a guy with him as if I had any shot at this right and she had a guy with him unfortunately and he was about 3 feet tall and he had a little vested suit on little tie and you know he opens the door for her and he pulled out the chair for her and I was just I was mesmerized and I was moved and I got emotional I don't know why I don't know if it's thinging my own Mom I don't know what it was at the time but anyway the bottom line is when I was done eating I went baited it was 5.95 or something like that and I had the rest of the money in my pocket I had no plan for this and I I'm walking out the door there's that little boy with his mom and her back's to me so I didn't talk to her I wasn't going to her I just went up to him because I was so moved and I just said hey I said my name's Tony what's your name I can't remember his name anymore you know Johnny or whatever it was and he goes uh I said Johnny I said you are a Class Act I said I just want you to know I have so much respect for I saw you hold the door for your lady I saw you pulled the chair out for her you're so present with her and I said take it her lunch like this he goes well she's my mom and I said well that's even more impressive he goes I can't take her to lunch because you know I'm just 11 and and I saides you can I have no plan for it just reached in my pocket took all the money out in the world $19 whatever was left over and dumped it on him with the change and everything right in front of him and his eyes got big and you know garbage can covers and he goes I can't take that I said sure you can't he said how come I said because I'm bigger than you are and then I smiled and he laughed and I didn't even look at the woman I didn't do it for acknowledgement I just walked out that door to get my car and then realized I didn't have my car there because I'd walk so I I look like a stupid white guy skipping my ass I'm sure all the way home I mean I was high as a kite and I had no money and I got home and I was still cool about it and I was full GL I so much and I woke up the next morning with no plan no idea no nothing and no money and it's like I mean no money not a dollar and no one to call to get money from and it was a guy had loaned a, to about two and a half years before when I really didn't have it but he needed it more than I did I loaned it to him so I've been for months been calling and sting you know regular mail to him because it wasn't answering the phone it was no email those days and um and that morning I get my mail and no no call no response that when I get my mail there's all the bills and there's a handwritten note and I open the note and it's from this guy apologizing to me and telling me that he was so sorry I was there for him when he really needed it and he had not been there for me and he had put in you know an extra $200 for interest and so forth so was $1,200 $1,200 is more money than I could live on that for a month in those days right and I just started crying uncontrollably I was like you know why am I crying this is beautiful this is beautiful you know it's like and then I realized wow you know when I had nothing I gave everything and here this is what does this mean I said I don't know what it means but I'm going to decide it means because I didn't give to get and I didn't give what was easy that's why I'm receiving and it's like that day on I can tell you I've had ups and downs I have so many companies the early days I had a couple companies on the verge of bankruptcy they didn't go bankrupt thank God I hung on and made it through it but I never felt that scarcity I never felt that scarcity again since that day because if you get to that point your brain realizes there's more than enough and you can give when you feel like there's nothing there that's that's what transforms you when I interviewed Sir John temp who's the first billionaire investor started with nothing he said to me that the secret to wealth is gratitude right because doesn't matter how much money you have if you're not grateful you're not rich um but then he said also I've never met anybody that tithed for at least 10 years who didn't become wealthy he said Ty there doesn't have to be a church it's just taking 10% of what you're earning and giving it away and I'm proud to say I've given away 177% and I've done quite well um but I did it when I had nothing it's it's there um I want to play one more seed with the audience though and that is if they'd like to have an experience you know they can't come for the you know three or four days yet for an event but they'd like to have an experience since Co started four years ago everybody was trapped at home and I was doing stadiums you know and they started shutting down the stadium tell like put 100 people in the stadium so I decided I'd build a studio and I'd build these 20 foot high you know walls 67 resolution I could see everything and I went to the guys you know who built zoom and I said look you know I need you to help me get to 20,000 30,000 people not a thousand I built software so that people could instead of clapping could shake their phone it would send electric signal and if one person did hear nothing when 20,000 people do it it's like thunder and it allowed me to literally explode in the number of people I reach so now I do a free seminar once a year for three days it's coming up January 25th through 27th just in about a

some of these stories I on the moment in that moment I was like you know what uh I'm gonna start giving and the the idea I came up with I go you know this was a pretty crazy experience I had I just got lucky I bought some Black Friday tickets uh I don't know how I stumbled into this but this was cool and I've I'm a different guy right now and I decided all right I'm GNA start giving I what I did was I said all right next year I'm going to send one person to this I'm going to give somebody an experience to go to upw and I was like every year I'm gonna gift more people than the year before so I've sent 44 people now to your events you know my mom my dad I know anybody anybody who you know other entrepreneurs who I thought you know might like it yes and uh how they responded to this result how did they react out these events 15% of people are um like me they're like they come back and it's like did somebody plug you in you're like electric now what happened to you so 15% of people they're a new person never looked back I would say 70% of people were like that was a great experience I loved it and they're like you know but they didn't fully get like you know for me it was like a a full transformation just being totally honest so 70% of people all the Paul experience yeah exactly and then I would say 50% of people were like what the hell is this um you know this was I don't know what this is and they often you know a lot of people I send are like successful tech people and they come in almost like they want to be the smart guy in the Reddit comments almost and they're like you know they're so worried about he said this and is that the real sta it 54% or 51% I'm like you're missing the point trying to be so you know you're you're being so smart you're being dumb right now and so people have everybody has their own experience I think it's uh you know what I tell them is just go have the experience right go go decide for yourself uh so you know for people who listen to this I'm gonna put a thing in the in the description I want to send people who actually listen to the podcast because I've been sending people I know but now uh you know this year I'll send

today we're talking taxes and we're talking taxes because taxes are my favorite subject they became my favorite subject when I paid way too much in tax when I sold my company and I was so happy and so sad at the same time today's guest had the same problem he sold teachable for over $200 million and then decided you know what he's goingon to go on a renegade to make sure that no entrepreneur pays more taxes than they need to um we basically invited him here and he was like you know I could talk about my story I could talk about my life we were like no dude talk about [Music] taxes Anor welcome to the show man uh and it's a long time coming yeah I'm excited to be here it's weird how I've now accumulated a lot of specific knowledge in this one kind of very narrow topic and I'm excited to share it and the summary of your story and we'll talk about a little bit later in the episode but we want to talk about tax summary of story is Prodigy entrepreneur had a bunch of stuff started in college you started a company called teachable sold it for $250 million and you were 31 uh that was like a courses business now you've got a new thing was called carry now oh no was called oo now called carrye and it's like a 401k like a self-directed 401k thing yeah absolutely it's basically the bigger vision is how do we help people build wealth by saving money on taxes and the solo 401K is our first product but yeah that's the story The quick sort of other bit is I did not grow up in America so I knew nothing about the US Financial system the country I grew up in never had taxes taxes were just not a thing that existed in Oman where I grew up so the first time I heard about taxes was when I was 21 years old I was like wow you actually have to give money that you earn this is crazy uh but yeah you got most of the story by the way before we talk taxes I know we're supposed to start with the taxes thing yeah you you you have earned your seat on my first million you made your first million bucks when you were like 20 years old right with something pretty funny well can you tell that story can you tell the fast version of that story yeah absolutely I was in I was in college at Berkeley and at the time Facebook released the Facebook platforms you could you know send gifts to people answer quizzes and all of that and I built these viral Facebook applications starting from when I was 18 all the way to 20 and it was really fun I mean you know we created personality quizzes like you could answer a few questions and find out how good a kisser you are or which friend's character you're most like if if you have to take a Facebook quiz to figure out if you're a good kisser you're probably a bad kisser right well the funny thing is I'm not I'm not going to name names one of the Facebook Founders actually took that quiz multiple times and I know that because you get their Facebook user ID in the database so user ID number I'm not going to tell you which number it is is was in our database and we're like wow this person really wanted to know but anyways yeah so we created these personality quizzes and then friend quizzes and stuff and yeah you know millions of daily users uh was able to make a million dollars before S21 which was pretty cool yeah that's amazing um so you you've earned your your street credit here for us uh on my first million all right so let's talk let's talk taxes if I'm an entrepreneur what are the biggest things I need to know about taxes what are the things I should be knowledgeable of and do doing in order to save money cool the first thing I think everyone should know even people who are not entrepreneurs yet is the US tax code is rigged in favor of business owners um it's very intentional but you can look at a country's tax code and learn a lot about what it stands for and in America two things stand out the tax code is rigged in favor of people involved in real estate it's the most tax advantag asset class and two people who start businesses so the first thing I tell someone is if you are a full-time W2 employee somewhere if you are not yet a business owner consider becoming a business owner since it is the single biggest thing you can do to optimize your taxes like that is just written into the DNA of this country and it's something that I never realized until I started digging and was like wow there's the playbook for what you can do to pay less in taxes is 10 times bigger if you are a business owner so it's rigged in favor of business owners and real estate and most people kind of ignore this I would say like the advice I got growing up was you know go to a good school so you can get a good job that's what winning was and um and even the advice around money which was kind of like you know hope you try try to get like a raise maybe 10% you know try to save but the hard part about saving is that your biggest expense is taxes right your your your taxes might be 30 to 50% depending on where you live and and how what bracket you're in uh that's your biggest expense and that's every single year off every dollar you make unless you're able to Shield it with some of these uh these things you're G talk about I think I I don't know if you remember but Warren Buffett back in the day had a famous quote where he's like my secretary pays a higher tax rate than than than I do right yeah what an well I think I think the issue though it's not an issue just it is what it is if you have W2 income I'm almost positive there's close to no way that you can reduce that your tax liability other than maybe um like minor percentage points you can do crazy stuff by using your spouse you can have your spouse become a real estate professional so then you as a couple can write write off real estate depreciation but you have to get pretty fancy to do things with W2 so you're right there is a universe of things just much smaller and then like let's say I make a million dollars a year as a business owner like I I actually don't know what the savings can be I know with qsbs I saved a huge sum but I don't know what I could reduce my my taxable income by as a business owner but I know it's a lot whereas the W2 it ain't well let's tell the W2 story real quick because uh I know people in San Francisco that have high paying jobs at like you know a Facebook or Google and you know they're marrying somebody and they're like hey guess what honey you're a real estate broker now they're like what I don't want to do real estate you want you're a real estate professional now it's like they have to get get the status and then they're buying airbnbs in order to offset their uh their W W2 income we literally say that like tongue and cheek right we have a presentation on like how do you lower your tax bill as a W2 professional Point number three is marry a real estate professional like it's like tongue and cheek but it actually it actually one of the very few things you can do as a W2 professional but I don't think anyone pays more in taxes than highly paid Tech employees like in terms of tax bracket that's about as bad as you can get you know two people in San Francisco making $400,000 a year together cool you're paying half of it in taxes yeah and is before it even comes to you it's just taken out of your paycheck before you even get it um all right so let's say we are an entrepreneur Sam mentioned qsbs I'm guessing that's going to be number one on your list because it's such a huge Advantage explain what it is and then explain the kind of beginner level and then the advanced level version of doing it cool so four big letters in the US tax code this may be the single most generous tax break available today it's called qsbs qualified small business stock this is insane so when you look at all these tech companies being built and sold the reality is most of them are going to have shareholders that pay very little in taxes and that's because of what's called qsbs which roughly says if you hold shares in a C corporation for five years you pay no taxes on up to $10 million in gains um it applies to Founders it applies to employees it also applies to investors and it's such a generous tax you're forgetting the up to 10 million or 10 times your basis whichever is greater great point it's a great point it's either $10 million or 10 times what you pay for the shares as a Founder it's most likely going to be 10 million since you buy your shares for almost nothing but this is this is massive like when I sold my company I live in New York state and in New York state even New York State doesn't charge you taxes so I only had to pay New York City taxes on the first $10 million in gains and this is just by size of benefit it's absurd right because you think about W2 employees getting taxed so heavily and here you have startup Founders employees investors paying nothing on10 million when they sell their company Sean I think California is the only state that doesn't recognize qsbs there's actually six there's actually six or seven states there's a couple that partially don't recognize it 43 don't 43 um you'd pay no state taxes as well all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using HubSpot landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM if you're not paying any taxes on 10 million in gains you would normally otherwise pay long-term capital gains which would be roughly 20% plus there's like a 3.6% something extra fee so it's like you know basically 2.3 million is what you get net extra correct that's that's the actual in your pocket in New York substantially more don't forget there's another million plus in New York taxes that I'm not paying Okay cool so and then yeah so for California you'll pay pay another 133% on top if New York if you're in one of the QBs uh you know free states then you're saving another let's say million to Mill 1.3 million in uh in additional state taxes so about two and a half to three and a half million dollars in your pocket yep or or I've got a friend who had a company who was uh I won't say publicly but Anker you and I are very close friend who had a company that was I think an sc Corp he uh converted to a C Corp at a $30 million valuation and So eventually when he sells it will be 10 time 30 so $300 million so that difference which is uh I can't do the math but 20 20 $270 million gain that will be the taxfree portion I was I was saving that for the advanced strategies but yeah there's a there's a lot you can do to truly like multiply this benefit so I heard about the 10 million thing and I was like wow this is insane like really really cool but then I found out that the limit is per shareholder per company so where this gets interesting is if I give some shares to my mom my brother my dad each of us now have our own $10 million limit so as a family we have a $40 million limit or if you go down the estate planning rabbit hole which it's a little complicated but at a certain point you know hire an attorney figure it out um you can set up trust I set up trust for my future children trust for charity and each of these trusts get their own $10 million benefit which multiplies this theoretically as many times as possible personally so what happens if you what if you set up for three future kids and you only have one Future kid um you can basically set up like so what I did for instance right I have no kids is you can set it up for future beneficiaries as well so it's any of my future children are entitled to to have the trust what's important is it's an irrevocable gift you can't take it back yourself okay but when if you don't have kids now um it has to go to either my parents my brother I've named a bunch of different beneficiaries so there's like a line there's like a there's like a order order yeah you're like the only Brown parents who are like oh Anor it's okay if you don't have children it's okay as long as you're happy as long as you're happy it's okay I wish I wish honestly that would be it would be worth the $10 million to not be harassed by my parents so this is called like stackable trust right like this is called qsbs stacking so couple of things I didn't realize the first time around that I'm doing differently this time around so the first time around I was the only person to hit the holding threshold because I didn't realize how this works but this time around I've given all my early team members shares instead of options so they can start their clock ticking that's a really important thing that a lot of people don't realize is you have to own the shares for five years not options the way that companies get around this right is you do the 83b election right uh and you basically buy your shares at the super low price we should explain how archaic the IRS is so there's this thing called the 83b which I don't exactly know what it means but it's basically you may whenever I start a company I've got to write a check to myself for $100 or I write from s par to the name of the company Inc and I have to mail it to the IRS and I like handw write on it and I write a letter to them and I say this is s par I'm writing you one check for $100 and I'm literally writing this out by hand will you please uh send this sted envelope back to me that has proof that you receive this it's literally like the Tooth Fairy dude yeah it's like the tooth fairy and you write the you write address and you just write like IRS like uh I forget where it is in California and by the way you have to do this three weeks I think or 90 days 30 days 30 days 30 days 30 days after you do this they have to get it and so right when you file the company you've got to run to the convenience so I get your stamp and envelope and hurry up and do this thing and then you write this out and somehow this works and what's even crazier is the IRS won't check in on you to make sure you did this right unless you get in trouble and you have to like save this like envelope like gotcha I got the envelope I filed it away like it's crazy how this works and if you don't do it you have to pay millions of dollars in taxes like it's a very very hundreds of millions yeah it's a very high stakes document yeah it's a high stakes document and you like have to write it I remember like thinking like I gotta make sure my seven is perfectly clear so that's not a t or like it's like a very stressful thing and you have to write it up by hand it's crazy how like archaic it is I I didn't understand this rule um but our CFO was like hey did you do your 83b and I'm like n no it's be fine she's like no no you have to do it within 30 days and I was like okay well can you just like you know where's the form can you send me the link she's like no no you have to print this out you got to go take it to the post office and I was like oh man and she looked at me she's like you don't do those types of things do you I was like no I don't run errands like that I I I just simply don't I'm out of the postal system like I don't mail things I don't check my mail like I'm out of that whole system in general yeah you're like how many SS do I you like 50 40 was what part do I lick and I'm like licking the form and I'm like then I I I finally have it and I realized I'm on day 37 and so for the next five years it just haunted me I was like I didn't do that goddamn form and then when my company finally basically failed I was like didn't matter I was like it didn't come back to bite me because I was for five years had been dreading that my lack of uh you know belief in doing like doing annoying paperwork things was going to bite me and I was so happy when that one entity failed and that the other entity was the one that old I was like this is this is amazing but here's the crazier part is you can claim you did it in time right so very technically what the document means is it says I am like tax me on what the value is today I'm choosing to be taxed up front but if not for signing this anytime your company grows in valuation you could theoretically be liable for taxes can you imagine what a nightmare that is like let's say you raise a series a a series B A series C yeah you would not you wouldn't have money you wouldn't have money but you'd have a tax bill it's like really really bad so there's a dark side to this which is that uh sometimes if you join a company later like I think bolt got was pretty popular this happened at bolt so bolt was like hey we are lending our our employees money to buy their shares God that was such a Shell at a like five billion or 10 billion dollar valuation and they were like see this is great because now they're goingon to start their clock of owning the shares but people were like okay so what happens if the valuation goes down and there like now not only do my shares become worthless I owe the money for those shares at that premium value valuation and people were like this is not going to end well the full story hasn't played out you know bolt is uh is still going so it's it's unclear exactly what's going to happen with that it's trending in the direction like that was a bad idea I think it's undoubtedly a bad idea it was a 2021 valuation like tens of billions of dollars like it's it's not good and people saw it coming and it's it's really bad when you now like I'm I'm hoping they forgive those loans because otherwise you have not only are you making nothing in equity you have you owe 80 $100,000 just for working there at our company our investor was like here's the promissary note you don't have to come up with the cash and we'll forgive this if this ever happens and I was like can you write that they're like no we can't write that down it's like you just have to trust us I like okay I do trust you and they did if they if they would have write it down it's taxed to you as income so that's why they can write it down right yeah all right I want to go to the counter opinion so we got friends who you know they're like oh the number one thing get out of California you schmuck uh come to come to Texas no no no forget Texas you're still feder paying federal tax come to Puerto Rico what do you think about that should you should I move to Puerto Rico to save money in taxes according to so to me this gets to the meta level right like why do we have money what is the point of money and I think there's two camps of people camp one is like they look at their life as as this vessel to make as much money as possible and other people look at money as a tool to live the life you want so I very firmly fit into the latter camp where money enables me to live the life I want yes I don't want to pay more in taxes than I have to and you know gamifying the tax system is also fun just because like I'm a hustler and it's kind of fun to do but I want to live the life I want and to me that means living where you want so I I would I would personally never ever move somewhere just to save on taxes well you've done the exact opposite you you you live currently in you live in the highest tax place in America I believe correct and um I'm totally fine with that because again like money enables me to live the life I want I just tend to think and it's ironic because you know I'm running a company that helps people save money on taxes the kinds of people who spend all their life worrying about taxes are some of the unhappiest people I know so I don't ever want to get to that point and sometimes when you move to like you know a Utopia with zero taxes you're surrounded with everyone else that moved there for that reason that's your group your friends are other people who hate taxes and I don't know if if you know that's the Social Circle I want dude we had John Lee Dumis on the Pod do you remember this Sean and we were talking about taxes and he was like bragging about how he moved to Puerto Rico or something like that dude he was glowing I thought he was pregnant I was like wow this guy's so happy he moved to Puerto Rico and he was so happy about it and he and then he started making fun of me that I didn't live in Puerto Rico like do you remember that he was like insulting me and I was like John we're not close enough that you can make fun of me that hard this a podcast um you know I think that the thing you know a lot of people who listen this podcast we all share one goal prob uh we we have many different goals but one we share is we all want Financial Freedom and most people think Financial Freedom is oh I'm free to buy what I want do what I want it's the financial leather jacket you're a financial badass now all right cool but I think the real Financial Freedom is when money doesn't have a hold on you so it's not about exactly you being able to buy and do certain things it's that money no longer dictates your decisions money does not control you or or uh make you do things that you don't want to do and so it's it's more of freedom from money not freedom to spend money you had a point on on this thing I want you to explain and it's really a direct attack at Sam you said the point of having money is to not worry about money if you are wealthy but still stressed about money which I see all the time you're missing the point all right Sam look this man in the eye and unker tell him D I don't I don't blame I don't blame him if if it's him or anyone else cuz these are beliefs we form very young in life like at to some degree they're not even fully conscious beliefs so if they're not conscious beliefs to try and sort of program it but yeah I have so many like super weldy friends friends you know with hundreds of millions of dollars who are stressed about the pursuit of more money they are 100 millionaires who want to be billionaires or something and and again like you said it really well right the whole point of money is to be free from it and do what you want like to me the best thing I bought with money was being able to say no to a job that would have paid me tens of millions of dollars in equity because guess what I don't need it anymore can I just say Sean so look I give let me defend myself I came on here and I express uh my belief on money and how I'm fearful of it and how I want it to make me happy it doesn't but you did Camp MFM you told me about Joe gbia Joe gbia is worth1 billion doll and you told me this crazy story and it blew my mind about how happy is and everything like this and so I radically changed my opinion on money and happiness and now I realize I just need 10 billion to be happy that's all I need is 10 billion so like my opinion has been changed it's no longer about scarcity mindset if I have 10 billion I will be happy there you go I'm glad I'm glad you've been enlightened all right Anor um give me a couple other quick hot takes before we no you're gotta make fun of Sean now which is there's no true Alpha yeah let's frame it you said there's no true Alpha in investing I realized that's sort of a Fool's game that's why instead I realized I can I can optimize my tax setup and make more money that way than try to beat the market as a guy who uh has been attempting to beat the market for quite some time now successfully how's that been going wait answer the question what are the wins and what are the losses and we're not talking about private we're talking about uh have you been try have you did you try to beat the market in terms of public too he looks kind of sheepish he looks kind of sheepish he's he's like yeah trying to make me cry What's Happening Here uh no no no I I I don't know I actually don't know if you pick and choose stocks I know you pick and choose private companies but that was like your job I agree that most people cannot beat the market I do not agree that nobody can beat the market over I know that that's an unpopular opinion and I know that you know the famous Warren Buffett bet I know all those things I just refuse to believe that it's it's not a bell curve so um I think the people that beat the market spend all their lives doing that with their own Capital right like think about Jim Simmons right his hedge fund is returned like 40% on average they're not taking outside Capital what I think is a little bit of a scam is a lot of the financial services industry that tries to promise you outsize returns um who promises that like like like what what's that stereotype hedge funds because I I've never met like a financial adviser that would be dumb enough to promise that any any actively managed fund right so yes hedge funds are a big big sort of thing any active stock picking fund I mean there's a lot of stock picking funds that charge you one to two 1% a year um and their portfolio they say will outperform or whatever um so does every real estate fund Venture fund basically like anything that charges outsized fees anything that charges more than a Vanguard fund that's crazy that that people like buy into that though correct so our our thesis is all always like okay fine I do think better tax strategy can actually create alpha alpha is a you know Finance term for like you will outperform um and using that tax Alpha to just put more dollars in the market I think is a smarter approach and the approach I like and you know I'm taking with my money as well out of 100% of your net worth is 100% of it in the S&P index or no absolutely not like I have I have a lot of it not in the S&P index but that's my fund money I think there's a good chance I don't outperform um and a lot of it is in private uh private investing which are funds that I own but I think I'm the only person I know who has a fund is biggest mine and charges no management fees the average Venture fund charges 20 to 25% just in management fees and and the average person does not realize that we charge zero percent Sean do you know how I tell tell you that I don't buy individual stocks yeah I real I looked at my portfolio the other day it was the first time in a year that I looked at it and I realized I was wrong I've done it twice or three times the company that I did it on was play was Playboy uh I had read I read their annual report yeah you can't just call their magazine their annual report dude that's called their monthly calendar yeah but yeah actually their annual report they have a lot of photos uh and oh Jenny old Jenny McCarthy picture holding up the ballad sheet that's nice uh I uh I did that because I was like oh look like they're prop they're their their real estate asset is worth more than what they're trying to sell the company for and I was like that's smart I'll do that did not win on that one so lost on that one also did coinbase at the IPO God and then I sold it uh two weeks before it popped like three months ago or whatever whenever it was so I've I've done I've done two you've also done it with HubSpot you got HubSpot stock you could have sold it Diversified you decided to hold that is a decision to buy that's correct I and and with BMB yeah correct the two biggest Holdings in your portfolio correct so you do it too we all do no those aren't my those aren't my two biggest Holdings the my index funds are significantly larger but uh yeah I have done so I've done it as well so I'm like you Anor I have my fund money thing it's just that I happen to have a fun money stash that's 80% instead of 20% yeah I mean look at the end of the day as long as we realize what we're doing it's fine right like I I think we all have to learned this lesson ourselves in 2021 I thought I was a damn genius I was like these index funds are stupid my portfolio is up like 300% I should just be a stock picker for life and yeah then you come back to reality and realize what was there was was there a day where you're like H huh that's not the way it was many because again if you remember there's such an insane runup for a while you couldn't lose every company was up 100% day on day it was when investing was the most fun it should not be that fun and then yeah there were numerous days of like cool I've lost $300,000 today cool down half a million dollars today cool and just that happen happening repeatedly while the S&P 500 kind of just kept chipping away and growing and you know Nvidia comes out of nowhere and all these stocks that I only held because I had an index fund otherwise I had no exposure Sean let me an Anor let me tell you this crazy story about uh tax stuff that I learned this is like one of those tax hacks I'm not the biggest fan of tax hacks but this is actually a good one I met this lady she was speaking at one of our events and uh I don't want to say her name of her company but she was on the commercial for this credit card company because she loved the credit card so much and her business was doing let's say 50 million a year and she was putting a lot of of it on a credit card and it was giving her $300,000 a year of either points or cash back and according to the IRS a cash cash back from a credit card is considered a rebate correct and I believe you get up to I don't remember what it is I don't know what it is now but three years ago when she told me this she said it's uh $300,000 a year of of rebates is that you know what it is nowadays is it same something like that depends on the card itself but yeah oh I I thought it was by the government I thought it was limited to the government must have been limited to the credit card she was getting $300,000 a year of cash back of which she was like that's my salary I don't take a salary or I take a very unmeaningful salary for my company and I'm living off my credit card points and that was pretty wild did you know you could actually pay your taxes at a credit card and it's for some people you could actually like Arbitrage that where again this is insane I would never do it but it's just I just found it interesting you can pay your taxes on a credit card there's not a very high extra fee and in a lot of cases you can actually end up slightly better it's a very painful thing to do David David Hower did it David Hower sold his company grasshopper I think for $200 million and he paid his taxes on his AMX and he called AMX and he told him what he was going to do and so I don't I don't remember what the bill is but let's say 20 or $30 million of a tax bill he paid that on his AMX and he goes I've got I just got you know a couple decades with the flights insane that's that's the other thing with credit card points is once you learn how to use them for travel the cash back feels less good like yes the cash back has a theoretical value but there's so much more valuable applied to travel once you kind of learn how the game works what's the smart way to do it okay so the thing you always want to avoid is never spend the points on your credit card website that is the thing almost everyone does and you lose a ton of value there I do that yeah so what you want to do instead is create an account with an airline like I do it with Emirates a lot because I fly internet or with Air France km the International Airlines are the best look up a flight on their loyalty program do the transfer it takes like 30 seconds and you'll probably save 70% points right there no way 70% yeah I've I've tested this a lot because what these it says transfer like there's a tiny link that says Transfer Partners and you have to that's where you send your points you never spend it in the thing that's going to save you so Point I've spent I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on flights over the past 10 years through Chase my Chase card I found this out two years ago it was life changing yeah absolutely what you got you got hosed bro that it's so bad to do it wait you knew that Sean yeah I PID for this guy Mo points he's like this guy who'll call you he'll teach you about credit card points uh or like he he'll just be like what's your situation here's what your credit card setup should be and here's how to use it and so he showed it to me and I was like wow that was like the best $300 I've ever spent because that one session which I thought H 300 bucks to do this call that's that's kind of a lot of course I mean the Savings in just understanding how to book the flights better because he's like this is luxury travel you want to travel first class all around the world here's what you need to do and for for me I have an Ecom business so we're spending millions of a year in ads so he's like you need this MX gold because it gives you 4X on every Facebook point that you uh every dollar you spend on Facebook or Google and so you're getting 4X multipliers he's like but then you got to transfer it out and then you got to use this website website like points at me or whatever to um be able to search for points across all the airlines yeah I think just transferring out is the 820 if you want to tell someone in one sentence how to do better transfer your points out do you have any more of those little little tricks what else you got in your hat come on magician pull something that's Prett aesome solo 41k so that's the one that you have on here that I don't know anything about what is a solo 41k so solo 401K this is the first product we built and I had an LLC for a while I was earning some you know some random money and I saw I found this account called a solo 401K which is like your own like your corporate 401K but it exists exclusively for you and with that you can do really cool things so one you can put in up to $69,000 a year typically if you max out your corporate account it's very hard to hit the max because your company match is not enough but with a solo 401K you can put in $69,000 a year get that as a tax deduction um the second thing is you could do the whole thing as a Roth contribution so if you read about Peter theel and how he grew his you know billion dollar Roth IRA traditionally with the Roth IRA you can only put in $7,000 can you tell the Peter teal story real quick how did he use a Roth IRA to make billions oh man this was both genius and kind of possibly illegal but what he did is he bought his founder shares at PayPal with his Roth IRA so he spent like $2,000 to buy PayPal shares that became worth $27 million when PayPal sold and then he had $27 million to just make all kinds of Investments he allegedly bought his like Facebook shares 10% of Facebook from his Roth IRA so he's gonna turn 59 and a half in a year and he's gonna have five billion do taxfree which is pretty wild the wildest part about that what you just said is that Peter teal only made $27 million selling PayPal yeah yeah I realize me and Peter teal are sort of uh we're sort of you know apples and apples I guess right Sam like the the hustle and PayPal netted the founders very similar amounts of money that's kind of amazing well what what we don't know is if Peter theel H had others shairs not in his rotha which is quite possible actually ah damn news too G to be true let's just take it probably not he's gonna have to show that to me for me to change my opinion yeah yeah I'm not gonna let facts get in the way of me beating Peter te what about uh can a person have more than one 401K yeah so that's what's cool is if you have a full-time job and a side hustle you can have a solo 401K for your business while still contributing to your employer 401K um but because it's your own 401K you can invest it in anything right your employer 401K has like a list of very specific assets with a solo 401K you can invest it however you want if you need liquidity you could borrow up to $50,000 from it it's simply the most powerful retirement account in America but it's not available unless you have your own business isn't the normal 401K kind of a racket like the thing where they're like you can only buy these These funds using our 401K is that because they get a lot of them have fees no it comes from the 401K provider the long answer is uh corporate 401K plant are subject to irell laws like employment retirement investment something act and those those acts are just there to protect employees but as a result employers can't do things that help them like there limits on how much you can contribute to yourself if your employees are part of the same plan limit to Investments but if there's no employees go crazy so the solo 41k you could put that in could you like put in real estate could you put in anything is it like absolutely if yeah the only thing you can't do which is where the whole Peter thei thing may be slightly illegal is you can't have a self-dealing transaction so I can't invest in my startup I can invest in Sam's startup that's totally fine but I can't invest in my own company I can't invest in my house but I can do commercial real estate gotcha okay that's self-dealing for him is it if you that's just a a major Angel investment he was the founder too which is why it's sketch he was the founder of PayPal remember if he was just an angel investor it's fine to much he you know we might might be an accident for encor if you keep talking like this out loud he's got5 billion dollar writing on nobody paying too much attention to this yeah I mean look so people because know people ask us all the time can I do what Peter theel did and I was like look it may be fine if you don't own over 50% I wouldn't because again like the thing with the IRS is a lot of these things are not clear rules there rules written a certain way somewhat interprets them somehow the IRS challenges it sometimes the IRS loses in court and that's how loopholes are established right so so like the problem that I have with my my personal bookkeepers or accountants my CPA like they're pretty reactionary so it's like at the end of the year like we are dealing the problems and then everyone makes the same thing where they say next year I'm doing this right but I'll worry about it in like two or three months and then two or three months becomes like way later that's the real New Year's resolution to be honest is the 3 week after tax after file your taxes is the the real New Year's resolution to be honest candidly that's the problem we're having cuz right now we're realizing we have to educate the CPAs a lot and almost everyone that comes to us this a bu a sample they do not like their CPA um and we don't do that yet right like maybe there's a world will do it but who do you have like do you hire like a tax strategist who is like more offensive and do they they work in tandem with your CPA what do you do so for me personally once I've you know gone down this Rabbit Hole um we're doing this internally we have a program where we help people with the tax strategy part we don't do tax filings I'm basically using our our own services but yeah there's a big part that's tax strategy that is not the person signing off your tax return should they be separate the way the world is written today the like just laws and stuff it is because the person filing your taxes typically doesn't do that much strategy um it's sort of just why like even if let's say you want to set up a trust you need an estate attorney who's different from your financial adviser who's different from your accountant and to the average person you're like why why can't one person do this and those are the kinds of things we're thinking a lot about like how do we productize this in some way shape or form while still being compliant because compliance is a big big big part anytime you try and build these kinds of businesses so I was so uh you know stressed out last tax season uh you know that I was like okay how am I going to do things differently this year so I I was like I'm going to treat this like it's it's it's my own business it's its own product it's its own company I'm starting and so I was like I'm going to go on a road show and I'm going to go and basically see who's out there you know go give me your best pitch and I created a data room I was like this is my tax setup and I put all the time in like here's a flowchart here's my prior years returns here's what here's what I paid in taxes here's what my expectation is for next year I was like here's a turnkey data room so I don't even have to have a phone call with you I'm like I have the phone call and I on the phone call I tell them exactly what I want because for some reason I would like go to these tax people and I think it's an insecurity It's like because I don't know as much about taxes as you I kind of defer everything and I almost become like I work for you and then I'm like like splash water on my face I'm like wa no no I'm paying you hold on wait this is backwards you work for me I forgot why am I pretending like I I I have to tiptoe around even asking you for what I want and so I go in and I'm like I felt this way I never want to feel this way again I want somebody who's going to take care of everything I you know everything from I want you to literally I want you to be able to pay bills if I need you to up to filing my my returns for all of these you know I got 12 entities all 12 entities um and I need you to do strategy and I need you to be coming to me every you know every quarter with proactive suggestions about what I should be doing um that's what I want who can provide me that and I went on tour basically and it's such a better way than I was doing before I highly recommend this for anybody who's like has enough income and kind of uh business value where that makes sense to do which I don't know what that number is probably different for a lot of people it wouldn't have made sense sense for me three years ago to do that it's like ah whatever you're paying you know a couple hundred K in taxes or you know even a million dollars in taxes probably not worth that much effort to go do but as you scale I think it's important to do that I'm realizing now yep and I also think it has to be a collaboration it's very hard a lot of people are like oh if I had a tax guide they would solve all my issues but a lot of the best strategies they're like longterm right let's say you want to start a business to get acquired 5 years later that's the kind of stuff that you like need a partnership to be discussing and have someone you're working with somewhat at least quarterly right because there's a lot of this stuff that like this the more you know the more you'll push them and the better the things you'll achieve I'm actually going to do that data room thing that's the second thing that you've said in the last few months that it's like going to have a change in my life that's really smart the first thing bro we talk twice a week on this podcast that's the second thing in months that was good yeah yeah well the well like a lot of the stuff you say I'm like I'm either already doing that or I don't want to do that or uh like I'm not sure if you're right or that's only okay but the you said that data room thing is actually a really Wise Wise way to look at it the other thing that you said it was and it hit me I was like that's brilliant and it was uh when you were selling one your uh your house in San Francisco you so like I forget what real estate agents make 6% but you're like but 6% is not that that the difference between 2 million and 2.2 million is like 6% isn't that meaningful for the realer but it's really meaningful for me as the owner that's a six figure difference so I'll just give you my real estate agent I'll tell you hey if you get anything above my asking price of like 2.1 which is my happy number but if you get anything above that like 2.2 I'll actually give you like 30% of the fee so I'm selling a piece of property now and that's what I told my I went I just right after the the Pod I went and called her right away I go hey how about this yeah I didn't do 30% that's crazy but I did more I I did more than the 6% so you uh you messed that one up a little bit but it's okay well but but but the thing is is like even I I don't remember what dollar right each additional dollar past that is like yeah you said like 10% I think you even said like You' buy this person a burka bag you said something like crazy I had a negative incentive too no no I said and if you don't get me the price that you comped me when you when you won this listing okay there has to be some incentive or disincentive if you don't live up to your word what real estate agents do is on the way in they're like they woo you oh we're gonna this will be great I've done such similar sales I think we can get you what what price do you think oh yeah I think we can get you that price and then afterwards two weeks later they're like oh just the market is so you know right now you know the thing is blah blah blah and then then then they're just negging you and they're trying to reduce your expectations so that when an offer comes in you'll take it whatever it is because they just want to turn the deal over yeah right because they're they're getting 3% on two billion bucks they don't really care if it's two point if it's 2 million 50,000 or two million they'd rather just get the deal done and so I knew that they do that neing so up front when I said when he's promising me the world I said all right cool but if you don't do it you got to buy my wife this bag and um he was like laughing and I was like I let it sit there for a second and he's like oh you're for real and I was like yeah he's like okay deal and then literally when we were coming when we're coming to do the deal he's like I really don't want to buy your wife that bag let me go back to them and see if I can get more and he got an extra like $30,000 a after that uh you know that last comment so I appreciate it the reason why it broke my frame was because these are like a realtor is like uh you you think like well for some reason you think this is just the law or like there is no negotiating like this is how it's always been done and I must do it this way I'm just and and when I was thinking about it I was like no that the way that he actually said is 100% better I didn't realize that I could like question them right you know what I mean and there's actually like what's crazy is there's people who do that with the IRS as well so for example Sean Parker I believe is the guy who created either created or he was uh important with helping create it with opportunity zones in real estate yep and like I remember like reading about opportunity zones and I be like oh Shawn Parker created I'm like wait what and I guess like the story is is he was young he was still in his 20s and he convinced the government that it's wise to invest into opportunity zones which is uh real estate that's in areas that are impoverished or or we want them to be better and I'm like how ballsy of that kid to go and convince the IRS or the government that this is the right move and I and I love like stories like that and uh that that was it was a wild story let's do a couple more before we before we finish so you said owning real estate with your business what's this one yeah so another great example right so Sam said okay what if I have a million dollars in business profits like what can I do to lower my tax bill just buying your office building or if you have a physical building connected to anything you're doing whether it's your office whether you have a retail location if you own that real estate you can use depreciation um to offset 20 30% of the purchase price as a business law that year so which is why you'll see a lot of old school businesses they actually own their properties they're not just renting since you just save so much money um people take this you can also do this with cars and you know buy a vehicle attached to your business you have the whole like insanity where you can actually depreciate more of the purchase price if your car weighs over 6,000 pounds which is insane and why you have the whole like G-Wagon tax right off meme um but yeah owning real estate of your businesses is massive that's like the classic like immigrant story which is like a mom and pop like came here from Vietnam and then they bought they just they eventually bought their Corner Store building and then they the building becomes worth significantly more than the corner store and then they bought their G wagon and the G wagon like again T like business owners were already very favored as Were Real Estate developers but when Trump was in office he actually took it the next level with the tax cuts and jobs act that basically doubled those benefits it gave an extra benefit to business business owners where they get to deduct 20% of their income called qualified business income deduction and it allowed real estate developers um and and your boy Nick Hubert talks about all the time to do what's called bonus depreciation and depreciate 20 to 30% of the purchase price upfront um so even though the code is already written this way there's always new incentives to further make it even better for business owners and real estate developers let's do some of these uh other things you you you had a good thing on happiness I want to read it to you basically you were like happiness it's not that complicated uh what is the kind of what are the four things that that actually matter when it comes to happiness yeah I mean look after I sold my company I spent two years traveling chilling you know I was like wow you know we spent all our lives waiting to like retire what if I just lived a retired life now um and a lot of f was like okay fine what are my happiness triggers and I found for me was very very simple um the two two like critical things for like my environment were plenty of time Outdoors ideally with sunlight like constant movement like Sam didn't believe me when I told him I walk 20,000 steps a day at to produce receipts um doing work that's an insane amount that is an insane amount three and a half years it's just it's just what keeps me keeps me going dude my my trailing 90 days because we had the baby was uh 3,100 steps a day yeah that to me that's misery like I I just need to I need to be in motion what do what do you do to get those 20,000 steps like do you have did you like replace meetings with walking meetings or something like what what did you do in your meetings phone calls like um a big part of my rtin playing sports every day though again like it's winter here and that's why I hate winter cuz like now I'm not getting my outdoor time and my walking has come down a lot um but yeah so happiness triggers movement uh being able to spend time Outdoors having a higher purpose for me that's work with meaning but for other people you know it's religion it's just something that is like bigger than themselves and four is like relationships that count I can like simplify my life to these four components and like repr like that's all it takes for at least me to just be very very happy are you dating anyone uh no right now you probably crush it though in that department right yeah look I mean again I I enjoy I enjoy being single uh but at the same time look I'm 34 years old and the parental pressure is ramping up we'll see how it goes you're like I can defeat the IRS but not not the parental pressure yeah how old were you Sam when you when you and Sarah got together she was 22 and I was 25 oh damn you were young it didn't feel that way cuz I went pretty crazy between like 19 and 24 like I I I I did some fun things yeah actually I've actually drank a beer with you there's not a lot of people at this chapter of your life that have done that but yeah yeah that's true that's true and I had a lot of fun I did this CrossCountry motorcycle trip and after I just sold the company and I didn't sell it for a lot of money I had like $50,000 in my bank account but I was like 23 riding my motorcycle cross country telling people I just sold my company on Tinder was this apartment list or whatever yeah yeah yeah yeah it was two apartment L and I and I just hosted a conference so I had money and like it was I was the coolest guy ever for like eight weeks and then I met my wife like right when I got home yeah um but uh yeah we've been together for a while uh it's honestly awesome I like I I don't even like talking about this because I remember when we got married we had to go to like and talk to a priest because we got married in Catholic church and I was like telling her I was like telling the priest I was like yeah we uh you know we're a good partnership we talk about like business and stuff all the time he's like well what about love so like I don't even like mentioning this but like basically dating someone who is smart and you eventually want to marry it's actually makes you more money that's not the most important thing but I think like what I've learned is having a good relationship I think actually was the greatest financial decision I made I mean you're not you're probably less distracted right like people in people in relationships are like eventually like on are kind of more stable I think I remember when I was when I was selling my business I was negotiating with the the dude who like runs General Atlantic big big private Equity Fund and he's like an old school guy he's like are you married I was like no kids no he like I don't like that I can't trust single people you have nothing to lose I I don't like it I would feel much better about this deal if you were married and had a family because you're scared you'd be more nervous more scared of stuff you're like for for $250 million I can get a 30-day fiance right now sir what what do you need yeah yeah so Sean when your wife goes out of town are you like me where you're like uh what the hell am I supposed to do like what do what do I do it's three hours of heaven but anything beyond three hours I'm like H this boring like this is this sucks like it's so quiet in here like I started walking around circles like my dog or something I don't know what to do I want to talk about one more thing we have a large Indian listenership you're welcome yeah thank you Sean uh I feel like everyone in my life is is like all my best friends are Indian you're like going on a tear on social media saying uh like particularly you're like you know East Asian people we've got the stereotype of of us not having a lot of muscle in reality it's just because we eat like or what did you say the Indian diet is just by default not great for building strength for staying in shape and things are really bad right now like an Indian person living in North America right so we have the same exact like upbringing whatever is anywhere between four to six times more likely to have heart disease diabetes like it's just it's real bad and now that I guess I have more of a voice on social media and people are listening I feel like it's something worth talking about since I don't know like if if I could have some impact over the next 10 20 30 years to change that that would go a long way but the hardest part is there's this like cultural like you know deniability where Indian people get really mad when you tell them that um if every even even now I mean you know if you try tweeting out the Indian diet is like traditionally unhealthy or something you'll get all these people in India like getting super super angry about it but ask anyone who's ever I don't know do you ever count Macos Sam or Sean yeah I I I use my fitness pal every day for like the past four years Okay cool so there's not one person who's ever counted macros who will fight the indan diet as healthy like not one it's impossible it is actually impossible if you track it to to see it um yet it produces this passionate response I mean I ended up commenting on an Indian cricketer's physique and an Indian newspaper the Hindustan times ran this like article about me saying Indian ameran entrepreneur fat shames like cricketer and I had to like turn off my Instagram because I got hundreds thousands of comments like just attacking me my family and everything I stood for because I'm not being like you know a proud Indian or whatever so that's hilarious man the uh the I went to an Indian grocer Sam you probably don't know this there's actually just like Indian grocery shops SE we have our own separate secret okay so most don't really realize this but if you walk in every single aisle literally is the shittiest food that you could possibly eat and I went in there and I was like you know Jim Carrey in The Truman Show when he's like wait this sky is actually like a wall like what what is this what what's happening in here and I was literally like running down the a like what's happening in here this is fried it's all fried why is everything fried literally not one thing and and no protein right it's like fried and zero protein it's literally fried carbohydrates with some fat and like that's everything and you just see the moms just putting things in there for their kids I'm like don't don't do this man this is so bad it's literally so bad and to the point where I was like should someone create like a just a better for you Indian food that goes into the Indian grocery so you're the only skew in the store that is not like deep fried terrible everything or like you know just canned gabim on or something it's like this terrible terrible food um and that's not even like the home food that's like the grocery store right so if you're in it's like garbage in garbage out it's like if your inputs are all terrible then the are also going to be terrible um why they just don't care is it not part of the it's just not part of the culture protein is just not really deeply embedded in in Indian food and it is it is small parts but it's just not really a big deal and it's compounded when you live in America but I think about it this way right I joked about this but like I think the spelling be is the only time I see Indian people on ESPN obviously an exaggeration ultimate burn dude that's so good yeah I mean look as an IDI person I can say it I don't think you can say it Sam You' get canceled uh but yeah like it's it's it's really not good what I think is optimistically my generation we're seeing people being aware of this we're we're seeing this changing a lot of South Asian people right they're always like even like baji was on a podcast he's like oh yeah I did like as well as I could for my South Asian genetics I actually think that's kind of I think South Asian genetics are honestly not bad at all for people who work out and and kind of eat clean and whatever I mean all the Indian friends I have that have put in the effort have seen results but the whole stereotype I think starts because of the diet yeah I've been on an Indian food kick lately and it's been all like coconut milk and so I've just not been using that or coconut it's just all creamy and and and it tastes so good going in but it does not feel wonderful and Indian parents when they feed you and because I'll be like Mom why did you give us this and she's like this is good for you I'm like how is this good for you and she' be like gives you energy and I think they literally took the idea of calories as like you know calories like a measure of energy it's like yeah they were like gives you energy this carbohydrate you're going to have so much energy and I'm like not that's not how it works and even they're like oh doll doll has tons of protein it's like lentils basically it's like yeah but has like you know the macros on dollar like 20 grams of protein 35 grams of of carbs and then you add butter ghee and like oil to the thing to make it taste good it's like well that's not really going to help then right like that and doll is your protein in the rest of your meal right you have all this other stuff like oh for protein I'll have doll that's a great example and yeah like Indian people will like the Indian Express actually ran an article being like yep we thought dll had a lot of protein too like the awareness is increasing now but it's it's pretty slow I went to a uh what's it called is it a holly or holy a holy celebration and it was uh naan with ghee is a ghee so like that clear clear butter and then uh tons of uh butter buttered chicken but instead of chicken it was cheese oh God and and then it was like the dessert was fried dough and maple syrup what do you guys call GL jump it's delicious by the way it's delicious like don't yeah yeah yeah it's good for you because it made me smile and smiling is good for you but uh it didn't feel great uh two hours later yeah and here's what's changing though is now Indian people are really weldy there's four million Indian people they have an average income of $100,000 the wealthiest ethnic group so I do think things will change like it used to not be a very viable Market but now there's a lot of fuzz and it's a very big market so I think all of these businesses also make good commercial sense if you read in our comment section on YouTube um the most recurring comment is Sean you look great Sean are you losing weight Sean that beard looks wonderful so Sean's gonna be a sex $10 on Fiverr you can get that anybody can get that for you go pay five go pay a Fiverr you can get people saying how good you look on YouTube I guess everyone's commenting on Sean's looks except for like they'll either they'll make fun of his outfit cuz he wears like a Mickey Mouse t-shirt or they'll be like Sean your workout program it's working so well like people are just sucking up to him so much well yep thank you and uh Anker where should people find you where how do they go and use your product that helps them with taxes yeah absolutely we're called carry we're at kry money.com and if anyone wants to set up a solo 401k or just get better at what they pay in taxes check us out

there's no such thing as a loser who wakes up at 5:00 a.m. and works out it is so hard to do and if you are losing in life and you're not happy with where you are get up early and work out dud I hate when you say that I get out of bed at 7: or 8 but I'll be doing stuff until 1:00 a.m. whenever you see that I feel so guilty I'm not saying it on the other end that you can't win I'm saying if you're not happy with your position in life one of the biggest reasons is that you need to change your self identity you need to start identifying as a winner exactly what Nick said like you need to create evidence that proves to yourself that you're a winner and waking up early and working out is the easiest way to do that

all right boys here we go we're doing double liquid death crack open a tall one crack open a second tall one it is time for my favorite episode of the Year Bar None do we have a famous guest no is this IDE is this episode full of insights questionable is this the annual drunk ideas episode of the Year yes it is Sam we're [Music] here why are you so amped what happened this morning because it's my favorite episode of the year and I'm drinking double liquid D's is that uh is that literally just water you've never had one no is it just carbon it's carbonated water that's all right this is like the Austin national anthem is drinking this it's it's like uh I still want to go to the Hipster bar but I have to you know cold plunge and um you know put sunlight into my eyes in the morning so I I don't actually drink that's a drunk idea this is a drunk idea 100% so we had that guy we had the founder of liquid death on the Pod years ago like right when we first started and and he was explaining like his idea and we like uh yeah that's really dumb now the company I think they're getting ready to go public aren't they yeah exactly it's the uccess story it's it's like that you know that one couple on The Bachelor that's still together after 42 Seasons it's the it is the one idea left standing of all the drunk ideas so for those who don't know drunk ideas was this um concept we had in a stroke of Genius many years ago which was there's a bunch of ideas we wanted to bring up on the podcast as like possible business ideas but they're bad and we know they're bad and how we had to bridge this Gap how do we still get this half-baked idea off our chest knowing that it's not really a great idea using the cover of alcohol one of the time tested uh methods of saying dumb [ __ ] is to say that you were drunk and so even though neither Sam nor I drink we call it drunk episodes and it's basically where I show up buzzed slash Tipsy high on my own Supply and I pitched Sam usually it was me pitching Sam really bad ideas and him reacting but then I peer pressured Sam into coming up with these it was hard for you right well what I did I tell you I was like I'm not exactly like a prepar to be funny type of person I'm not exactly a funny type of person in the first place but like you love like preparing this stuff and your best one ever was actually called um the very longdistance girlfriend yeah dude I'm about to bers I was looking through the old list just now and I saw the uh the secret camera roll where you don't want to put some pictures on your main camera roll in case anybody clicks it so there's a calculator app that if you push in the the the right numbers in the calculator it turns into your photo with your secret camera roll back there how is this not built yet what what are the what are the computer science departments that stand for waiting for that this is not built yet I I don't really understand the the holdup all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys but we'll ask our members for certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you could check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM all right so it's a it's a new year and you know with the new year everybody's trying to establish better habits yeah so this idea is called habit Island it's actually a remix of one of your old real ideas called hostage hostage SF hostage SF which was saying Sam's uh weight loss guaranteed business idea where he just comes and he grabs you puts you in the back of a of a white van and takes you away for 30 days it deprives you of of food so you guaranteed will lose weight well let me just say when I say I like this idea that's settling it short I love that idea and to the point where I have now taken your taken the Baton and ran with it like I'm the anchor of this 4x100 relay what do they say in water boy he goes uh not only can I do that but yeah yes I can do that not only do I love it but but yes I love it this is the only podcast hosted by millionaires that will quote water booy and if you're into that combination of of redneck and green wallet we got you all right so habit Island what is it I know so many people that want to start putting these good habits together they they listen to huberman they listen to Peter AA they're they they subscribe to Brian Johnson they're they're paying attention to Brian Johnson's nighttime erections they got like all kinds of Health in their world they're trying to improve their habits so habit Island what is it it's a place that you go here's what we're gonna do we're gonna buy an old school prison right a defunct prison but we're going to Jazz it up a little bit all right you're going to check yourself in and not only you're going to check yourself in you're going to leave a hefty check at the door when you check in because this is kind of like prehab so it's you know when you when you have a drug problem you go to rehab they try to sort of help you recover and fix your habits well this is prehab this is before you have a drug problem this is you were just a normal person but you wanted to level up you wanted to level up all of your healthy habits proactively and so you check in and guess what you want to establish a a habit of sleeping on time sleeping early lights out at 9:30 and no Wi-fi prison wide so uh you know on habit Island we just force you into all of the habits that you need it's 42 days it's a 42-day experience they say 21 days is enough to establish a new habit double it double that and we're going 42 and so we have certain period we just force it so like you know you want to wake up and you want a cold plunge guess what showers are only cold uh from certain hours of the day or there's just a plunge and you're just going to go single file line hop in hop out get your plunge done it's pure pressure everybody's doing it uh you want to eat shitty or do you want to fix your your habit about eating shitty there's no shitty food we're only serving super veggie here and uh we're on the Brian Johnson diet by default there is no other food in this island so like host SF you really have no choice we're taking Choice out of it and we're just reprogramming you with badass habits uh you know you want to have some mindfulness again we're killing the wi-fi at random intervals and there's nothing else to do here so you're going to have to get a little mindful with it what do you think of this idea it's great have you ever been have you ever heard of like our friends Jack do does them I've had a few other friends do them they go to silent Retreats have you ever heard of these so basically our friend Jack goes to one he goes to one in Bali but I've got other friends that go to one outside of Austin and there silent Retreats for five days not only are you not supposed to talk they actually only feed you light food so bananas and like fruits and very light food and you can't even make eye contact with people and I've Got Friends that go and do the and and and some of them you're not even supposed to read so no phones obviously but you don't they don't want you reading and they come back from these things and they they act like they're transformed have you heard of people going to these well yeah they say they're transformed but they don't ever say it for the better or not and I I always question that you changed yeah it's like that phrase whatever doesn't kill you makes you weaker is that that phrase well those are also upsells on habit Island so if you want to go sensory deprivation for five days just for a small extra fee we have a room where we'll just put you in and you can come out in five days and see how it goes uh I like the silent meditation idea we'll just gag people so they can't talk for for you know a couple hours we are going to just all it's ocart menu actually you could just sort of choose how transformed you want to be and then again it's baked in and you have handlers that are handling everything I say this in J but like every great drunk idea there's a sliver of a phenomenal idea in this idea am I right or am I right yeah no I'm into it it's I mean you're just you're this isn't breathtaking you're just talking about growing up fat camp and I'm on board with that I would love that stuff exactly see you have you have the little gift to to sort of reframe that I like that that was nice yeah all right let me tell you about something really quick have you paid attention to some of these fake AI influencers I have some of them are really fascinating so there's this one called the what's her name it's Karen Karen majori I think we actually talked about it a while ago and so basically it was this is not particularly a totally fake AI person it was a real person she's a real person and she made sexy like pictures whatever that was like her old stick then she took 2,000 hours of her video content and teamed up with someone and they made a fake AI version of her who you could talk to and she'll send personal videos to you whatever it's kind of killing it in week one I believe she did $72,000 in Revenue in uh I think she's using fan view which is like a only fan style subscription platform well anyway it's worked well but you know she appeals to men whatever uh it's like that normal like hot girl you pay to see her like do sexy stuff whatever but you know who makes more money doing the same stuff but just doing a different way is the Andrew Tates of the world and so of course it's it's just some nerdy guys coming up with this stuff teaming up with like smart women doing these things we need a fake tap and I've noticed that like there's been these guys on Twitter that are fake guys so there's one named Derek guy have you seen Derek guy his Twitter handle is uh die workware and he gives fashion advice oh he's not fake Guy's real right he's a real guy but we don't know who he is like you can't find a picture of him and like you don't know too much about what he's done uh you know that he's a real guy and he gives great advice and then there's uh Wall Street playboys and by the way I subscribe I paid money for a die workor wear like newsletter and then there's Wall Street Playboys which I also paid for it's Anonymous guys talking about Wall Street which I'm not even a part of but I find it so fascinating because the anonymous angle what I think we should do or not we a person instead of these like attractive women doing the fake AI things we need a fake a fake tap fake okay okay because what's the biggest downside of becoming Andrew Tate or becoming Dam bazarian you have to be them you actually have to be them like I don't want to go to jail in Romania I don't want to get canceled and say all this C or I don't want have to say this stupid hateful [ __ ] in order to like get famous I don't actually want to do any of that but like like the idea of having a really big audience I like the idea of selling Hustlers University but I don't want to live that life I don't want to trap myself in that box so I've been following this one that you have on here Emily Pelini which sounds like a bottle sparkling water but it is actually as you wrote here a 23y old funloving girly from La did you that's amazing um and basically what this person is doing so uh she's this fake influencer she's she's AI she's a AI generated girl but she looks real uh but she's kind of like too good to be real in fact they intentionally made her they actually asked AI to generate like the average man's dream girl and so you know there's like guy hot and girl hot like girls think a certain girl look as hot and guys think a certain this is guy hot it's like Kate Upton versus Kate Moss yeah well said and so you go uh she's got like 200,000 Instagram followers and that's in like a year um and basically what they do is there's a real person behind it who films the video but then they deep fake it to switch the body and the face of this AI girl and there's like they showed the Instagram DMS and there's like celebrities politicians athletes sliding into her DMs like and they I don't know if they don't know if she's not real or they just don't care I'm not sure but when I saw this I was like oh okay you know we thought AI was going to take the job like jobs of like you know bluecollar workers and stuff like that because I saw all those Boston Dynamics robots that like your robot that can lift boxes and stuff actually AI is coming for like the Instagram thoughts and like that's who's going first is is like only fans and Instagram models um but I like your twist here which is everybody's doing hot girls nobody's doing Ultra masculine guys right like yeah just Train Hey GPT GPT 5 I know you're in the middle of a training run just pause you need to watch these videos of entertain Fight Club and that guy guy who chops wood on Tik Tok and is hot and like you need to like train the most powerful a AI I need like 10,000 gpus pointed at that and it's gonna come out with just this absolute Savage gentleman 50 Shades of Gray [ __ ] who is gonna just take over social media um and get tons of subscribers yeah we need a fake Tate a fake Hermos whatever it is someone who says what they have to say but makes it so I don't actually have to live that life so you know I could talk to talk but I want to walk the walk and when they get canceled cuz like what they did was they were like oh this Emily pigini she's brunette guess what she's got a sister Fiona blonde if you're into that right you just copy paste you copy paste all the different variants of what people's dream personality and body and face are and you create all the variants yourself and you you own one of the guys who uh one of the one of the people who is behind uh one of these things they were an agency and they had to hire influencers and they were like this is a pain in the ass These influencers suck and so they just made their own and that's kind they like pivoted their agency like start making these and that's like the whole thing this is the next Social Network movie right like you know The Social Network movie starts with like Zuckerberg getting rejected from the like uh the whatever the houses of the frats at Harvard and he like you know as his revenge is like I will create the social network that everybody on Earth will use instead and that's what's going to happen here it's like I'm so sick of these influencers wouldn't it be a shame if I replaced all of them and controlled all of them right like would a shame if they just did everything I ever wanted you know at my whim and that's what's going to happen here and the reason this is interesting is like I because I know based off my behavior I am buying advice or buying content from these Anonymous people I'm not buying porn from these people yeah uh like like gross like that's almost I mean maybe in the future one day but these Anonymous I never say never I'm not dogmatic you know I'm open-minded but like I just think that these Anonymous Twitter handles are actually really cool uh you know the car dealership guy have you seen what he does yes I've seen him I bought a car from him yeah that's crazy you bought a car from him he's got I'm never going to pay $5 a month bought like $100,000 car from this guy you literally bought a a fancy SUV from him and you don't even know who he is I don't I don't know if you know who he is or not I don't know who he is and I ask him for advice he's got 600,000 followers now and he does his car I know and I wish I didn't know life was better when I didn't know sometimes it's better not know all right let me do the next one what do you got I'm going to hit you with uh three names of ideas that I want you to pick frivolous lawsuit company um user lose at gym or better than Google uh I want to hear uh the frivolous lawsuit and then better than Google all right frivolous lawsuit um so I don't know if you know this but like uh my e-commerce business got sued recently and I didn't come to you D I didn't cry on your shoulder but it didn't it didn't feel good can you say like a ballpark reason it's the same reason every e-commerce business that gets to any scale gets sued every single one ADA compliance you know how outside of buildings you have to have like the ramp for like anybody in a wheelchair to be able to get into your building but how's that pertain to a website websites have the same thing dog they have a accessibility requirement by law which means it needs to be like let's say so let's say you can't see color it needs to allow for like the gray gray scale [ __ ] or let's say you're blind it needs to be able to be uh used by screen readers so basically the text to speech needs to be able to navigate like if you move your mouse it'll say hovering over menu click menu got it okay under the menu you have this this this this and so there's all these little rules around this and it's like a total conversion killer if you do it right because like first you have to put this ugly badge on your site that like takes the place of where you would put your upsell or like your popup that's like hey check out now or give us your Emil address instead it's like ADA Compliant and then you have to do all this work that's like not going our Drive sales um in order to maintain compliance did you have to pay a lot of money uh well we're still negotiating but like on average these will settle between 10 and 20 grand okay got it there's just a law firm out there that all they do is they file the suit they use the same six plaintiff names it's like uh I'll just make up a name like you know Rebecca Jones it's like oh wow Rebecca Jones has sued 3,000 companies year and uh why is that because there's a law firm whose whole business is and it's like a major Law Firm but there's like a major law firm in New York who whole business is they just file these cases non-stop every single day for every site that they could find um that does is they've automated the frivolous lawsuits in the e-commerce space and you talk to any e-commerce owner who's like you know been around for a couple years or has you know does over 10 million in revenue and they'll all tell you the same thing yep we got hit with it pain in the ass can't fight it just settle 10 15,000 bucks and uh install this app this app costs $1,000 a month that keeps you compliant it's a whole bracket and um you know it'd be one thing if this was actually like you know a legitimate complaint but these are not like from people who actually have you know any actual issue with the websites it's just like lawsuit uh you know this frivolous lawsuit thing all right how do I make my pain into my pleasure what if we did this to the AI companies because there's an infinite number of AI companies right now all with a huge amount of funding and there's a huge gray area around what's legal and not legal when it comes to AI so for example open AI by New York Times for plagiarizing for plagiarism uh you know if you go to uh open a if you go to chat GPT and you say hey uh draw or like make make me a picture of two brothers who are plumbers um that like to eat pizza guess what it's going to show you Mario and Luigi it's going to generate that art that's not their IP they can't just create art of Mario and Luigi but they do because that's what they were trained on I am stunned that somebody's not just suing every AI company and being like cool I'll settle for 20K go ahead or 50k settlement uh but otherwise you're just going to be wrapped up in this it's going to hurt your future fundraising it's going to be an issue for you it's more people are going to come attack you if if I make this loud I think there's a lot of money to be made if you hate your life and are a complete [ __ ] and want to do that some people are angry drunks that's like an angry drunk it's like oh that friend he gets drug that he does things that none of us can defend and if you talk to any lawyer who's like hey can you help me with this they're like let me guess it's blah blah blah and blah blah blah and you're like yeah how'd you know they're like because they're the only ones doing this because they file 10 thou 10,000 of these a year and they own another Law Firm that helps defend uh Ecom companies what a let me let you bake man what else you keep going for the second one the better than Google all right better than Google so I'm talking to my wife and I don't know do you know about this mug this Stanley mug you know this dud it's in it's insane I think they grew from 70 million in sales to 700 million or around that in 24 months that is correct in uh not 24 months in 2019 they were 70 million and then 2023 2022 2023 they're at 750 so like three years that's that's insane do you know the back story of this by the way it's pretty fasting no I I know that it's an old I mean like I'm from Missouri and in Missouri it's like carart and Stanley so it's like carart is what construction workers would buy and that's what I would I remember for Christmas we'd go to the hardware store and get a new coat from carart and then in in the Stanley mugs used to be thermoses that you'd put coffee or like soup in for lunch or for construction workers at lunch yeah nailed it exactly it's it's like 100-year-old brand that was like construction workers would use it to keep their coffee hot all day while they're on on site and then a couple years ago this mommy blog out of Utah was like we love love these mugs and they were like we love this drink and then they they gifted it to some influencers they were like hey on behalf of us like they're called The Bu guide on beh on behalf of the bu guide they gave it up and somebody at Stanley noticed it and they reached out they're like hey thanks for doing that hey you know do you think your audience would like this you guys seem to be big fans of this jumbo water bottle and they were like yeah we are they're like how about we do this how about we give you guys 5,000 of these cups to try to sell through your site they're like okay so they scramble they get warehouse space they post it and in like five minutes or something like that it sells out and then they do it again and it sells out again and then Stanley was like whoa there's just like cool mom Market that we're not really touching and the moms were like yeah this is great because every mom wants to be hydrated we're all like chronically dehydrated um this you know this drink is cool it's whether I have iced coffee or hot coffee it's like this mug is great um but the color suck and they're like what do you mean these are Classics you know who doesn't want like dark moss green and like you know construction red and they were like no no no you need pastel pink and so they created some new colors and then it [ __ ] took off and it became the thing and then all these crazy moments happened I don't know if you saw that one where it uh a car caught fire and burned did you see this video what and the Stanley mug survived there's a Stanley mug in the cup holder and it's untouched the whole car is like scorched like the whole car is black and just like destroyed and she's like she picks up the Stanley mug the the straw is a little mted but the cup is still good and then she shakes it and the ice is still inside it's like this kept my drink cold even through a fire and then the guy the sanley was like holy [ __ ] this is amazing and they were like get this woman on a plane out here they bought her a car and they gave her like a bunch of Stanley and like it went super super viral all these mugs have this do you remember the nalene bottle we're gonna go way back into the drink drink wear history nalene bottle what what was the whole thing with algae bottle you could run over it with your car and it wouldn't break you remember that was like their I didn't even know that no that's am enough which by the way like we tested it it definitely broke but that was like the thing like these things are so strong they're indestructible you could run over it with car and it won't break right because that's the problem I'm having with my water bottle well yeah or being in a fire your cars keep running over it yeah yeah you notice Stanley was just like they're like okay new marketing plan arson um all right so back to my uh better than Google idea all right so my wife is in these groups these Facebook groups that are always tipping her off on these things and like what is this group and she shows it to me and I go why is this called better than Google and she's like oh I don't know it's just like I'm like what and she's like yeah there's like this influencer she has this group for her like kind of fans or whatever but they call it better than Google and I was like because she's like because if you ask a question here you're going to get a better answer than Google like you're going to get 10,000 moms who have actually tried things care are not sponsored and are going to like answer your question and I was like that is such a good name I sh I finger to the lips my wife and I go this is a drunk idea I need to go write this down because better than Google what an what an amazing premise and so true dude do you remember back in the day this app called jelly that came out uh no what was so the creator of Twitter was like my next ACT is this company called jelly and he came out with this app and this app was like kind of like Kora but it was like you know Kora is old it's like desktop based and and Kora is um just full of Indian people like just completely full of Indians like I think half the daily users are like in IND India or something crazy so jelly came out was gonna be the cool version of it it was you ask a question on your phone and it'll ping your friends like any of your contacts as well as one degree removed so it's only friends and friends of friends and jelly for like seven days was the greatest app of all time it was like somebody would ask a question about like you know what microphone is best for podcast and you would get like Tim Ferris to reply and then you know because he's a friend of a friend of somebody and the problem was it was just a bunch of tech guys who don't actually have that many uh you know sort of day-to-day life questions like you know in the same way that you know I call my mom you know once a week to say hi and you just chat be a good son whereas my sister will call my mom 10 times a day asking for her opinion about like which you know which trinket she should get from Ross like you know she just has to like get an opinion on everything and so I think women is the right market for a product like this people who want an opinion on everything and want to discuss and want to get answers and want High trust recommendations um so I think this idea of a vertical Google where it's moms asking questions to other moms dare I say trillion doll idea I don't know but that's that's what I'm thinking what do you think better than Google is some of the best bring you you had that is the best thing I have heard in so long there was another uh phrase that we had said recently that I was like that's a beautiful phrase this is the top better than Google that is such a funny that is like if Duck Duck Go can get like a 100 million users for guys who are like I don't want Google to have my cookies like then better than Google can work all right any doubters out there to btg just go to Duck Duck Go and tell me that this [ __ ] wouldn't work do your uh duck ducko user voice again privacy is everything I don't know why they're like a gargoyle El I don't want Google to have my cookies you're like Kevin from the office I know my location it's like yeah home [ __ ] always I know your location better than Google is brilliant man this is awesome I love better than Google this group only has uh 17,000 people I just requested to join am I going to be the only guy in it yeah we're early dude you got to do what our friend did our friend just changed his profile uh gender on Facebook to a female by the way it had 2,300 posts last month sorry go ahead crazy engagement right yes yes I'm on to something so um so my friend switches our friend switched their gender to female on Facebook cuz they were like yeah you need to see the ads that are being served to women like if you want to be good at business like is a non-starter you're trying to use Facebook and Instagram as a dude like you're not even it's like you're on the outside of the club with your ear against the wall trying to hear the music it's like might as well just come in you only get like flannel shirt ads that's literally all I get it just ads for flannel shirts on sale a FL shirt and you scroll it's like you sure it's FL we got another color if that's the problem going it's one long conversation from the flannel company to you yeah it's like we have both colors red and black oh cool we have both uh this this is awesome I love better than Google you got any other ones so we need to create Shan box or sbox or MFM box manbox no not manbox it's got to be named after someone so it's not a thing anymore but my friend Neville did this thing years ago and I bought one before I was even friends with him where all he records this video of him and like you even see the recording where he's like all right is the camera on the camera's on all right good hey everyone and he starts talking and he creates this Mystery Box where it has three letters written in there uh about like different copyrighting techniques that you can use as well as like a letter from him on something he learned that month and he goes I'm only going to sell I think a thousand of these and I'm going to charge $100 because I got to like actually make all of these boxes and it's a ton of work uh and he sold out right away and he has all these photos of people consuming the Box because it felt awesome when he would get these like he would just use USPS packaging so it like felt like it literally came just from him right and I've and I've heard about Agora Agora is that big newsletter subscription that we've talked about that does like a billion dollars in sales and we call them a newsletter subscription but they actually make a [ __ ] ton of money from literally a physical newsletter and newsletters are all the rage right now I think should go the opposite route and literally create something on printed white paper a physical newsletter I think you could charge a100 to $200 a month for it where you actually type something out and then you could put like a book or something or something interesting that you've consumed that month and I think you could charge a lot of money for this for a sha box did that guy DM you about this idea yesterday because some guy literally yesterday was like you need a Shan box I've done this for other people here's what it could be and I was like what I don't really understand they send me an he goes I'll send you a Google doc tomorrow uh so this is a coincidence as they say I think this is a cool idea your price sounded a little bit high but maybe not right maybe if you put enough value in the box right because like the problem is you just kept saying you literally type words on the paper and I'm like okay yeah that's that's like saying and then you stand on the stage and the words come out of your mouth it's like right so what's in the box so what's in the box you got to say it like that if you're GNA say that phrase that's from the movie um so what Neville would do is he had three envelopes one had a swipe file where he would print out the best ads or sales pages that he saw that month and he would explain why he liked him I believe the second thing was like a lesson that he learned and the third thing he said he goes this is a mystery I'm not actually going to tell you what it is uh and so he wouldn't tell people what the third thing was and I so I don't I don't actually know what he would nor normally send but he would do these things and he would take pictures of him like actually putting the labels on the box and so he felt like it was coming straight from him and people love them it was so funny to get these and he would like sometimes he would handwrite stuff and just literally like copy it like a fact machine or it looked like it felt like a fax machine copy it felt totally analog in old school and the whole point of this is instead of the inbox email inbox let's just do the exact opposite and we and we can take it one step further you can't even buy it online you have to send a check to Sean's house you have to print off a coupon you've got to didn't that one no we're going to take it we're going to take it a step further dude ridiculous stuff gets noticed like that last drink that you just didn't need and now you tomorrow is is messed up all right yeah he took it one drink too far but that's a good drunk idea I kind of like this idea a printed out newsletter box it comes to your mailbox instead of your inbox I like the idea and this is cool I didn't I didn't know about this I remember back in the day there was a service that did this and they partnered with Tim Ferris they ended up dying but it was a quarterly subscription I think it was called they try to make it yeah they try to make it too like uh like here yeah and here's what I like I remember when I started the hustle that's what I wanted to do I was like we got to seem big let's say we all the time and I'm like no F that like now that I know that like Mom and Pop is better than big you know big corporate company Vibe keep it keep it lame or not lame keep it kind of like uh like uh thrown together that's the way to do it I want to see a USPS box I want to see some of the tape all messed up when you like tape everything in there that's the way to do it so I got an idea for you I'm drinking this liquid death and like you said this is probably the best best case scenario of a drunk idea which is like it's just sparkling water but it looks like a beer right that's what this is It's sparkling water but in a beer can and um so that if you're at the bar and you just want to drink water but you don't want to look like a wuss you get liquid death right and it's like I don't know man but it actually work they uh Shane Shane Gillis on some podcast he was like what's Liquid death and someone explained to him he's like where do they make it Flint Michigan like what like is it it kills you he like is that is that the water of Flint that's good um so I in that same vein let's remix right what is it great ideas great artists steel ideas and copy them or something like that that's the that's the phrase we're going to do that so not about you but ever since I gave up drinking I really don't miss it don't much about it did you did you actually give up drinking or is it you're like oh I haven't drink in four months let's just keep going it's the ladder but that a't as cool as like you know saying I gave up drinking and someone asks why and you're like H you don't want to know I have a dark side so so the um the idea here is the one thing I do miss the one part that's really fun about drinking that you can't really replicate not drinking is taking shots or just having that celebratory moment with a group of people where everybody get let's do shots we're doing shots no I don't want to do the shot we're doing it we got to do it give 10 shots let's do it everybody get your shot boom you take it you're like oh God that was rough give me the lime right that whole thing I missed that I like that when when when have you done that my whole life when I've done that I was always the the let's do shots guy right like I was the try hard guy at the bar I was always trying to do shots yeah but when at what era that was like probably 15 years ago that you were doing that yeah but I miss it I still miss it to this day that's how good this idea is so shots are one of the great bonding mechanisms that humans have ever come up with up there with you know fire and hugs and I feel like we've us healthy sober guys with two packs we're we're missing that part of that ritual of bonding and so here's what we're doing just like liquid death put water in beer cans we're going to make healthy shots that go in bars so here's what it is it's a shot you take that's just like [ __ ] turmeric ginger like all the [ __ ] that gives you the same like H face puckered up feeling of like a vodka shot or like a tequila shot but it's just going to be good for your your gut it's it's actually just a gut shot and U oh we're doing gut shots yeah gut shots gut shots and people are just going to go nuts for it that's the that's the last part I didn't tell you people are going to go crazy about it have you ever had some so someone sent me some non-alcoholic gin and it was I drank I tried it and everything and it was the worst it was horrible and then our friend Justin May's amazing entrepreneur he's got this new order or this new non-alcoholic wine called Shirley uh as in like Shirley this is a dumb idea uh no I'm joking Justin it's all right but like I've had some of these like non-alcoholic beverag I think it's so stupid other than non-alcoholic beer have you have you tasted nonalcoholic beer so you just like this one gin exactly what you just said because here's the difference is beer I drink a lot of nine alcoh beer because I find it like it tastes great to me like I actually thoroughly enjoy that taste and and it feels good and there is like a placebo Buzz to be honest that you let me ask you a question when you were drinking were you drinking a lot of gin regularly was that your go-to drink did you enjoy no it was light didn't like normal Jin not going to like fake Jin were you drinking a bunch of white wine back when you were drinking heavily and had good times no no exactly so the reason you like the non-alcoholic beer is it reminds you of the good times and these other things actually drinks that [ __ ] though no does anyone actually like whiskey like people say they do and I'm like I don't believe you I think you're lying that's what I'm saying they drink whiskey because they have this sort of like status thing plus they like get getting drunk shots you just like the bonding moment of taking shots together and the almost right of passage of taking a nasty rough shot together this is a good idea I'm telling you I know a good idea when I see one this is a good idea your idea is stupid this is not a good idea you're just telling me to bring like a juice bar into a normal bar all right that sounds like a good idea Point proven um do you have more or do you want me to keep going you do you do one more all right wait let me pick uh just stand back and let let the man cook I think it's really what what needs to happen here I said I said I'm gonna let you bake that's how that was my attempt at trying to be cool it was cook I'm so [ __ ] lame seing today on the P yeah let him fry let him try do a divorce Island oh divorce Island easy idea again question not even maybe a drunk idea maybe just a good good solid idea a lot of people getting divorced we all know that half marriage is ending a divorce hard to get back on the horse if you ever talk to a divorced person it's hard to get yourself back out there get in the dating scene you got baggage you don't want to start back it's you know you're going back to level one of relationships after you've been in this like you know deep deep relationship we need divorce Island we need a place that you go it's sandals it's a Sandals Resort for people who just got divorced it runs quarterly so every season there's a spring divorce Island there's a summer fall and winter class it's like why combinator but just for people who recently got divorced and you apply to get in then you go and you're going to be with a bunch of other people who also recently got divorced even ratio guys to girls actually maybe it's uh maybe it's actually a little scoop maybe we go 6040 uh to make it a little bit better and um it's just a place to just the slogan is get back on the horse and we actually offer horseback riding on to horse Island also as one of our first date options and it's just a place where you know everybody here's in the same boat this is a safe space everybody here has the same intentions everybody here would love to find love again but everybody here is also and there's no Stigma because hey we're all on equal footing we're all recently divorced so uh a few a few episodes ago you were suggesting how you should buy a school campus um and turn it into a college or redo it then you said you wanted to create habit Island and for some reason you went with prison you said you're going to buy a prison just good value that's straight up a value play okay now you're talking about an island I think you need to start acquiring land my friend it sounds like uh you need you need your own little Disneyland divorce Farms doesn't have quite the same but there's got to be just some shitty Resort that's struggling and it's like look you don't have the best beaches H the weather can be a a little temperamental here uh we really need to refurbish this thing but we just don't have the capital you know what you're never going to win the the the the luxury resort vacation game but you can become number one in divorce getaways if we just reposition the product and that's what I think we should do here uh cool uh can I give you um just a quick one for the Run what do you got actually I I got two for you I got two for the rad double or nothing coffee it's a coffee shop where you know instead of at the end where it's like do you want to tip 20% 30% whatever it just says double or nothing and it's basically you flip a coin and it's either going to be a free coffee or you're gonna pay double for it and the double goes to the Baristas why is this a great idea have you ever heard the phrase asymmetric upside because that's what I'm offering you here a coffee really only costs a a coffee shop like 40 cents or something but they let's say the price of the coffee was four bucks if they can get eight bucks out of every um you know every other customer here on this coin flip that's a lot of extra dollars coming through the till and worst case scenaria you're just giving up a free coffee it's only cost you 40 cents in the downside and so I think that there's it's a good bet I think it's going to be like a slot machine we're going to slightly skew it so it's double or nothing but I didn't say it's 50/50 it's actually going to be more like a 7030 chance of you pank double maybe maybe that's a little too aggressive whatever the legal limits are for slots we're going to go all the way to that and it's a place for people who like caffeine but also like to take their chances dude the The Tipping thing at those places is crazy the the place that I go to the default that it starts at the lowend is 30% uh if I owned one of these places I'm just going to [ __ ] with people and make the default 3 100% And then the second one is 400% and the third one is 500% I saw one the other day these SE guys are getting out of hand I saw the screen and it said do you want to P 15 20 25% and then it just had the amount of student loans that that person at the cashier owed no way and I was like is that true I think that's drunk ideas um that's a wrap uh it's gonna be a little while till we come up with some new ones and we have another one of these but if you like drunk ideas you got to go to our YouTube you got to comment because Sam never wants to do these and I'm always the one being like people love it in reality I have no idea if people love it I love it and I assume that people love it so I need you to either tweet at us our our Twitter handles are in the description or go to YouTube and just do us a favor say more of this more drunk ideas got to bring it back uh because otherwise there's no way Sam's gonna let me do this again all right that's the [Music] pod [Music] h

every investor I've ever had the moment I pitched them and walked out of the room called me 12 times showed up at my door in Chicago and said I want in this round same thing with employees I'm always recruiting the moment they wanted to join the company they wanted to drop everything they were doing to join the company in my opinion raising capital is an informative process not a persuasive one within 5 minutes of us getting on the call we had some preconceived notions of what we thought of each other and then within 5 minutes I'd say you'd have a 90% cemented view of what you think of the person and so when I'm pitching I'm going in and I'm informing them of what we're building and what we're doing and I never asked twice because I know that everyone who's ever really wanted to do it didn't need to be asked twice they loved it

amongst this group of very successful people it was very clear that Jimmy is an outlier he's an outlier because of his mindset because of his ambition because of his level of of obsession because of his work ethic because of his absolute disregard for social norms so let me just tell you some things that stood [Music] out what's up Sam uh I'm back I'm back from Camp MFM you Camp is it even called Camp MFM if only one of us went I don't know we have to debate that but I'm back I have so much good stuff to share I have this is it's a crazy event honestly it's kind of a batshit Crazy Event I'll give it batshit crazy it is so interesting what happened here I have so many notes I'm going to share with you but first I saw something completely unrelated that I got to tell you about so by the way before we even get to all of that we have to explain that you hosted this big event now you're going to tell me some amazing thing that you just saw we do all of this for free and all we are ask asking for our dear viewer here if you're on YouTube hit that subscribe button for us that's all we ask for and people say that all the time but you want to know what Sean what I want to make sure that our listeners our viewers know it takes them literally a second but it means so much to us and actually changes Our Lives if everyone does it so hopefully people will see the dedication that we have in this content and pay us back by just giving us a subscribe so that's all I want to say change life just change a life today with one simple tap um all right so before I tell you all about Camp FM I got to tell you about this amazing Evil Genius affiliate marketing play that I saw uh somebody share on Twitter so I don't know if you saw this it involves 23 and me so okay so basically this guy points us out he goes check this out this is the most Evil Genius thing I've ever seen and he points out this tweet that um a user her name is Stella posted and she says hey my friend Elizabeth is looking for an unvaxxed sperm donor Sam you're halfway there um she said I'm looking for somebody who's blue-eyed white which half like I'm I'm vaccinated but I now you to convince me to give my sperm or you're half eligible uh all right so blue-eyed white 511 or taller blah blah blah so it has this set of requirements big go yeah big go but then uh there's there's some things in here that are like a little bit interesting makes you raise one eyebrow so first one she says follows a healthy meat focused diet specific but okay second no Jewish or African ancestry slightly racist but okay then it says must be natural insemination she will not do IVF DM me okay so she doesn't want to do the normal sperm donation process wants natural insemination which means 10 white guy who's unvaxxed so basically anyone who lives in Missouri she wants to have sex with got it so okay you see that first thing then she tweets again says hey that last tweet got so many so much inbound I just want to add some detail um so she retweets it again reiterates the criteria but then she adds some photos of the girl too she says as you could see she is beautiful pure blooded European okay code word uh intelligent has a childbearing body which I've always dreamed of having myself and uh your offing will be raised extremely well and they post a bunch of pictures of her and it's like this kind of hot model looking girl so this guy points out he's like this tweet got like almost three million views and if you do it if you DM the person then they send you a link and they're like hey cool you're interested awesome um you know she would love to have you know naturally conceived with you um Random 5 foot1 white guy who's unvaxxed um you just got to make sure you have the you satisfy all the criteria take this 23 and me and submit your results and then that'll say that you're eligible but it's like an affiliate code for 23 and me this girl's so probably this I say this girl there's probably no girl what it actually is is this fat guy in his basement is tricking tons of guys who are like maybe I'll impregnate this this hot European model um I just got to take this 23 and me and basically even if you get paid the the normal 23 and me like referral bonus is 20 bucks per person who does it so if you just do the math on this funnel three million people see this tweet let's say that one tenth of 1% are gonna actually go do this that's 3,000 people that went and did this at minimum that's 60k in Revenue off this tweet of affiliate Revenue isn't this crazy that next week 23 of me is sitting down they're like at their marketing uh they're in their marketing meeting and they're like all right we have to like let's do some let's look at the data and see who our Target demographic is wow like I apparently this marketing company just told us they did some research our new users love Jorts should we like should we have a bunch of white guys named Todd who wear like jean shorts in our commercials like like that's is that our new Target demographic they just like everything skew now where they're just like all this one type of person totally totally they're like oh I guess Twitter's our best Channel and Stella appears to be our best retailer who is Stella should we be advertising on Twitch is this evil or is it Evil Genius because it's a fine line between evil and Evil Genius I I think it's Evil Genius so let's go on to the next part Camp MFM all right so let's start with the following was it good was it great was it lifechanging I'm going to go with lifechanging I'm going to go with life changing that's how it was everyone I spoke with who went it ranged between the worst was great the highest was life-changing so you had a good that's a good high NPS so let me just explain what we did so we basically took 20 people to um to Greenville North Carolina which is middle of nowhere um we basically stayed at Mr BEAST's house uh there so last year we we did this thing once and we realized oh this is really cool if we bring a bunch of interesting people that we know in the business world and then a few entertainers and some people that Mr Beast knows in his world this can become a very interesting event we did it again this year we had 20 people and I got some highlights I got some low lights but where do you want to start how should I how should I do this I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better what what I actually wanted to ask you about was uh the evolution of Jimmy aka Mr Beast because my perception of him last year so I went and hung out I went to Lan last year I couldn't go this year but last year how old is he was he 24 last year went 25 now okay so he's super young and and and so here's my perception of him when I met him last year he had he clearly had this factor of like I hadn't met anyone like him but when we talk about like a Steve Jobs or or a and Elon Musk these conquerors like he had that it Factor it was very clear that this guy was crazy focused and he was insane and mostly all the right ways but he still had some aspects of a normal 24y old um he felt a little impatient about certain things he felt like uh he was still trying to like he had he had great conversations but then there's other times where it's like oh you're just a normal 24y old where you uh maybe are are you said something rude or something like that and then this year I heard from someone who went from the year before they go dude Jimmy has evolved so much he's he's still only 25 but which is insane he's only 25 but he now has like is morphing into this proper Visionary where I believe that he's going to take over the world was that true a lot of that is true uh you could see the evolution which is kind of crazy so he um so for people who don't know Jimmy is basically one of the most famous people on planet Earth it's kind of like bizarre when you look at the numbers like he is the biggest Creator on the biggest app in the world he's he's the number one most followed Creator on YouTube he's almost the number one channel on YouTube there's only like one channel that's bigger which is like this Indian music channel um he's the fastest growing he's the biggest he's the biggest on YouTube he's the biggest on Tik Tok so the two biggest entertainment apps in the world YouTube and Tik Tok he's the basically the number one Creator on both weren't the stats like one out of five what was it was it uh maybe like one out of 10 people on Earth see his videos once a month or something like some stupid stat like that dude you can look at this a 100 ways and it's insane it's like more people watch his content than watch the Super Bowl every month it's like okay well what are we doing here what is this how what is this mean I think like his average video gets 80 million views unique it's hard to even like fathom that and then you go outside with him and you know wherever you are it's like a Michael Jackson level of Fame right so was it really I mean we didn't go anywhere last year but you guys like basically didn't go anywhere this year but you can still see it it still happens um so so kind of insane so that's the first thing it's just hard to even wrap your head around that level of of Fame and success at this age he's running a billion dollar company so he's his his company is worth well over a billion dollars which is the combination of his channel is he the running it yeah it's him it's his the whole ship is him right like but does he have a CEO or is he also the CEO he has like a CEO but like the CEO reports to him he's the owner right so like the owner is number one um okay so he's got basically what what changed from last year let's start with that uh first the guy lost 30 pounds so after last year's Camp uh he watched the video of himself playing basketball was like oh my got up so slow and out of shape F this and you could see that like you know the type of person who can become the number one Creator on YouTube You Know by obsessing and focusing for 10 years guess what that guy can transform his body in a year too right so he's like on an extreme like bodybuilder workout uh program he's got like his bodybuilder meals he's got his trainer who follows him around and they built a gym right outside of his Studio that we went and hung out in it's like this is where he works out he's big he's like I only have three goals this year grow the channel get big and sell chocolate those are the three things he's doing and like that's another interesting thing last year when we talked to him I don't know you didn't go to his Studio last year but we did and um he had like 10 things he was doing it was like oh I want to you know do this mobile gaming thing and then I'm doing this over here I'm doing this this and uh because why not he could do any of those things right like you and me find it hard to say no opportunities texted Ben times more Ben was so every night me and Ben so Ben Levy he is my business partner he organize the whole event but during the event we're basically not talking because we're just working different parts of the room and you know me and Ben talked 247 anyway so we don't need to talk at this event but at the end of the night he would text me like yo like all right brain dump like we would just text random words we don't even explain them to each other like we'll talk about this later here's some takeaways here's some insights here's some learnings here's some ways we could help somebody in this room like whatever and one of the things I text him I go it's embarrassing man Jimmy has one literally at least 1,000 times more opportunities than us like this podcast creates a lot of opportunities and you know where we are in the tech world to create some opportunities but he literally has at least a thousand X more opportunities and he does less he says yes to less stuff than we did we have like we're doing four things he's doing two and like that's insane like that's that just shows like how poorly we are are are are staying focused and committed to what actually matters and being smart about say yes and no to things I said if this guy could say no to literally a thousand or maybe 10,000 better opportunities than what we're saying no to like we that's something to learn from so okay what changed uh he lost a bunch of weight his channel has basically like doubled in the last year that we we talked to him he's like added like I don't know 100 million more subscribers uh his chocolate business has taken off so I really underestimated this chocolate business Feasta bles when I had a a chance to invest in this thing like at the earlier rounds and I was like chocolate company like that's I don't know why why chocolate like uh I get it your audience is young but like chocolate's kind of like low priced it's like uh you know yeah I mean how often do people how often do people Reby this thing like shouldn't he be building like you know a mobile game or something like that that's kind of what I was thinking and last year when we were with them I think the results were like it's okay or it's it it might it might be okay like it was kind of like number three he was like oh I got Beast Burger it's say Burger chain virtual restaurant that's doing I think it was doing like 100 million gross or something at the time they've since shut that down um and then or or he like doesn't work on that anymore they had like a couple of things in the pipe they had this like translation service thing for like YouTubers whatever they had all this stuff chocolate was like number three maybe last year and now it's like every day I wake up and think how do I sell more chocolate right it's like that level of like hyper Obsession and you know going to do hundreds of millions in chocolate sales this year with a clear path to how this could become like he's like basically he like there's five chocolate companies that matter they're valued in the billions up to you know $30 billion doar uh we are eating share like crazy um you know these guys can't touch us when it comes to marketing and so you know we are just blowing through the like retail doors basically it's like yeah like get into Walmart Walmart is the main thing and guess what can drive more people to Walmart than these guys can and so he has just like really blown that business up which is pretty impressive you know now it's pretty obvious that that's going to be a a billion dollar plus business I would bet that he's gonna sell that chocolate brand for6 billion doll that's my guess I think that's what's gonna I think if we fast forward the news three years from now uh you know Mr Beast sells the majority stake or in the chocolate business for at a $6 billion do valuation that's insane and what about his mindset um so you said he focused more um what else changed well so Joe Rogan has this thing he says about David Goggins where he goes he's uncommon amongst uncommon men so this room was really interesting because I don't know the average Network you know even take out Joe who's like you know worth like seven to 10 billion dollars or something you know when we were doing the intros I was like you know between me and Joe we're worth almost 10 billion dollar it's just all Joe the so so basically even if you take him out of it you know this is a room of very very successful people average probably like I don't know hundred million dollars net worth or something like that it amongst this group of very successful people it was very clear that Jimmy is an outlier he's an outlier because of his mindset because of his ambition because of his level of of obsession because of his work ethic because of his absolute disregard for social norms so let me just tell you some things that stood out so basically he's he was very humble he was like you know he's like I he's like I've made every mistake you can make trying to run this business he's like I've hired and fired like six CEOs I thought we hire the Disney guy surely he'll know things no he doesn't know [ __ ] about YouTube that's not going to work uh we hire this person over here and then they build the whole thing out and I realized oh my God they buildt this WR we got to get rid of all that he's like so I've made all these mistakes he's like so I want to learn from you guys because i' I'm only 25 I've only been doing this for a couple years now you guys might have been doing this for 20 more years than me right like there people in the room were 50 years old right so it's like it's a different um different like level of experience he's like he's like I'm just making things up I'm sitting here in North Carolina just making things up I don't even have access to people like you on most days to even ask questions so he'd be like I'll tell you some examples so he's like uh we were like so what worked for you how have you scaled this thing up he goes oh I just create clones and we were like what he's like yeah I just wanted to clone myself because I was like God I know I could do this but I don't have the time so I need to clone somebody he's like like what do you mean what do you do he's like so I literally have somebody essentially move in with me and I just duct tap them duct tape them to my hip he's like you're G to follow me everywhere to everything and for this first six months all you're G to do is just Shadow me and just learn exactly how I think and what I want and what I do and why I do it and then in six months you start getting your you start doing those things and he's like I basically now cloned myself several times and now I have and then they clone themselves he's like that's what we do and we're like so you literally have the guy live with you he's like yeah what that it would be better than if he didn't right we're like yeah but like what about his like family and stuff he's like yeah I mean I just you you want to do this or not so like like one of the guys one of the guys who's like his right-hand man now last year when we went he was a guy just like uh you know he does these challenges like live in this circle for 100 days and you get like half a million dollars this was the guy living in the circle he was just like a random contestant but he had a back ground in video production and he had some experience and so they actually recruited him after that experiment to work with him now he's like his right-hand man does everything with him he's with him 247 I was like dude you got like kids this is like a Saturday are you supposed to be working he's like yeah I work every day I work all day every day and he's like I made a deal with my family I was like look I'm coming out here it's a Once in a-lifetime experience you're not going to see me for like the next nine months hopefully after nine months I will have like set up a system where I'll be back you know a little bit more but like this is an this is an adventure and I want to go on it this is like the Pinnacle of my career it's a once at a lifetime opportunity to work with this guy on this type of stuff so I'm going to go all in and this Allin mentality was just so P pervasive I'll give you another simple example the guy who's currently his assistant we were like how'd you get the job as assistant and he's like oh um we're like did you interview for this how did he like pick you he's like no I an interview he's like they uh really wanted to play this board game but you know Amazon Prime was going to take two days and so one of his guys hit me up because he knew I had the game and he's like fly here right now and uh we want this game now we want to play now we don't want to wait two days for Amazon Prime we want to play this game tonight he's like so I just got on a flight and I came and I handed them the board game and they were like cool if you're willing to do that you can like you can make it here H do you want do you want a job you're extreme enough and he's like he's describ so I was asking this guy I was like how do you filter for this cuz they were they were trying to pick up like how do we keep this culture as we scale of people who are just all in and he's like uh he's like now when I interview people we do like these psychographic like tests to get figure out your personality profile but he's like then I'm going to talk to you he's like I'm gonna spend an hour convincing you how hard this is going to be and how much you're going to have to sacrifice to be here and I can just see in that do they Flinch do they start asking me about vacation policies or do they get excited about like kind of like going on this Mission like this Mission to Mars and our of their version of the mission of Mars I thought that was fascinating that he's basically breeding this insane work culture the team has leveled up so much the quality of people he has around him from last year to this year has leveled up so much and he just breaks all the social norms like just being like yeah uh he's like one guy he's like I talked to his main like one of his like main content guys is like editor thumbnail guy like this guy's job title is like master of thumbnails basically he just does thumbnails and I was like how did this work he's like well I had my own channel that was doing well I was how do you convince you to do this he's like well his channel was taken off he's like we were always talking about like strategies and ideas every day and like our little Mastermind and we would just sit in Discord all day and talk about what like what's working what's not studying the platform and he's like I just knew this guy's like hyper obsessed he's gonna make it and he offered me the he's like first I started helping him and he wasn't paying me or whatever I was just helping him out whenever I could he's like then he told me like hey I need uh you know I need a thumbnail for this like tonight he's like oh dude sorry I'm at a wedding and like by the way I don't work for you so you know it's not going to work he's like so he wired me 10 grand and he's like uh he's like can you make the thumbnail please he's like so I told my girlfriend he's like I left the wedding and I made the thumbnail and I've never looked back since and since my role has grown and you know he's made it all worth my while to be here to shut down my own channel to go all in and I just thought it was fascinating the level of like like disregard for like convention partly because he doesn't know it and partly because he's like well we need this so what's the best way like can't we just theoretically couldn't we just find a guy with the game and tell him to book a flight and he'll be here in a few hours cool we're not limited by Amazon shipping like 99 people out of a 100 would not try to bypass Amazon's fastest shipping as like the way to get something I remember um years ago 10 plus years ago my wife went to Facebook and she was um telling her father about working at Facebook and I think my wife worked there starting when there was 6 or 9,000 people I forget and uh my father-in-law was like why do you need 9,000 people to run a website like why do you need 9,000 people for like a web page what do you what all those people do and that's what I I someone had said that Jimmy has uh Mr Beast has um uh hundreds of employees working for him and at first I was like how do you need hundreds of employees and then I had to re I had to rethink it I'm like well no he's actually he's a movie Studio it just instead of theaters it's on it's on your phone or on your TV I was like this guy's he's just built like the new the new Paramount or whatever the studios are the Warner Brothers and that's exactly what he's doing and it's crazy fascinating because you know I did this a little bit with newsletters but not with nearly that intensity where it was like let's just take a small thing or something people think is small and try to blow it up and at the time it was email people thought it was uh just like a something you disregard I'm like no we can get like 5 million subscribers and turned into a business and of course it was only a fraction of what he did but that's basically what he has done with YouTube but at a with a much better result where he's like what's this one this one small thing that people are dismissing and he's built a whole studio around it it's pretty amazing and the other thing you know if you talk to him he's like uh he's like it's impossible to do what I'm doing better than me he's like because I'm GNA spend you know 10 times more than anyone I use every waking hour of my day to think about this I hire all the best people in the world I reinvest all of my profits back into this and I'm gonna do this and he's like and I think in decades not not years so how could you beat that and if you just abstract this away like forget about the fact that he's doing that for YouTube channels like there's something to be inspired by and learn from that from that right like if you are willing to work in thinking decades not years work every hour every every thought in your brain is consumed by how do I do this better um you reinvest all your money and say I will spend as much as I can to make the best product possible to get this into as many people's hands as possible like can you lose like what is there to fear what how could you possibly lose with that equation and I think that that is just like a very fascinating uh mindset to see in practice a lot of people could say that [ __ ] very few people can actually do it and I know that he says he invests everything and and we had Reed on the Pod and he had kind of insinuated that like sometimes what they do is it's a mess like because they move so fast like we just miss some stuff but that's okay do you think that Jimmy is Cash poor then like is he just like everything is tied up into his business I don't know I don't want to speculate too much on that but uh I think you know the reality is he ra he he's a he is a venture back startup he raised venture capital and he is doing what you know um what an Airbnb did or what a Facebook did was like I'm gonna lose a ton of money now every year building up all of this market share so that then I can make back you know I could become a 10 billion or hundred billion dollar company that's literally what he's doing he raised like 50 million plus and invest all of that into content to G build this enormous following of being the most followed Creator on Tik Tok and YouTube and you know hundreds of millions of of fans and then he used that to launch a chocolate business that's going to be worth billions of dollars plus his back catalog is worth a lot of money plus his sponsorships and and AD Revenue will make a lot of money plus any other business he launches will make a lot of money right so he he just did the he he is a movie movie production studio in terms of his operations but he's like a venture he more like a venture back startup than he is like a Creator can you talk so when I hear about the way that he lives part I'm definitely inspired but I'm only inspired because I'm not going to change the way I do things so much like him because that's just not my personality and I don't think that's what I enjoy is to be that Allin of like you know I'm more well balanced which means I'm going to be less successful and I'm okay with that but there are um you had other guys there so Joe gbia I don't know what his intensity levels like I've only spent three minutes with them and I've read about them that's about it but then you also had sad so scad's 32 sad has businesses he was on our podcast he's got businesses that no one will talk about because it's not really that popular but I imagine he's in the realm of being a billionaire and then you had Joe gbia who's multi-billionaire and his company is one of the biggest and best in the world how did did you learn different perspectives on how to crush it based off of being around like those three examples Jimmy Sayad and uh Joe yeah 100 perc I'll give you a couple of quick observations so one observation is uh by the way there was probably like two or three more people that were like you know billionaires at this event so you get to see like a range of like oh how do people act how do people think how do people operate and it's like yeah s's like small team simple business unsexy not going to be famous don't want to be famous don't want people knowing my name I want to be able to walk around he travels the world with his son um you know for two weeks out of every month that's what he wants in his lifestyle you talk to Mr Beast about kids and he's like it's a shame people have kids man they go soft right he's just like he's just like he's like damn he he literally like I don't I W put words in his mouth but the the general feeling is like it sucks that people start off really ambitious trying to do big cool cool awesome [ __ ] and then like just get tired or they they either get tired or worn out or disillusioned or they just shift their focus to family and like he's just like that's not GNA be me um and so you have to totally different perspectives on these things and you know no judgment there's many ways to win each person should choose the game they want to play um but I will share a couple of observations number one this is probably just a good observation for me in general in life the smartest and most successful people in that room were the quietest they were the ones doing the most listening the least bragging the least kind of like you know you know word vomit of Storytelling or trying to interject themselves oh you did that I did something similar too let me tell you about me me me me and uh it was the people who were the least successful and the least you know sharp in terms of like had the most uh wisdom or or Intelligence on on a topic that were talking the most and I'm guilty of that I'm in the talk the most Camp so I was like damn that's a real like takeaway for me from this was watch how those people operate you want to be them you have to watch how they operate and you know they definitely do that the sort of the ratio of two ear two ears for every one mouth right like double the amount of listening as talking if not more and that was just so obvious to me at this event they had the Le and it also the people who were the actually the most successful had the least kind of like I would say the whole group was pretty good good about like not trying to brag or one-upsmanship you know or try to like assert themselves um but the people who the most successful had had that had that in in the least quantity which I thought was very very interesting the second thing I thought that was that was interesting was um uh just back in in there was like always these the people who were very very successful in one area more often than not if I asked them about some random side quest hobby they were also like world class at that thing like we were talking about you know Joe was super successful airb he's also like you know extremely fit notless like kind of fit he's extremely fit uh Jimmy Mr Beast you know uh the day after our event he's like oh I'm uh like what are you doing tomorrow he's like oh I flew I'm flying in all of he's like I play this one board game that's super Niche called Dune he's like and I there's no tournament for Dune so I created it and I'm flying in the the French Champion the British champion the German Champion like the best players in the world to come compete with me at this game he's like I did this last year and I won he's like I play you know these guys Play 10,000 hours a year whatever 100,000 hours a year or something crazy like I don't have that time but I like you know when I do play I binge this thing you know that's my way of unwinding is to become world class at this random Niche strategy board game and like we've heard these stories about how you know Peter teal is also a Grandmaster chess champion or Travis kalanick was ranked number three in wi 10 we tennis globally right and it's like yeah jiby literally won the competition against the other best champions in the world at this board game and they they were so bad they're like we got to run this back he's like great let's run it back let's do it again this year and like you know he put up a 20 grand price there's like no prize pull for this thing uh because it's like such a niche game and I thought that's also kind of interesting which is once you develop kind of this laser beam that can come out of your eyes and you hone that laser beam on your main thing if you ever shift your focus to something else you're like homelander and you just can just burn a laser through whatever that next thing is because you have practiced the art of you know Obsession Focus Excellence you know breaking something down into its core parts and building it back up again that was the other thing we I was like dude how do you describe yourself are you like do you just are you an Entertainer are you like a chocolate guy now are you a business are you a businessman because you're in a room with business people like how do are you a YouTuber what do you call yourself you know what he said take a guess what he said I don't know a business Builder he's like I'm a data junkie no way he's like yeah I basically just studied the algorithm I studied the platform and I figured out what's going to work and I decided I'm going to study this more than anyone studies anything and he's like then I've basically figured out what type of content's gonna work and then through my experimentation I figured out what's going to work like when they you know when we put up a thumbnail for our YouTube channel we put up one thumbnail and sometimes we're like you know what I don't know if that's a good and then we're like screw it we'll AB test are you YouTube team is going to hear this I'm going to be freaking out I think they put up a lot more than that no no they don't they a test There's A and B that's it you know what he does he'll put up they will test like hundreds of thumbnails like rap in Rapid succession during the when they first release a video they will cycle through hundreds of thumbnails programmatically to try to find the winning one during that and then they're also like well our loyal fans our hardcore viewers come first they're going to want to see Jimmy's face but after that after you know basically the 24-hour period it's going to be more fans that are from the platform just people browsing YouTube they don't know Jimmy they don't want to see his face so let's just put this uh you know this bathtub full of sakks or whatever the the challenge is let's make that the thumbnail Jack told me about that and I go Jack is he doing that because he's so big or is he so big because he did that and he said the second one he's so big because he did that yes yeah yeah yeah I'm like he's successful because of that he doesn't do that now because he's successful another random nerdy takeaway I had um actually I'll just leave it as this last one so the random nerdy takeaway um he is making the the biggest he he is attacking the biggest Tam on YouTube so like Tam is this idea of total addressable market and I could think of a viral idea maybe an idea that's that's kind of Juicy but like his ideas are uh like you know year-old in the Philippines or a 25-year-old in the United States or a 40-year-old woman in in the UK would all be interested in his video why because his his video is a like it's a video you don't even need words to explain you could literally just with the thumbnail or like a hieroglyphic explain this it's like man trapped in room 100 days all right I'm interested what is that right or like you know um you know two people uh you know first to to leave the circle loses it's like okay I get it and a million dollars first to leave the circle loses or he'll do a video that's like um million dollars if this if this like you know FBI agent can catch me right it's this like very very simple premises that appeal to a really really broad amount of people and I just that was something I hadn't really appreciated before I thought he was making kind of like viral click baity type of stuff what I didn't factor in was he will only pick ideas that can literally appeal to like one billion people and that's just different than what most people do on the platform most people don't like our channel for example the stuff we talk about it's not meant to do that it's meant to appeal to a narrow niche of people in a deep way he plays a different game appeal to the entire world in a small way what did you think of hanging out with like guys like Jack Smith and Val that so that the first so we had Val or I had one day you weren't here so I had Val on the Pod Val is a guy who has like four different companies with like three or two of them in the100 million dollar a year range what did you think of hanging out with a guy like Val he's cool right everybody had interesting things to share can I tell you the low lights because I don't want to just say all the good things can I tell you the bad things yeah first uh the big the worst thing was not getting to invite everyone so we only invited 20 people this year we invited less people than last year because last year was kind of a lot to manage like we had almost 30 people last year this year we targeted 15 so we tried to cut it in half um it ended up being 20 at the end but uh that was the worst part because you know it's really really hard to say no to people or like not invite people who you're friends with you just didn't want you know they just you're trying to create an event where there's new people there and so therefore you just can't do it so that was the that was shitty uh also another thing I hate hosting these things I know it's good meaning there's so much value in hosting this people feel so app a lot of work it's a lot of work and it's honestly I'm okay with work it's just socially like I feel drained you know sometime you say this about the podcast you're like dude I feel drained after these and I'm like dude I could go all day at the end of the night every one of these I'm like I am so overs soed out I am I'm I'm I'm an introvert actually it turns out you're performing as well and I want everybody to have a good time and it's like dude you can't control if people are having a good time yeah you're working basically and so it was socially I felt so uh exhausted socially exhausted is the right word the last one or a couple other ones basketball kind of mediocre it was pretty sloppy because the overlap of people people who are you know super successful and interesting that also are good pickup basketball players surprisingly low also people lie we're like yo do you play they're like yeah love to they show up I'm like you don't play do you next year do fighting do fight camp that so we agreed to do a fight Camp I talked to Michael bisbing before Michael bisbing a UFC guy and YouTuber he would be interesting because if he would everyone would want to meet Jimmy or joia Michael bising would be cool I bet I mean you know some UFC guys have listened to us and dm'd us that would be fun I want this is what I want to do I want to take any of like the kind of the Hobbies uh and then mix basically integrate them so right rather than like work life balance where it's like there's the things I like to do and then there's work and then they're separate they're always trading off time against each other no no integrate them and so take something I love to do which would be like you know like boxing or or sparring in some way or basketball and integrate it with like you know a networking event basically and you lost you lost so last year last year was crazy because this is when I saw that Jimmy was insane we were all just hanging out this B basketball court and he like didn't even make an ordeal of it he was goes hey Sean if you can make this half court shot I'll give you $10,000 and he didn't even say like if you don't make it I get this or you only have three shots to make it like there was no I was like what the [ __ ] Jimmy why would you make this bet and he was just insane and he did it and you did it in like number five or three or something and he gave you 10 grand and I heard this year you lost 10 grand doing the same thing someone another low light I lost the half court shot this year I lost 10 grand to Joe and it's one thing to lose $10,000 it's another thing to lose $10,000 to a multi-billionaire because I was like oh damn this is uh this is a has a little extra kick to it so yeah you paid for 15 minutes 15 minutes fly time on his jet exactly exactly um and actually we because we lost the game we had to go and do the like ice Plunge in the like freezing cold lake thing um so that was also you know part of the penalty of of losing the final championship game so that kind of sucked um yeah so those were some of the some of the low lights someone who went mentioned to me they didn't say that you guys discussed this but I assumed because he kept bringing it up about prime um and apparent so this is pretty mind so the Mr Beast stuff is mindboggling that he has a chocolate company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars I looked up Prime so Prime was started by Logan Paul and KSI publicly they said that the business in the second year business did $1.2 billion in revenue and I imagine that Prime must have come up in your conversations and I someone said that the two guys who founded it alongside Logan and KSI were like young kids almost like they imply like they were nobody's like they had no business in getting into this industry and it has just crushed it and I guess my mind is like a billion dollars in sales that's worth if your Prime that's worth like a really high multiple because of how fast it's growing that's worth billions of dollars so you basically have created billions and billions of dollars in value off of a Creator it's mindboggling did you learn anything interesting about prime yeah so I I think some of that's accurate and some of it's not so they did do over a billion dollars by 1.3 1.5 billion and what's kind of like its first full year you know it launched in 2022 so the 202 three numbers are the First full year of of you know full calendar year of business so that's that's Bonkers right obviously that's Bonkers no what what business does over a billion dollars in Revenue in its first year that's be crazy um they're not kids so I think they're in their 20s but they're not kids they are also not like never done this before remember we talked about those like status signals of like uh the the green flags of when you're young like video game player um hacker of of popular thing another one you know running your own Minecraft server that's another one um one other one is sneaker flipper so these guys were sneaker flippers that's how they kind of like that was their Road into business was selling you know sneakers then they created this uh kind of like they did a couple things but then they they ended up creating something called Alani new which I don't know if you heard about this but it's like kind of this like Posh drink that like um it was started with this Instagram Creator she's not anywhere near the level of like a Logan Paul or whatever U but they started this thing they've done Partnerships with Kim Kardashian and others like they made Kim Aid like the Kim Kardashian flavor thing Alani knew they did before Prime like an energy drink and a pre-workout supplement right yeah but it's like for women and it's like high-end it's like the you know Equinox or whatever got it and it's uh Alani new does over hundred million dollars of profit per year so it's a that itself is a almost billion dollar revenue revenue generating things that's that is that itself is probably a multi-billion dollar company that they built before Prime so these guys did that they have this this hold code called Congo Brands they don't want people to know about them you go to LinkedIn great picture you go to Congo Brands not much story if anybody asks who owns Prime they say Logan Paul and KSI in reality these guys own 60% of that company right Logan and KSI own you know the sort of like 30 to 40% of that company and so um that brand Prime is going to be my guess is that that that ends up being like a 20 billion dollar brand it's crazy you know that is gonna make Logan Paul a multi-billionaire off of off of uh Prime so you know Celsius you know that energy drink yeah Celsius just sold eight% to Pepsi for 550 million so Celsius is valued at six billion Prime is bigger than Celsius it's going to be bigger than Celsius or it already is bigger than Celsius and so what an insane story and that guy Trey uh you know Mr Beast Jimmy he was like I call him like he's like I call that guy every day he's like that guy is so helpful to me with Feasta bbls he's like I'm calling that guy all the time he is so smart he's like he is so smart so much smarter than everybody else in this space it's insane and he's like I I am just getting so much learning from that guy and he's like that's why I like to meet people that I can learn from because I've seen how how much fat you know he's like same thing for me he's like if I wanted to if you took my channel away I could rebuild right back to where I am in three years he's like that's how Trey is with cpg and he's like I'm just trying to find who that person is for all the different fields he's like I want to meet them yeah what's crazy is if you Google Trey like his name like you barely get anything there's no interviews I I try I've tried hard to find you know some him on YouTube or an interview with him nothing that's insane um last question all right so you did this thing you know what we call that lasagna I know it tell them why tell them why we call this lasagna Sam what is it you move in silent moving silence like lasagna um all right so you did this thing at worst it was fun at best it was life-changing if it is lifechanging how are you going to change laser focus my friend uh in fact during the thing uh you should have just listened to me four years ago should have listened to you then but the thing is you don't really have the same level of inspiration and motivation that Mr Beast this is true and I'm not nearly as successful as them if I had a few if I had few zeros behind uh my bank account or uh my my Instagram account maybe you would have listened but it just it just sucks you couldn't have listen to them it's laser focus on content specifically because uh you know one realization you got to know who you are and you got to know what you're into uh for me I think I'm probably like a B+ entrepreneur but I think I could be A+ in the content game I think I it would be impossible really for me to be A+ as an entrepreneur I don't think I'm it's not where I'm naturally as talented uh plus I don't enjoy it enough to go that hard as hard as you would want to to be at that top tier but I do feel that way about making content so that's what I'm going to do I'm gonna try to build the largest content brand or audience around entrepreneurship so around people who who are into the same [ __ ] we're into right MFM has been awesome and it's like the it's kind of shown that that can be true but uh it's never been something I'm laser focused on and I also don't think podcast is the right vehicle to do that so I'm going to do it off off of podcasting because podcasting is not viral which is like what you what you want is to be able to spread your gospel to as many people as possible the problem with podcasting is podcasting is like bottom of funnel it's like it's like where people you know form a deep relationship it's not where they meet you do you get Envy so like when I thought about I've thought about that as well um I'm not into content creation as much as you so that's not going to be the path for me but I have used it as um you know like a miniat Logan Paul Prime thing very very very Min miniature compared to them um do you think that so for entrepreneurship that sort of means that you're going to be a B2B like uh you know sha to you're going to sell something that businesses might buy or something that like we'll call it like the prosumer so like not like a drink but maybe someone who buys something for their job um do you think that there's as many opportunities in that space as there is creating a drink or a makeup kit or or uh whatever other consumer roles and also I'm not even worried about that like that will exist and uh it'll be what it'll be doesn't really matter uh but yeah it does like you know I don't think Tim Ferris when he started you know four hour work week or even his podcast would have been like yeah and then what I'm gonna do is invest in Uber and make a hundred million like that's what happened but it's not what you would have predicted but of course how does he get into that deal because he's Tim Ferris that's what who people want to rope into things and so you know getting into Shopify and and Uber early on is how you made all the money um you couldn't really connect those dots at the beginning right it's only something that later after the fact you could see how that all connected together and are you prepared to be a 38-year-old YouTuber hanging out with a bunch of 22 year olds all the time while you're wearing I didn't say I was to do I didn't do YouTube Noah my good friend Noah Kagan he uh you know he runs a really successful business that's worth hundreds of millions dollar so he's successful but he um he has like a YouTube channel and I always make fun of him like dude you're a 42 Old YouTuber you [ __ ] dork like you're hanging out with all 22 year olds who like yoyo still like what do you like grow up Peter Pan uh and so that's what I'll be making fun of you about uh so you could go and like do all those dude we had you and I had to do a photo shoot recently because MFM they wanted to upload the title or the the picture and in that photo shoot we had to stand there and do like 10 emotions they're like all right act yeah thumbnail faces act like you're someone just said something stupid and you think they're full of it and like inevitably every picture is just this like you're you're shocked and like we had to do these things first of all I hated that I hated that it was horrible dude there was one where you had your head like this like you're going to smack someone yeah they were like you're angry and then I did a [ __ ] slap uh hand thing I was like was that I was like what are you doing yeah and and then they had to like I just had to hold up five four three so they could like use my hands for different numbers I hated that I hated doing that um so we're going to be seeing that but I can't like that's just not my DNA but that um that's gonna be you now congratulations it's hard for me to be a little [ __ ] but I hope you enjoy it yeah no it was just like you know like you know a lot of the YouTubers um and this is a good thing they're they're actors they're they're performers they're entertainers we sort of started this just like hang out when we go to places and people are like oh my gosh I need your autograph oh can take a picture I'll be like and this is Sam and I'll introduce you too okay so don't worry well it was just well you have a little bit more of that acting DNA but they they like you like performing a little bit but they um these guys are like hard they're they're you I mean YouTubers are actors and so it's it's you say YouTube I didn't say I'm going do YouTube necessarily I know you didn't say that but I'm I'm still going to make fun of you for doing that don't let reality get in the way of what I'm going to mock you for uh can I tell you okay so one of the things we did at this Camp by the way is I'm not going to tell you what was in it but I'll tell you what we did so last year I was too afraid to like structure it meaning last year I was like yeah we're just gonna hang it's GNA be cool it's G to be casual it's gonna be great it's gonna be awesome just hanging no problem just super cool because I was like I don't want to be the second grade teacher be like all right everybody sit down you know give me your sh like your bunny ears and like let's dude in reality you need that you need that we needed that and we needed that and and one of the best things last year was when somebody finally impromptu was like Hey so do you guys want to do like some intros or like an icebreaker like who who are you guys and what what do you do can we learn something from each other so this year I arranged it where I was like all right we're gonna do these things called tiny talks that I was like at night we're gonna have people do kind of like a flash you know five to 10 minute talk on their thing because everybody in this room is world class at something otherwise you wouldn't be in this room so tell us what your world class at and how you do it so that we can kind of learn from it so it was like you know Mr Beast does his YouTube Master Class he's like here here's my channel here's the analytics he's like you know just logs in he's screen sharing he's like so here's how we think about this here's what I did here's what worked here's what didn't work here's this trick we do on our thumbnails that makes this work better I mean like you couldn't pay for this right so he did that Joe gbia did one on his first startup before Airbnb and kind of like the lessons he learned there read read the title and only give a one sentence summary of uh the takeaway that you had uh how I went from zero to 1.3 billion in real estate in 10 years um The One sented summary is this guy has an unfair advantage that lets him play the game differently and I should just give him my money to invest and that's what I'm doing okay so like uh yeah unfair advantages do exist and when you have them just part you know press push your push your chips into the table uh all right next one why I bought 23 gas stations and was it a good idea uh so last year at the camp somebody shared about why how they owned a you know 10 gas stations or something so one of the guys went and bought 23 gas stations after that and um funny story and actually it probably was a good idea for him because you know he had sold his business and he needed something that would give him a lot of depreciation in year one a lot of bonus depreciation and gas stations do do that so in that sense it was a smart move but now he holds all these assets that like he's going to have to figure out if they were the right thing on in the long term I think there's different thing another guy did a presentation on why Venture Capital mostly sucks and why people play the game totally wrong and he is a VC um so I thought that was a great talk at the end of it he did this thing called the Mount Rushmore of death that I thought was interesting he's like we were like dude how did you even think of investing in this one company that that took off it sold for like three billion dollar and he goes well he's like I first was taking like a thousand meetings a year like most VCS do and they're just like so inundated with data that they actually like lose the way to think like so then I step back and I was like okay I'm not going to do just like constant inbound meetings just worried about missing the next big thing instead I'm gonna figure out where would the next big thing live and I'm GNA go find it so he did this thing called the Mount Rushmore of death which is like these four things cause death more than anything else combined right like these make up 80% of all the reasons for death uh petera calls these The Four Horsemen but the he did this guy did Mount Rushmore and it's like heart disease diabetes cancer and and um dementia and yeah like dementia Alzheimer so like neuro neuro cognitive um degeneration and he's like so then I just went and looked for what's the best company uh in biotech that attacks one of those four in a way that I think is plausible to to work and then he ended up finding a big winner in that space I thought that was kind of interesting um another guy he goes my talks about the 3DS of B of buying businesses death divorce and distressed he's like you know the the best opportunities come if you can buy a business from somebody who died and the kids don't want to inherit the business from somebody who's going through a divorce and they have to you know sell their business or distressed you know somebody took on too much risk and you can basically go buy it for less than the intrinsic value of the business and so one guy there he had bought a business he was looking at buying this business he would have had to pay like you know 1520 million for it um on top of the inventory that they had and instead he ended up own now he owns the business for the cost of the inventory that they own like he's like literally like I just paid for the inventory and I now own the whole business and he's like you know and that was one of my supplier so it cut my cogs in half so it's just like these great you know what do what does a great deal look like and you really start to learn what does a great deal look like so those talks I thought were badass all right let's wrap up and let me make one suggestion don't turn this into a business this is perfect as it is don't [ __ ] this a business Camp MFM this is awesome of course not this is perfect don't [ __ ] this up number two do it again and number three keep it at whatever size 20 I I would be bad at picking because I would want everyone to come that is so stressful but hopefully you don't ruin this because this is definitely a gem um I'm when we made the list of people we would want to come the list was 142 so you had to go from 142 to inviting 15 that was terrible I was I had I'm I don't regret my decision I you know I I had to put family time in but I had immense amount of after all of that you didn't regret your decision no I don't regret it at I don't regret it but but I I I I have massive fomo I wish I was in a position that it would have been that I could have made it but uh I I'm I had huge amount of fomos because Ramone and Jack were giving me updates and Val and Ben and Nick and I would just text people like how's it going is it fun and they would send me pictures so I sort of got like 1% of you know ongoing updates it sounded awesome everybody at the thing was just they were just calling it Sean's bachelor party they're like I'm so happy to be at Sea's bachelor party which is hilarious because I didn't have a bachelor party but if I did this is exactly what I would have wanted to do it's basically group of guys who are all a lot of fun uh tons of jokes play basketball play poker talk business that's like the ideal bachelor party so I think maybe we should just rebranded to that my annual bachelor party well no keep it Camp FFM so I by default always get an invite no dude you blew us off this year you know how it is you would have done the same thing um and if it's people were like where's Sam and I was like oh you know he just had a baby they're like wasn't that like three months ago and I was like yeah and they're like then it was two and a half months ago it was two and a half months ago and I made the commitment that the first three I'm I'm at home um I got to do it I got to do laser focus on that baby I like it I appreciate that we you know I was I actually got a I was getting um I was laying with her and I was like shirtless and she was just in her diaper and I was changing her diaper and she [ __ ] all over me somehow as I was getting a text from uh like Ramone being like yeah dude now we're lifting weights and doing all this stuff I was like oh cool like uh let me wipe this poop off of me real quick because she just the poop just ran down my belly uh any tips how to get diarrhea out of dude is there a tiny talk about that she literally puked on my face this week cuz I was like holding her at my shoulder and she threw up and I got puked all over my face and I was like reading these texts and like seeing Nick puber do like a dexa scan and Joe G jump in a lake and I'm like oh that's yeah we had he has a dexa in his gym and we put Nick on it and then we played a game where everybody had to guess his body fat percentage and then I was like yeah this would get everybody canceled nowadays this is like you know fat shaming I pretty sure this is the definition of f shaming but uh but he loved it it was great yeah that's that's baller I definitely uh wish I could have been there um all right that was a good episode that was a good recap all [Music] right

all right everyone what's happening this is Sam so on today's pod I did something very selfish so I've got these two friends one is named Nick bear so you probably have seen Nick on Instagram or on YouTube he's got millions of followers and he owns this company called bpn bare performance nutrition they do something like $60 million a year in sale so he's a really successful entrepreneur but he's like a fitness fanatic so he looks like a bodybuilder but he's runs some marathon in like 2 hours and 39 minutes which is a freakish time but it's also freakish considering how big he is and then we have sahill Bloom who's another buddy of mine who's really popular on social media on Twitter he's a writer you probably have seen him all over the place and I just nerded out on Fitness with these guys we also talked a little bit about business so we asked the typical questions like where do you guys spend your money how much you spend each month where do you like to invest your money um we talked about their their companies and how they're growing and we did a lot of business stuff but most of this was about Fitness and I just asked them all the fitness questions that I had I had a bunch of listeners send me questions and I think it was a great time and it was really fun to learn about what these guys are doing for training hopefully inspire you so anyway check out the [Music] Pod can I ask you so I I tweeted out that you guys were coming on and I got a bunch of questions they range from personal finance Fitness business all types of stuff I want to ask you guys both a couple questions I'm going to start which I'm going to start with one that sounds like the hardest but I actually think it's the easiest because you answer this all the time and I'll preface this by saying I've seen your your father in videos I've seen your brother in videos and I've seen you in real life and so I think I know what the answer is because I know the genetics that you come from but someone said genuinely curious how can Nick be natural given his performance please press him on this and so you constantly get asked if you're natural I know you've answered it constantly but just humor me for because this was a a very uh a lot of people ask this question I am natural and I used to address these these call outs and questions and claims all the time because I would get defensive in it like it was all the time it's been like that since I started creating content I even went to the extent of sharing blood work every month I was going getting blood work every month and I would share it on my videos during my bulk in my cut and people like oh he's faking he's F he's finding workarounds I'm like guys so I finally have gotten to a point where I'm just over addressing the the questions and the claims and the hate around it and I'm just gonna do my thing like even in this last marathon people were like he's using EPO what is that like blood doping I'm like what amateur what amateur athlete you know that's running marathons run marathons is taking EPO and blood doping but then you're like but how do I how do I get that does anyone have a guy like yeah I'm like who like where do you get EPO I don't even know where you you you'd get that um I I mean I've seen you uh in real life that you you just have I think you're just a freak genetically and and I I would be honored if someone asked if I was on a bunch of stuff that would make me feel wonderful Dude also by the way like my um my thing with this always is like I have a few friends who everyone says this about they're like oh they you know definitely not natural and I just know for a fact that that person has just outworked me in the gym on a daily basis for the last like 10 [ __ ] years excuse my language and not by like a ton but by a little bit every single day for 10 years and that adds up to something insane and it looks like a totally different human being so like when I see a dude that has way bigger shoulders than me or way bigger chest like I know that they probably did that extra set or they did the extra two reps that I was just like oh six is good and stopped and so like I just I think it's such a cop out when people freak out about like oh are you natural or not the reality is like sometimes they don't because genetics are real like for example genetics are real but genetics are like definitely a real thing like the the bare genetics are solid dude your dad ran like a sub Six Mile I don't remember what age he is but he was some you know he was a grown man and he still was huge like you got and then I saw your brother your brother looked like he competed in the strongman games I mean you guys are just huge yes my my dad's 60 my uncle his brother is 57 if you saw both of them with their shirts off after running they've still both run marathons half marathons I mean six-pack abs chiseled arms and shoulders they don't take anything they're not they're not on trt or any of that stuff they're just like Farm boys who grew up in central Pennsylvania milking cows and and bailing hay dude listen to this so sahill texted me I I I nerded out with them I go this I go dude I just hung out with Nick bear um and and it was amazing and sahill was like yeah he's you know he looks great whatever but how tall is he and I was like I'm pretty sure he's my height or just like an inch shorter uh so he's pretty tall and I sent him this picture and I remember in that photo I think I think Nick you were at like your weakest you're were about to run a marathon I was at my strongest and our squats and bench were like almost the same I think you did five pounds ahead and um you just like looked so much better and you know we were like the sucks that like we're kind of comparable I guess in terms of strength but like he just he just has it he just has it like you you just you just have whatever it is that you just you look good uh appreciate that genetics are real AR's laughing at mean helps Sam you got Sam you got to get a tan man you're too pale to uh you're too pale to have good-looking ABS That's genetics man it's that's another genetics component he just has it and so I don't know everyone everyone in the comments are going to make fun of me that I'm just like flirting with you but you know I'm just saying what people think genetics are like a real thing you can take person a person B different genetics same work ethic same diet same training program and you're not going to get the same results people people send me messages all the time they're like I eat exactly what you eat I train exactly way you train I run exactly the same miles as you but we don't look the same yeah because genetically we are not the same like we have different DNA so it's going to have different results it doesn't mean you shouldn't eat right and train and and try to do your best but like I will give I will give genetics the credit they deserve but also I am one of the most consistent people I know in terms of training and recovery and diet like my diet is dialed in I still enjoy myself like me and my wife will go for dinner I'll get some drinks I'll like order the whole menu and try everything I love food I'm a big foodie but my my diet 90% of the time time is so regimented and dialed in I'm eating my meals when I'm not hungry I'm eating my meals when I know I need nutrition to fuel workouts like it is for me a lifestyle that I truly love and embrace I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better are you like that sill are you as dial you think yeah I mean I'm just like I probably have a similar wiring to you n like I kind of have like a obsessive personality and so when I when I commit to something or dive in on it it's going to piss off everyone around me because I'm like if we were traveling during the day and I get home at 10 p.m but I had a six mile run to do I'm going out at 10 p.m. and have to go hit the run and it's not a question and like if I get home at midnight but I'm the type of person that wakes up at 4 and gets in my cold plunge I'm waking up at 4 and getting in my cold plunge and uh I'm I feel the same way as you in General on the genetics thing although I will say like when people say oh I do the same workouts as you I run the same miles I did the same thing I call [ __ ] because I I just don't like i' I've trained super hard my whole life but there are people that I just know have trained harder than me because I know like in the back of my mind I know for sure that like I could have probably done two more reps on something but I like was working out on my own and my in my home gym and I just like took it easy and that two reps compounded over five years makes a difference um to the point I'm like time being a lever and so I'm honest enough with myself on some things where like with running I post all my stats and so there's no hiding right like if I'm gonna post my koros you know screenshot or whatever on my Instagram from any run workout I can't hide from whether or not I put in the right amount of effort on that workout but lifting I can totally hide from it I'm not sh you can't see all the stats exactly on what I did and how many reps I hit or whatever it was and so it's also just like the accountability um that comes with sharing things publicly on your progress that I feel like for you like you've been basically doing that for what six seven eight years like you've been showing your process in public and the accountability that comes from that that people are out there waiting like oh what's next next thing what's he going after is he gon to hit his goal that adds a whole lot of fire like when you're running Sim sure and you're struggling mile 20 and you're like this isn't for this isn't for me like I I have a million people out there that want to see me get this 239 done so I'm gonna go do it I mean that's that's why we included a small clip in the video after that race was over but that's why these when you hit your goal in a race or you hit your goal in anything it feels so good when you hit it cuz you know the work that went in and all I kept saying after I got across that Finish Line at cim I kept saying man I'm so [ __ ] proud of that I'm so proud of that one because like you know all the work that goes into it the early mornings hitting your workouts making sure you hit your your Paces making sure you fueled properly the night before those big workouts and when I was at like mile 20 I knew I was I was running sub 240 like I I just knew I was on Pace like I can hold on for another six miles I could feel this lump just like forming in my throat was getting emotional so I was thinking man all this work like this is why I did it I'm holding 605 Paces at Mile 20 with six miles left like home stretch and when you finally hit that goal and it's because of the work you put in like there's nothing that replaces that my um my dad and I have been really close my whole life and I played baseball in college Nick in case in case we we hadn't talked about about that and um when I had to retire cuz I was hurt the hardest thing was telling my dad um cuz so much of our relationship had been built around the sport and built around you know him coming to all my practices taking me to all my lessons all that stuff over the years and he told me at the time like I don't care I'm gonna be there to cheer you on and whatever your next thing is in life and at my Marathon uh he surprised me and flew out for it and I remember like those last six miles I was hurting so so bad and all I was thinking the whole time was like I got to get to my dad he's at the Finish Line he's there waiting for me and when I crossed the finish line and I had done it I'd gone sub three he was standing there and I like broke down completely I like all of the emotion that you hold in from that you know from trying to get to something from like struggling through it hitting your goal um that emotion like it's completely unparalleled like nothing I've ever experienced in life just that that rush I think it's why people keep signing up and and doing races or signing up and committing to hard things is cuz when you finally accomplish it it's like uh I referenc this part of this book all the time because I think it's so applicable but in Tim Grover's book winning he talks about achieving your first win and when you achieve that first win no matter what it is it builds this little ounce of confidence so then you set down to achieve another win but that win is larger and more ambitious and it requires more work more effort but when you finally get it builds more confidence and you keep applying this thing over years and years and years and you keep pushing out what that win is and could be through the process of succeeding and failing and winning and losing you build this massive amount of confidence where you finally get to a point thinking oh I can actually do whatever I want to do that's a really powerful position to be in that's why I always say there's no such thing as a loser who wakes up at 5:00 a.m. and works out because it is so hard to do and if you are losing in life and you're not happy with where you are get up early and work out I hate when you say that you piss me off so much when you say that because I get out of bed at 7 or eight but I'll be doing stuff until 1:00 am whenever you see that I feel so guilty but that is I'm not saying it on the other end that you can't win I'm saying if you're not happy with your position in life one of the biggest reasons is that you need to change your self identity right like you need to start identifying as a winner exactly what Nick said like you need to create evidence that proves to yourself that you're a winner and waking up early and working out is the easiest way to do that and like it still sucks but if you do that for a week you immediately are like oh wow I can do that that's one hard thing that I do I'm like you start to change your brain chemistry around who you are as a person dude I feel so shitty I'll wake up I'll look at Instagram and I'll be like all right I just got up at 8 and then I see Nick post and it's like I think on Saturday or something it's like dude he just ran ran eight miles he already just ran 72 miles at a 615 Pace he like his Instagram post I'm and fed his daughter a great meal yeah like he does all this I'm even awake but in my head I'm like that [ __ ] is going to bed at nine though I'm I'm gonna [ __ ] him up between 10 10 and 1: a.m I I am I am a morning person I am not a night owl by any means but now now my daughter's born and she's getting older if I don't wake up at 5: and work out there's a chance it's it might not get done so like right now we're going through this sleep regression where she's waking up at the oddest times and screaming her head off in the night so like last night woke up middle of the night gave her a bottle put her down she didn't want me to leave her room so I ended up sleeping the rest of the night next to her crib my alarm went off at 5 I was like all right here we go went downstairs went through my routine went out for my run there's nothing that makes me more sick to my stomach than morning air um let me ask you guys let me ask you guys a quick question um this will be it's met for Nick but S I want to hear your answer too Nick covers all Fitness and diet stuff extensively on his channel but I want to know his monthly burn so where what he spends his money on and where he puts his money invest his money outside of BPM so investing wise at this point in my life I haven't gotten to a point where I have any personal interest in investing so I just hire a financial adviser and he takes care of all of my investment for me maybe at some point I'll actually be curious and explore that Curiosity but like I work with a guy we make a budget funds probably yeah I'm just like take this money put it where you think it's gonna make me some money uh other than that I mean most of my money I'm spending is either going towards my mortgage investing back into the business my personal brand and mainly food to be honest like me and my wife how you spend per month on food just groceries maybe like it's hard to say because we'll do like one big grocery Hall week then I go like every other day to the grocery store and I'm going to like these exclusive like butcher shops here in Nashville so maybe I spend $2,251 a month on groceries but then we're going out to dinner and like when we go out to dinner it's we want every appetizer every entree we're going to sample stuff getting a few cocktails like we our thing is we love sure experiences like that and we'll do some big vacations every year like I'm not going out and buying a lot of materialistic things right now it's more so on experiences so you haven't gotten on the no alcohol train Nick nope uh to be honest like I I really have no interest on the the no alcohol train like I'm not a big drinker but like if me and my wife are going to date night on Thursday because Thursday is our date night night I'll get one drink maybe two drinks but I really really never drink over two drinks ever wait do you drink sahill I'm the same way as Nick like I I um I think like when it enhances the experience with the person you're with uh I love it and then I just I've cut all like drink by myself at home out of my life yeah I don't do any drinking by myself but like if I'm with a group of people and we're having like a an oldfashioned or opening a bottle of wine I do think it enhances the experience and conversation's always good and it lightens the mood a little bit and just allows you to relax what what's your St what's your answer to that question what do you what do you do you do with your money the same thing I do you just are in Vanguard index right yeah I mean we were like I was much more fun with my money when I was in my private Equity days uh cuz then it was like like I don't know I was just like freewheeling in my 20s doing whatever the hell and then we had a kid and I was like I should probably start just being really boring with this and I feel like you influenced me in this like we're in this group chat all together with a bunch of uh absolute degenerates and they all like sling their money into the most degenerate stuff and they're always texting the thread like this is the best new opportunity buy like a million dollars of aluminum or a million dollars of some some [ __ ] that i' never even heard of and without fail by the way like 6 months later it's at its alltime low like this thing just absolutely tanks yeah it's stupid or they'll short stuff or whatever I don't even know what they do but it's like these the terminology that I don't even understand I mean it goes back to like the fundamental thing is like you should spend more time figuring out how to increase your income versus like what your returns are investing for the vast majority of people because that's a much bigger lever for your long-term Financial wealth um that's what I did for a while I just I just focused on how to make more money how to how to build revenue streams and then it got to a point where like I was finally ready to start investing and I was able to invest or put away a lot of money a month that I didn't need to spend or or have liquid yeah and it's just like I just like to not have to think about where that is though like yeah I do that too I just want it to sit and like I basically want to just track an index and just go sit there but to the burn question Sam we probably spend like I don't know 20 30 a month or something like that um all in on everything and groceries probably similar to similar to Nick we probably spend three to five a month um on food I don't even know I don't know what my monthly spend is at the moment but maybe 20 but I can see why New York would be significantly higher but I you're about to get on the uh Northeast grind right yeah I'm thinking about moving up there and I'm looking at the difference in prices and like it's it's uh it's pretty meaningful compared to Texas uh yeah you are you think about going to the city so my in-laws live uh around in this in Manhattan and I frankly hate Manhattan I like Brooklyn but I have a newborn and I think that we will likely do the most bougie thing on Earth but um there's a town called the Westport Connecticut it's next to greenage Connecticut so you could say I'm going to move to Greenwich Connecticut which is like clay clay ten courts and white skirts and [ __ ] like that but I think we're going to yeah but we like I I'm testing it out so I rented a place for uh a few weeks uh in late January just to see what it's like and I'm looking at what the rent is and like a comparable home to where I am now because I don't want to buy at the moment it's like 20 grand a month in rent I mean it's just like crazy uh so the biggest Reason by the way that Sam's not saying for why he's moving here is because it's like 20 minutes from me and we have a long-term plan of my son Roman and his daughter Naomi uh starting to build the uh the par Bloom Empire here so we need to like start cultivating it early in their in their young years yeah I'm okay with that uh we're we're just planning ahead um let right let me ask you guys another question um uh uh this is a two-parter so what what do most people get wrong about health and fitness what makes you want to Nick what makes you want to throw your computer out the window and people say it online and the second thing is um would love an honest assessment of time requirements and what's the best bang for your buck for workouts because a lot of us listening are entrepreneurs and we don't have a ton of time um so what's like the best bank for your buck so it's a two-parter I think they I can answer both probably in one answer I think most people think that they need to spend like an hour running a day and an hour strength training a day so everyone thinks they have to spend like two hours training a day and I think you could easily split that 45 minutes to an hour a day split between strength and endurance training and get like a really really solid workout but I think you have some sort of you have to have some sort of level of cardiovascular conditioning as well as strength into your programming when you say cardiovascular do you mean like hit like a like a 60-minute berries or do you mean like a like a berries boot camp class something like that or a body weight thing or do you mean walking or do you mean zone two steady Pac stuff I'd say it's a mixture between Zone 2 Zone 3 cuz most people to be honest aren't spending their time in zone two zone two is actually like super low and which is like what 130 beats per minute for like a 30y old yeah it's it's it's low and most people are not doing any zone two training so I I like what's the benefit of zone two though aerobic Base building but what's that mean for does that make me live longer does that make me less likely to have a heart attack what's it do all those things helps uh cardiovascular health it helps build your aerobic foundation so that you can utilize oxygen more efficiently like you're not going to go run a sub three hour marathon by just doing speed workor you need that aerobic Base building where your body is learning how to utilize the oxygen at a more effective and efficient rate by then using fuel sources appropriately alongside of so like I'd say a split between you probably want just talking about cardiovascular conditioning 70 to 80% of that training being your aerobic Zone whether that's zone two zone three which is like lighter so you're walking hiking jogging something like that and then 20 to 30% of your cardiovascular conditioning more hit you go do a Berry's boot camp you can go do like a my my wife does soul cycle like a soul cycle class hop on your pelaton go do some Sprints speed workout something like that where the heart rate is getting elevated uh lactate threshold type stuff so if you split your your cardiovascular training between aerobic zones and some high-intensity interval training and then you have compound movements strength training you're doing some some heavier movements working with free weights barbells machines stuff like that you don't need to spend two hours every day you can spend 45 minutes to an hour you know four days a week five days a week I personally love the train so I I'm working out every day a week doing something move my body for strengthening what do you what do you say is like do you tell people like do the five by five or like what what's your suggestion just squat deadlift bench what do you do I mean there's a lot of different ways to approach it like right now I personally enjoy the pushpull leg split which is a a three-day split you can do three workouts a week or you can do six workouts a week so like a push day would be all pushing movements it'd be chest focused shoulders triceps pushing being upper body and then a pool day would be back biceps movements like rows all upper body again and then your lower day is um lower body legs quads hamstrings glutes I like starting every strength workout with some some warm-up movements and then going into a a heavy working compound movement exercise like a barbell squat you do a deadlift you can do a hex barar deadlift bench press or dumbbell chest press and then having some accessory movements alongside of that to support the development of the muscles that you're utilizing for those big compound movements so that's the way I like to approach cardiovascular and then strength training I don't personally like to mix the two like the CrossFit approach I've never fallen in love with that like when I'm strength training I like strength training and when I'm doing my cardio I like cardio but I don't I don't like like doing them together I like when they're separate and distinct and separated now moving on to I think where like what irks me about the fitness space I actually made a post about this yesterday because everyone going into a new year is going to have new training and diet goals then everyone thinks like there's this new thing that they're going to do that's going to change their life it's going to change their body it's going to change their health so January 1 starts people are thinking I need to do something new what should I do I'm gonna do carnivore no I'm gonna do keto I'm G I'm gonna go like strictly bodybuilding no I'm just like just GNA run so people go to these extremes thinking it's like the magic pill they haven't tried yet that's going to unlock this hidden potential that was just disguised by everything else they were doing previous VI ly and the reality is that like that's not going to change anything if it does like the the changes are incremental but what makes this compounding change in your life in your Fitness is your health is just being consistent with eating better drinking more water moving your body that's why everyone's talking about getting in more steps when you're getting in more steps you're just being more active going to the gym on a regular consistent basis it's creating creating habits and routines in your life that help you facilitate these healthy habits on a consistent and regular routine Sean was telling me that he was talking or he saw the guy who started a slice it's like a Pie Pizza app he was like between January 1st and January 11th our sales slump and he goes on January 12th that's National quitting day and he goes we see alltime high sales on for people ordering pizza because everyone from their New Year's resolution is giving in on January 12th that's where that's where it ends 11 days that's wild we owned a ton of uh Planet fitnesses uh back in my PE days and that like first 10 days of the year is like rain maker season like you're just sitting there just like watching the fees pour in like praying to the rain gods for all the money that's coming in and then inevitably those people just don't end up going to the gym but they still pay yeah they still bu dud PL of Fitness business model dude they model is like yeah you get you get like 10,000 members for a gym and maybe like you know 5 10% of them actually like regularly use it so the equipment doesn't have to get refreshed that often it's like I mean it's an incredible business model all right here's a question for sahill so we didn't even mention this but sahill sahill you mentioned that you were a baseball player I was a runner all through high school and college the baseball players were usually the douches who made fun of the runners because of our shorts and about a year ago you got you got into running you made all these Grand claims about these times that you were going to run you said you're going to break 18 in the 5K you're going to break I was like you're an idiot dude you don't know what the hell you're talking about turns out you were completely right you nailed all of it you you you crushed it and running and someone asked what the biggest so so at this point by the way you're a pretty like you're like a pretty successful runner for like in the weekend Cate in the weekend warrior category you're like top top in that category uh which is uh sounds like a left-handed compliment that's not what it that wasn't supposed to be that it was that was a I take that that was a compliment someone said what's the uh biggest surprise Sills learned from getting more into running honestly it goes back to what you said like when I was um when I was in high school like I thought Runners were nerds um and in my mind it was like the nerdiest sport like I couldn't imagine running or like being IND I was like ah it's not you know it's not a team sport like it's not it's it doesn't seem hard whatever and I have developed unbelievable respect for endurance athletes and for runners from having gone through this because I mean know a few reasons first off the training is so many hours and so monotonous and you have to fall in love with the long slow runs like you know in baseball it was all intensity so you can get excited about you know like a really fast Sprint uh you know I was a pitcher so like a bullpen session or whatever but with running like if you're going to be a marathoner you have to love the 22 Mile at a like 830 Pace just zero fun like you have to fall in love with that and be willing to do that over and over over and over again in order to become a great amateur or to become Elite you know like on Nick's level and above and you have to do it consistently over a long period of time and then the second one is just like the mental fortitude to pull through a race is badass like it hurts so bad I mean I would argue that the 5K is the most painful like I did so my my PRS were the 257 Marathon which was painful but in like a your legs are cramping kind of way where you just need to like grit your teeth to the Finish I ran the 459 mile which honestly didn't hurt that bad because it was too short to hurt like it was just it was over before it could really start to hurt it was like you're breathing really fast but didn't hurt that bad but the 5K which I ran 1752 was like excruciating pain absolutely like the last five laps of that were the most miserable experience maybe of My Life um just like past your lactate threshold awful and the mental fortitude that Runners have and that endurance athletes have to grind through that I now like I no longer think Runners are nerds I think it is legit badassery and especially when it's like a runner that has body weight on them I think it's unbelievable well the the the the runner like the the runner has evolved over the years too like now running's become so popular in the past couple years it's it's do you think it's because of people like you I mean I think I think that you've created like a huge trend of these like it's it's now Macho to be a runner yeah I do think that like covid and the pandemic definitely contributed to a lot of that where gyms were closed down and this is why a lot of my content actually started growing is because I was pumping out running content for like a year and a half before the pandemic hit and then pandemic hits all these Gyms close people have nowhere to to work out and train and they need it for their physical health but also their mental health so people start running and looking for running content and my content blew up during that time because everyone was looking for how to run especially you know people who are focused on strength now transitioning and evolving towards running but I I mean I think running has become cooler because there's a different look to running now like you can carry more weight you can look like a bodybuilder you can look like a strength athlete and there's these different parts of running that exist like the ultra scene has come up and I didn't know what ultra running was years ago and you have like these badass disruptive races like have you guys heard of the speed project no what's that no so speed project is like this underground race that happens and you start in LA and then it goes to Las Vegas there's no Spectators there's no rules you just get there as fast as possible and it's a relay race so you have a team of I say like maybe six people I think it's like 300 miles and someone has to be running all the time [ __ ] but it's like super disruptive really like aggressive inyour face look and feel it's badass and then you have racist like have you guys heard of the Barkley marathons no what are these dude you guys you guys need to watch this documentary like tonight it's called where dreams go to die oh I have seen this and this race happens in Tennessee it's I think there there's five loops and it's run by this guy named Laz and you can't have a GPS watch you don't have uh like any sort of sense of where the route is you're given a map and the map has points on it there's no Trail and you're given a bib number so say your bib number is 13 on this map you have to go find all these points before you come back to the checkpoint and at each point on the appap is a book and you have to pull out the corresponding page with your bib number and bring it back to Laz after each Loop to be able to go out and start again and I think there were like six years where no one finished no one won yeah it's like 15 runners in 38 years dud that sounds like a pain in the butt I'm not trying to learn how to read maps I just want to look good naked like by the way like running to to Nick's Point running has definitely changed in public perception like I just more and more now I'm like I used to think oh okay lifting like deadlifting to me I'm like oh it's so Primal deadlifting like you got to pick a car up off of your wife or off of your kid like you got to get it up off of them in order to save their life and now I I add running to that where I'm like if you can't go run like super fast to go call for help when someone's in trouble like that's super Prime Ultimate like you got to pick the car up and then you got to go run two miles to get help from like the nearest aid station we had Scott Galloway on uh Nick Scott always is like big successful entrepreneur whatever and he um he said something that was was brilliant he's like a he's like a poet he's really good with words and he said um he goes my fitness regime I want to be able to kill and eat most everyone in a room or outrun them uh I was like I like that that's great I love that that sounds very like a very practical way to to exercise I enjoy that have you seen Theo vaugh on Joe Rogan talking about uh who he would eat in a plane crash if you if you haven't seen it it's like one of the funniest theovon clips I've ever seen um let me uh all right I'll ask one or two more uh the so someone asked do you guys um do you guys religiously stick to your programming and do you ever create the programming yourself it really depends on for me like what I'm training for if I have a very specific goal then my training program is specialized to get to that specific goal so like for my my Marathon prep working with Jeff Cunningham like he would give me my workouts for the week and I would hit those workouts to a te I wouldn't miss or skip anything I mean there there's been times where Jeff has accidentally sent me in my workouts with wrong paces and I look at him be like oh [ __ ] this team's fast and I go out and hit him he's said what are you doing I'm like you sent this over to me he's like oh that's a typo so like if you if he if you said the program when I'm in a a prep I'm doing whatever you tell me to do but outside of that I have a lot of flexibility like today I woke up and I was thinking how's my body feel how far do I want to run I went and ran ran 10 miles sometimes in the middle of the run like two to three miles in I decide how far I'm going to run based off my feel that's called Auto regulation so you adjust your training programming based off your recovery and how you're feeling and how well you slept and all those things so a lot of my training now as flexible but it's not as rigid because I don't have a specific competition goal at the moment what about you saho I need someone else to write the programs for me otherwise I don't take them seriously and I need to pay for them um I found because when I pay for something I take it way more seriously so my um my marathon training I had no program I was just running with my neighbor um Brian Maza who's also a I I know Nick knows him also um he like a fitness influencer and uh personality that was really into hybrid training as well so I started running with him had no program and then uh I got connected on text with Nick and I was like Nick I want to run a sub three-h hour marathon what's a workout I should do and Nick replied and was like try doing this and it was I don't think I'd run over like 16 miles at the time by the way and Nick repli and said 22 Mile run it was 6 miles easy to warm up and then it was four rounds of three at 6:30 with one at 710 float he was like if you can do that you'll feel good about being able to run sub3 and I had never done I mean I had not come close to that but that weekend I had the same thing as what you said with your trainer Nick we're like I was like all right I gotta go do that I guess and so I went out and hit that um and then I started following Nick's Marathon program as a result um that got me through it wow um I I do the same thing by the way I've got a a guy that does my programming here in Austin his name is Jesse at Central athlete and it's expensive I think I pay $400 a mon month um and I only I I do everything that I'm told because I'm paying money for it and if I won't take it seriously if I'm doing it or I wouldn't go my intensity would be lower I'd like dude I can't do this it's like well Jesse told me I have to do it therefore I will do it um all right last question do you get nutrition coaching too I get nutrition coaching yeah I use my body tutor um it's basically a service when I was like really into it I would call them for five minutes every single day and they would be like all right what's the plan today where like you have like a quarterly plan you're like I want to lose weight gain weight I don't want to eat this I do want to eat this whatever and there's like all right what's what what's your plan today in order to hit your goals um and you and they you'd have to like show them and then they review your My Fitness Pal every night and it's like all right you're you're doing you're doing everything according to plan so it kind of guilt guilts me into doing it but it also teaches me like like I didn't know that you had to get a gram of protein per body power pound or per pound of body weight like I didn't know any of that [ __ ] and so they like educated me um track track tracking nutrition can be super beneficial for people just getting into Health Fitness just teaches them about serving sizes and macronutrients and total calories well I started weighing my food after I saw Nick you did it on some of your videos you were like and I thought weighing your food was like cumbersome but like I just saw you like just have a bowl on top of the scale and when you were pouring the chicken in there like I just need about half a pound and you just pour it in there like oh cool that was really simple and easy he just poured it right into the bowl and put it in microwave and it was like a very easy thing to track so I started doing it after I saw your videos actually yeah I don't track my nutrition right now but I still weigh my food just for like serving size allocation yeah and now I know but now I just buy like like if I buy red meat I buy it by the pound and I know that a pound of red meat reduces to7 and I know what's in s of uh you know ground beef OR7 of chicken and so yeah that's how I do a lot of it now uh for weighing last question um this is from me I'm actually curious who influences you guys and what sources do turn to for like like for example there's this guy um what's the guy on uh I think his name is biolane on Instagram what's his name yeah Lane Norton lanan great so like I like he's like you know New York Times did an article where they're like now everyone has their own Fitness Guru who they trust and so like hberman is like a guy for someone you're a guy for someone probably where I'm like if they say this I do what they say who are your your gurus your Fitness guys that you trust for health and nutrition and what sources do you use Lane Norton is definitely one for me what I like about Lane is like if anyone's ever saying something and it seems so ridiculous and bold and new and fresh I will literally go over to Lane's platform and wait for him to do a response because he typically does I love his carnivore stuff and like the guy who says like vegetables are bad for you like it's great yeah Lane has like a really holistic science-based approach to health and nutrition he also has a really good app called carbon that is great for people who want to track their nutrition and and reach their Fitness goal like fitness-wise I follow Lane I listen to some huberman stuff I'm typically just like I don't I don't have one person I'm I'm following for Fitness and Nutrition I'm kind of just like having a pulse and feeling what's out there and then if I hear about something I'll go do my own research so I'll read the actual articles in peer- reviewed literature to see what what do you use for that have you heard of I've been using perplexity for that it's been kind of cool for it's like a chat gbt for studies interesting perplexity yeah I have it bookmarked here perplexity and it's uh uh they do a bad job of explaining what it is but it they basically review tons of different studies so you don't have to read all of them and so you can ask you can ask it a question of like is aspartame proven to give cancer and I'll say like well of all these studies here's what it here's what they here's the summary I'll check that out L Lane has one called reps I also use examine.com same love them examine.com is really good and then I'll just go like to PubMed PubMed and just like read the the articles there from like fit that's where I'm like pulling a lot of my info outside of Fitness um just like audiobooks like whenever I'm running I'm typically listening to an audio book and that's crazy to me that's insane to me that you do that you you can't do that dude no like a I don't pay attention and B like it like you usually what I like to do is uh I like when I go for a run I know how many I like beat uh beat per minute song you know songs that are a certain beat per minute and so my stride will go to that that beat per minute you know what I mean which is typically like like around 80 be or 85 beats per minute I used to do that when I first started running I would do that but yeah I'll listen to an audio book in like 10 miles I forget I'm running for 10 miles like I just I listened to an audiobook during the marathon I did the exact same thing what I listened to uh the Martian Andy we uh the Sci-Fi dude you guys are so weird that is so weird to me dude you know what book I I just finished up that like I can't recommend enough it's called trust by Henry Cloud if you guys haven't read that yet or heard of it it's I mean maybe it's just hitting me at like the right time of my life but it is a powerful good book what is it it's all about like how to evaluate relationships and Trust how to regain or rebuild trust when you've been betrayed what to look for in in in trusting someone a lot of times we think that trust is someone who just like won't lie steal or cheat so like we'll hire people or bring people onto our team who meet those requirements oh they don't lie steal or cheat I can trust them or can we trust them in the capacity of the role that we're expecting them to perform dude this is serial killer [ __ ] that you can listen to a self- health book uh while you're like while you're like running a marathon I think that's so weird uh like I would read this B you went no headphones for the marathon right Nick yeah yeah I didn't no headphones that's what Ballers do sahill like if if you yeah that is what Ballers I grew real Runners will definitely give you [ __ ] yeah if you like go to a cross country practice or something and like you go run with headphones on like the the hardcores will totally mock you but I do it anyway because I'm like this is fun for me I'm doing what I want I'm not GNA be hard was what Nick said at the beginning by the way which is like when you uh if you publicly State you're going to hit some sort of like goals um the running like the the running hardcores will definitely talk crap and troll you until you post proof that you actually did it and then you kind of like have earned enough clout like I sort of feel like everyone made fun of me for getting into running and then I like posted some actual verifiable stats and now you you know now I'm like a solid amateur and people can't really make fun of you anymore so now you've like you've like earned the respect of the crew like the cool kids in the in the cafeteria so now like they can't come beat you up that's a real thing that actually happens yeah what's your what's your answer to that um what's my answer to uh where I go to yeah and who influences you who's like your your person I mean I grew up um so my baseball training I was the first client of this guy named Eric cresy who has now become pretty famous um he's the performance coach for the Yankees but is now like the Major League Baseball strength guy like trains Max jurz or Justin verland or all of like the who's who of baseball and guy's the worst person to get Fitness advice from that's like the fattest sport no he was like the um he was the first guy to like really bring strength and performance training to baseball so it was that it was like the fat guys or the steroid era guys who were just Meatheads and he brought like True Performance training to the sport which now is like the real driver of why every guy throws 100 miles an hour like guys are hitting absolute tanks all the time like he was really the pioneer of that I mean he's been on like Tim Ferris podcast he's really really big time and a close friend incredible uh and then there's this guy Ben Bruno who is like a celebrity trainer um pretty Instagram presence and he's more of the like stuff for regular people to actually Implement in their life um training and um I I just love that stuff because it's kind of a cool blend of the like more extreme things that I like doing with the actionable stuff that people can actually take as advice yeah B Bruno he's got like the uh like the everyday rip guy Vibe he he's super super strong functionally um and trains like insane legit celebrities out of like a 150 square foot gym in his garage yeah here's him with J timberlink yeah timberlink is like one of his one of his good friends rolls up there and trains with them he's he's incredible um and then on diet stuff there's this guy um Zach I think rousel is how you pronounce his last name he's like the flexible dieting lifestyle is his Instagram handle and he just posts like insane macro recipes basically um things that are like delicious but don't completely screw up your diet and I just I nerd out on that kind of stuff he's he's Austin Texas based yeah he's Austin based yeah dude Nick you probably know like half these guys I would bet I know I know Zach I know Zach personally you know who else is really good for like General Health Information Health and Fitness in information for people just getting started as Jordan s Jordan yeah Jordan SC so Jordan was an intern at Eric cress's gym so Jordan is my year in high school he went to Lincoln studbury High School which was like our rival high school and he was an intern at cr's gym when I was was training there so I've known Jordan since we were like we were kids oh wow yeah he's he's he's got good stuff by the way I Gary V's trainer I saw that I just went to this guy the flexible dieting lifestyle and I'm I'm like typing all the in as you guys are talking and I'll I'll do a little Flex I go to follow this guy and it says follow back oh yeah that's awesome Zach is awesome the protein ice cream recipes are like the best thing in the world yeah he this is a great Instagram this guy kills it do you have a do you have a creamy at home ninja creamy I do oh it's the best one of our best purchases my wife and I like every Saturday the ninja creamy you can make like protein ice cream with it they were they got popular based off of Tik Tock early on and they like were sold out for months and then they finally came back on the market we purchased one well I used to do that so what I do with your so uh bpn so I like to do uh a scent protein with just water and then I use bpn to like eat and so like for example I'll mix it with some type of liquid and I'll microwave bpn and it's almost like I'm eating like um I I don't know I mean it's like a dessert because you gave me the keyme pie one and then you gave me a birthday cake one and I think the birthday cake one is discontinued and I would just we would microwave it and just eat it and it was like a A sule or something now I guess I'll use bpn for this creamy Sam I will change your life right now two cups of whole milk like Fair life whole milk a scoop of bpn vanilla uh maybe like two tiny little packets of stevia and some uh sugarfree vanilla pudding mix freeze it overnight put it into the ninja creamy and it is literally identical to like a vanilla McDonald's McFlurry really it comes out insane and then you can put a couple like Oreo thins in there and get like a legit McDonald's McFlurry that has like 40 grams of protein and is gray for you dud this is awesome I'm like literally writing all this down and I just add the creamy to my cart it will change your life I'm not joking it is it is pretty wild I I did it my first time and like I only mixed it once and it came out I like what's this yeah you got to go twice I did it twice completely different thing the after like one more mix Light Ice Cream setting once open it up pour like a tiny uh like a tablespoon of whole milk in and then blend it on light ice cream again and it makes the perfect consistency all right I literally just bought it off Amazon the creamy and I'll I only have I gotta get bpn vanilla now because I only did chocolate birthday cake and key pie um I want to hear about this 239 though I'm gonna nerd out on this yeah so Nick you're trying to run 239 now for the marathon right no I just did so you just did at cim which is the California International Marathon that was December 3rd I ran a 23920 and when I went into that prep I was shooting for a sub 245 and and sub 24 5 is about a 615 minute per mile Pace ended up doing 605 minute per mile pace for all 26.2 of those miles can you just walk through your progression on the marathon stuff because I feel like I've seen a video so I mean I only I started running in March and someone mentioned your name as soon as I started getting into running as like the person that was pioneering this whole idea of like hybrid athlete whatever it's kind of become like an invogue thing now but basically a guy that can be both jacked and fit in cardio things not CrossFit like actual you know strength related stuff and then and then running and I remember seeing a video of you like a 4H hour marathon maybe um and your progression from that to running maybe sub three for the first time can you just walk through like what your progression has been from start to finish on the different marathons you've done yeah well first off when when you and I first started talking and you said you wanted to do a sub three for your first marathon I thought he was crazy when he said that dude so did I I was like man that's I think I even told you like that's a bold move but you did it so congratulations on that um but yeah my my my Marathon progression so my first marathon was in 2018 it was about a year after I got out of the military and what's funny is the day I got out of the military I said I would never run a day in my life again and about a year later was running my first marathon and here we are like thousands of miles later but 2018 Austin marathon I ran a 357 which was just an absolute dumpster fire but you weighed like 225 right that's was like 225 I didn't have a a training program I was a bodybuilder like I was just I just wanted to be as big and yolked as possible ran this marathon after mile 16 I hit the wall it was just all downhill from there a year later I signed up for the Austin marathon again same training program which was lack there up of and I ran a 4H hour 15-minute Marathon so I I ran 18 minutes slower than the previous year and then after that I signed up for my first Iron Man trained for an Iron Man did Iron Man Florida actually started to learn what it takes to build endurance and get better at endurance events and races you broke 12 hours in that one yeah I did my IR Iron Man Florida in 1128 but I ran the marathon in four hours and 4 minutes so the reason that was so kind of significant was I looked back at my previous two marathons I was like man after I just swam and biked and then ran I was able to run a pretty decent Marathon so I told myself I want to run sub three and that was the goal and I I I posted this online I said I'm doing a sub three hour marathon and the internet trolls and activity just blew up I mean there are Forums on let's run run there are Forums on on Reddit everyone was like this guy will not run a sub three hour marathon so then I signed up for the Austin marathon again I I followed a training program it was a better prep but even in my head I was like I'm not in sub three shape but at the starting line I told myself you can mentally out will anything I was like if I just like I can mentally overcome the physical weakness that I have to run the sub three hour marathon and what's sub three is sub3 650 per mile I think 651 is like 25959 like if you sneak in under one second and the only reason I know that is because of exactly what Nick said about mine that everyone was like dude there's no way so I knew in my mind like I just have to keep this under 651 my watch base and I'm gonna be fine see I like banking time so I always like I like saving time so at the end if I need it I have it which is the opposite of what like real Runners tell you to do I did the same thing by the way like I went out way too fast and then was just like hanging on for deer life doing the math in my head of like okay if I run like a 10-minute mile here I'm still going to make it I'm still because there's like they call it the wall the wall is basically I think it's like when you burn 1,00 or 2200 calories or something like that and you start going into what's it called where you like start using muscle as energy I believe orad of car yeah yeah yeah and that's when that wall is where you're like I can't go any further usually that's in like mile 20 right yeah ranges you know based off the individual like your conditioning your experience glycogen stores how how fast you burn through your body's energy so I went out that Austin marathon with a goal of running sub three I went out way too fast and within the first six miles I knew I wasn't going to do SUB three like I in the first six miles I was done for the Austin marathon is not flat it's it's Hills it's it's like a horrible PR course no one PRS that I know of at the Austin marathon so then the remainder of that race I was just holding on ended up running 3:24 so 24 minutes over sub three everyone on the internet that doubted me loved it and I went into another training block immediately after that race was done I actually did a real prep this time had a really solid Coach Jeff Cunningham and I ended up running a marathon a year later in 2 hours 56 minutes 27 seconds so that was the first time I went sub three then a year later I did the Buffalo New York Marathon in 248 and then just recently December 3rd 2023 I ran a 23920 which is a 605 God mile Pace what weight were you I was 195 pounds oh my God that's ridiculous at 195 and was ridiculous at any at any body weight but it's insane at 195 were you still squatting and benching while you're I mean were you you still strong I I I took a lot of time off strength training during that prep so for like 13 weeks leading up to that race I was still lifting here and there but I wasn't lifting legs heavy I wasn't lifting even upper body really heavy I was just getting some movement in just to maintain and feel good but the priority was was running because what a lot of Runners don't realize is like so 239 that's that's impressive that's very impressive but it's more impressive that you're doing it at your body weight that is that is that is like out of this world I um I got dinner one time recently with this guy named Josh Kerr do you guys know who Josh Kerr is unless you're a running nerd you don't know who he is but he won the world he won the World Championships recently in the 1500 meter he's like a 345 Miler so one of the fastest milers ever whatever but he's pretty big for a Miler for a normal human being you think he's skinny but for a Miler he's big and I started talking to him and I was like you're pretty big uh how'd you do this he goes man he's from uh Scotland I think he goes when I I came to America when I was 17 to go to college and I was training for the mile and I but I wasn't used to having fast food and like having restaurants open 24 hours a day and so I got fat like my first semester there and I weighed 200 pounds and I broke the mile when I was 17 or 18 that year when I weighed 200 pounds he goes I think I own the world record for the fattest sub4 Mile and like 200 lb for like just a guy who's 6 foot that's not huge but d to run that time or the time even that uh you're running or even sahill you're pretty big too for running those times with that weight that's just like inconceivable not only because it's hard but what's inconceivable is that you're not getting hurt running 50 to 80 miles a week leading up to it that's what's like in my mind the most impressive part here yeah mean when I first started running I I had a lot of injuries just because my my body mechanics weren't super efficient so I've had knee injuries uh quads ankles shins calves like everything but now as I've I've run longer with more miles my body has become pretty efficient at Form and Function and I rarely get injured anymore unless I do like a an ultra marathon I had two um you know from my training I just had two like random life lesson type things from the running that I'm curious Nick if you've experience these one was before my Marathon I was trying to figure out like how to just like mentally take on um the goal of running sub three for it and how to think about like if I'm six miles into the race and I realize I'm not going to hit it how to make sure I still finish the race and don't just like mentally completely lose it and this marathoner told me that for every single race or anything that you're going after you want to have basically three goals he was like you have your a goal which is the main thing you're trying to hit and then you have a b goal which is like just slightly worse and then you have a c goal which is just like finish the Damn Race and you can always like you lock in on your a goal from the start but if you start falling off that and realize you're not going to hit it you need something to fall back on that keeps you motivated when you're in it and so you have your B goal and then the C goal is just get to the finish line and I have taken that and like run with it in every area of life now like no matter what it is if you have a fitness goal like a daily Fitness goal you want to you know run every day and work out every day it's good to have that a goal but the reality is that like [ __ ] hits the fan sometimes like your kid is up all night or you know like you have a problem at home or something at work pops up and so having that idea of like what is the B goal maybe it's a slightly lower version and then the C goal is like I'm just going to go for a walk and get 15 minutes of movement in that has helped me so much in terms of just like navigating the vagaries of life that inevitably hit when you know you're not going to have your perfect day every single day yeah it's like the mindset of like all or nothing so like you see so many people at every marathon every race it's very applicable to anything else in life but you see these Elite runners go out and as soon as they fall off of pace they drop out they just fall to the side and I was actually talking to Ken R out a few weeks ago when he was on uh my podcast and now he lives right down the road for me here in in Nashville but he was telling me when he did Kona Iron Man years and years and years ago go during the race he realized he wasn't going to hit the time he wanted so he just dropped down to the race and he him and his family traveled to Hawaii for this race so there's a lot of time effort energy money going into it he dropped down to the race and he said it was like his greatest regret ever so he he forced himself to go back the next year for for Redemption just to prove to himself that he could do it but I think the the feelings the emotions and just everything that that's created when you quit something and drop out because you weren't on Pace for that egg goal I mean that's like self-destruction that hurts so much more than not actually finishing the race the other thing that's funny to me about uh all Runners that I feel like they've gone through you said it like with your first marathon or when you left the military you were like I'm never going to run again I'm done with this it's like uh it's like women after they have um after they have babies there's like that chemical that gets released that makes them forget how much it hurts going through child birth I think the same thing happen with running it just is like a little more delayed like when I finished my Marathon I was like [ __ ] this I'm never running another Marathon my like that was the most painful thing I ever experien like the last six miles I wouldn't wish that on my worst damn enemy in the world and then like two weeks later I'm like like which one should I sign up for next year like I Gotta Go 249 I gotta do this yeah I mean it's I'm the same way with Ultras like I finished an ultra and I'm out for two weeks I can't walk my toenails are falling off and I talk to my wife I'm like this is this was stupid why did I do this I'm useless I can't help on at home and I find myself signing up for another Ultra shortly after dude your Ultra documentary was so good I I remember I like had I subscribed for like the premiere so I was like sitting at my TV waiting for it to come out it was an hour long about Leadville I think right yeah uh it was so good I remember I was like one of the first ones I was like all right it's coming up at this time Sarah let's sit down and watch it and what's crazy about you is like there's this whole thing where these people who talking cliches or like every Media or every company should be a media company yada yada Y and the thing is they mostly suck at it you're actually one of the few guys that has like your supplements they meet I don't know what the grade is but you know I know uh I've talked to you and I talked to other people about it and your competitors will be like yeah bpn they they meet this particular grade they are of high quality but you also you nail that the supplement thing but then you also are nailing the media thing and no one else or very few other people are doing that where they're you're actually really nailing it it's almost You could argue that your media is even better than the supplements because supplements like I don't know how the industry works but it seems like yeah they like these five are great but your media is awesome I appreciate that you had like it looked like you had three or four guys following you around the whole time your wife was there I feel like I know her because of of the videos and then she was following you on Instagram or and talking about your splits and these guys have these beautiful cameras it was just like it it was a great documentary how many views did that have the Leadville doc now has I think one and a half million it was so good man it was so good are you did you come up with that storyline or did you just hire a good a good team that's my creative director Jordan in house here where's he from Jordan is from Ohio geographically but he was just when I met him he was employee number four at bpn and he was filming for another YouTuber when I met him as a Freel answerer and I was looking for a videographer at the time because this was 2019 at the time I was still filming and editing all my own videos that's crazy that's a [ __ ] ton of work I mean all I did all literally all I did was work and 2019 was the first time I was able to bring some on on but I was looking for like over a year for the right person I would fly people down they would stay with me i' meet them we'd film something it just didn't feel right so I didn't to it met Jordan felt right he moved down creative director he led my content for a while then he went and led bpn content for a while and now he's back working directly on my content again but he came up with the storyline the the whole production The Scouting the editing process obviously we had a lot of guys on the team supporting that editing and and filming and production but Jordan LED that that project we just launched the last man standing Ultra that he led and created with Ian Rodriguez here on my team and we posted the cim race video Monday but yeah Jordan is a super talented creative what's your how much are you spending per year on a team for content and are you able to are you tracking the ROI or is this just like a thing where you're like I'm pretty sure it's working it's up I'm pretty sure it's working I mean our our media team is I mean with videog just videographers photographers we have 10 but then we have our social team and a lot of my business decisions as like as an entrepreneur one thing I've learned and I think we were talking about this when when you were on my podcast a few months ago is that I make a lot of my decisions and I've made a lot of my decisions in business based off of intuition and gut feeling I never looked at the p&l I never looked at the balance sheet if I had this feeling that it was working and I could feel momentum and I had a pulse on it I was just like keep keep spending keep hiring then finally at one point I I hired operators a CFO a CEO and they're like hey we got to put some some guard rails around this but like all of my decisions in business have been intuition gut if it feels right I'm going to do it I have I have a feeling there's going to be an Roi I might not be able to measure it but I can subjectively tell if it's going to work or it is working is it separate at all like the Nick bear Fitness platform and your personal social media is that separate from bpn as like a functional entity or are the people like the videographers the 10 people is that all under bpn yeah the whole process has has changed significantly over the last couple years so originally it was all one team and then at one point we separated out where I have now have the Nick bear Fitness business and then the bear performance nutrition business so there were like two separate teams and the Nick bear Fitness business is your app right your app and your channel yeah it's like my my content my IP uh my my channel my training app stuff like that I used to do brand deals I don't do any brand deals anymore more dude Hoka should have been paying you like seven figures a year I bought hokas because of you because I saw I was like oh big guy wears hokas hokas is thing the amount of the amount of hoko renc cons I sold when I first started running has to be absolutely ridiculous so just talking about the separation we separated out Nick bear Fitness team and bpn team for a while really it it made no sense uh of what we were doing and why we're doing it just I just thought it was the professional move to take in that next step and stage of business now we've brought it all back into one entity I still have the Nick bear Fitness business but everyone that is working on media is on bpn payroll is a bpn team member and all the content we're creating is in the hope of building the supplement business now the teams are separated working on different projects like I have my creative director Jordan who's leading my content Ian who's working on my content Everett who's a podcast producer and then we have videographers creatives that are working on just bpn stuff but there's definitely crossover and the lines are blur blurrier than they used to be do you think that dings your valuation if you ever wanted to sell the company because it's so tied onto you I don't know if it it dings the valuation but I definitely think that a process and a sale would come with a whole lot of structure a lot of I IP IP negotiations and possibly issues um I feel like it's less than you think actually I um I was always impressed so I had actually taken bpn supplements before knowing you and had no idea who you were or that you were involved they had just like popped up as one of the supplements I was taking actually that's not the bulk you think you think s that's the bulk of custom honestly I have no idea I just remember like back in my private Equity days we looked at um on it you remember that I don't know if it's still around on it was selling and it was like they had a huge exit well it was so tied to joean and what was his name Aubrey um yeah Aubrey Marcus and that was like when we were looking at it private Equity guys like that's their biggest fear is like oh how involved are these two guys like is it a key man risk all this stuff and then ultimately they ended up getting to an amazing exit with somebody and you know they put guard rails around it they get like keyman insurance or whatever it is um but I I would I mean I'd be interested to find out actually like run a survey of your customers like What proportion actually end up coming through you and your media versus now just like the flywheel is spinning SEO is there um and the business kind of just you know is self-propagating well that's been the fear with my businesses which is I don't want to make it me I want to make it its own thing but me or Nick or sahill like that gets initial base but it's like at what point do you when do you make the transition and it's a that's a challenging there's a I don't know the answer to that question and I'm afraid of the repercussions of making the wrong making the wrong choice you know what I mean yeah that that's been a topic of discussion for the last couple years with us and trying to figure out how to navigate that and for a while I kept leading into okay well let's separate in the hopes of building bpn away from myself so that it's separate and distinct and can stand on its own but what I I found by doing that is the the separation created this loss of vision and brand so I've kind of just like flipped my whole thought process on that and said screw whatever happens in the future and I'm G to lean fully back in and I don't care really how it affects valuation or the end process anymore I'm just going to build a brand that I'm really proud of and the way I want to build it and whatever happens happens and if someone comes knocking on my door in the next couple years and says like hey we love what you're doing let's talk but if you don't like it you know I just want to make sure I'm enjoying the process and not building a business based off of kpis and Milestones and I bet you're I mean I have I have no idea I've never seen you comment on this but I would I would have to assume the app that you have how much do you charge 50 bucks a month or something uh it's $1 199.99 a month so I would have to imagine that's doing well too right I mean I I make much more money outside of bpn that I make personally with bpn yeah I mean I I think it's killing it s have you ever thought about doing it yeah I mean that type of business model is incredible right it's just like the ultimate scalability and you know as your personal it just for you as you think about reinvesting cash flows into your brand building it just makes it it makes it so much more dynamic because you can run all of your media stuff at break even if you want to like you can just reinvest all the cash that you're generating from YouTube ads from the app from any of those things into creating better and better content and create this massive flywheel and just count on bpn as the like long-term upside bet yeah but if I had a bet I I bet you Nick if I had a bet Nick has probably been even though his net worth has skyrocketed I if I had to bet you'd live you've lived relatively poor compared to the net worth that you've created cash flow poor and now you probably taste this and you're like okay finally I can afford like uh to live like I want to live as as opposed to just living on $80,000 a year yeah I mean for the first I I didn't take any money out of the business for the first five years what do you get like just like a like a army or you get like a military stien or something yes it work it worked well because started the business 2012 2017 is the year I transitioned out of the army so I actually had to start paying myself then me and my brother who moved down from Pennsylvania to help us build the business we signed our first Warehouse lease that year it was the first year we hit seven figures in revenue and it was also like the most challenging year in my entire life because I didn't know anything about financing inventory I didn't know anything about leveraging debt I didn't know anything about taking out business loans or utilizing lines of credit cash flow is an absolute nightmare the only money I thought I had to spend was the money that was in the bank account we had no terms with manufacturers like 20 2017 was arguably the the worst and hardest year of my life but also the best year of my life that if I could go relive any year right now it'd be that year that's insane that's one thing by the way like just the the time frame on all of this I feel like people don't appreciate time as a lever for growth on anything um as much as they should and actually like people in Fitness and athletes understand it better because they understand that like growing slowly is the game and just getting better slowly like when I look at your YouTube channel and go to most popular videos a bunch of these videos like you've been at this for years and years there's like six-year-old video four-year-old video three-year-old video like eight-year-old video the 10,000 calorie cheat day challenge like some of this stuff you've just been add it and I know you just said it you were editing these like you were actually on the ground spending the like 100 hour weeks doing this stuff for a long long time it wasn't like you all of a sudden popped up and had this unbelievable you know production quality that you have today so I I also just think like appreciating time as a lever for growth on these fronts is incredible that is one one thing that's been a powerful skill for myself over this last decade plus is just the consistency at which I've just kept doing the thing but even the one thing Sam and I talked about when he was on my podcast I think you you were going to do like a speech and you you were back in like the green room before going out to the speech and talking to all these high worth individuals who are super powerful and they're all sitting there super insecure and scared and nervous and like yeah they're like holy [ __ ] these people aren't any more secure confident or better than me and I think once you realize that that I have all the skills that I need to take whatever is I want to take to the top I just have to apply it because I used to think and I went through this phase where I like okay I'll get this business I'll get this thing to this this level but at some point I'm not going to be smart enough so I'm going to have to Outsource people to come in and take it from where I build it to where it needs or can go and sometimes you do that but you don't have to and I've realized that there's no one smarter than me that's going to take this business to the level it needs to go I just have to be super consistent at this approach for a long period of time and it's GNA pay off in dividends but you did hire a CEO I think what are you a year into to that a little over a year yep how's that it's been great I mean the the main reason I wanted to step out of the CEO role and I I wasn't actively looking to hire a CEO but cat came into the business first is kind of just an advisor and then she joined as the chief Revenue officer leaning into more operations and then we just had a conversation one day I was like hey would you ever want to be CEO cuz I really just want to like focus on creating content and brand building and she's like yeah if you want me to be CEO I'll be CEO so we made the switch because the business got to a point in a size where I wasn't spending my time on the things that I was passionate about anymore I was spending my time on like people management and lawsuits and Retail and finances and p&l and balance sheets and I was like this is all like super critical important stuff but I don't love it I want to focus on what I love and that's creating content that's building brand that's getting people jacked up that's talking about the products it's working on new product Innovation and that's why I wanted to make that change which has been like much harder than I thought it would be and I'm only now a year in of that transition really finding my Lane but this last year for me has been an interesting one dude and it's hard so so I I have a CEO too we'll be at one year in a couple months and it's hard because you want to be a good I don't know what it's called a good partner with your CEO where you want them to make mistakes and you want them to you know put their flavor and stuff because you got to let a CEO do that but then at the same time you're like but I already did all this and I can tell you what the outcome of this is going to be or uh you know it's just like it's really it's a it's a it's like getting married where you and but not living together right away and so you get married and then you move in and you're like oh you're [ __ ] quit leaving the cap off the toothpaste and it's like well no you can't like [ __ ] about little stuff you got to let them do what they want to do you know what I mean it's like kind of weird it's like a it's like a weird there's it's a weird thing but you have to learn how to like manage each other and it's and it is a challenge but when it works it's hard it's it's the best at any point do you feel the need to jump back into the CEO role well in my when I get pissed off I'll be like I gotta do this and then I'll get like end of week or end of month updates and I'm like oh my God Jordan is so much better at me than all of these things and I and and also like I would have done this different this different this different and those three things I probably would have been wrong about so like the the name of the game isn't being right 100% of the time the name of the game is being right for the right things most of the time and I just had to like kind of like have empathy and put myself in his shoes and that helped a lot but uh no like when I on a bad day when I get pissed off I'm like I should do this and then 99% of the time I'm like you are more talented than I am at so many things I cannot do this yeah I think sometimes too when you're when you're far removed from the position for an extended period of time you forget all the bad things you have to used to deal with and you only remember the good like man I kind of miss this and you get exposed to all the the things the bad things that you don't miss too much no you got it you run with it it also kind of I just before you jump forward from that Sam it um it also differs greatly between like a true business operations Endeavor and a creative Endeavor like you couldn't step away and truly have a CEO just like running your content apparatus because it would lose it would lose the like the Nick soul that is in it that's in every single piece of content that exists you can like build your team around it but you actually being in that creatively um I think is so key there was this um I think it was Jerry Seinfeld um did a interview with I think it was like the Harvard Business review and they uh they asked him about the fact that him and Larry David basically like wrote every episode of Seinfeld and after nine years they had basically burned out and so the show just had to end because they had burned out on doing it and the Harvard Business Review was like could you have hired McKenzie uh to come in and like help you find a better model and design something and Jerry Seinfeld said who's McKenzie and they said it's a consulting firm and Seinfeld responded uh are they funny and and basically his point was you don't like I don't need them if they're not funny because the efficient way of doing the creative thing is actually the wrong way and what he said is the right way is the hard way the show was successful because they did it the hard way they micromanaged every single detail of the creative process and they really had their soul in it and so I think that like your creative success and what has allowed all your businesses to thrive are also fundamentally tied to the fact that you have your soul in every sing piece of content that you guys are putting together yeah I agree with that I think sometimes entrepreneurship and building a business and and founding and Company from the outside looking in like people make it seem easy so it's romanticized and everyone's like oh I could start a business I could do it and then you finally do it and like you have this passion around everything you're building but then it gets hard and it gets challenging and then it grows and then you know your passions are sidelined for the priorities other other the for other parts of the business but it's just maintaining that consistent work ethic even when you're working on things that you truly weren't passionate about in the beginning but you know it drives business and leads you to an ultimate end goal well guys uh I appreciate you coming on uh it was a little impromptu but this is fun I just like hanging out with you guys and and learning um nick uh sahill I'm close to sahill so I don't say this to him but Nick I've uh I've looked up to you for a while now and I appreciate you doing this sahill I appreciate you doing this too this is awesome no thanks guys appreciate the opportunity all right that's the [Music] pod

more joy is derived from the anticipation of an event versus the actual event itself I just had this with my kids for Christmas the whole buildup to Christmas Day and the idea of Christmas morning and opening up all your presents I got 25 days of joy out of that from them and then on the day of you know they woke up they started ripping presents open they didn't even know which toy to play with and it was over like an hour and then they were like okay can we have cartoons with breakfast now and I was like yep all right I guess back to the routine and I just realized these people are right New Year's anticipations might be a thing because instead of planning and committing like some brute Alpha saying I'm going to do this you just say oh I can't wait to have X experience I can't wait to do y and that might be a little bit more fulfilling

you want to start something that can get to a billion in exit value in 5 years you have a new company now is that the one that you think going to do it so when I was at fubo TV when I left we were doing about a billion dollars a year in Revenue I think about 700 million was the monthly subscriptions to fubo TV and then 300 million was the advertising so I thought to myself why are these companies coming to fubo TV we're big but we're not massive so what we've done is we've built this huge infrastructure we have thousands and thousands of merchants tens of millions of SKS that kind of organically come into this data set we've trained a language model to understand nothing besides what's in that data set and then that can communicate to a user so they can have an ongoing conversation think about like not just Neiman Marcus or not just Macy's or not just a retailer who picked a couple hundred Brands to carry but you can essentially communicate back and forth with an inventory of every brand in the world

you drop out of college and you start a company that you end up selling for can you say how much you sold for yeah it was 40 million at that time you must have been pretty young how old were you when you sold 23 what was the idea and how did you make that happen I was actually at the University of Missouri for a year enjoyed my time there was not for me though always wanted to kind of start a company when I dropped out I didn't really have the exact plan yet but I did always play a lot of online poker I started hearing whispers of them legalizing gaming nationally here in the United States I just sat down and essentially just wrote out for hours how I thought the market would evolve and my conclusion was that there will be early players you'll have DraftKings and FanDuel it really would end up being dominated by either the brick and mortar Casino companies to date all the technology had been built overseas cuz it's been around for 50 years but it was like built in the early 2000s where you had like these desktop applications to place a bet and then to get to Mobile they just like compressed it into a mobile experience so I said what if I just rebuilt all that and then called these big companies and said hey don't white label this garbage from Sweden and pay some huge rev share what if we just do a deal

that's a great idea I'm glad I brought this up I should do this I love how you were like you gave me a great idea but the thing you said was completely different than what I said that's how that's how this works that's how this thing works that's a little yes and there for you to all my thespians out [Music] there all right we're live Sean what are we what are we talking about you're kicking it off well maybe you should introduce yourself I don't even recognize you because it's New Year New You am I right Sam save me new year new year same [ __ ] as always yeah nothing nothing will change I I have I didn't I purposely didn't set any goals this year I'm just gonna go with the flow what why what are you what are you thinking well I want to talk about New Year's um resolutions and stuff at first I have to apologize we did not put out a lot of content over the last week or so normally who cares no big deal and I thought well you know this is good let's take a little break spend time with the family you're a new dad I'm an existing Dad let's just be quality home home bodies here and F family men family first right but the thing is about family first is that the time I need podcast the most is when I'm with my family this might sound crazy to people who aren't podcast people but I know there's other people like me out there who you love your family you spend a lot of time with your family a little too much time sometimes with your family and you need this little mini breaks um I was taking out the trash and I was then I had to like walk my dog and I was like I went to my favorite podcasters Channel and they didn't have anything new for me and I was like damn this is what I needed I needed a little break from the family world just to go and Escape who's your favorite podcaster um I like Bill Simmons he's it's because I like to just listen to basketball stuff or or Sports things and so I will and I've been listening to him since I don't know 2006 or something he's like the first podcaster I've ever heard um so I have this familiarity built up and when there's not a new episode I hate it and I realized we're that person for some people out there we are there we are there uh escape from family card or escape from the boring you know chore and I know that it was holiday time but I bet people needed us more and we weren't there so next year we will be there that's my commitment to you guy out there who's who's has to run errands and deal with a bunch of BS we should have just done reruns could we have done a rerun and it been all right just our voices actually just ASMR of us saying nonsense just gibberish for hours um did you have you ever seen this Louis CK skit or like or one of his bits from his standup thing where he talks about being a dad now that now now that you're a dad you're going to start to appreciate this one joke it's not even that funny you know some people are like it's so true that's that's hilarious this is just it's so true it's not even that hilarious what he say he talks about he's like um the greatest 30 seconds in the world he's like you know what the greatest 30 seconds in the world is he's like when you put your kid in the car and you [ __ ] you get him into the car seat you finally clip it all together and then you close the door and you have like 30 seconds while you're walking from their door back to your door and that 30 seconds of silence and Solitude is everything in life and it's so true this was the the first week that I experienced where I was like oh a break would be nice because my my baby has been perfect mostly but like she goes to like a week of growing and she'll cry more than normal mostly she doesn't cry at all and I remember there was a day where she cried for like an hour and I was like all right I understand why why why people request breaks because before I was like why would I ever want to leave this thing I'm getting so much dopamine from it now it was the first time that I experienced a break so I'm slowly understanding some of these things um do you know how chill I am when my like our Nanny will be like Oh I'm sick or whatever she calls out sick or you hey my my daughter's visiting from college can I have the day off and dude I get I'm in my head I'm like yeah of course no problem but in my soul I'm like enraged I'm like how dare you make me spend all day with my kids how dare you how I have to look after my own like you know this is an injustice that has happened to me that don't you feel guilt you don't feel guilt you're like the guilt being why am I so reliant on this person I experienced that a little bit cuz we have a Night Nurse I'm past that I fully accepted that that is the way I need to live and that that is a necessity and actually a right of mine a core a core human right an American right of Mine by the way right up there next with aoli being just flavored mayonnaise Night Nurse is beautiful rebranding it's basically just this young woman who I have no idea what her credentials really are but she just like plays on her phone While She lays on the couch next to my daughter and when she cries at this point now it's only one night a week or one time a night and she gives her a bottle and then just goes back to sleep and I'm basically paying someone a full-time salary to live and sleep on my couch right and because we call it a nurse I think there's some type of medical compon it ain't there if it was called uh if it was called like sleep sitter and it's a babysitter we just pay her you know to help with one one one moment while we sleep it' feel a little different than night yes beautiful rebranding by the way I think the the aoli for this is got to be opare by the way what a word what a fantastic word okay we can move on yeah opair is a beautiful one too by the way do we're thinking about getting an opair and uh I was like wait so we just get this like young 23y old who's just going to be living at our home and it's kind of weird it's it's pretty weird when do you think about it it's weird right okay so now I want to talk about resolutions so in the past do you do resolution you said you didn't do it this year is that part of like chill mod yeah so so so what I do is I have four categories and I named them all FS because it's cute so Family Fitness Fun finances so I'll usually have a finance goal of like I want to make this much money I want to launch this thing do this that's a business thing friendship would be the last one and I was so excited for myself there but okay finances works too that that's fun that's fun the Forgotten fifth F okay that's fun so fun is like trips I want to do this with friends whatever family is uh you know Sarah and I want to achieve this thing together we want to communicate more I don't know whatever it is and then uh Fitness is you know this much weight lifted this whatever normally I do that right now I've not said it and I'm said I'm going to do quarterly but I'm not gonna start it for another month yeah oh dude I'm in this I'm on the I'm in the same boat I have a very very similar exercise that I do I think mine are like you know work play uh love and you know whatever Fitness or health you know something like that branding is is a lot better you should do Family Fitness Finance fun well I just don't want to use your thing now cuz feel like oh I'm going to do Sam's New Year resolutions today kill me now all right so um so so I agree with what you normally do and I normally do the same but I don't know why I had extreme aversion to it this year and so I looked up some alternatives to New Year's resolutions the aversion I think came from a bunch of thread Boys on Twitter I think honestly there's just like a lot of content on Twitter right now of people being like just wrapped up the annual plan annual review of 2023 and my predictions and plans for 2024 and I was like just just too much for me I can't I need to just get away from this and no one hits them and in general I would say if I try to think of all right what is what is the new stuff I'm going to do it's such a small boy attitude to be like yeah I waited till the uh I waited till the first to do the things I wanted to do it's like no I like anything I wanted to do anything I realized I should do a decision I just made in in that moment and started doing it immediately I just did it on November 21st instead of January 1 and so I think what are your Alternatives okay so a couple Alternatives you tell me if you like these or not so saw this on Tik Tok this is definitely such a a sort of jenzy approach to life they go New Year resolutions goals uh are what are you my dad bingo card New Year's bingo card so here's here's how a New Year's bingo card works I I don't know how many things are on a bingo grid I think it's like 16 squares so you just come up with 16 but also leave a couple blank if you can't think of them gen Z that's how we roll um you just come up with some things that you might do this year it's a maybe it's a huh huh might go might go to travel might go backpacking through Central America might not though um might start dating somebody also fine alone and that's blank you just come you know you come up with squares of things that might be fun to do this year got it and then you just see if you do them and if you do them Bingo you just try to you shade it in you you shade in the square and you see how you get a bigo card and it's a low pressure Vis but it's like an actual little vision board and I was like I think I kind of like this by the way on my bingo card this year if I were to do it I they're in Houston they're doing a zerg flight and it's five grand and they take you up into this have you seen that they take you up into like a 747 that's like empty and it's like full of like pillows and you float for like 20 seconds at a time that's going to be on my bingo card this year I'm I'm scared of it but I so I might do it might do it what an attitude what a what a new attit what a refreshing attitude to the new year right so the jenz Bingo cart this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated W I can see the client's whole history call support tickets emails and here's a task from 3 days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better here's another one this is comes from the uh the psychology World here are my New Year's anticipations what what is that you just say things you're looking forward to this year you just brainstorm you just say oh man I'm looking forward to that that would be so fun that would be amazing and the reason why is these psychologists did a study and they found that actually more joy is derived from the anticipation of an event from versus the actual event itself and like I just had this with my kids for Christmas like we did the Elf on the Shelf thing um and just in general like the build the whole buildup to Christmas Day and the idea of Christmas morning and opening up all your presents like I got 25 days of joy out of that from them because the anticipation and then on the day of you know they woke up they started ripping presents open they didn't even know which one to play which toy to play with and uh it was over like an hour and then they were like okay can we have cartoons with breakfast now and I was like yep all right I guess back to the routine and uh and it was kind of done and I just realized these people are right New Year's anticipations might be a thing because instead of planning and committing like some some brute Alpha saying I'm gonna do this you just say oh I can't wait to have x and x x experience I can't wait to do why and uh that that might be a little bit more more fulfilling what do you think eight all right eight I give that an eight that's pretty good wow okay I thought you were pretty on bingo card bingo card is cool and I you know anytime you said if you say I read a study that said this it's like saying that's like when a restaurant has a sign that says world's greatest cup of coffee I have a rule that if I see a restaurant that says world's greatest blank I always go to it that's my rule because I think if you have the audacity to say that then I will give you the I'll try it so that that if you say yeah so like uh hearing someone say a study once said just makes me weak in the knees and gets me all hot and bothered so I'm you know the funny thing by the way so I saw that and I was like you didn't see a study on it that that's no so I was like who oh I was like for the first time ever I was like yeah I'll take the special right like you know the waiter read specials you never ordered the special I was like let me read the study and I scrolled down and it said University of Scranton and I was like oh pretty sure it's a madeup town from the office I don't think Scranton exists and so oh oh Dunder Mifflin came out with a study this year so this is probably [ __ ] but uh nevertheless that's that's where the study came from all right here's another one there's this guy on uh on Twitter that's he's made his brand all around the idea of obsession you know this guy no I wish what what's what is it yeah basically it's like the good version of OCD he's like uh anyway he's all about being obsessed and so he goes he goes my he instead of New Year's resolution he goes my year of obsession he goes I believe that a one-year Obsession can change your life that's awesome that's an awesome sentence right that's like a actually a pretty powerful sentence I read it I was like I'm in and I closed the tab I was like I don't even want to anything else you say is gonna make me like you less than that first sentence Morgan hle had the guy we had on he had this great quote he said people don't remember books they remember sentences and I try to make like memorable sentences that's a memorable sense that's a beautiful sense and I think that that is so true that one one year of obsession really can change your life if you de said this year I'm going to be obsessed with X and you just started to just rev up that engine of obsession and whether it's around you know working out or it's around um having fun or it's around you know this company that you're going to start or whatever it is creating content whatever it is I think that's just an amazing attitude it's for some reason it's different than a resolution that's the best I would even say the year of like identity where you I mean obsession is actually better but it's like a year where you change your identity I remember like do you remember like three or four years ago when I was kind of pudgy and I was like this is the year I become a fitness influencer and I was joking but I was like I was g i I was I was gonna make Fitness part of my my identity right it's the same thing Obsession identity that's a that's beautiful that's a beautiful sentence that's a nine that's a nine okay you're in on that one um so okay another one forget forget looking forward do a New Year's reflection so in just forget the to the the kind of to-do list of here's a bunch of promises I'm going to break to myself you know like uh which is what the New Year resolutions tend to be instead just triple down on the reflection so really take a walk down memory lane open up your camera go through your camera roll go watch you know January February March April write down what's some of your your best experiences were you know just do a little bit of a journal entry kind of to end the year um send a few thank you notes uh to people or moments or um you know people who or or you know experiences that you had with people just talking about how great they were or you know how much you appreciated having them um reflect on you know maybe everybody I think everybody always says um oh man I learned so much and I grew so much and then if you ever say awesome what what' you learn the writer's block occurs sudden suddenly silence silence sweeps over the room um try to actually sus out like what did I really learn um and what were the big learning moments for me this year this happened and my learning was X and I did like a monster reflection exercise the other day so fun and I think that people should do this in a more intense way forget like the method just just do it in a more intense way just be like I'm gonna actually really try to dig in so I've been doing that every year for a while and I would just put them in Google Docs but now so like if you're listen you're listen I don't know what day this will go live but if you go to the anti mba.com you'll see my reflection and the antiba that's just my personal blog I barely ever share I don't give a [ __ ] who reads it um not that many people read it because I don't really share it but I started doing this publicly now just to reflect and my family will be able to read it in 10 or 30 years which is awesome right imagine when your mom was coming to India if or coming from India if she instead of just telling you the stor she you could read her blog what she thought then and so I've been doing that a lot lately um it's awesome it's really fun and it's awesome to go through your camera role because your camera tells you exactly every month what's going on relationship hack learned this from Tony Robbins he's he basically said once a month he's like me and my he's like it's very easy with your wife to like uh or your partner and just to to kind of like get into some routine where you're just like mostly your focus and energy is in your work or your kids or your whatever and like that kind of dating time is gone and people try to do they try to like you know reignite the spark with like oh it's date night tonight but like you're both kind of tired and you know you already have had a bunch of conversations not that much new stuff to share it's like hey what's new with you I don't know the same things you've been going through you know like we've been together my in-laws were in town and they were like hey Sam Sarah do you guys want us to watch a baby and you could have a date night and we're like yeah but could our date night be we're just going to go upstairs and scroll on our phone yeah that sounds great Sam's gonna turn on a bath and Sarah's gonna leave the house yeah like that that was our version of date night so well I have that all the time that in that case but but Tony Robin said this he does exercise called flooding which is he's like real romantic he's like just sit down and basically um open up the you know the camera roll or videos and just watch together um you know something from like a year ago three years ago whatever it is and just kind of flood those memories um to together and it will almost rebond you because you'll both you'll both re-experience what you've already experienced and um it's a kind of like low low bar way to uh it's sort of like the minimum dose you need to get like sort of a Maximum Impact in terms of how close you feel with somebody and I've been doing that it's it's pretty awesome don't do it every month but like I do it from time time you should blog this just play create like a Blog that no one that you don't care if anyone reads and and kind of forc yourself to write on there it's pretty awesome but dude whenever I write something everybody reads it it gets like super popular just don't share it it's just it's just like uh you know like I you know my big thing is I read a lot of history it's crazy people used to like journal and diary remember when you were a kid and someone told me about like having a diary and I'm like dude that's what like chicks do I'm not going to write a diary now we're just going to re brand it call it blogging and it's way more fun you know do I have it here it's in the other room right now but uh I bought not like a journal because you know most journals are like very small and uh that's great but like actually writing in a journal can be kind of uh it's kind of hard it's kind of limited I bought one of those artist sketch pads like a huge like thick card stock canvas thing this thing is amazing it's a absolute pleasure to write on and draw on I don't feel Limited in any way um way better than a journal I I really love this thing I leave it on my desk most days and I just have it there I could take notes on one side I can scribble an idea on the other and it's just the idea of a sketch pad is just way better than these like yeah but in 20 years your kids are going to be like why did Dad just make these stupid s's with the six lines like what is what is that what is that uh doodle he keeps that dumb s that everyone does like why does it keep drawing cubes like over and over again dude there's no chance my kids care about what I was thinking when I was 35 years old or that's the reality maybe maybe one day one little thing but uh no all right last uh last one here for New Year's so we got the bingo card we got anticipations we got the obsession we got the reflection um the last one is just this one's actually not it's kind of the best one to end on but the magic word and the magic word is um you pick a theme for really just the month so you forget the year Year's too long you just say all right January my word word of the month right now the theme of this month is going to be um uh playful flirting I'm flirt with everybody right you just come up with whatever the word is I'm going to take every situation I'm going to try to infuse this word into it or as as often as I can I'm gonna try to have this be the theme right I actually think that's great what yours gonna be just like pizza that's what Ranch is what doesn't get better with ranch ranch that's so funny yeah I think January is just carbs uh no I think magic is good well no matter which one of these new years you pick uh just remember January 12th January 12th is National quitters day it's the second Friday after the New Year by that time I think like more than half of people have completely abandoned their thing I saw the guy who the founder of that that company sliced pizza they're like a yeah a nationwide like pizza delivery thing he's like uh he he said something like January 12th 201 15th he's like um he's like hey sales will be down for the next two weeks but then our biggest day of the year is coming he's like Is that real super super bowl of pizza delivery is on National quitters Day when people give up on their uh on their diets by the second week of January and they move on so yeah that that is what it is second Friday of Jan that company by the way is killing it who would have thought who not I not I is the answer not I not I um all right let me bring up a juicy topic I got a big juicy one I got one that when I was researching this I kept giggling and I kept laughing as a bystander this topic it it is it is awesome it has made me so happy and let me explain why so I've got this friend I met him in Hampton I think he said that you knew him through one of his software companies uh he won some contest we did his name is Spencer Scott and he owns two software companies the software company that I think he spoke to us about it's pretty funny you go to like your website so for in our case let's say mfmp pod.com and you could see who's on your website and you could video call with them and it just pops up and it says hey you in Austin if you have any questions I'm here in real time you can ask me questions whatever he's got these software companies I think they probably do4 or $500,000 a year in Revenue he makes a great Living Well something happened to him and the way that he reacted to this is just hilarious so Spencer lives outside of Dallas and apparently there is an issue where the trash collectors come and they leave their trash bins like they come and pick up the bins and they leave them like all over the place and so seeing that he's like a scrappy entrepreneur I'm looking at a photo of that like we should post a photo of this on the YouTube channel there's somebody's uh trash cans like one looks like it got in a World Star Hip-Hop fight it just got beat up it's on the ground another one is just at the neighbor's lawn and then one is where it's supposed to be and he's like this is how they left my trash again today and it makes and it made the neighbors really angry apparently people he had heard like people complain about this and so the the group I guess it's uh is it called Wy Texas page Wy Texas yeah it says like what whatever his neighborhood is like residence and then it's in in the little town that he's in and he explains this like in a really funny way he goes we've got my my NE my neighborhood is supposed to be one of these fancy neighborhood gated uh it's a gated community we've got 24-hour security hell we even have 48 48 hour security if you take into account all the car that live in my neighborhood and Report stuff like we're just full of security and yet our trash it's just so annoying that once a week the the company picks it up and our cans are left all over the place so he makes a Facebook post in the neighborhood group and he says Hey neighbors is anyone open to switching trash services to a better option my wife and I are mildly frustrated with cards and we've made jokes that we feel we are like unpaid employees every week we play a fun game of where's Waldo trying to find our trash cans which are either in the ditch or hidden in our neighbors yards whatever and then uh 150 people commented on that and so this guy uh Spencer Scott he calls himself he's like a Jehovah's Witness of B2B sales apparently before he started a software company he would go door too selling internet services or uh uh I think phone lines things like that so he's just like a like a door to door sales guy then he got into software and he's a pretty Scrappy guy and he goes hell I think I'm going to do this he finds out that the trash company is actually charging something like 50 bucks a month for 300 houses he does some math he goes this is kind of interesting and so he starts sending an email or uh so he makes a new Post in the Facebook group and listen to this he goes in order for this to work we need 200 houses to sign up and commit to switching vendors I and this is a great post by the way I know this is a huge ass and you're gonna you're going to be taking on a risk on a new startup but I can assure you we are going to be Lighty years better than cards and this is the good part if we aren't I'm sure they'll take us back I've got everything lined up including two advisers who have been in the industry for years what do you say you want to help us start start a trash company with me and so he creates this website where he just Googled like referral programs and I linked to the website where Tim Ferris he actually made a blog post where he talked about Harry's their their pre-launch uh strategy and so he made this account if you go to his website his website is uh uh is it lonar trash.com Great Name by the way it's hilarious this website and so if you refer a new customer you get a T-shirt If you refer 10 customers you get uh one free month of trash pickup and So within like 24 48 Hours he sets up a stripe uh uh a stripe account he collects $155,000 in sales and so with that $155,000 he says [ __ ] I'm in business he goes out and he buys 200 trash bins because that's I guess how many customers he got for month one and there's a picture of all these trash bins in his driveway then he goes on Facebook Marketplace searches like within 500 miles and he finds a trash like a trash garbage truck for sale for 40 Grand apparently AMX I didn't know they allow this but they give you a line of credit up to 60 or 80 grand for 7% interest he uses that and he buys this truck without ever seeing it so he calls the guy and he's like hey do a FaceTime with me whatever spends two grand gets this truck shipped to his house now he's in business and tomorrow is his first day in business and he's got two tomorrow he's got to get up at 4:00 a.m. it's one day a week it's one with I'm gonna go with them not tomorrow but over the next uh few weeks we're gonna I'm gonna get a video career I think we gotta go do this but this guy has started a uh trash can or trash business and so in so let me see I have his math here he was like I think a bad year is going to be about 150 Grand in Revenue I think a decent year will be 250 and I think a great year will be 3 50 and if it works well I'll expand to new regions and it's crazy fascinating that he's doing this and he's doing it mostly in public where he's like tweeting out all the stuff that he's doing and it's just so funny that this guy's doing this because he's like making a joke about it so for example he bought hoodies for himself and I guess the one employee he has and thises what's the T-shirt say it says says it says great days start with a good dump picture of his garbage truck and I had him like interview for uh to get information for this pot I asked him all these questions and I wrote him down and he's taking a very technical like techy analysis towards us he's like look at the search uh the SEO for the largest company Waste Management they have this many pages but the second uh highest in the country only has 650 pages I think I could rank there by doing X Y and Z and it's crazy fascinating and get this so one truck holds I got to remember this one truck holds 200 bins worth of trash and those 200 bins worth of trash cost $250 to dump so the costs are going to be the the truck the cans which eventually pay off pretty quickly and then labor so it's a pretty fascinating business and I cannot believe that he just went all in on this and he's making it happen I appreciate people who do this so much I love this story and I feel very invested in this I've invested in a lot of companies but I feel invested in this I need this to work lonar trash I feel like we should single-handedly pump this and to all listeners in the uh where is he Dallas he's uh 30 minutes outside of Dallas and he explicitly said he goes when you talk about this pod on the Pod I'm afraid that too many people are going to go to my website and there's a buy now button and I'm just going to have to like go through all the work of refunding them and telling them we can't service them so I have to remind people he is only servicing one region right he's like he says my neighborhood has um I think three 400 houses and then there's 400 houses in the S sister neighborhood he says the trash collecting company is currently charging $33 per month per bin so most houses have two bins so it's 66 bucks a month so let's just do the math here 66 bucks a month just his neighborhood that's 26k a month 316,000 a year double it for for both and that's like sort of 600 Grand of potential Revenue if he got everybody to switch of course not going to get everybody to switch but I do think he could do pretty well so here's should we brainstorm a few marketing tactics for him but it's actually could be potentially bigger than than we think so he goes he goes I he goes I talked he goes basically I went and T went on Facebook Marketplace and I found all these trash guys uh who were selling these trucks and I just played dumb with them I was like he's like I didn't even play dumb I am dumb I don't know anything about this and so he makes friends with all these guys on Facebook Marketplace who are selling trucks and he's like I fly up there and I meet one of them and he's like this guy is in Oklahoma you would think that he's just a country bumpkin his business did 9 million in Revenue 2 million in it he owns a plane that he flies around in and he starts talking to these guys and he learns that there's a small town mcken which is north of Dallas I guess it's a small City uh they it just went out to bid for them to get a new trash collector it was 50,000 houses and the contract is $20 million a year and that's a a relatively small region outside of Dallas so it potentially could be bigger and we know uh we talked about Wayne hinga a billionaire who started um AutoNation Blockbuster and waste management now he used to own the Florida Panthers and then we talked about Bradley Jak jaob who's a multi-billionaire who started also with trash businesses maybe it could be bigger than we think well Spencer if you're listening to this which I I'd be stunned if you didn't listen to this giant segment about your company me and Sam we haven't talked about this I don't know if Sam's cool with this but we're gonna buy your next truck for you sir we are gonna invest in your company and we will fund your next truck and that will be the MFM trash truck how many other podcasts do you know that will have their own trash dude I would 100 I would I would I would put up 20 grand to we're both in for 20 grand we'll buy the next 40K truck whenever he's ready to to expand this we'll come in at a low valuation here right give us a you know $500,000 valuation and uh we as this podcast will then single-handedly promote this neighborhood by neighborhood as you expand but I think you should do a couple things so here's a few free marketing ideas for him do you know can you design the the bins like could he paint the bins could he color the bins in a different way or or design them so that if you're using this trash company your bins will look different I don't see why not I mean like a bright pink one or something like the lift mustache back in the day remember when when you would go through San Francisco you'd see these cars driving with this fluffy mustache on it like what the heck is that and then somebody would have to tell you right it it was so weird you had to ask what is that and then as soon as somebody knew they were happy to tell you oh that's lift it's a ride sharing company you could actually just request a ride on your phone and then the driver will show up like that that's his car he puts the mustache on it that means he's attacking you and it's like whoa okay interesting and the lift I have a lift mustache right here I admired this marketing tactic so much I stole a mustache off a car and I have this thing so you'll have to have like um he could have like he could paint like cookies on on the bin and then the truck will look like Cookie Monster or something where it's like silly when it like goes intock the truck and the the bins need to become his marketing assets and so the bins should look like you've made a choice that you have decided to go with the local provider who's all about service that's has fun blah blah blah right so make the bins fun and interesting in some way great idea First Step um Second Step he should go around and basically fly after that other company puts bins out and uh you know let's say they're knocked over or in the wrong spot he should put a little thing that says we would never do this to you uh we're a new company started by a guy who lives here I was so frustrated and Del your little founder story put it as a Slip inside of every trash bin um because you're you're really just Marketing in this 400 house radius right so pretty easy next thing I don't know if you know this Sam kids love garbage trucks garbage trucks fire trucks they just love them so take the truck on tour like the Wiener mobile do you remember that the Oscar meire Wier mobile ex go to school exactly this is the Oscar Meer play Playbook and so in our town uh the fire department for Christmas they always like they'll bring the fire truck out they'll like play music off it they'll put a Santa on top do the same thing every holiday you're putting the your your truck's going to drive around it's going to be themed and it's GNA like you know create an occasion for the F like when when a garbage truck comes outside here I grab my kids and we run outside because they love to see it they love to see it pick up the trash whatever and so use do something that's going to get the kids to do it so for example uh go around let the kids ride in the truck or or drive the truck or something like that uh or let everybody get out their hose and wash the truck so you can like spray your hose at the truck while it's going by create something that's going to get kids excited to see it and families excited to see it so that they know who you are tell your story um so I think if he does this he could literally get like 80% of the neighborhood on board because the other trash company does no marketing whatsoever and it sounds like they're not doing a great job there's a little bit of an opening here to uh to go in and and sell a better service I think it's just fast fascinating I think that like obviously the margins are going to be way worse than software but you have a recurring element here um every I mean the the size of the market is every home in America uh and also like just what he's doing like you remember how we talked about pinks pinks was a window cleaning company Y and for some reason they just have cool hats and people have their hats they sent they sent me one I wear it it's awesome the like what he's doing with great days start with a good dump like that little silly stuff or like the fact that his website is kind of funny and how it has a a affiliate program this is brilliant I do think he's missing that branding though in the the there's no like uh like you know pinks is is got its its color it's got its name it's got whatever uh there's like the two guys in a truck kind of like moving company that's another good one where it's like you know two two dudes in a truck he needs something like that yeah but uh keep it mind I'm pretty sure he started this three weeks ago uh so he's like he's like look why does everything figured out yeah I decided this was my mission eight weeks ago I'm all in like just you know you can't stop me now also we'll crowdsource this dude if there's a design agency that listens to the Pod you need to do a free a pro bono free full branding you know where's Red antler red antler I need you to do take on this project for free in exchange for marketing collateral that you did this truck this uh this trash company uh this local trash company in Texas branding we need a design company to let's crowdsource all everything we need to make this happen and he said uh so I had him fill this out on 12:15 he goes I came up with this idea 60 days ago so what's that that's uh so uh in October 15th he came up with the idea uh and then he got customers that fast I I just can't believe this it's just so funny and he's got all these pictures of all these bins in front of his house of him and his wife cleaning the bins uh it's it's just this is Art also Tik Tock he needs to go on Tik Tok and tell the story I don't know if you've seen But like uh so somebody posted this Tik Tok the other day they go oh you're worried about um oh like you know you want to start posting on Tik Tok but you're worried what do I have to say or how do I look or whatever and the woman goes do you know what I watch on this app I watch I watch guys cut sand I watch women clean houses I watch and it's like I watch a massage therapist I don't even get the massage I watch other people get massages dude I watch chiropractors and fruit getting crushed yeah cracking necks and opening up avocados like what are you waiting for and I think that is a a uh you know Mark andreon did it's time to build as this rally cry there's like the equivalent one of like do you know what I watch I'll watch anything is the rally Cry of Tik Tok and I think he's got to tell the story of like this Dad this father of two who got so annoyed with his trash company that he's just decided like all right eff it I'm doing this he says that he goes his goal is uh 24 customers in less than 18 months which is around a thou a million dollars in ARR uh he said he's going to hit a thousand C customers in the first six months and his first day driving the truck he's he goes I screwed around with it a little bit to test it out uh but I really like am just getting going tomorrow for the first time and then listen to this listen to this guy's humor he goes I go are you looking to hire for certain positions he goes yeah in fact as I as I'm typing this I'm sitting at the bar at DAV Busters watching adults play the claw game anyone who wins I slipped in my biz card and give them an invite to make $20 an hour driving my trash trucks uh this guy he's great man he's great he's great he's he's full of humor this is awesome this is a really cool thing that he started as just like a stupid idea but it's got legs and I think that this is gonna be awesome this can make because I think Spencer also wants a bit of uh a bit of Fame a little bit of content Fame yeah yeah yeah not just that I think he you know from meeting him I think he has an urge that I have a very Primal urge inside which is like I just want to live like I just want to do something different with my life you know like I just want to do something different than the like path like okay I get it I could do the path but I really don't want to just do the path I think Spencer has this which is what leads somebody to do something like this and I my it sounds like he's already pretty all in but triple down go even further all in Rebrand yourself as trash Daddy tell your story to the world like do the unnecessary like you know every Sunday have a theme uh you know like remember how Goan used to do this with sprig he used to put a truffle in every box like you know every time you ordered you get a little chocolate truffle with it like just keep coming up with surprise and Delight ways to go do the absolute unnecessary because that's what people pay attention to the things yeah like leaving a toy trash truck in people's mailbox or something like that ex Sam brilliant I should be doing this frankly this is this is my type of get out of the way yeah yeah he's the ride Graves I'm the Travis kinic I need to take this thing over uh this needs to be my business his ass on no I think this is awesome so I what's his handle his just if you look up Spencer Scott I think his handle is AKA Spencer Scott um on Twitter this is going to be a really fun Journey for us to follow along and we're early in the we're early on this and we're going to help make this a thing this is Awesome by the way Spencer if you're listening holler at us I I know I talked to you about this before but now it's public record yeah that was awesome okay wow what a segment what a way to start off the new year that was that was amazing that's what this podcast is all about if this is your first time listening to this podcast that's what this podcast is all about yeah finding cool stuff all right I wanted to tell you another just like fun product real quick this is a quick one click this link to this thing birdie birdie. design is the name of it dude I can't tell if these things are popular like is this like a Yellow Cab where like I noticed one and they're everywhere or they have they always been everywhere we talked about this type of stuff a while ago uh it's everywhere now I've I've never seen one you've seen one of these in real life no well go ahead and explain what it is okay so I'll explain it into the cont into context of this one of the running jokes on the Pod is that a completely valid business model is just X beautifully done and if you're pitching somebody you really don't even have to say much more than that you're like what if it was just headphones just really well done and everyone else will not or a thermostat just a you can't argue with somebody who is just saying we're just not going to do it you know all the bad ways you could do this we're not going to do any of those just beautifully done and Nest is a thermostat that's just it's just beautifully done this is a air qu air quality monitor that is beautifully done so go to birdie. design and you'll see it it's this white circle with a small yellow bird like the Twitter old Twitter logo and when it's it's like uh when it's pointed up like a cuckoo clock that means the quality is good if the air quality in your house ever drops rather than you know beeping like an annoying smoke alarm or having tons of numbers and and strange colors and you're like oh God you get stressed out the bird just changes positions just to tell that hey the air quality is not great right now and then you look in your app and it'll tell you all about it so this thing is awesome I think it's big in Europe it's not actually they're like just now like actually I don't know if this is true but they're expanding to the to the States now I think it's bigger in Europe I think this is a fantastic idea beautiful website the tury is DKK what's DKK um some type of Monopoly money I don't know yeah Danish Crone ah the croner yes how can I forget so yeah this thing cost 2,000 DKK an unknown amount of dollars um $300 $300 that's 300 it's beautiful it's a piece of art it's wonderful so we talked about this with Steph Smith Steph Smith said that these air quality control like monitors they're gonna she she said they're going to explode she and then she went on and said uh uh she goes I predict that the subreddit called air quality is going to be the next big thing it only has 4,000 Subs but it's been doubling every 6 months and I think that um with wildfires and all this other stuff that air quality control is going to become a huge thing and I keep seeing people tweet this constantly they have these little digital meters and I don't know what the measurement is but they say CO2 is this number and it looks like a little digital clock and they're everywhere man people are traveling with them I'm seeing this everywhere now that she told us about this yes exactly so she was saying like you know she's like I noticed that sleep r/ sleep quality went through this crazy Trend over the last you know four years where sleep became like you know the Vogue kind of Health Trend and um she's like I think air quality is going to be next look at the growth of the of the air quality subreddit the products on Amazon that are there and it's kind of like an immature space and I think this is a wonderful beautiful product design for a product that's that's in that space yeah I mean I'm looking at the Amazon ratings right now I mean some of these products have tens of thousands of reviews um this is going to be a thing man this is going to be like the next version of ring I think uh these air quality controls but the thing about it is I don't know if this is pseudo science like like I don't know the truth of is are you willing to bet your life on it that's that's the beauty of these products right that's the beauty is it's like a dog vitamin it's like I don't [ __ ] know if this works like but like I'll buy that insurance like right but don't you love your dog yeah how do I get Co2 out of my house I could tell you I don't breathe less I I don't know remove the car from the living room I don't know how to do it it's coming from me I think like yeah I don't I don't know how to do it but when I see it I'm like that sounds important it's like the word leaky gut or a juice cleanse like well if you use those words I guess I have to do it right I don't know if I have leaky gut but as sure as hell am willing to like take any product I will stop it you know just in case um all right I've got one more quick thing yeah you go I need some device so I own a Facebook group you know one of my hobbies is I have Facebook groups I'm one of the only people that that actually do that I actually have three or four I've got a couple that are in the 60 and 70,000 range but I have one that when Trend shut down I just posted in there and I said um I don't know what I'm going to do with this but here's a Facebook group I call it uh I actually am not going to say the name of it because I don't want to get flooded with new people joining and I just said uh this Facebook group is going to close down I just made a new one you guys can all hang out in there it's got 3,000 members most of them are people who have small businesses doing hundreds of thousands of dollars it's mostly like those types that that size of business I have no intention to monetize it but I wouldn't be lying if in the back of my head I'm just thinking this could be something I'm missing out here the group has a lot of um traction people post every single day are you a member of it uh I think what did you call it uh let's let's give it a you wantan to give it a plug or you don't want to give it a plug it's called yeah terrible name I think it's a hilarious name and it's in the tagline is shipping products with the Bold fast fund energy it's a community of people who build and talk business that are bold Fast Fun the artists formerly known as Trends we're a pirate ship of people who care about talking nerdy business stuff showing out projects asking questions and commiserating with their fellow Pirates and mostly because Trends kicked us out and we're a bunch of degens we need a place to go to uh and so I created this group it's got 3,000 members dozens of posts per day if I wanted to monetize this which I I actually am not sure I will because I don't want to work on it what would you do the real answer is kind of a boring answer I would absolutely not bother monetizing this I'm not going to there's a 1% chance tell some reason why you have a incredible business that you already you know own and can focus on any ounce and of Mind share and time share that you spend on not that business on some really secondary business is dumb and wasted I agree I agree that's the first thing but but we are a podcast where we talk about stuff right right right yeah so for for the sake of argument I'll tell you what you could do so I do think you probably should have called it something like the artist fil really known as Trends I think that's like a better uh better name I think you could simply reboot Trends that's the first simple obvious idea right so uh let's not let's not you know over complicate things people liked Trends these are people that already were in Trends and paying customers of Trends transend is now free slash like you know different let's just say so there's an opportunity to do this I actually think this is true about many businesses there is this window like I don't know three years after a company's been acquired where you can literally just start the same company again this uh this is so common I see this all the time people can literally build the same company and the guy we sold the milk road to he did the same thing he built a company sold it for 45 and then he built the same company sold it again to 4 for another $45 million to the same company and then finally they were like hey um non-compete this time like you can't do this again to us and um people really really underestimate how much you could do this especially a few years after a company's been AC a product's been acquired because by that time the team has changed the products been folded in you know like a whole bunch of stuff has gone a so I think that's the easiest thing you could do I believe they shut down Trends because I think it had 500,000 people on the list on the email list and HubSpot was like dude like Trends charges $300 a year it probably makes I don't know what it made but let's say five or six million a year um and we have 400,000 people saying they're interested but haven't bought it yet we can make way more money just making it free and a portion of them will buy our software and so but like many entrepreneurs would be like yeah but five million or $6 million a year with two people running it that's pretty dope I would like that as well the next thing uh is I think you could use it for growing Hampton so uh the way that y commentator uses Hacker News so Paul Graham basically creates Hacker News Hacker News becomes the most popular Forum or message board for developers and um you know he could have been like guys we got to do a job board and then we gotta like you know do sponsored post then we got to make a paid tier that paid tier is going to have certain permissions he's like no no no I already have one of the best business models in the world where YC can basically invest in young hackers for like you know at that time they were giving you like $188,000 for 6% of your company or something like that um all he needed to do was just keep the thing free and keep it awesome so that it became just like a um an asset a marketing asset out there for YC that existed for YC and I think that that was the right move and that's what I would if I was you for Hampton you've given me ideas so look here's how I think about some of these small projects I think I don't want to spend a second doing it but what I love about little projects like this is there's people in my family there's people who I'm friends with I'm like I don't want to spend a second doing this but I will give this to you as long as you keep it awesome and it makes a little bit of money for yourself you could just pay yourself with all that money I don't care but as long as this thing lives and it's great I don't need to make a scent from it I think what I can do is make this um a thing where the community stays amazing and once or twice a month I can have a sponsor that pays a small enough salary for the person running it to make uh to make a living while keeping the community great that's a great idea I'm glad I brought this up I should do this I love how you were like you gave me a great idea but the thing you said was completely different than what I said that's how that's how this works that's how this thing works that's a little yes and there for you to all my thespians out there Sam just yes anded with a huge leap didn't you say sponsored yeah yeah I said the word sponsored oh you talking about job post on Hacker News that's why I one to the other saying what pul gram didn't do and then you go that's what I you stopped listening and then you said sponsorships that's a great idea for the record I'm not going to I'm not going to spend any more than 10 minutes a month on this thing I'm not actually going to do anything but it is fun this is the point of the podcast is to think about this stuff we'll see what happens but I'm not personally going to spend a second with this but you know what I mean all these young Bloods that we have in our crew who I would love to work with in some capacity and I don't have an option to work with them or something I'm just thinking about it uh I'm just I'm gonna start doing yes say like to my wife that says like hey let's go do this yeah let's do that and we're going to do it differently than what you said we're going to do what I said instead yes sand is my new thing yeah that's a great idea and also at that time we're GNA do this other thing like what do you got to eat for dinner and I'm like well I had Tai for lunch so not that you're like Ty that's a great idea I'm so glad you said Ty that is so [ __ ] funny I'm going to yet sand the [ __ ] out of people from now on um well the beautiful thing about yes anding people is uh instead of they can't like argue with you because you're like oh are you trying to be a buzz kill and not yes and here are you trying to like stop our flow they're like oh I guess I got to go with this it's not going the direction I want but guess uh last thing you have Camp MFM coming up on Wednesday I had to bow out because I'm committed to this whole this whole being a parent thing you know whatever that thing is the whole this whole you know being a person dad and all that nonsense I'm committed to it I saw the flyer you made for it and I I did not have any fomo until I saw that the Airbnb founder is going in particular the Airbnb founder who interviewed me for my job at Airbnb and then fired me four days later one day before I was supposed to start he's going and I would have loved to have gone to see that guy he uh by the way he fired me for just cause he was right I was wrong why um how did you get him Ben Ben is the easy answer so we we went into Camp MFM this year with a a fresh mindset new year new US Camp MFM is basically Sean and Ben you went and found last year or we did two years ago 15 people including Mr Beast maybe 20 people you last year we went to a kind of a crummy house that was just huge and you somehow got us all Nikes and then we went like basketball shoes and then we went and like played B verion of the story sucks here's what happened last year let me just yes angre real quick so so yes but completely different last year um Ben was like why don't you host an event why don't you host like a conference or something like that there's so many people that you know are in the kind of podcast audience Twitter audience that would love to come I said yes but a couple of problems a I don't really like big groups of people like I really have a bad time when I go to events with like a lot of people in them it's just socially not something I enjoy second conferences are kind of boring and if I don't want to like if I when I hear oh you're invited to come to a conference either you're gonna watch people talk or you're G to get to talk on stage it's not uh again I have that Spencer Scott urge to just do something different with my life so I said why don't we do something different I said what would I what would be the instead of just saying no let me instead ask what would be the event that I would love to go to I'd be looking forward to and I was like oh what I would want is just kind of like a summer camp for adults um where it's kind of like a summer camp like I used to go in the Summers to play at a basketball camp so I love basketball I would just go to something that's super fun we're gonna play and then we hang out and we talk yeah we do that after but like the main thing is we're gonna play and we're gonna compete and we're gonna have a lot of fun um and that all the guests you know it's a small number of guests but that all of them are like the 20 Most Fascinating People I know which we tried it last year it was amazing um Mr Beast I tweeted out the thing I said here's my my dream for an event and I had three bullet points and I put out a Google form and in that Google form there was like 200 people replied of which 199 we did not invite to the event but one of them was Mr Beast and I didn't know he followed us I thought it was a prank when I was like oh yeah sure your Twitter handles Mr Beast yeah sure whatever and then his email was like a real name but it was kind of like a like a Yahoo or something like that I was like ah this got to be fake then I get a d so I don't even reply the next day he DMS me says so are we doing this or what and I like you know spit out my drink and I was like oh [ __ ] oh okay yeah yeah we're doing this uh where do you live oh North Carolina funny coincidence we're doing it there and so I was like I'm GNA make this easy for him and we just so happen to be doing it in Greenville North Carolina yeah exactly and so we we went you were there it was a great time there's 27 people and we we invited this uh guy who trains a bunch of NBA stars like Kyrie Irving and Trey young and these guy he TR used to train Kobe and he came down he basically was like kind of the our our coach and it was a bunch of out of shape you know business people plus a couple of entertainers so like you know um people from the the entertainment world that that joined as well anyways it was a good time so this year we wanted to do it again but we made you know came up with some differences so I was like even less people last year we had 27 people this year we cut it down to I think 177 um which was we really only tried to have 15 but we ended up at 17 we we said well we don't want to do it with the same exact group every single year because again the point of this is we're trying to rotate kind of like you know just people we want to use it as an excuse to meet people we want to meet and by the way you forgot we all lived or it was only two nights but we all stayed in the same air it was just a huge house it was like a family's house that had all their like like I I shared a I shared a I shared a bunk bed with Ramon in the Sun and uh and then they had like a lake that we were swimming in it was awesome it was a crappy like inside house but that's actually made it amazing it made it really fun well it was the best house in Raleigh North Carolina but that says more about Raleigh North Carolina than it is the house so so it was uh but so this year we were like all right we're doing it again and um we came up with kind of a dream guest list now why did I say that Ben was the way that we got uh the co Airbnb guy to come because Ben somehow just like he is the Twitter API like he just consumes so much content that he know I was like you know it's like a AI search I was like who is a super interesting business person who also loves to play basketball he's like oh I think the Airbnb guy plays basketball every weekend and I was like how could you possibly know that well and he owns the San Antonio Spurs own San Antonio Spurs and I was like oh wow so uh we reach out to Joe uh Joe's ass he finds me his email I cold email him and I say hey you don't know me from from you don't you don't know my name's Sean but you don't know me from John you know here's the here's this event that we're doing I think you would really like it um yeah we'd love to have you and he calls me and he's like basically calls me ask me some questions but I could tell it's just like are you in are you like an insane person like do I want to be around you for two days or not and um and so he's coming there's a the guest list is kind of amazing so I'm gon to do a recap of it afterwards but what a what a thing to manifest uh like you know Jess ma came on the podcast she said this thing she I was like so you you run a a venture Studio an idea lab like what do you call it she's like oh no I don't call it anything she's like I have a team of people that are like my little manifestation company like if I want to make something happen they just help me make it happen make it come make it go from idea to a thing and uh now that's how I think about what me and Ben do it's not like a holding Co it's like a manifestation Co it's what is the life we want to have and then we just sort of make it so and this is one thing that you know I would want to have as my kind of like annual annual thing that I do yeah I gotta tell you so this I'm flying out tomorrow right so I'm like all right I got to get my my haircut and my beard Tri I gotta get I gotta get fresh by the way your haircut looks quite good you should do that more often you'll notice my hair might look good but my beard looks untouched why is that what happened let me tell you a little story so this is a little I I didn't think that well I think that and so I uh I go to this Barber Shop normally I have this guy who comes to my house cuts my hair and it's like a routine so I don't need to think about it but he couldn't come so I was like all right I'm g go to this place I go and uh this I'm like great yeah I got this big event just need a you know little standard F booy haircut trim the beard a little bit and uh we're good right he's like I don't do beards and I was like pretty sure I booked that what do you mean um he's like I was like this is a barber shop right like what else do you do if not hair and beards he's like he's like I just don't want to mess it up I was like well I also don't want you to mess it up but I needed all right whatever weird but okay and then he's like okay what do you want for your haircut I show him a picture and he starts doing it and um super nice guy but I noticed that his hand is like really trembling while he's cutting my hair and I'm like okay this is interesting um I feel bad for him but you know Sam I also feel bad for me because you don't want to get your haircut by somebody whose hand is trembling with clippers so I'm like okay this is now a high-risk situation I'm about to go to my biggest event of the year I hired this vlogger to follow me around not try to have an effed up haircut but I put I put my faith in this guy we did it the haircut turned out okay I was like you know what beard forget I ever said it not doing it um and he's like he at the end he goes thank you so much you were You' have been so kind to me and I go I didn't do anything what do you mean I just sat here got my haircut he's like I was so nervous I have never done that haircut and I was like hey man what the hell what why are you telling me this afterwards you got the most basic haircut that every guy ever has like this is the standard guy haircut what do you mean this is a barber shop you work here right like did I just ask a customer to cut my hair most bizarre experience he's like I was so nervous he's like I've done one of these before and I totally screwed it up Bianca she's amazing he points at he points to this woman Bianca goes she had to fix it for me she's so good with the Clippers I'm like then why did Bianca cut my hair what's happening right now you should if he wants you should tell him you should start a trash company fit right in dude not racist experience am I right I was laughing so hard I was like what just happened to me this is like a comedy skit it's GNA be Wednesday to Friday I'm this is the I just got fomo for the first time last night when I saw uh that Joe was gonna be there I'm I'm bummed I can't go hopefully you you uh do

can I just read you the menu of shady Gators would you guys be interested in that yeah be very interested tell me all the variations of tater tots you mean Gator bites or ultimate tater tots or loaded loaded tots um for [Music] me all right we're live uh we have got Sam Ratner by the way Sean I I don't know Sam that well I think you think that I know him well yeah because I don't know him so I'm like how' this guy get here he's uh he's here because Ari talked to her talk to him on the phone we do these pre- calls and same I got to say like out of uh I don't know every 10 pre- calls we do with people that we don't know eight out of 10 are are kind of like a hey probably not a good fit for the Pod she talked to you and she was like you gotta have this guy on so I don't even know what you did but you did something and you have some kind of story or energy or ideas that that she liked yeah basically what what I know about you is by the way you're like shockingly young how old are you 27 26 yeah I just turned 27 and what I know about you is you had this company that was a sports betting site you sold it for around $40 million to fubo TV like I think before it even launched but you've also done all these other strange things like I think you bought did you buy a riverbat casino or a river boat like You' bought a bunch like you're into a lot of really strange things and for such a young person you've done like a lot of odd I mean just the fact that you've done a start that you sold for a lot of money that's already impressive but even amongst the impressive people you've done a a lot of like strange and unique things right all right so let's start with that you were you drop out of college and you start a company that you end up selling for can you say how much you sold for yeah it was 40 million okay so you drop out of college you build a company you sell it for 40 million at that time you must have been pretty young how old were you when you sold 23 okay great so 18 to 23 is uh what was what was the idea and how did you make that happen uh so I had gone I was actually at the University of Missouri for a year nice missou so I was I was at mizou uh enjoyed my time there was not for me though uh always wanted to kind of start a company uh when I dropped out I didn't really have the exact plan yet uh but I did always play a lot of online poker I was very active I was the kid with 12 monitors uh playing online poker in the dorm rooms so I kind of knew the community a lot um and you know started hearing whispers of them legalizing you know gaming National here in the United States you know lifting the federal ban if you would and I thought the market would evolve shouldn't evolve much differently than it does overseas where it's very part of the culture you can bet when you're 18 sometimes 16 you're betting you know at the Arsenal game inside the stadium but here there was like a stigma to it you know if grandma says she buys a lottery ticket you know uh you're like you don't think anything but if she says she took the bear spread you're like ah Grandma what the hell are you doing so um I thought if that would be the case I just sat down and essentially just rote out for hours how I thought the market would evolve and my conclusion was that um there will be early players you'll have DraftKings and FanDuel they have you know audiences and fantasy but that it really would end up being dominated by either the brick and mortar Casino companies or the media companies which is now just playing out with ESPN and stuff in to dat all the technology had been built overseas because it's been around for 50 years but it was like built in the early 2000s where you had like these desktop applications to place a bet and then to get to Mobile they just like compressed it into a mobile experience they didn't like rebuild it they didn't rebuild it native iOS it didn't have any good API functionality to have ticketing and Merchandising and these other things so I said what if we just what if I just rebuilt all that and then called these big companies and said hey uh don't white label this garbage from Sweden um you know and pay some huge rev share what if we just do a deal can you can you pause that for a second yeah so you're you're describing what sounds like pretty sophisticated process you're like I heard you know that there's this inflection that there maybe it was going to get legalized so I started thinking ahead of that and then instead of just jumping right in with my two Dumb Friends and starting to build a product I thought I wrote down how I thought the market would evolve and then I realized that my good go to market would be to kind of undercut these rev share competitors with a mobile first product on the platform dude you're like 18 19 years old at this time you know I couldn't figure out how my night was going to evolve let alone how how a market was going to evolve like was this your first rodeo and why why were you so good at it at that time so in high school I ran a snow removal business um which natural pivot natural pivot uh and so I had been you could call it in business in a very rudimentary way we were plowing driveways um but we had hundreds of houses I kind of knew how to build a business and what I realized although I learned a ton I'm like 15 I'm learning what insurance is because some woman slipped on salt I'm learning how to you know Finance you know trucks to get plows like so I kind of had this business sense and by the way when you're talking about plowing you're not talking about shoveling you just said financing trucks yeah like the plows you put on the front of trucks got it okay yeah so you were sophisticated you're going door too to get these customers for yourn business how it was me and uh uh a good friend of mine Ilia who's now David Do's right-hand guy Ilia federovich we went to high school together I went to Vernon Hills which is where they went so illy and I built the snow removal business and we'd be like at used car lots negotiating for essentially but what I learned from how much were you making back then 15 16 years old I think we did like 50 60 grand for the winner or something like that so and I couldn't drive that was a big problem ILO only had his permit I didn't have a license so we couldn't really get anywhere there was no Uber or at least we didn't have debit cards so like we'd like walk to like mundeline which is like the neighboring town to like go look at the plows it was complicated but what I learned from that is you could scale that business um and actually do really well from a cash flow perspective because cander most people don't want to be in that business or they're like 60 years old and they've been just driving the same truck for the same couple commercial Lots but what I learned is there's no value it can't it can't scale that well that large and I was just always interested in like how big can I make something and I had that itch to do that so then I thought well if it's easy there can't be any value in it if anyone could just get into it well then there's inherently zero value longterm like big if you want to build billion dollar business so when I thought gambling could be big it would have been very easy to be like oh we're going to have a fantasy site that is slightly different and you can pay to play and it also includes Nascar or something and like all those things just to me it's like eh how does that get to 500 million in Revenue I don't see it I'm not interested so I knew I had to really sit down and think how will the market evolve and then I literally just looked at what are the P of this pieces of this Evolution that because it's such a headache or Capital intensive no one will ever want to touch and then because of that it should actually end up being slightly less Capital intensive because no one wants to do it and then you have value it was my thought essentially our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better and when you dropped out was that a easy decision for you to go do this gambling company was it hard and basically how did you live cuz I always wonder this when people drop out of college you're kind of college is a very it's a bubble that's like yeah here's your bed here's the bathroom here's the library you know these are this is your place and then when you drop out you're like out of the system you're neither at home nor are you in school so what was uh it was definitely uh uh my parents were not thrilled as you can imagine um uh and when you go home it's it's like when you grow up uh you're my son I love you and then when you turn 18 you're like that guy in the house you're like you're like what are you still doing here uh so uh I I went home and lived with my mom um although I essentially I went to Starbucks every morning and worked until from whenever they open 5 or 6 a.m. until they closed at 7 and then I'd go to Lifetime Fitness and there were no yoga classes after 8 so I would work in the yoga studio upstairs at Lifetime and they had free coffee free all that stuff so I kind of had like an office and it kind of got to the point where I started leaving my stuff as like a setup in the corner and I think a lot of I think the instructors thought like oh that's someone else's class and it was just like my laptop and monitor and computer so I worked out a lifetime for like three like a year uh and it was cheap because uh you know lifetime whatever I was under the 28 age so I'm playing like the reduced thing um and I would just kind of work all day so I lived at my mom how did you fund how did you fund the company at that stage uh come on Sean credit cards baby uh I essentially what happened to that snowplow money oh yeah uh we had some cash from that but uh essentially like I knew I needed I knew you literally you kind of have two options if you don't have tons and tons of cash saved you essentially you can work a part-time job um uh I was unwilling to do anything but spend every waking moment on the business so I didn't want to do that and so I kind of just went open to credit cards and I've always been a zero backup plan guy I perfect I purposely failed every final before dropping out so going back was not an option because I'd be going back at like 23 years old as a freshman so I'm always a put it all on the line and you will figure it out kind of guy and uh purposely failed de finals yeah that's that's what I that's what I say too so so I came home when I dropped out I came home you know when like you come home a little early and it's like you're surprising your parents and you're like oh like did you finish early I came home early enough where it was kind of too early for them to believe that I had finished finals so what that essentially meant is I didn't show up to the finals and I got zeros on all the finals so going back was now out of the question which removed the debate with my parents because they kind of said well he can't really go back you ended up selling did you sell the company I was looking at the the site on web archive did you sold the company before it even launched right yeah like 18 months is that right yeah yeah about all right so who who contacted you how did they even know that you were up for up for grab so what we had was essentially every component to a gambling platform that you could want so we were an authorized gaming operator of the NBA Major League Baseball I just willed my way into convincing the leagues to do a deal with me um candidly I think they thought I was like kind of crazy and kind of cool and they're not used to cool and crazy they're used to like Disney so they were like okay we'll do the deal with you so it was like well explain that I would think if if a 19-year-old's like yeah I'm going to go become an authorized gaming uh you know operator for the NBA I'd be like yeah it's not really going to happen man so what's what's your other plan so uh how did you do that yeah they would like offer you an internship instead yeah uh uh we had a couple things we at that time we did raise a little bit of capital and it was from some Venture funds in sports media and entertainment that the leagues knew very well so they were like okay uh this kid called us 6 months ago he sounds kind of crazy but now it seems like there's this article out um the people that invested in them um 76 Capital also invested in a bunch of other companies we have deals with so there's some significance there um we also they were very familiar with our lawyers because our lawyers represent ESPN and a lot of other people so you kind of just have to put the pieces in place that kind of give them some gut feel to they're not he's not just crazy he's crazy and he has some people that we know and so at the time it was like DraftKings FanDuel MGM bar stool and then like us and and the league was also like a little careful like can we like uh we'll do this with you just don't tell anyone right now and we don't really want to put out an article but we kind of want to do the deal we think the platform's cool so we kind of had all these assets we were an authorized gaming operator of those leagues we had Market access which I can get into which is the licenses we were through compliance in mostly all legal states now back then it was 17 States or so um now it's 35 Plus I think um and at the time if you wanted to be in the gaming business uh you have to go through regular compliance most public Boards of directors have no interest in going through a regulatory process they have to disclose their financials and all these things so uh and they also didn't know the business enough um you know you can be a big public company but if you want to have a book in Jersey you have to go down to Atlantic City and sit in an old room with regulators and lawyers and convince them as to why they should give you the license um and so it was just like this old school process uh that they were unwilling to go through and we kind of spent the money and went through the pain of building the platform getting it through compliance getting the license licenses getting the deals and we knew that what we really wanted was an existing audience in sports even if we went and raised $100 million I think DraftKings at the time spent $100 million on corporate travel a year so $100 million wasn't going to move the needle for us to go to market without any users so we started talking about a joint venture with a handful of companies uh and at the time fubo TV had just gone public they put out a proxy they wanted to be in the gaming business and my phone rang um and it was fubo TV and they wanted to talk about a deal so um which and so they they they bought you for I think I I read the SEC filing like just about close to 40 million what uh what' you do with the money uh I have it what do you mean well I mean that's a that's that's a lot of money for anyone to get particularly for 23 24 year old uh what you invested in um I'm mostly in the market and then I have these small random crazy Investments that I feel really good about um but I'm mostly in the market I'm pretty long here's why I'm long the market if I want to do other things with the money I'll simply take a loan against my portfolio and then take the risk if you sell the stock now you have a taxable event you get less than like if you wanted to put a million bucks into something you can either sell a million dollars and have some huge taxable event and a headache to deal with with paperwork uh and then you invest and then if it goes to zero you're screwed or you take a line of credit against your portfolio say in the index fund like the Spy um and if I need a million I'll take a line of credit they keep a million two is collateral and then I get to take my million dollar shot anyways and if it doesn't work out uh all I got to do is wait and in eight years I'll have the money back because the stock would have doubled anyways um you know given what the interest rates are pretty low when you take a loan against like that so I have most all my money for the most part in the market so yeah I was down like during Co like millions and millions and millions of dollars but like if you're never selling then it just doesn't really matter and if you don't need it like I kept what I needed in cash like whatever but other than that I'm pretty in the market but that's where your story gets kind of kind of interesting so like all right selling for that amount of money at the age of 23 pre-launch that's that's you know 1% the 1% that's pretty wild but I read that you know when Ari talked to you and and I read in our notes I read that you bought this riverbat what the hell is that and that's one of your crazy Investments and you also were looking at vending machine businesses this is wild to me that you would do this okay so uh when you're in the online gaming business everyone who's in it for the most part is like the old Trump gaming people All The Regulators are the same one time we got a document and they had Still They sent us the wrong copy because my partner Scott bera's name was when he was president of trump so they sent us a trump entertainment Resorts form like The Regulators never change so while the business is techy you could call it the industry is not so everyone you meet is like has been in this casino business for 50 years and I stumbled into this Riverboat because um to get a license uh unlike a cannabis license where you can just apply as a dispensary you have to get what's called Market access and the you are subleasing the licenses from the ones that have them and the only people that have them are the brick and mortar properties it's kind of like if you it's weird if you wanted a grocery store imagine if you had the suas from Whole Foods like a license that they have the entry the reason that's the case is because uh you know we took land from Native Americans we allowed them to have casinos on reservation property uh then all of a sudden 2018 the government goes we'll just legalize online gambling well then they were like well no one's going to come to our properties anymore CU they can just log on DraftKings and you just screwed us so you should give us the license and then we'll sublease it to them so they did that and then MGM and Cesar and everyone went crazy because they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa we're the biggest tax revenue drivers in the country besides oil so if the if the tribes are getting them then we get them fast forward everyone got them riverboats counted as properties brick and mortar properties and before landbased gaming in the early 90s everything was on the water because it was illegal and it started in the early 40s and 50s because all the trade happened up and down the Mississippi candidly mostly through St Louis and people would just like truckers pull over on the highway people would pull over their vessels and they'd have makeshift card games on a barge and then all sudden it trans I don't think that like a guy like Sean doesn't know this but I grew up at St Louis and so when you say you're going to the casino we actually wouldn't use the word Casino so we would say let's go to the boat to the boat and all the all they're not some of them actually are like boats but a lot of them are just like property that are floating but they're not I guess technically they're floating but they're like not really a boat it's like the boat is this like massive parking lot and then they built like a building on top of it but when I was younger we would say we're g let's go to the boat it's essentially a structure built on a barge is really what it is but there's no engine room it's just floating there it's like building a house and then shoving it out into the water and tying it and you meet the state standards yeah so I was talking with a buddy after I leave fubo uh and he was showing me this picture of his grandfather in Atlantic City and in the background are these Riverbats and um he said you know what happens to these things when they're done with them and I was like what do you mean he goes well like where do they go and I was like I don't know like I have no idea and so I hang up with him I'm like where do they go it's kind of interesting uh I'm unemployed I don't have much to do so uh I emailed the general Council of a casino company that we had done a license deal with at fubo to get the license in Iowa uh uh and uh uh they were a Riverboat property and I went to it a couple times we had to go set stuff up um and I called The General Counsel I said hey Bill I have a question for you your boat's really old uh I heard you guys were thinking about building a property on the land what are you going to do with this cruise ship you have sitting in front of the property when you're done with it and he goes well you know when you couldn't build brick and mortar properties uh there was a market for them you know they'd sell because they were just operating casinos like any other property but he goes now no one wants them so they kind of just end up in junkyards and I was like you're got to be kidding me he's like no these things are unbelievable I go you scrap them and he goes probably who would ever buy them and um he just bought uh they had just bought two casinos in Baton Rouge that were both on vessels uh but operating still um which they do in like places like baton r or Kansas City and stuff and I said are there any near us because I'm in Chicago he's in Iowa I go are there any near us and he goes s if there were any boats near us I wouldn't have bought them in Baton Rouge Louisiana and then like almost like a movie I'm hanging up the phone and I hear like hey Sam Sam Sam Sam and I'm like Bill what's up and he said we don't know where it is uh but we think somebody somewhere in Iowa has uh the catfish and he was talking about Catfish Bend riverboat casino and uh I said what do you mean someone has he goes well they built a property like 20 years ago and no one knows where the boat went I'm unemployed I'm kind of like into this kind of stuff I have nothing to do and I was like okay I have somewhere to be at like noon it's like 10 o' I'm going to give myself an hour and a half or two and try and find this boat just for the pure fun and if not I'll never think about this again and we'll call it a day and so first I called every junkyard in the tri-state area in Chicago and Iowa I'd call uh there was this place I remember in like de Mo or somewhere and I and this guy answered I'll never forget this and uh I said hey quick question who's the oldest guy at the junkyard who's been there the longest and they were like on speaker and they're all yelling like oh it's Ricky everyone grab Ricky go get Ricky go get and this Ricky guy gets on the phone and this was like I've been on the phone for an hour with junkyards and Rick's like catfish he goes he goes I would never forget if catfish Ben came through this junkyard we've never seen it so I'm like all right Ricky so I hang up I talk to 12 Ricky this boat has not gone to a junkyard it is not in a j and I thought to myself if they brought it down somewhere out of Illinois or Iowa and it got junked in Missouri so be it I can't call every junkyard in America but we're going to move forward assuming it's still still a thing so uh I found uh I remember one time I got a ticket on my uncle's boats and wave Runners uh in chaino lakes and if you don't pay it it ends up on the fishing and gaming or like the the fishing and hunting ticketing site so I was like all right uh whoever is Goofy enough to buy this thing or have it definitely got like a moving violation or something I mean this thing is a cruise ship it's not like a Corolla so I said let's assume they have a ticket and they haven't paid it so I went to the site and I sat there for an hour and I just clicked through hundreds of pages of tickets but you don't even see the pictures of anything it's just the entity name or the person's name and so I'm looking for like a random entity like some kind of sign and on like 194 page 190 something I see like cffb whatever it is LLC it's like an acronym and I kind of go past it and then like I thought to myself I was like Catfish Bend Riverboat cin I go that kind of fits and I clicked it boom big vessel moving violation $222,000 ticket um from the company that bought it at auction and then I read the court filing and essentially catfish Ben built a brick and mortar property left the boat to rot kind of like icon left the casino in Atlantic City to rot knowing that the city would pay for it to get cleaned up so he didn't have to pay for it they then said all right you have to move it we'll pay for the fees but you have to auction it off and um so he auctioned it off in an anonymous auction to uh a marina construction company in Northern Iowa who uh does a lot of work with the Army Corps of Engineers fixing submarines so I thought to myself o he probably want it for the engine rooms and stuff um but all I had was like an entity name and it was like random and I called a buddy in Iowa and I said hey what do you know about this um XYZ Enterprises or whatever and he said what are you buying a boat and now I've been on the phone for two hours trying to find this thing I got like phone in the ear I'm like notes from Ricky at the junkyard and I was I dropped everything I like whoa how did you know I was talking about a boat and he said that company he goes they fix everyone's yachts and I was like no way so I called like their websites from the 9s the phone number is floating like at the bottom of the website and I just and I just called and I said uh hey is uh I did what I did with the I go who's the oldest person at this company and they put this like 90y old man on and I said I've got a crazy question for you and I swear to God he cut me off and he said tell me you're looking for the catfish baby and I said do you have it and he was like yeah he goes I have it I've been looking at it every day for 20 years I said wow I said no one knows you have this like why like no one knows where it is and he goes yeah like you know we're quiet like whatever and he said why are you calling me what do you want to buy it and I think my wife heard in the other room and she looked at me like you are not buying this thing and I kind of smiled I'm like uh I don't know maybe and he's like well why don't you come see it and I'm like okay so long story short I drew drove you know to Northern Iowa and uh it was sitting there in a quarry um he had planned to Ed it for parts became too cost intense to get the engines out of the engine room and uh I persuaded myself to buy it uh so but what's the game plan here well okay so here's the plan um it's first of all it's 40 it's three interior stories all connected by elevators the thing is a full-blown Casino vessel um it's 40,000 square feet of some of the most unique real estate ever when you walk in you think you just walked into Las Vegas with Elvis Presley the walls the floors when I bought it all the blackjack tables all the craps tables so first I was like could be a movie Set uh could I in I I know the gaming business maybe I could open up a casino um or maybe I'll turn it into a restaurant or nightclub or something like that so I had some loose ideas but nothing like in place uh so I bought the thing um uh had to deal with the Coast Guard all this stuff and spent about a year going down the path to open up a casino long story short there's not many riverb licenses left in America so um you know I was meeting with the chairman of one of the largest gaming companies in Goa India uh he controls uh Goa which is like Atlantic City on Western India side they have a bunch of vessel casinos um long story short became too cost intensive to get it there um but he introduced me to a deal in the uh in Southeast Asia um where we had the deal on the one yard line long story short uh some of these countries in Southeast Asia are pretty um corrupt and they made a big ask and my lawyer said that ask is not happening we're not talking about this anymore um so now I'm kind of more pivoting back to um you know partnering with someone to open up a really cool restaurant or entertainment venue and move it down south somewhere like Florida or you know Nashville Cumberland River or something like that what did you end up paying for it uh I might want to tell you that off the Pod over or under seven figures can you say that under under okay um you this seems like a crazy thing to to be working on when you are able to build websites for free or with just your time um uh but you've done like you're you're kind of interesting in that you can root out these really off-the-wall ideas because you did another one with vending machines didn't you didn't end up doing it but yeah so I everyone was talking about vending machines all over Twitter vending machines are the next gold I'm like okay what's well we we had a guy who like we were joking about this last episode we had a guy who like was like dude I'm making 15 we talk about you know like big hundred million billion dollar ideas and then we had this guy he was like I'm making 10,000 a month on vending machines and for some reason that interests everyone because when you're 13 years old that's like vending machines is like one of the things that you're fascinated by and so yeah we I don't know if we helped to make it popular or we pounced on it because it was already popular but we saw that too there's a chance I heard about it on on the Pod I don't even know but all I know is there was like maybe it was a year ago or so there was like this 30-day Rush of it was like vending machines were like crypto or the next AI everyone in the world wanted vending machines so I was like all right it seems like a terrible business so why does everyone want this and it's like high cash flow like I get it but similar to the ATM business you have to go there it's physical you have to replace product I was like eh that can't be that interesting but like anything else I always go down this path of like before I say no let me do some diligence and I'm on like some one of those sites bis buy sell or one of those type of sites where you can buy a company there's this Rural Company uh in the middle of nowhere like Lewiston Idaho not even Boise like Lewiston there's nothing there and uh it did when I I had looked at 20 companies and they all did about the same margins whatever they were I don't remember now this company did like three times the margin I was like why is this company so much better like either they're lying and fidgeting these numbers or something's going on and uh the broker convinced me to go so I flew into this like remote airport in Leon Idaho uh and I drive 40 minutes to this like warehouse and we open up and it is this like full-blown operation I have pictures I have like so many pictures of they had hundreds and hundreds of vending machines that they didn't even have out there yet that they have stocked they had more inventory you thought they like ran a hospital there was so much inventory and I was like okay uh this is a bigger business than the numbers I saw and so I said there's no way that the numbers I read is this business and he goes yeah they own five regions and we listed one of them but if it was the right person we'd probably sell them all and I said okay and I was trying to ask a bunch of questions and he kept just saying like you just have to go out with God I'm spacing out his name um Roger or something what whoever owned it um you just have to go out with him and you'll know why everyone loves vending machines I said okay so I spend all day in Idaho in the pouring rain and we drive around Le and Idaho and I realize there's no grocery stores there's no convenience stores there's no Fox Trot coffee they rely on vending machines it's FedEx distribution centers it's like this is where they do build all the turbines that go on the propellers for the fields it's like it's like you know the workers part of America and everyone's lunch break they just go to the vending machines and a warehouse will have 50 of them snacks cold food hot food everything they eat is out of vending machines so I said oh like every meal of the Working Day is coming out of a vending machine and so then when I dug into how the business Works usually you're buying a contract um from Coker Pepsi and you're you're obligated to sell their product they give it to you for a rate and you have to use their machine well those are on like five or 10 year deals so then during diligence I asked them to give me all of the contracts with Pepsi and Coke because what I knew is that this local library or this local Warehouse they don't want to have to deal with getting new machines they don't want to deal with that um and so it'd be just disruptive to the business so I realized that all of his contracts with Coke and Pepsi were expiring soon and I was like well the only reason the margins aren't absolute insanity is because I have to pay a120 for freedos and I can only sell them for two bucks but what if I got an alternative to freedos and and bought it for 4 cents and then and then sold it for two now the margins are insane and so I looked into like the legality of like do I need to renew with COK or Pepsi and the answer was no I need to get new machines but there's companies that'll Finance them so I was like What if I just buy this company wait for all the contract to expire renew none of them and then go in without C or Pepsi now you have a little bit of a distribution headache because they'll bring them to Lewis Den Idaho but Le and Idaho there's all these like discount stores to buy product at so it could work and near the end of diligence uh I had just kind of had the idea to start my next company and I came to the conclusion of I don't want to end up having to move to Leon Idaho because I bought a vending business and I need to save it um and so while I think it's an unbelievable opport I chose not not to do it how big do you think that could have been it was 5,000 machines yeah but in dollars what what do you think it would have done I probably would have made like I don't know a million two a year million three a year but it would I I'd have to run it I felt like I was going to have to run it for two years or maybe a year and then hire someone but the other thing is you're dealing with physical stuff I need to pay drivers to go to the things I need to have inventory so everything had to be in Leon and I'm like what am I gon to move to rural Idaho so if uh that business is doing a million a year in cash flow what what do it sell for uh I think they wanted four million for the business five million so four times cash or however they measured so I went to a bank and and they wrote up a loan I was going to finance it um and then I was like wait uh what if uh I end up having to move to Idaho this is a problem um so so so your due diligence on these things the reason you're fascinating is your due diligence on these things is pretty in depth like most people my myself sometimes included I will endend with like I'll just do a few Google searches and it kind of ends there you're I mean multiple times you're flying to places and meet people yeah I mean I do a lot of times within five minutes I think we all on the back of a napkin know if a deals make sense but I usually try and figure out everyone else thinks there's a a way to make this business marginally better by consolidating and rolling them up but how do you make it five times better and then the answer is if there's no answer I'm not interested um because then I wouldn't do the deal so then I only tried and figure out how could you make this five times better when everyone tries to make it 10% better and my thought was when I looked at the line item the biggest line item 90% of it was the cost of goods from Coke and Pepsi I go how can I just not sell that because I can buy a store brand Twinkie in wholesale for 10 times less than I have to buy Twinkie for and so I just read all the contracts and then I would call people like I'd call lawyers that I knew were in the vending business and I said do I have to renew like here's the language it's kind of like and they said like there's always this like thought from Coke or Pepsi of like you don't really have to but they give you the product they distribute it like it's names that people know brands that people know but I thought in my opinion people's willingness to buy Fritos uh uh wasn't that much higher than a name brand because they have no alternative like like right so that was what I thought they're they're at the job and and honestly I could also lower the prices and those people would have been thrilled and I talked to them I'd go in I'd be like hey is it cool if I like talk to your employees real quick I was at like a distribution center and the guys like sure just like don't take my vending machines like that's all I was like okay and I'd go up and I'd be like uh hey do any of you guys care if it wasn't Fritos anymore and then the guy said well would it be 50 cents less I said sure he go I don't care what it is like Fritos are Fritos and I was like huh interesting so that's where I think the value in vending is if you're not just trying to build like some big cap like like I just wouldn't buy a vending route or an ATM route or anything like that to just try to improve it because I'm a better operator like I think people think they're sub like you can be the best operator in the world but the business is the business so um that's kind of how I look at those things well I love that you um go down these R random rabbit holes so Riverboat gambling um vending machines I'm sure you've done more than we've just talked about in terms of thinking about ideas you you seem like you're one of us you have that switch it can't turn off and so regardless of what you're doing you're always GNA be thinking of of ideas or you're gonna hear something it's gonna make you curious and interested and you say well maybe not for me but that for somebody that would be actually pretty interesting uh do you have a couple of ideas you could share that maybe somebody in the audience might get uh get inspired by what are the other ideas the silver Bal ideas things that you're not necessarily doing um or you're just willing to share um there was another business that would actually be a lot in my opinion a lot easier than the vending business in Idaho um I was at uh about two summers ago um a lot of my friends you know they went to missou so we'll go to Lake of the Ozarks in the summer Fourth of July or something like that and the redneck Rivier baby home of the uh home of the uh the the wet t-shirt contest and and lost GoPros at the bottom of uh at the bottom of 40t of water that's actually a good business Sean um if you if you want to hire divers there's probably millions of dollars of GoPros at the bottom of Lake of the ozar so I'm at Lake of the ozar darks and I hadn't been since I had left college so it had been a couple years and we needed to get from our Airbnb to and I'm sure Sam knows this place the place called Shady Gators it is it is it is the uh Sean if you looked up on Google Shady Gators uh I think you would tell me you're not going is what you would say um it's like classic spring break it say it says College spring break bikini wet t-shirt contest as a gets and unfortunately the bridge at Lake of the Ozarks is on like the far side from where our Airbnb was and the only way to get there is to drive all the way around the lake well that's like a 50-minute uber and instead of that they have water taxis and I didn't even know about this my buddy's like yeah just call a dispatcher like they'll send a a water taxi what am I in Venice I was like okay so uh we we call this guy and like seven seconds later he pulls up to our Airbnb in the water and we just get on and all my buddies were drinking we're on their way there and all I can think about is how how much is this guy making right now and I said to my buddy I said how much are we paying him I whispered and he's like it's 250 we split it between the five of us I go I'm sorry this is like a three minute ride three minutes tops and I go and he just goes around and so I couldn't help myself I asked him I said hey um do you like own this thing and you could tell he like he was driving it but he did own it but he wanted he didn't want people to realize that the owner was driving he wanted to feel like it was a company he has the brand on the boat like all this stuff and he was like yeah we own it yeah he said we he said we he said we uh and uh so all my buddies are like getting off and they're running in the Shady Gators uh and I am just locked on this guy I go hold on a second hold on a second I was like it's $250 it took 90 seconds to get us here and he's like he's like yeah it's seasonal because it gets cold here in the winter but he's like we spew cash All Summer in spring and summer I said what does spew cash mean exactly and he said well I have three boats um and he goes all I do is I have a dispatcher and she sits behind a monitor and has like a live feed because they have like some they put like a drone up there with some things so she can see where all the boats are and she has the GPS and when people call she can see their IP address because when you call into the dispatcher it's like some platform that shows you so they know where people are on the lake and then she'll load it into their thing on the boat to go where to go next and a lot of these boats have like GPS so you just click accept just like you do on Uber and they drive around and I'm like okay uh and I said to him I said uh would you ever like raise capital for this business or like do you need more like uh are there more people than you can get and he said by 10 12 well how much was he making oh like like every boat made him like about 400 Grand a summer he had three of them so he was doing like a million to yeah and he's and he's from you know you know he built this from nothing started with one boat used the money to buy another boat but he doesn't know how to like he's not he didn't he would wait too long because he didn't know you could just like Go finance a boat he would just wait till he could pay 90 grand cash for a speed boat it's like you can just put down n Grand like a car and you'd have 10 tomorrow so but he didn't know how to do any of these things so I said if you had money um and you had 20 boats would it be too many boats and now they're sitting around he goes I could probably fill 10 boats as much as I fill these three but I don't want to spend the cash I kind of use it to you know I bought a house we built a lake house like all this stuff and so then I was like okay that's that that's that precious Mountain Dew money baby so then I'm like okay what if I this is also post buying the Riverboat before my next company so I'm still in like the vending mode of like can I blow up a business like this and so I called him because we were talking about maybe I would invest in the company and I said uh hey Connor uh I changed my mind uh would you sell me this business and he was like sell you this business I was like yeah he goes I never thought about that like I don't know what it's worth or anything um and my thought process was what if I can blow this up to 10 or 15 boats on Lake of the Ozarks and then go to Orange Beach Alabama and then go and then start going around America and building up the water taxi business Baton Rouge Louisiana you need to get from Tiger Stadium to you know Fred's bar whatever it is and then water is the only vertical that Uber doesn't have and lft doesn't have and then I called people Executives those companies and they said it's so difficult it's so Regional the weather all this stuff we don't want to own boats we have to dock them all this stuff but they kind of made a comment like but we'd buy it if it existed but we won't build that so I said okay so now I have a willing buyer of this business um so I thought if I could do this um uh he was taking most of the cash for himself I would buy this business I don't need any of the money so I would take all the money and just buy more boats until I've maximized Lake of the Ozarks and then I would go you know Lake Town by Lake town and uh lot of liability lot of logistical things definitely think it's worth doing but it didn't I ran all the numbers I tried to estimate forecast out what I thought this business could do and I just I had decided when I left fubo that the next thing I was going to do I had no interest in if it couldn't be worth at least a billion dollars in five years and I thought if it could be it was the absolute ceiling and you'd have to execute perfectly and hope there's no legal issues and weather and damage and like all it's a very physical business so I chose not to do it but I think it's a big opportunity and I think we'll see Uber buy some water taxi company in like 20 28 I think we'll see that can I just read you the menu of shady Gators would you guys be interested in that yeah be very interested tell me all the variations of tater tots you mean Gator bites or ultimate tater tots or loaded loaded tots um for me I'm gonna start with the shrimp happens that's where I'm gonna start uh Sam for my friend Sam he wants the Brazilian Sizzle those are the I this place looks phenomenal this place looks like I think you're focused on the boats you needed to buy Shady Gators uh this is an institution you know like you know when rich people go buy like the Washington Post this could have been your washow you know you could have bought Shady Gators and been like I will protect this this uh this National treasury Shady Gators will cash flow for hundreds of years to come as long as there's boobs and there's white shirts this place will stay upright we we have to take sea Sean's never been to some of these places we got to take him on a tour to florama down in uh yeah there's this restaurant Sean it's called florama they even made a TV show about it it was like the I've seen that so I've seen these all through the TV safely while I'm you know under a blank for years that's where that's where I spent spring break florama is right at the the Alabama Florida line there's literally a line like in the ground and this restaurant is half on each side and it's where you go for just pure debauchery when you are 21 years old old or 19 with a fake ID these places are wild you have to experience a good four B I had a buddy from New York who when I bought the vessel uh it's in like rural Iowa and uh he flew into this private airport because he had to see this thing and he had never been to he's we're like running out of gas on the highway and he's like we have to pull over we have to pull over he's like flipping out and I'm like we're good man there's a gas station in eight miles and we have like a reserve tank like don't worry about it like he's used to New York UBS and like just getting in Uber blacks and like being in the middle of nowhere Iowa he was like panicking he's taking pictures of like gas stations he thinks they're like he thinks they're like uh monuments it's like a safari for him yeah yeah yeah yeah this is where people get gas Brian yeah so um so you know what I wish I kind of wish there was a well in general I'll say this you're like we have the segment on this pod called the Blue Collar side hustle you're like the walking Blue Collar side hustle right like all of these ideas you're talking about are so Middle America I love it and they are so um just uh you know hustle and Ingenuity that I love it and you're finding really interesting opportunities that are off the beaten path right it's like you want to do things that the 99 like if you if you say all right I'm not the smartest guy there is maybe I'm in the I'm in the top 20% of IQ what you want is within that top 20% you want to then go look in places where 99% of them them don't look CU now you're you know you're operating in a field of your own and it seems like that's what you're doing I kind of wish this existed um Nationwide because what what you're finding is you're finding a bunch of opportunities that you know how you would execute them but now they're no longer worth your time or the the the schlep that you would have to eat to do it you were willing to do it with your first business but now on your third business you're not as willing to do that um you know T Peter teal did this thing called the teal Fellowship where he was like I'm going to pay kids to drop out of college if they're exceptional and they might create big things and out of that came you know figma and ethereum and some of the like kind of breakthrough multi-billion dollar tech companies I kind of feel like there should be a blue collar teal Fellowship where we just go and we we we post a flyer in a bunch of campuses that just says um sick of this drop out and make millions and let's just see who shows up and it's going to be the person who's like this is probably but like I'm down what else am I going to do go to organic chemistry right now like I got to see what's here there's going to be like eight people at the seminar and of the eight you know five will leave halfway through because they think it's a time share presentation and out of the three remaining there'll be one person who's like oh you're telling me that you'll help me go find a business within a mile and a half of this campus right now that if I just like Focus for three years can make me $9 million all right I'm in I'm I'm sitting I already go to you know Boise State or I already you know like at where I went to school at Duke there was this one bar it was our version of shady Gators called Shooters and if anybody went and bought Shooters it's like guess what sir you now have a monopoly on The Nightlife scene of Durham and every single student will come there and like this place just hasn't changed and like look if if the mechanical bull just took Apple pay your Revenue would go up 10 per. like there's just a bunch of easy wins that can be had just by like thinking about things slightly differently you know the example I would give of Shooters would be cool during the day this needs to be essentially like a yoga studio and at night it's going to become the nightclub and now you're going to go from you know 10% usage to maybe 45% usage and that will be a big that's how you do your your 5x um I feel like that needs to exist I feel like we need to find the Sam raters that are out there they're out there right now in every college and they just need a little bit of inspo a little bit of ideas and and a little bit of mentorship in order to do yeah the problem with the businesses I found is that if the value is in the fact that it's remotely located well then it's difficult because other than finding another Lewis in Idaho that already has an operating business and has those Dynamics if the town relies on it you can't scale it out of Leon on but the reason I love the water taxi thing is because there's 10 or 12 great water lake towns in America so I liked that a little bit better but my concern was when I really forecasted it out it'd be a big win but it would take it would take five to seven years and I was like nope just just not willing just just couldn't yeah so that that's always the problem but for someone who has I don't know I don't want to say for someone who is only pure want to execute and wants to retire and have 20 30 $40 million I think that's a great play well for a lot of people that's that's not necessarily where you have to retire but it's like when you're at zero $7 million sounds like all the dollars and uh and then once you have $7 million and you're now 24 and your friends are you know still paying off student debt and you're sitting there being like I learned so much and I have Financial Freedom I can do whatever I want they can do the thing you did and go chase down this River for you know 9 months where other people wouldn't wouldn't think to go do that right so it's it's a it's a gateway drug into doing you know more and more interesting things what were the other Investments you said you made two Investments that were awesome I assume one of them was the the boat yeah um I've invested not a lot because I really am focused on what I'm doing but I have made some private investments into startups that I try to be as helpful with as I can you said that you want to start something that can get to a billion in I assume you met exit value in 5 years you have a new company now is that the one that you think going to do it so showroom so when I was at um fubo TV uh when I left we were doing about a billion dollars a year in Revenue don't quote me they're public we can find the numbers I think about 700 million was the monthly subscriptions to fubo TV so $59.99 if you buy Red Zone you're probably near 100 bucks whatever it was uh and then 300 million uh give or take was the advertising which is when you scale a streaming business it's the whole business so I thought to myself why are these companies coming to fubo TV we're big but we're not massive uh so there's got to be a play here that they think there's value here um and what I realized is traditional cable Nationwide too expensive Disney plus ESPN plus and Hulu um all owned by Disney um kind of at a scale where pricing is probably similar to being National um and we were small enough that if you wanted six zip codes in Nashville uh we'd give it to you um and so what clearly the sentiment was from these companies was that uh it's very hard to get in front of consumers uh Google shopping uh while is okay for a user is unusable for a merchant because no one's outbidding calv inclin for the word underwear or black denim jacket it's become way too corporate I think like 80% or maybe 70% of the brands that buy keywords for E for fashion Footwear on Google shopping I think in their last report I think it was like one of like a few hundred Brands and there's tens of thousands of Brands so most of them AR on there and I was in a meeting once with the former C CMO of like a direct to Consumer cowboy boot brand and uh she made this interesting comment in a meeting and she was like yeah we waste like 50 cents of every dollar we spend on Google and I was like whoa whoa whoa hold on a second excuse me like stop the meeting that's craziest thing I've ever heard I go why is that and she said because we pay about $4 to own the word cowboy boots and half the time someone looks up cowboy boots it's a third grader looking up cowboy boots for their third grade presentation they need a photo to like cut out and put on their poster they had no intent of buying $700 boots so we waste 50 cents of every dollar and I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa and she said this is the first time I heard this concept she said that's why Vertical Search is so great I said what do you mean and she had been an executive uh she was a c or I don't know if she was a CMO very senior at cars.com and she said people look up Toyota on Google for all kinds of reasons photos videos they might be looking at Toyota's stock price but if they look up at Toyota and cars.com they're a buyer or they're a seller there's High intent you're not just browsing around cars.com so I said that's interesting so then I was like okay so those are really Google's competitors is all these vertical places to find what you want to find that has a better experience and more tailor than just traditional search so I essentially uh do what I always try to do like in the vending business I called the lawyers who know the Pepsi contracts I called as many Engineers on the Google shopping team is I could get to agreed to talk to me um and the sentiment was they said Sam we want Google flights to be a really great experience for Google users but not at the detriment of stepping on the toes of our large largest advertisers Expedia kayak they want them to pay and they want them to battle it out they don't think it's not a good business to be in they would just rather them battle it out and battle it out means pay Google to be there and my conclusion was okay could this be done better now and I was very anti- crypto still am don't like crypto at all never never boned it um and so when all this AI started coming out I had this initial sentiment of like Eh this is crypto again I don't believe in this I have changed my mind on that um and what I realized I was like if I showed you two black t-shirts and one's from Lululemon and ones from Gap if we remove the brand names the product descriptions the actual copy is shockingly similar it's just describing a black T-shirt um it's really inherent in the sentiment of the brand as to what that shirt is for Lulu's shirt is for one thing Gap shirt could be an undershirt and so um your inability to have like a ongoing conversation with a language model that knows every brand and product in the world um would be very limiting and you'd end up with Google shopping so what we've done is uh we've built this huge infrastructure we have thousands and thousands of merchants tens of millions of SKS um that kind of organically come into this data set we've trained a language model to understand nothing besides what's in that data set and then that can communicate um to a user so they can have an ongoing conversation with essentially think about like not just Neiman Marcus or not just Macy's or not just a retailer who picked a couple hundred Brands to carry but you can essentially communicate back and forth with an inventory of every brand in the world and the reason why shopping's always had these big opportunities is because everything else has been dominated by Amazon or Alibaba and they have their market share in the like cheap fast fashioned sector but Gucci's not on Amazon burberry's not on Amazon every brand at Neiman Marcus toova away luggage these companies like they might people might sell Nike products on Amazon Nike is not on Amazon so that's why companies like shop Runner had come along where they're like we're going to be the Amazon Prime for everything Amazon doesn't have and they scaled and sold to FedEx for hundreds of millions the founders on our board at showroom so there's always been these opportunities in fashion for product Discovery and I actually think prior to language models this is this is absolutely a business that would have been very very hard to build because you lack that brand sentiment um and so that's essentially what we've built we're launching the beta here shortly we have thousands of people on the waiting waiting list we're really excited we have Revenue share deals with every single Merchant in the platform those Revenue share deals fluctuate you know between five and 20% just depending on the brand you know Nike pays you you know a point probably but you know a a director consumer brand is paying for growth they'll pay you a 15% Revenue share all day you're kind of doing what you did before where the with the betting site you're like well the consumers went this and I don't know if I can differentiate that and so you went to the brand side you know if a if a Marketplace has two sides you went to the brand side you're sort of doing that with with this where you're like thinking well what's the problem for advertisers but it seems like with these consumer products the hardest part is getting the consumers and once you have them often times you can figure out not or I don't know if often is the right word some of the times you can figure out how do you monetize a huge audience aren't are are you scared that you're not going to be able to figure out how to get the actual users there no because I think inherent in the platform is the transaction so then there's transaction fees the merchants pay Revenue shares if you're a consumer platform for like entertainment social entertainment's become a little bit of a commodity that's why Netflix does these originals but everyone else like fubo Hulu ESPN Disney we all just had ESPN and TNT and everyone has the same stuff and if you're social you have to increase engagement but if you are something where there's transactions well now inherent in the experience is transacting and that's where you can make money so that's why I think companies like the social the ones that get a big audience and then go social I think it's a huge mistake like Pinterest big audience and then they went like social not Commerce um and to me it's like well no one Minds paying fees or having hidden fees into things that they were already buying people might complain about fees on Airbnb but they were already booking something and so I think the value is can you build a big consumer business then inherent in the journey is a transaction and your product is a 100 times better shopping experience than what they had before so I always just lean on focus on the consumer forget everything else if the consumer wants it everything else is noise you can push it through and consumers will want the product so I want to ask you about the way your brain works because I find you very interesting and we always ask everybody before they come on what are some of your strong opinions or life philosophies that you would you you live by and you gave us a couple but I want you to explain them so uh number One never ever pitched twice what is that so every investor I've ever had the moment I pitched them and walked out of the room called me 12 times showed up at my door in Chicago and said I won in this round um same thing with employees everyone I've ever you know I'm always recruiting anyone who's ever wanted to join the company the moment they wanted to join the company they wanted to drop everything they were doing to join the company in my opinion raising capital is an informative process not a persuasive one within 5 minutes of us getting on the call today I think we all we had some preconceived notions of what we thought of each other and then within 5 minutes I'd say you'd have a 90% cemented view of what you think of the person and so when I'm pitching um I'm going in and I'm giving them my full attention but I'm informing them of what we're building and what we're doing um and it's one thing if they have legitimate diligence questions as follow-ups or whatever but I never ask twice because I know that everyone who's ever really wanted to do it didn't need to be asked twice they loved it and so I would rather just move on to the next one um and in my opinion you give them the information they've formed their opinions if you're ever trying to persuade them you're on the wrong side of the table from a negotiation standpoint anyways um and so I just don't pitch twice um I try to be as cognizant if I can that you always want to be respectful of like Venture Associates at the fun because sometimes by pure volume if it's like a big fun like a sequoia they their principles can't take every meeting they need some layers that's fine um and if they have legit follow- on questions I'll get back on more calls and answer emails whatever but I never pitch twice because I know that if I need to kind of sell it again then they didn't want it and that doesn't mean that you can't have luck following up and being ruthless about the followup and you there's those stories where you push it through but there's thousands of funds in my opinion capital's pretty cheap if you have a great business you're going to raise the money and so I kind of just move on to people that are so excited by it that they are willing to get on a phone on Christmas um because they know this could be a life-changing opportunity for them you know so that's kind of how I view pitching you've got this other one that is um I don't know if controversial is the right word but it's kind a lot of people wouldn't agree so you said the but the potential you see in others is not real it's rarely potential realize so take everyone at face value for what they are today well there's one one key line in there is that you said it's a mirror of what you would do if you were in their position I've thought about I always have like these I have like a massive massive list on my phone and I have these Concepts and and I have another notepad of Concepts that I haven't really figured out a way to explain it the right way I always try to boil down this thought I have to like two sentences and recently on Twitter I saw someone say this which is the potential I don't know who it was but the potential you see in others is rarely realized it's simply a mirror of what you would do if you were them I have spent a lot of time in my life trying to I don't want to say change other people but I I think they have such great potential but I always feel like it's like you're dragging a bag of bricks in your backpack to the office it's like they just if they don't want it on their own you just can't change them and what I see in them is really what I would do if I were them but it's not what they want to do and so I'm not saying you can't put in effort to coach people up and make them great members of the team but that's different than if they want to be there or not if they don't want to be there you know if they don't want to box they're not showing up to the gym and boxing for 12 hours a day to go beat Floyd Mayweather they don't want to be there and so if you think they're a great boxer and they show up every day okay you can coach them but I just feel like it's a wasted effort and you should take people for exactly what they are and what do what do those people love doing more than anything as much as I love running businesses and building businesses and doing things like this what do they love as much as I love this and can I get that task to be something in my business because then they're going to do great but if it's anything other than that they're just better off going to somewhere else where they want want that skill set and so I just think that you should pretty quickly know it's like if you're a trainer or you're a coach does the player want to be there and if they don't want to be there you can be mad that like ah they're 6 eight it's like in high school when your coach goes to the volleyball team they're like Peter like stop spiking volleyballs like you could play center you know at Duke and they're like he I like volleyball he just likes volleyball and anytime they've ever gotten that kid to say fine I'll play on the basketball team he doesn't care he doesn't want to come to practice he's never very good and just don't realize the potential but his potential while it looked to you if you were 68 on the volleyball team you could be a great basketball player Peter doesn't want to be a great basketball player so it just doesn't work out so that's kind of like my opinion on that that kind of stuff let's do one more you have one on here that I'm curious about it says uh the value is in the duck calls it's a good one and uh I think that's the perfect one to end on here what does that mean me and um who's um best man at my wedding Jonah Roberts uh I'll give him a shout out Jonah uh he's from Memphis sound like he almost forgot his name Jonah and I were no no definitely didn't remember his name um Jonah and I were in Memphis Tennessee uh in his hometown and he wanted to take me to the Bass Pro Shop which there is like the Holy Growl um and we're walking around which feels like ours and we cannot stop dying laughing every single aisle every product you could ever imagine you need for hunting and fishing and home tools they have everything and uh right when we think we've seen every product that anyone's ever made we stumble to come around the corner to go to the like where the back of the store is and there's this big almost like when you go to a guitar store and they put all the expensive ones in a room there's this sign that says duck calls and there's like this glass door and we open and there's like what felt like a 100,000 duck calls they've got metal duck calls polyester duck calls they've got Stone duck calls they've got duck calls with two heads they have different colors they have it's like this whole economy of duck calls that we didn't even know existed and so what I realized is the reason I dig in to the vending businesses in the riverboats and the water taxis is because the value is in the duck calls the value is in the things that no one knows about that are very odd that have these Niche ecosystems of communities and the people who love duck calls trust me they love duck calls they'll pay a thousand dollars for a duck call they don't go hunting for they don't go without them it's like a big thing they collect them and it's something I never knew about and so whenever I hear about something that could be really big and then I hear a bunch of people I go I go I've never heard of that like who would ever want that and then I go on like one random Brands site in the duck call business and some random Merchant I've never heard before has 800,000 followers and does $5 million a year that like cements to me that all the values in the duck calls it's in the things that people don't know about or are too complicated to find or our regional or our Niche or one of those things so I always kind of me and Jonah always kind of say the value is in the duck calls I I have a feeling Sam well first of all are you going to call your shot now so your new business um are you are are you going to call your shot where in five years you're gonna it's gonna be worth a billion dollars because what I want to look back in five years because I think you're good you've clearly have the it Factor some you've already done amazing things but something more amazing I predict is gonna happen with you I don't know when but is this going to be the one you think I do are you gonna hit your fiveyear goal how your a year into it I bet uh yeah I would say that would be the goal would I wouldn't I would not work on every day I wake up it's like every day you own a building you own a stock you're choosing to buy it and every day I choose to work on this I think more and more uh that is definitely going to work and the moment that I think it's going the other way I will not work on it so we're going to look back on this December 2028 and we're going to see if you if you nailed it but I have a feeling you're going to do something amazing and uh we appreciate you coming on man you're you're awesome no thanks for having me I've been following the Pod since you started in 19 when I was I I used to watch your videos out of the lifetime yoga studio that's amazing uh awesome man thank you for coming on you're you're fun all right we appreciate you and that's a [Music] pop

my first business was called bunk it was Tinder for roommates which I always say was stupid but before it became an app we actually just had a website that was built on Weebly what we used to do is we went and found landlords who had four bedroom apartments and we said hey we're going to host an event at your three and four-bedroom apartment and we're going to have a bunch of prospective tenants there and they're going to team up and get their own place we would create individual ads for a one-bedroom at $1,000 and back then on Craigslist you could use HTML and create these beautiful images of what the apartment looked like and it said this is bunk SF we help match people this is a one-bedroom and a four-bedroom but we're going to help you team up we would get like 10,000 users a week coming to our bunk sf.com website and that's how I got our first bit of users

so I know a guy who sold a company for $990 million he had four co-founders and he raised a ton of money you know how much he made after the sale $3 million that's how much he made yeah that's insane right and I think that's an extreme case but there's many cases where you create a billion dollar business and you actually walk away with like 8% of the company which is still a ton of money but that's a wild experience it's like a small ton it's a small ton not as big of a ton as people think you get when you make a company that big yeah

Elon Musk said that Tesla is working on humanoids I think it's called Optimus and he went on to say not a lot of you people are talking about Optimus I think that's crazy because this is actually going to be bigger than our car business bigger than self-driving bigger than solar it's going to be bigger than everything and I don't think you guys realize how big this is going to be I invested in this company called figure and I talked to Brett at and he basically has me convinced that this is going to be like the biggest industry in the next like 10 or 15 years I think this is so big that there's going to be more of these robots than there are humans

the only thing I've seen where people change is you kind of have to hit rock bottom let's say a CEO comes to me and they say I think the best way for us to grow is SEO and I say oh well what about XYZ or have you thought about changing the product in this way when I challenge their idea they will now defend the idea and as soon as they defend the idea now they will double down on that I've just realized like trying to change people's impossible at the end of the day we're all like elephants and you're just the rider you just kind of go where the elephant's going to go and hope for the best

and then we were like all right fine deal like that's you know this business was so freaking hard like let's try this and uh in the end I don't think it ever ended up working but you got the customers and that's the point of the episode yeah exactly the subsequent failure is irrelevant okay [Music] yeah all right we're live Sean we're going to do a Q&A session today we got a bunch of questions I have a feeling we're going to spend most of the time on one question but the question is how did you get your first 100 customers in your businesses and what are the best ways that you've heard of so I I'll ask you Sean but uh I've personally have grown I think five things to a million to 10 million in Revenue I've grown one thing to well north of 10 million in Revenue multi-million dollars per month I've grown a bunch of stuff to thousands of users I've grown a bunch of stuff to hundreds of thousands and I've grown one thing to millions and we'll go through examples and uh you've done the same you how many did did bibo have or blab blab had like four million users um yeah basically we've done this a bunch of different times and a bunch of different ways and so when we get this question you know how did you get your first 100 customers I actually really like this question this is a very different question than like you know what's your advice it's like forget the advice let me tell you literally what I did when it comes to how we grew our businesses at the very very start because if you're at the start it doesn't matter what somebody did to go to get to 10 million in Revenue what matters is what the they got the $10 in Revenue how did they get the ball going how did they get the initial momentum because if you don't do that by definition you don't really get to you know you don't get to step two unless you've done step one and so this is the uh the step one episode and I thought it'd be fun if we take the our own like just all the different projects that we've done and just try to label the method that we use to go and get those first 100 customers that are that got the ball rolling do you want to go back and forth yeah let's trade off all right so the first thing that I grew I'm actually not going to talk about it a lot because I didn't realize it but I was breaking the law but it was I had an e-commerce store and I originally got my first 100 customers by posting in uh forums but I'm not going to mention that statute of by the way is that a real thing the statute of limitations like is it is there a real thing uh maybe we need producer AR to let us know by the way show her in her sweater fantastic sweater okay it's not a thing all right so so correct do not tell people what you were doing I thought after 10 years everything's forgiven no I'm not going to mention that but all right the first first uh my first business was called bunk it was like my first like actual startup out of college it was called bunk it was a roommate matching app it was Tinder for roommates which I always say was stupid we should have done Tinder for Tinder because this was right when Tinder came out it was like swiping like clicking Les yes or no um but before it became an app we actually just had a website that was built on Weebly we probably did 50,000 in sales in a handful of months something like that and what we used to do is in San Francisco it's mostly transient people so people like me and sea who moved there without knowing too many people and you want to rent a one-bedroom apartment but you can't afford a one-bedroom apartment and so instead there's a four-bedroom apartment where there's one room left and you apply to move in there what a lot of people don't know is back then and I don't know if it's this way now but back then literally a 100 people would apply for that one bedroom so the way that we got users is we went and found people who had like landlords who had four bedroom apartments and three bedroom apartments and we said hey we're going to host an event it's not going to be a party it was party it's going to be an event at your three and four bedroom apartment and we're going to have a bunch of perspective tenants there and they're going to team up and get their own place and so let's say that it was a four-bedroom place for 4,000 we would create individual ads for a one-bedroom at $11,000 and we and back then on Craigslist you could use HTML and create these beautiful like images of what the apartments looked like and it said this is bunk SF we help people match people this is a one-bedroom and a four-bedroom but we're going to help you team up and we we would get like like 10,000 users uh a week coming to our bunk sf.com website and that's how I got our first bit of users was through Craigslist and the point being the takeaway by the way is we already knew the Seekers were there and so it was just a piggyback where people already were I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hopspot grow better so the the smart part there is using Craigslist cuz Craigslist already had a lot of search volume basically you instead of SEO you use basically CEO so like go go to Craigslist and get uh use that traffic but then hosting the event what did you do in these events by the way was there anything special you did or like how did you get people to did you have to make it marketable or did you just make it normal because I know for the hustle you had these great little events that you use called pizza and for where you would invite a speaker to an event but the you would tape two 40 o beers to their hands and the rule this is a genius by the way this was so good I remember when you did this I was like that guy Sam is cool I want to be friends with him literally had that thought and I didn't even drink by the way at this point I didn't even drink but the name of the game was pizza in 40s because we didn't have a lot of money so we'll Supply Costco pizza and we'll have beer and the speaker has to have a 40 oce beer and the the interview is done when the 40 o beer is done right right it's like a TED talk but instead of 18 minutes it was however long it takes him to finish the beer if he wants to get off the stage chug baby chug and and you'd get a little bit more Loosey Goosey with the questions towards the tail that was genius so that one was marketable was your did you have to do that for the apartment thing or was it as simple as saying hey come check out this so we would get like hundreds of applicants for a one uh for like a four bedroom and we just emailed them and and we are very transparent in the ad it said this is not a one-bedroom it's a one-bedroom and a four bedroom but what we're doing is we're going to host a party with 50 people here's the types of people who are coming show up at this time and then they would team up and get a place and once they got a place the landlord would tell us it came from us and we would take money from both the user and the landlord and um uh yeah we were just really transparent about it and I would literally like ride my bike at the time to the house and be like knock knock I'm give me your $100 please uh or $300 or however much it was and that's how we made money but no it was that was very easy but now you can't do this uh Craigslist has changed how they operate but this by the way is exactly how Airbnb got popular um all right what's yours all right I'm GNA give you my first business as well so this is uh I'm 21 years old we are starting a sushi restaurant chain and I'm living in Denver and the way our thing worked it was like a cloud kitchen so it was um because we didn't want to sign a 10-year lease and build out a physical location and have to go raise $500,000 we had a mentor who was like what what if you did a delivery only a delivery only method and you um rented a commissary kitchen by the hour I remember we were paying $9 an hour instead of having to so like the contrast was we were about to sign a 10year lease with a personal guarantee and drop about 300 $500,000 to build it out or for $19 an hour we could start Monday and 15 years you're 15 years in the future I mean you you nailed it yeah we too early but still it so how do we get customers back then door Dash Uber Eats didn't exist so where are we going to get customers for our delivery only restaurant I didn't know any better knowing what I know now I probably would have just run ads local ads maybe Facebook ads Google ads something like that for people looking for sushi but I didn't know that at the time and ignorance is a bit of a superpower so the ignorance led us to our planning meeting was like 12 minutes long it's like we need customers so like hey we got the kitchen now like we need customers hey um I don't know walk around ask people so what I did was I went downtown and I did a version of door Tod door but instead of door too I did floor to floor so I went into a skyscraper because I wanted density so I was like oh let me just go to this big office building there's thousands of people working in this one building so I don't have to walk around all day I can just go in the elevator click one get out and talk to whoever I see click two get out talk to whoever I see I'll go up you know 30 40 flights in this building and what I realized when I was doing this was um it's kind of amazing I actually recommend this to pretty much anyone which is when you have a thing you you have all these ideas about why it's so great but you haven't actually like pitched it to somebody in a concise way where you have I don't know 30 seconds to a minute to like get your foot in the door and then maybe another minute to explain what your thing is and then you got to make a call to action and try to get them to buy and my pitch really sucked but because I was floor to floor it was like high 20 by 4 which was solid I knew and so what I realized was okay you go in you can't just bother people in an office you have to find the front desk lady her job is to greet a visitor so I said okay that's the accessible person she also had a lot of clout and so I learned about basically a local influencer so when people think about influencers they think it's got to be a celebrity but actually in any in any pocket of people there is somebody who is more influential than the rest any tribe of people and in an office that's always the person at the front desk it's the office manager the secretary whatever you want to call it and so I would go to this kind of office manager and I would say um I would say hey do you guys ever do so instead of saying hey would you like to eat some sushi it's like no I don't just eat sushi from strangers I realized pretty quickly that was my first pitch by floor two I was like all right I'm not saying that again so floor three and four I realized okay I should actually ask them like do they ever um do you guys ever do office catering for lunches or whatever for the for the for the group and they would say yes so I asked a question that had a very simple answer a yes or no answer if it was no then I knew don't waste my time on this Prospect they're not going to order but if it was yes yes now I had one person who might order 50 lunches um in one order right like they would order bulk and so I would ask them hey do you ever order uh you know do you guys ever do catering for office lunches maybe a birthday or a big meeting or or just every Wednesday and they were like yeah we do it every Wednesday I'd be like awesome I said when you order um where do you typically order from oh we always do the sandwich place blah blah blah I said awesome um if you ever wanted to try something new we actually just opened up a restaurant I was love to do a deal with you guys where we actually do it for free one time right so I created an offer I was like I'd love to bring you a sample tray just for you and you can invite a couple people in the office to try it out if you guys like it we'll leave a menu with you guys if you don't like it no problem we'll come back clean it up and I created an offer I created an opening question and I ended up getting my pitch right and this one thing we were profitable month one I remember we made like 13 Grand in the first month and like at the time everybody said restaurants you don't make any money and we were like we're doing it we're making money this is fantastic and so this Florida FL to floor sales and understanding who is the gatekeeper who is the person I need to get on board and what is the the sort of uh risk-free offer that I can offer them was the way we got our first first customers how much revenue were you doing in year six or not year six month year six zero dude we quit in month three because what we realized was we were like all right we were making I don't know tens of thousands a month so I think we were doing like maybe 30,000 the first month and a little bit more the second month and then by then it was like dude we were so worn out of the just the process of running a restaurant and we we kind of had a realization like great we can keep scaling this but that means we're going to have to keep doing this and it was you know we were waking up at 4 in the morning going to the fish market staying there till 11: at night because we would do private caterings at night and doing dishes and the then night we didn't know anything it was so stupid I didn't realize you should hire people we just did everything like you were like looking at your partners one day after work and you're like bail and they're like baale like we're out we had a realization we we realized we were in the wrong business we realized actually the the the genius of this was the delivery part people actually liked food delivery but they only ate sushi every couple weeks Max and so we were like oh you know what we should do we've been telling everyone for a year we're going to create the next you know this Chipotle of sushi actually what we should do is just deliver whatever the hell they actually want they want sandwiches dude they want burritos so we should just deliver that that's the business not the sushi part and then we were like all right I think that's true do we want to do that I was like and you know we had the smart thing which was hey guys maybe the first business idea we ever had in our lives might not be the best one and uh we're still young and we haven't committed anything to anybody what if we just switched to a better to a different business alog together and I'm so glad we had that conversation because most of the time if something's working you're making a little bit of money and you've been telling everyone for a year you just feel like you need to stay consistent with it and that would have been a terrible decision for us um that's hilarious um all right I'll tell you uh another one so I'll skip the book club one but I'll mention it briefly I had a book club the anti mba.com and that's how I met sea I met Ryan Hoover this way uh some of my best friends dude I just put another ad on Craigslist and I said I'm organizing a business book club and it was just from Craigslist and I ended up getting 10,000 people signing up to my email list by the way again sorry can we name these methods I will call the first one you did either like uh piggybacking because you piggybacked off Craigs or like a host an event maybe that was the method you did for mine it was literally door too and like don't underestimate the fact that you can just by Brute Force hand toand combat go get a 100 customers that way it'll only take you a few days to do that um and this third one you're talking about the book club we call it like the magnet there's something different to it because it wasn't just an event because what you did was you found a bunch of like-minded people because there was a filter the only people who want to do a book club for on for like biographies and business books are going to be the type of business nerds that you wanted to be around and create a product for and so like the selective filter where for 95% of the people they're GNA be like hell no but 5% there're it's a hell yes because it's like so nich to their obsessions and I think that there's something smart there that's different than just hosting a general event it's a magn the learnings by the way for a book club no one reads the book except me I was the only one who read the book I was just like teaching the book um all right I'll do the second one though all right so bunk was acquired for a very small sum and we ended up turning it into an app called roommates what'll call this methodology made to stick I guess because I learned this I uh one of the books that we read at my book club was called made to stick it was by Dan and Chip Heath I think they're experts on like verality and there was something in the book where it talked about I forget exactly the phrase but it but my takeaway was that phrase that I always say niches make riches and the idea being if you ever see one of these BuzzFeed articles and it'll be like 50 ways you 50 reasons why or uh 50 50 things only only long Islanders will laugh at right or 50 things you know you're an Italian Aman or 50 ways you know you're from St Louis and the thing about those is they don't get a huge amount of traffic but the people in Long Island or St Louis or who are Italian they will always click it they and so the click D rate is through the roof and so we didn't have a budget when we launched the app roommates and so what we did was I stole that that that learning and I created we launched in La Chicago Boston New York San Francisco five or six cities and so what we did was we made an infographic where we called it the typical roommates of San Francisco the typical roommates of LA and I had never even been to LA or New York or Boston I'd never even been there and what we did was each image of the infographic it was 18 people I think or 15 people and it said here's the people from the marina which is a neighborhood in in San Francisco here's a typical roommate from the mission which is the Hipster area of San Francisco and in each thing we said where do they shop and we named eight or four different places that they would shop where do they eat what what's a funny quote they would say and I would read Yelp and I would find out in in let's say New York like what is a the most reviewed restaurant on Yelp in that area and are people making jokes and saying that overhyped or whatever and which stores are the most popular and then what we did we made those infographics and we we shared them out on Facebook and Twitter and I think Instagram I don't even remember where and we tagged those restaurants and those stores and most people are like oh this is so funny they totally know us which we just stole it from Yelp all the jokes and they ended up sharing it and we got something like a 100,000 users just from that infographic just from those five infographics and if you Google you guys can Google um typical roommates of LA and you'll see H dep post or all the local newspapers of those regions shared it and that's how we got all of our initial customers from uh from those four or I remember seeing that I remember seeing the San Francisco one it was really funny it would be like like you're making it sound almost like it was like uh like utilitarian but it was actually humorous I thought like it wasn't funny the shop it would be like the marina it's like and then it'd be like whatever I don't remember exactly how you phrase it but it would be like um uh here you're gon to find Kelsey is blah blah blah and you would kind of like make fun of them but also backhanded compliment them and then you would say like you know the upside you you know you'll always have um you know Lululemon around the house the downside blah blah blah and you would like kind of poke fun at them and because of that everybody shared it because for their own neighborhood they'd be like that's so true that's so true that's so us oh my God this is you and then for others that they didn't like the other neighborhoods same thing it was like kind of like our team versus their team and so a lot of people shared this thing I was living in San Francisco at the time I remember seeing that right when I actually moved there and I was like this is actually quite it was useful because it's like it's not info you really found anywhere else either like uh it was like supposed to be like the real the real take so here's an example this is Wrigleyville in Chicago I've never even been there but it's an image of a broy looking guy who I guess went to Indiana University and he's wearing a cub shirt it said average one-bedroom rent average two-bedroom rent um here's how much you would save if you had a roommate and it says $310 per month or 20 Merkel fishbowls which I guess is like a restaurant in that area or it would say um avoids pilson and Andersonville so it creates like the tribe thing those are other neighborhoods occupation a PE teacher or a weekend bartender at Deuces uh you'll probably find them at R Wrigley Field rooftops crushing old Styles or doing 17 shots a fireball secret spot the back bar at of the stretch trying to to get the waitress to play find the water or calling everyone boss [ __ ] they say hey bro want a shot ski so like things like that where we' make fun of people but you'll notice we name as many Brands as possible the name of the game was throwing as many Brands as possible and those ref and those are the people who share and that is how we got I forget exactly how many users we had but I remember I got paid on how many swipes people did and they were Swip in millions and millions and millions of times right so that's how we got uh that's how we got traffic and users to the app roommates all right I'm going to tell you uh I'm going in order here so my next business was a biotech business in Australia that um go to Australia now biotech is a very like like we're talking about like Scrappy startup stories like how do you get somebody to download an app how do you get somebody to like order food biotech is like science people in it just go to an alley and you're like hey man here's a needle do you uh you want to try well it wasn't like human body biotech it was basically energy clean energy so the idea was our our technology was there's coal that's underground and people think coal is real dirty because if you mine it you bring it up to the surface and you burn it yes it is very like bad for the environment however our technology was this thing where you don't have to mine it so you don't have to bring it out of the ground and you don't have to burn it instead what you do is you pump little microbes into the ground little naturally occurring microbes and their natural feeding is basically they eat the coal they they basically decompose the coal is like they eat coal and they fart out natural gas so their natural metabolism of it will release natural gas which then bubbles back up to the to your pipe in the surface and uh boom you have a flare of natur was this like a company like a big company yeah it was a company it was a startup company so basically this the backstory was this guy in the United States the scientist in United States had been had gotten $40 million of government funding to develop microbes that would uh decompose ammunition because the government had uh there's Wars all around the world and part of of the like the environmental cleanup they had to do as part of the wars was they needed something that would decompose a lot of the ammunition and the the the waste product of the wars and so what happened was somebody realized you know the guy who the CEO of our company realized hey ammunition actually has a very similar composition to Coal I wonder if these bugs could decompose coal and so but it was speculative and we didn't know if it would work it worked in the lab will it work in the field now what are you going to do here to get your first customers right to get a customer you need some that has owns like land that has coal you have to have permits they have to let you like go do [ __ ] on their land how is this going to happen it's like so much friction so what we did was what I'll call the method of the no risk offer so what we did was we would go to we we said who needs this the most and we said Well it can't be somebody that actually values their coal because we're going to go and we don't have the money to go buy this coal like we can't buy the land from them like if you own land with a bunch of you know coal that's basically like fuel like that's very valuable property so we said we need to go to people that have stranded coal meaning they have coal that mining it would be uneconomic it'd be too deep it'd be too garly the way the the ground structure is so there is coal but like it's not good for Mining and so we got really tight on basically finding some for somebody for whom this was excess capacity and I think they know like Airbnb that's what they did right they sold excess rooms excess space in your house so we had took that same method we said how do we make a no risk offer so we went to them and we said look you're sitting on a bunch of coal what's that like who's an example like the landowner we would find we would do a geographic we looked at the geographic survey we would find where the stranded coal was meaning Cole that's not economic to be mined then we would go figure out from the property like Records who owns that we would go knock on their door we say did you know you're sitting on a bunch of coal and they'd be like yeah but like you can't really mine it we did a feasibility study it didn't work and we would say great what if I told you there was a way that you could make this many dollars per square foot without mining the coal and yeah I'm interested okay tell me more and we said well look we have this technology but you know obviously we need to prove it it'll only take us this much space and here's the deal we will do this all at our cost to do this whole method cost you nothing and but if it works we want to share of The Upside and they were like okay so you might make my land way more valuable and I only pay you if you do it and if I don't if it doesn't work I'm out I'm out nothing deal and and I'll throw in a tray of sushi exactly and so we were able to do this now this is something that this is also how Alex heroi did his gym launch thing if he listen to his story what he would do is he'd go to the gym owners he'd say uh you know I have a marketing program they're like I don't want to buy it we tried a bunch of marketing things I don't have I don't have enough money money anyways to go do this I'm not going to buy your marketing program for $10,000 so he reworked his offer and he was like how about this if I don't incre I will I will increase your sales by $100,000 using my marketing method and all I say is that anything we any of the incremental Revenue we bring in we get to keep whatever 15% it's like okay so you keep 15% but like you don't get anything if you don't raise my my Revenue it's like yeah we if we don't raise your Revenue by X we get nothing yeah no brainer Heros did a no Nob brainer offer Main Street did the same thing grew really fast in the tech startup Community by saying hey there's R&D tax credits available we will do it for you we keep 20% or 25% of all this all the extra tax credits you get you're not going to do this anyway ways so it's just free money for you um and so a lot of people use this this no-risk offer method and I think that's a very very fast way to bypass one of the hardest parts is if you're a new company which is you have no relationships nobody trusts you nobody you have no track record so you need to offer them something that has like zero downside and only upside how many customers did you get doing that well ironically what ended up happening was we had like five intered customers and then one of them was like hey hey hey if you're going to do this I want I want to own this technology like if it s like basically don't go to my competitors with this offer like they're going to then they're going to have you know this benefit I want this and so then they they came back later and they renegotiated the deal and they said how about this we'll give you $5 million and the land and we'll do the permitting for you um but and then we're like okay what's the catch and they're like the catch is if this works we want to be able to buy 50% of the technology for 50 million and then we were like all right fine deal like that's you know this business was so freaking hard let's try this and uh in the end I don't think it ever ended up working or I'm not sure what actually happened cuz I left after that deal was signed I was like turn out microbiomes microbiomes don't even like charcoal so turns out in the lab but it's like it I think it turned out to be kind of expensive or what actually happened is this field trial was going to take five years to do I wasn't going to sit around and wait till the to the conclusion of this and so I think what happened was like the guy who said yes got fired or took another job the next guy who came in was like ah I don't know I don't want to fund this and I have no idea what happened it kind of died on the vine but you got the customers and that's the point of the episode yeah we exactly the subsequent failure is irrelevant okay yeah that doesn't matter um all right my next one so uh I started a conference series called hustle con I ended up hosting this event maybe four or five times the first time I hosted it I decided to host it in May and I think it went uh the event happened in July uh July 1 or July 15 but I had roughly six weeks between deciding to do it and it happening and I think I made 60 Grand in revenue and I think 50,000 in profit the next year I think it was something like 180 Grand in revenue and my costs were only 20 grand so whatever that is that's what I made and then I did it again and I think I made like a quarter of a million in revenue and like 200,000 in profit um and then we hosted a bunch more events P you did like 600k right right yeah it made each event was doing like a couple times we got close to a million and I made a ton of mistakes the biggest mistake I made is I made it like a Ted event not like a trade show had I made it like a trade show I probably could have made tens of millions per event but I just didn't know what I was doing and I also charged like $300 to attend this event so I screwed up the business but I did get a lot of uh hype right away and the way that I got hype was I actually found one of my old posts um I would uh this one is on priceonomics so this guy Rohan Rohan he had a Blog called priceonomics and at the time they were like the best bloggers out there he was such a good blogger and he would go viral all the time so he was going to give a talk on content marketing and what I would do is I think I had eight speakers I wrote a blog post every Tuesday and Thursday on each speaker and I would go to Hacker News and I would go to Reddit and I would figure out which subreddits would this article fit best in and then later on and my second thing I'm going to talk about after uh after youo is I ended up eventually writing blog posts specifically that would go get popular in Reddit or on Reddit in different like subreddits but at this point I hadn't figured that out and so right away I think on the first day of business I think I got a thousand people to come uh to the website and then after that it would go to like 1,000 to 5,000 on any given day and you would go to the website and it would say a funny popup that I would get your attention and I would say give me your email and the hustle.com you couldn't even purchase a ticket unless you gave me your email you couldn't even see all the details and so I would get people's email and I would subsequently like the way I had it set up was I would write blog post number one put it on Reddit blog post number two put it on Reddit the traffic comes I collect their email when I get their email they go into a cycle where they get sent blog post number one then I get blog post number two and then I would keep writing blog post number three number four number five and I would keep emailing it to the Past people so it was like a cycle and those people would share just a little bit and that's how I eventually got two three four five thousand people coming to the website and I did another thing where I made the speaker look like a hero so it was like a glowing article about them and they would share it within their company and the each employee would share it to be proud and that's how I got two three four five thousand people and I think I think the email list I if you Google um hustle con Nev blog so my friend Neville madora Nev NE vblog he wrote a blog post about how I made 60 Grand in like six weeks and I list all the blog posted emails that I sent and that's originally uh how we got our first I think 10,000 email subscribers um is just doing that blogging and and when I say we I mean me in my kitchen uh just like doing this in my crappy San Francisco apartment that's yeah that's great I remember reading those blog posts they're really good I highly suggest you go read those uh they're detailed and specific and you literally have screenshots of what you wrote in certain emails and I think that's really cool to go see I like when people share those specifics um but do you hear that do you hear that that's the no dude that's the that's the thrill of the shill Oh I thought we had a pause I thought we had a pause I was like wait what uh all right you've got 90 seconds to to to Thrill me all right for those who don't remember the thrill of the shill is where we sh a thing but the way we do it is with value we do it with we by by entertaining with a little bit of story so I was going to talk to you about Shephard but the way I did it was I asked Marshall I go yo when you launch this thing because this is now a business that is coming up on like I I guess I really shouldn't say but millions of dollars of profit a year so a very very very healthy business how old are they four years uh yeah like less than four years old so uh in less than four years getting to you know basically eight figures in profit profit not Revenue profit so anyways I was like hey dude I'm doing this episode about how you got your first 100 customers what did you do for for Shephard he goes um he goes well I did a couple of things but he's like what I did was I he's linked me to the Tweet so he did three like three or four steps in a row so tweet one I'll show this on the screen he just goes I'm launching a new business tomorrow and then he did the sh sign emoji and then he said hint it's an agency and he had a small Twitter following about 10,000 followers at the time um not like a huge mega influencer but enough and that that post itself has 350 likes so that post itself probably got a bunch of people being curious going inbound and then what he did next he's like I'm gonna explain it on my newsletter so he goes to the newsletter and he writes this post and he goes today I'm launching this new business but let me tell you a story and he goes a few years ago my business is struggling here's why so he does what I call the personal story tactic which is instead of pitching the solution that you've made you pitch the problem that you had and you tell a personal story where you reveal some information you do some vulnerability and hopefully other people resonate with the problem that you had so he goes uh my business was was doing good and he's like but I uh or he's like I had this business it was kind of struggling I was working all the time but we never really had any profits I realized I I always thought I could solve the problem with growth and then finally one day I was like maybe I should try to lower my costs I didn't really know what to do so I looked for where could I lower my cost he goes I heard about a guy who had hired somebody in the Philippines for less than $1,000 a month meanwhile I was paying somebody 000 for the same service so I did it I did another one here's a picture of me in the Philippines you know we went out and met them because I was so amazed at how this worked he goes and so then that became my secret weapon I was hiring overseas and so now all of a sudden I went from profit margin of zero to profit margin of whatever 15% and that made the difference between the business sucking to the business being good so I started doing this for a few friends just for fun finally decided I'm going to make a business called support cheer.com to help you find equ amazing employees that are 80% less than the US equivalent he go blah blah and then he sent me the screenshot we can show this on the screen so this newsletter went to 12,000 people it had an 11% click rate which is the power of a story versus an ad and so normally an ad would get like a one to 3% click exactly so this is 10 times better why is it 10 times better because again he kind of opened up the kimono and told the story so to support sheep.com it says 1300 people clicked that link and then that's where he got you know you can even assume even like a 3% conversion on 1300 people is going to get you you know your whatever your I don't know the math but like let's say your first 20 30 customers to get the ball rolling and for a business like this where each customer's worth thousands of dollars that was enough to to sort of really actually move the needle and then what he did was he just kept doing the same thing and so if you want to hire people go use Shephard that's really the the shill but I actually like this method a lot I remember that Ryan Hoover did this amazingly with product hunt also I remember him doing this so he did the hand toand combat where every morning he would go to Phil's Coffee in San Francisco at like 5 or 6 in the morning and for the first three hours of the day all he would do would be reply to people's tweets so anytime somebody said about something about product hunt he would reply personally anytime somebody mentioned a cool product he would be like that's awesome do you want to post that on product hunt I gave you access and he would he would manually Brute Force do this in the morning but then he would go and he would go to Fast Company and say hey do you want to cover product hunt and they're like I never heard of it no so he's like damn I really want to get pressed but I can't uh they're not they don't want to talk about product and it's not sexy enough so then instead what he did was he would go to a Fast Company he would say hey I signed up a thousand customers for my side project in a weekend can I tell you how we did it and I wrote this blog post it's already written in this Google doc will you guys run this and as a guest post and then if you go look producton has a bunch of posts that he wrote and so it was like he would get to 100 customers then he would write the post of how he got to 100 customers get that posted somewhere on Indie hackers or whatever that would get him to a thousand then he would go write the post of how I got to a thousand because he's like the generically interesting story people aren't that interested in product hunt but they are interested in how a guy can bootstrap his side hustle to a thousand customers in a week and he did the work for them and he did the work for them and so again it was a no-brainer offer to basically say hey it's written do you want to run this or should I go you know I like fasting update you guys should run this if not I I guess I'll go ask somebody else and that that method I saw was something somebody else did that worked really well all right solid thrill the shill good job you forgot the call to action join shepard.com support shepard.com support shepard.com um all right what's your uh what's your next one okay so my next one I call pissing in the pond and pissing in the pond is as good of a method as it sounds like so what you want to do like you said sounds like a horrible method there's riches and niches similarly what you want to do is not try to boil the ocean bad phrase you want to piss in the pond okay so boiling the is when you go try to get the mass Market to care about what you're doing doesn't really work what you want to do is say all right I'm small anyways to me when I have no customers 10 customers is a big win 100 customers is a a phenomenal win and so where can I go that is small but hyper obsessed and so what we did when we launched our e-commerce brand was we know we knew that there were Facebook groups dedicated to literally like comparing products in our niche these weren't big right they're maybe 5,000 people total and this is like in Facebook you know it's like that's a that's kind of a small overall Facebook group and what we would do is we go there and we would do the Marshall thing just like he did with Shephard we would go tell our story which was why we started this brand so instead of saying buy our product we would say um hey y'all wanted to share my story the ups and downs that's gone over the last six months trying to launch a brand that does this and then we would share like here were some of the UPS we had here were some of the downs we had when we got screwed or we got scammed or we were so naive and people really started rooting for us and you can get people to root for you um and so that's how we for my Ecom Biz we did I think uh 30,000 in month one in in Revenue about I think 28,000 specifically and our ad spend was only maybe 500 or thousand so we did to try ads but most of the the revenue that first month came from this group and this was really good because who those 100 customers are actually matters and if you can get a 100 UND of the hyper obsessed people of a niche to actually give a [ __ ] about you and know about you they are the ones who spread the word they're the ones that other people look to for recommendations and so it's actually quite valuable to go get to go piss in that pond and so you go to that group and the way you do it that's acceptable where you're making the water warmer not uncomfortable is you tell a story of the ups and the Downs you've had trying to build something cool in this space why you started what worked for you what didn't work for you some of the big mistakes you made and people will then root for for you because you're the underdog now let me take you another example of this so I can't believe we even did this business I'm embarrassed to even say this is a business I was doing but in our idea lab we had a hackathon and in the hackathon our our devops guy was like Hey I built this app it's like a four four square was hot at the time this is way back in the day he's like four it's four square for beers and he's like basically every time you drink a beer watch this you scan the label and it checks in that beer and it keeps track of all the different beers you've drank and then everybody's like starts laughing we're like that's awesome man that's cool you know beer who who doesn't love beer and so we were kind of like maybe there's a thing here and actually to this day actually there is a business called untap that does us and there's a there's a version of this for wine we were just the wrong people to start this business similar to the sushi business I made the same mistake again which was you don't even drink beer do you the guy who I drink beer but I'm not like a craft beer off ficado guy who loves to go try new craft beers oh like drinking it you're like ah yes a Miller like this is beautiful brewery tour once and the guy was like smell these Hops and I was like no thanks I don't you guys have french fries exactly I was like can I just drink it I don't care about all this so anyways um we had this app called beer hunt Okay so how do you do it there was a craft beer so it was like where do you get again if you go to the the mass Market Mass Market is like me they don't care about beer enough to care about this product but instead there was a craft beer tasting festival or something like that in San fr Isco we went there and we tried to make a splash this is also the uh what I'll call the booth babes method is how do you actually make a splash at an event and so we weren't hosting this one we were attending and so we dressed up like it was October Fest we dressed up like in our like whatever leader hen and whatever we wore outfits like we were straight from Germany and we came and we created we were like people probably won't just download our app if we say download our app so how do we were you when you did this 23 24 uh um and so we but you know our whole company was was older but we're all there and they were there were down for it which I liked uh you know like our Engineers are doing this and so that um what we did was we created a scavenger hunt for the conference we were like hey here's a little card um if you can mark off all these things at this conference uh we're going to give one person like you know the like whatever some beard dream it was like you know you're going to get a year supply of of craft beer and it was like it didn't even matter what the prize the idea was like people are going to wander around this place anyways they were happy to play the game of like marking things off as they went so we had our branded little scavenger hunt they would do it and at the end we would had a guy standing at the door he would collect them he would give them out and he would collect them and on it they had their email address and so now we had basically I think we had 1400 leads or something from the St 1400 leads of people who are so into craft beer that they will go to this like craft beer like pay money to go to this craft beer tasting festival type thing and so then that those became the first you know whatever 700 customers or 700 people to download our app and they really gave a [ __ ] so that that really cranked the engine to get something started seeing you at a 23y old you at a like fancy Brewery it reminded me of a time one time I told Neville I go Neville I've never been to a strip club or somehow it came up and he was like I'm gonna take you right now and I was like I I don't really want to go to a strip club he's like well you have your flight at 5:00 p.m. there's a shrip club near the airport in Texas it's 2:00 let's go and I don't drink so like it's even worse and we go out to this strip club and I'm so uncomfortable I'm rubbing my hands I don't know what to do with my hands and uh I'm like and like these strippers come up and like touch my shoulders and they're like hey can I get you anything and I was like yeah can I get some ketchup for these fries like the waitresses yeah like and the food was only $6 it was $1 for fries $5 for sandwich I remember texting my wife and I'm like do I how much do I tip because I kind of took up a seat but I didn't do anything it's just like it was the most uncomfortable that I've ever been it's like the first and only time I've ever been to a strip club was two o'clock at the airport in Austin strip club uh just can can I tell you the one time I went to strip club it's it's a incredible story so I've been one time in my life you know maybe 22 years old something like that and we go and it's me people know me so I don't need to describe me but it's my buddy who's like the ladies man this guy like was the Big Man on Campus he you know like your dorm has like an RA he like hooked up with the Ra's girlfriend and it's like that gu a Senor refresh like wow this guy just amazing and so we go with this guy he's the man and then we go with our other buddy um who was like Mr longterm relationship so he's been in a relationship forever and never met never never known this guy not in a relationship but he had just broken up and so we go to a strip club because you know like in Vegas they're like hey boys you want some free drinks get in this limo we're like oh wow what's the cat they drive you like 30 minutes away to a strip club and there now you're here and you have two free drink coupons that you can go at the bar so me and the ladies man we don't know what to do none of us have ever been to strip club so we go to the bar again what do I I'm uncomfortable let me just like find a safety net it's like let's go get a drink yeah yeah yeah drink drink drink that's a good idea and we go and then we turn to look for our friend Mr long Mr always wied up and he's not only not with us he is holding hands with the stripper going into the back room and I'm like it's been less than like two minutes we're like we're like uh we're like what's he doing it's so we had several questions one um I can't like why is he doing this so fast number two why is he going to the back room isn't that like for like the the high tier stuff like why isn't he just sitting here and watching the the Sher and three most importantly was why' he pick her because he had picked just objectively completely scientifically the least attractive stripper in the place and so 15 minutes go by he comes back out and we're I'm like I have a thousand questions what happens in the back room how much does it cost do you have to tip on top of the cost I have so many logistical questions but most importantly why'd you pick her man you could have picked anyone here and he goes oh you could pick what he goes he goes oh he goes he goes I thought it's like Harry Potter the one chooses the wizard to this day the line the one chooses the wizard is like etched in my soul it just applies to any situation and neither of us have been to a strip club since since never been again same can't top that um um all right I'll do one last one uh Trends trends.co we're going to go from shipper to what the Sass yeah sassy to sass yeah um I hope people have made it this far um uh Trends Trends EO was a uh paid research newsletter that I launched when we sold it 18 months after launching it I think it was doing four or 500,000 a month in sales I think we had 20,000 users or so um and it was great whatever I screwed up a bunch of stuff with that but we got some results and the way that we got results is we started and I I did this like I as a little skunk project and if you actually see the link I list to my original gumroad project I made a gumroad page and I think it was like 400 words of me just writing like a story explaining so basically the story was like in 1996 Jeff bezo saw this amazing stat which was that the internet was growing at 2,300 per. nothing grows that fast bezo said unless it's in a Petri disc and immediately then he knew that he had to start an Internet company that sold something um and so that was how it started and then I said hey everyone I'm Sam um I invest in a lot of companies or I and or I have this company called the hustle and I'm able to see a lot of interesting things next quarter I'm launching this product called Trends where I'm going to um break down interesting companies and explain how they works and hopefully identify a handful of Trends as shocking as this Bezos one that he found so you're going to be able to catch the wave instead of Miss it I'm going to charge $300 a year for this but right now you just spend 100 bucks and you get a lifetime of of access and so I got originally I got um a thousand or 2,000 people to sign up for this and I'll explain how but before we even launched this whole project I ran Facebook ads against a this gumroad page and it made $60,000 in pre-sales and the way that I got the initial 100 users is the hustle at the time probably had a million emails and I just found the 300 engaged users and I sent them an email that basically explained this story and linked to the gumroad page um and then what I did was I actually got on the phone with all 100 of them and I asked them why' you do this what are you looking for what what are your expectations and then I went and made the first report based off of like some of their insights and what they wanted and then what we did was people would sign up to the hustle and afterwards they would see a page that says thank you by the way we have something coming soon and would link to this gumroad page now that's a little bit if you're listening to this and you don't have an audience you're like w what the [ __ ] that's not really actionable but I had to share this is how we built like I think it was 400 or 500,000 by month 18 and so it worked and we built the product around just calling those people yeah that's like a you had a Launchpad you had an audience that you had built for years and then you were able to do this and I wouldn't recommend doing that just to launch a product but if you don't really know what product you want to launch it's not a bad idea idea to uh to build a Launchpad along the way so just to recap I did the same thing with Hampton and I would DM people on Twitter and you could say I have an audience so it helps I didn't use my audience but I did use my reputation so some people had known me um so I I but I called emailed people on LinkedIn and I called people on Twitter so if you want to do this methodology you could still do it that way yeah and we didn't mention a couple of the obvious ones so and we kind of loosely mentioned it cold outre there's a bunch of traditional methods to to try to do this we told you what we did which was partly because we were young and dumb and we didn't know any better we didn't know that you could just I didn't know you could just run ads or just do cold emails I would go door to door instead um but also you know it some of it's in the specific so for example from milk Road I had an audience so I had a newsletter I had this podcast and I could have just mentioned it but I layered on another tactic which is what I call the David Blaine method and you know David Blaine will do this [ __ ] where he's like I'm going to freeze myself for a week yeah watch me you know slightly torture myself and try to do something incredible and it's like all right he's like I'm gonna freeze myself in a block of ice I'm gonna bury myself underground I'm GNA hold my breath until I pass out yeah I'm gonna he literally did one where he's like I'm gonna hold on to these balloons and fly away it's like okay dope and he did it he like flew away like the movie up and so he um David bla does this stuff so when we started the milk road I was like okay if I think if I told people that hey I'm starting a daily newsletter about crypto for people that want to read um you know the latest kind of news and info on crypto I think people would sign up but I wanted to like juice it a little bit so how did I go a little bit further I was like let me do a stunt and so I said I am funding and of course you know you have to have some money to do this this version of it but you could really David blae puts his body Through Torture I put some money on the line so what I did was I said I'm gonna put a million dollars in this wallet you can go look at the address right now here's a million dollars in a wallet and then I'm going to try to turn this into 10 million through trading crypto and this is like um you know Dave from bar stool does this with his Dave day trader uh you know Jason calanis tried to copy that and do J Trader like people try to do a version of this where it's like watch me try to run this bankroll up uh I I learned this from back in the poker days I used to love when anyone would do this in the gambling or poker space and they'd be like I'm starting with this bankroll I'm either going broke I'm going to this level I'm get I'm getting to this Milestone and here I'm GNA post all of my history and it never works out but it's really fun to watch and that's what I figured and that's exactly what happened I managed to turn a million dollars because we bought it like you know P crypto into what became like $350,000 at the bottom and then now it's a little bit higher but um basically it's like watch me lose money but either way watch me lose money is also entertaining people will subscribe to watch me get my ass kicked to watch they'll subscribe to watch me kick ass and even better they'll subscribe to find out whether I get my ass kicked or whether I kick ass and the other version of this is people call it now build in public people do that before that buffer and convert kit did this stuff where they would share like all their team salaries they would share all their team's Revenue uh or the company's revenue and it it tends to work I remember this guy named Pat Flynn from Smart passive income he was one of the first guys to do this he would share his monthly revenue and where it all came from and I would go there every month to see like what he was doing and it totally worked the the extreme access works but I think the other one is calling your shot or uh basically creating a a storyline so it's basically like what is a story there's the hero they have a goal and they have an obstacle and then there's some Stakes there's there's something on the line and I think that's the way to like juice that up so it's not just I'm going to build in public so I'll I'll provide a monthly update it's I'm gonna try to do X and if I don't do X you know like there's a there's a like I'm putting something on the line trying to get there and I'm G to try to do this incredible thing not just inch my way forward you know if I said Hey I'm um you know I'll show you you know my you know some of the things I'm investing in that'd be okay but to say I'm going to try to turn a million dollars into 10 million or go bust that people want to watch more and so you know I think the David blae spectacle method is another one I want to see you do that with your second trip to the strip club build in public bro I'm gonna order as much food and free water as I can until they kick me out of the strip club can I make it over or under 6 hours before they realize this guy's just here for the fries all right we got to end there that's the pod [Music]

have you ever heard this explanation of why gossip exists evolutionarily well it's impossible for me to know one by one with each person about their character and their reputation through only firsthand experiences and so how does a tribe function well gossip is actually a necessary thing I should know that if this person's untrustworthy because rumors should spread so that the tribe as a whole becomes almost immune to this charlatan through gossip and so I kind of feel like the same thing exists where these online influencers don't you know they're just trying to sell you something well yeah there's some amount of that but at the same same time what am I going to do go test all my supplements myself we're all going to Outsource that task to somebody and we're going to trust them until they burn our trust and then we're going to move on to the next one it is the efficient way to do things even though it's kind of seen as this low IQ move

what matters is not necessarily what are the best returns that you can earn this year that's what everyone chases but that's not what matters what matters is what are the best returns that you can sustain for the longest period of [Music] time um let's just get right into it Morgan what's going on man I'm happy you're here I'm happy to be here thanks for having me guys I read the book uh your your first big hit psychology of money a while ago was that four years ago about yep yeah and then this new one just came out was it called same as ever that's right yeah man uh and people I the good reads reviews are higher on the re most recent one I think than the first one so congratulations no thanks it's always it's always I think with all books and all articles this probably true for podcast too you really never know what's going to work and what's not and even I I've been a writer for 17 years and I still really don't know when I publish something a blog or a book how it's going to be received and maybe you get a little a little bit better around the edges but it's always like you just have to birth into the world and then and then just step back and watch it's going to do whatever it's going to do well you told me that the first version of psychology of money you said that you the first print run was I think 5,000 copies is that right so you guys you thought you know 5,000 copies is is the right amount you sold over four million now so uh I think that that proves your point of you don't really know till you know uh but that is that number is kind of amazing dude like over four million books sold you are I don't know in the top 0.01% or something of of authors you know that I don't know how much you make per book but I think that means you've made like over $10 million as an author on a successful book that's so hard to do that's so rare and um you know congrats to you for doing that thanks Sean yeah I mean I was telling someone the other day I think the closest analogy to the book industry is probably professional sports where 99.9% of high school basketball players will never make the NBA I don't 99.999 whatever it is um but but then you have a couple of of LeBron James and Michael Jordans who go on to make a billion dollars doing it and I I don't know this to be 100% sure but adding it up in my head I'm pretty sure there are more billionaire authors than there are billionaire athletes even in a world in which 99.9% of books will sell you know a couple thousand copies or or less if that but then you have JK rling and Dave plinky and James Patterson who who have made over a billion dollars writing books so it's just like extremely taal driven in the success I want to ask you about um one of your philosophies because you're very interested to me you have a philosophy it's very easy to sell a philosophy of more right people do that all the time and in fact even our podcast I would say falls into the bucket of the philosophy of more many times when we say no small boy stuff right we're saying think big play Big go for it don't sit around and wait don't don't be fearful right so more more action more ambition more whatever that's that's one philosophy a lot of people fall into and some people go even crazy right David gogins is like work harder Gary ve Alex OSI these guys are like just grind harder so people often have the philosophy of more and some people Marie condo and others have the philosophy of way less you need less minimalism um you know escapism just become a a sort of a a Zen person go uh whatever get those vans and just like travel around the world right so it's like um there's the philosophy of less and you're in the middle which usually is the dead zone for content uh you're in the Middle where you're like no just have enough right like moderation and I can't believe you've got moderation to sell I'm going to read you a quote and then I want you to talk about this so he said more than I want big returns I want to be financially unbreakable if I'm unbreakable I think I'll actually get the biggest returns because I'll be able to stick around long enough for the compounding to work wonders I loved that quote and I in general I find this moderation thing interesting tell me about that this is where like moderation in finance is actually going to lead to the biggest return returns because what matters is not necessarily what are the best returns that you can earn this year that's what everyone chases but that's not what matters what matters is what are the best returns that you can sustain for the longest period of time and so this is why like on an annual basis I am I strive for average returns in my index funds by Design why do I do it because that's going to give me the endurance to hold them for 50 years and if you can earn average returns for 50 years you're going to end up in the top 1% of all investors and you do it with zero effort what's average uh in the in the US Stock Market 6% reel six and a half percent reel after inflation is what's been if you can earn six and a half percent returns after inflation for 50 years it's it I mean you can run the calculations of it it it is it's going to achieve every it's it's dynastic wealth it'll make your great grandchildren wealthy and so that's there and you can do that with zero effort now look past past performance not indicative there's a nuclear war Etc you can come up with all these scenarios in which it's not going to work out you can come up with scenarios in which the economic conditions of the last 100 years are not going to replicate for the next hundred years okay all those aside earning average returns for an above average period of time is way more lucrative than trying to earn Superior returns for a shorter period of time like as always and I think it's so counterintuitive the intuition for everyone including educated professional investors is how do I earn the highest returns this year and like it's like of course it's like how could that be wrong it's like no if you're just average for a long period of time you that's the winner Pimco the big fun they had this phrase that I love they called it strategic mediocrity where in any given year they were never going to be in the top half against their peers but in every decade they'd always be in the top Des aisle because the peers that beat them in any given year get washed out and I think that I think it applies to a lot of things it applies to a lot of businesses it applies to relationships and marriages of like you don't need to be a superhero if you're just good for a long period of time that's how compounding Works its magic our software is the worst have have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better that that thing you just said was excellent I love that so you said I want average returns for an above average number of years rather than Superior returns for a short period of time um or you know I you know I in any given year I'm not trying to be in the top uh I'm trying to be you know sort of 50% but if I do that for 30 years I'll be in the top 10 per. it's so true in the kind of like slow and steady he wins the race I think you had a stat that like if Warren Buffett has I don't know what it is like let's say $85 billion dollars net worth like 81 billion of those 85 came after his 65th birthday right and I think you said something like if if Warren had just retired when he was 60 nobody would even talk about him because the compound like obviously he is a great investor of of course but the whole secret what's literally 99% of his wealth is that he's been a great investor for 80 years that's why he started investing when he was 11 and he's 93 today still going as as as as hard as ever and that's where all the money comes from and yes like so his average returns are are 20% per year which which is phenomenal of course but if you earn 20% per year for 20 years it's it's really good if you're in 20% a year for 40 years it's great if you're ear in 20% a year for 80 years you're worth $100 billion dollars like that that that's where all the Returns come from did you hear this Sam they're giving that shirt away at Buffett's give it away this year at the burar conference just hard as ever still going hard as ever Is that real are you being serious oh be hilarious dude but we joke about war Buffett where he talks about uh you know like uh well I forget the how he phrases it but he talks about like the the you know it's all about the future it's all about the future and we were like dude you're 93 like there is no future like Bale and enjoy life and you could argue like well he's he likes what he does so you know it's cool he's enjoying life but I've always like when I think about long-term stuff I'll like map out my life and I'm like man like if I only live to be 80 I only have you know uh 40 or something Summers left like I don't I don't know if I want to be I'm not willing to pay the price of if that's what's considered great is doing 30 or 20 20% returns for 80 years I'm not willing to pay that price because Life's too short and and when I think about like what it requires to be one of one to be one of the greats that's what freaks me out is I don't want to be that old and not have enjoyed it you know that's why it's like the converse to all this is Bill Perkins book die with zero of like spend it while you're here enjoy it while you're here because when you're gone it's it's pointless you know what I mean yeah yeah now I think I think there's a couple I think I I agree with every word you said particularly for Ordinary People Like Us I do think Buffett's DNA is just he gets more pleasure from anything in life the most pleasure he gets is from compounding there's nothing that makes him happier the other thing is even though he's worth a hundred billion dollars today he's given away a hundred billion already and and with with with the rest of his net worth effect you know go into the bill Ming The Gates Foundation I I imagine I don't know this to be true but I imagine when he when he lays in bed pondering his life he's like I'm I I did I I I put my skill to use and I'm going to give away a quarter of a trillion dollars for the better of society I was just in Omaha a couple months ago where he's lived his entire life and in Downtown Omaha one of the tallest buildings says the Buffett Center for Cancer Research or something like that I imagine when he drives past that and this is the building that he drove past when he was five years old it gives him a ridiculous amount of pride and pleasure and so I actually think if if he were on his deathbed tomorrow Charlie Monger just died last month I think he would look back and say like I I I live the best life that I could have it wasn't Perfect by any means but I I I think there is a difference between the Bill Perkins philosophy which is true for 99% of people and then there's 1% of people who actually get so much pleasure out of compounding and thinking about what that money is going to do to society after they die dude there's this crazy story about Buffett where his daughter had just had a baby and she's living in a [ __ ] apartment and she and uh a mutual friend of Warren and the daughter went it was actually the CEO of Washington Post went to the house and was like Warren her kitchen sucks man and so the daughter eventually goes to Warren and goes hey can I get like a $1,000 Loan in order to redo my kitchen and he was like H just go to the bank and uh so she eventually goes to the bank and then a few months later uh the the CEO of Washington Post goes back to her house and the daughter's sitting in bed but she has a really small TV where she would sit and nurse her child in front of and Washington Post lady goes to Warren she goes Warren give her 500 bucks for a new TV man she could barely see this TV and she's in bed like eight hours a day can you just give her a new TV and waren was like no compounding is more important for that $500 TV I can't I'm not going to to take the money out and so Katherine uh the CEO of Washington Post ended up buying her a $500 TV but that's how like tight this guy was about following his code which I guess I appreciate that someone has a code but that a that ain't my code wait so Warren Buffett's just an [ __ ] is that the store is this a real story because I hate War well yeah so War Buffett gets he gets a pass for having this all Shucks attitude but he's definitely an [ __ ] he's definitely an [ __ ] depending on how you Define [ __ ] I would Define him as a Wonder a what do I say great men are also bad men the way he handled his his family I think was was not wonderful the way he handled business associates was wonderful so you know like it's there's trade-offs to being great I think I think as someone like I have so much respect and admiration and reverence for him but I would also put him in the campus someone who was like I'm so glad he exists but I don't think I would want that for my own life which is not a criticism against his life it's just like to each their own and let's not pretend that everyone should want the life of the five standard deviation success it's like there's a cost to all of that I was just trying to imagine like his daughter just like you know at the bus stop trying to get a bus ride to wherever she's going she looking up at the Buffett cancer research center and just being like God damn it there's there's some other parts of the story Buffett's uh first wife Susie you know had uh billions of dollars of her own and she was much more freeing with with money so I think the the buffet children and they did just fine but yeah there's there's plenty of stories about Warren he always described he was like capital is my tool not going to give like these are the tools of my business this is how I make money I'm not going to be willy-nilly with it and even when Buffett was in his 20s when he was a kid this is back in the 50s he was already worth tens of millions of dollars in the when that was real money in the 50s and you could easily imagine a world in which he's worth the equivalent of a hundred million when he's 30 years old or whatever it was and everyone be like dude you need to give all this away you're never going to be able to spend this and his philosophy was like his philosophy has always been people in the future will be just as needy as people are today day so if I have an above aage ability to compound it it actually makes sense for me to hold on to this money for as long as I can before I give it away which I think is actually pretty rational you you said a few things that I thought were um contradictory in in different interviews that I watched the and I think in the book I forget I'm mixing up the book and interviews that I watch but you talk about financial goals and you're like I don't look at I don't look at my portfolio um I I think you said I don't set goals or at least that's the vibe that I got in an interview but then I've also read a little bit where you do have some type of goals um so for for financial goals do you like have a number in your oh sorry I remember what it was you said whenever you hit your goal you're always going to double it therefore I don't have goals I think that's what you said H it's such a the the the reason it's hard for me to answer that is I'm sure I've said things that are contradictory because I like everyone else it's like it depends depends I'm not trying to call you out no no no depends on I'm probably the the mood that I'm in that day do I if I'm sitting here today and I think do my wife and I have financial goals not really it's not like oh we're trying to hit X and once we hit X we're going to go by y like not really but I like everyone else think about like oh if my income stays the same we'll have this much money what kind of life could we live with that much money and one thing too like we have two young kids and we are pretty hellbent on not spoiling them they live an amazing life and we live in a great house they'll have a great education they'll live the top 0 one% of lives but we don't want to raise spoiled little pricks and because of that we off we often we have goals it's not like oh how can we buy a a bigger house another house nicer cars it's kind of like we want to live a good but not extravagant life because we don't want to spoil our kids but like even that sometimes like I can talk to other people who are like no actually you can live the big high life without spoiling your kids here's how to do it so I I I feel like I say like I think a lot of the contradictions come from humility of just like I I I haven't really figured it out yet for myself I tend to not have goals for years I had a goal of once my net worth is X I'm not going to work much anymore because I could easily live for the rest of my life off of that net worth and I've exceeded that number and I'm working I'm working harder than ever but I don't I don't regret that at all maybe that is some version of moving the goalpost but I think more of it is after I hit some level of financial Independence after I wrote books it was like okay I'm only going to do the work that I enjoy now and it's not really work it's just like I really enjoy writing these books I only speak at conferences that in cities that I want to go to it doesn't feel like work and I I don't think I really understood that 10 years ago 10 years ago work was by and large a means to an ends I need to do this to feed my family and now that I've reached kind of the artistic level I'm like oh I want to keep doing this forever and in that world goals kind of go out the window well we've like interviewed a bunch of I mean we've had we have a bunch of wealthy friends we've had a bunch of people on here um you're like a financial historian so you've like read about all these people you also know a lot of them and you've written about them and you probably run in even a more Elite Circle than we do but a question that I've always wondered is is there a threshold where I'm not going to worry anymore so far I've not found that threshold and we had Scott Galloway on here recently and he was like I'm worth like over 100 million liquid and I still freak out have you found any type of thresholds to where the average person changes where they feel more relief I don't know I don't know if the average person I can tell you myself though that number that I was talking about before where for years it was like once I hit this number I'm not going to work anymore once I hit that number I still can you say that number I I don't know I don't know if I want to get too too into DET maybe I'll tell you off camera it's not it's not it's not a ridiculous at it CU some people don't know how what how should I think about what that number is for me for example I was like oh if my life annual burn rate was X and I wanted a certain amount of money where you know 4% or 5% withdrawals of that uh would mean I'm sort of setting neutral let's assume I'm getting 6% real returns in the market if I was to withdraw 4% out to pay for lifestyle uh you know that that number of the bank account is never going to go down it's only going to go up uh that's how exactly how I calculated years ago Sean you said yours was six million but if I had to guess that has changed as you've had a family uh yeah no to be honest can I say the honest answer is kind of ridiculous sounding but like it's not that oh I had kids and oh man I really underes these diapers are expensive that's not actually what happened I literally I remember one day I was like okay so I've done this I was like I kind of feel like a guy who should have $100 million and with I was like I think I'm I think I'm worth that I think I should be like you know I don't have to have it but like if I didn't have it something would feel a miss something would feel a little wrong and uh then I was like okay cool I think I should do that it didn't become my like North Star of like I'm gonna do this but what I did do was I made sure that I would only um I would only work on things that either I was doing purely for the joy of it it it didn't have to bring in any dollars or if I was doing it because I thought it was going to be financially rewarding the financial reward had to be big enough enough to make it to be like on that path not a path not a smaller path yeah do like I I came up with my number exactly as you did Sean it was like if I have a 4% withdrawal rate what is the annual income that I know is going to be like easily comfortably all that we're ever going to want to spend and like I just backed into the number and Sam to answer your question of like once I hit that level a I I kept working as I am now and I don't think I was any happier but I had a I have less Financial stress less career stress because happiness dude that's happiness such a cop out I hate when people say money doesn't make you happier but it just gets rid of mddy problems and I'm like yeah when I worried about rent I was unhappy now I don't I'm more happy I'm not necessarily happy but I'm happier I I think like I think we we probably agree this is like arguing over the definition of words but I would say there's a big difference between happiness and a reduction of anxiety I think those are very different things happiness is is like you wake up grinning ear to ear or it's like if you're watching the funniest comedy you've ever seen and you're just like laughing on the floor that's a happy moment but it's always fleeing but to me the reduction of anxiety or contentment that is something that money can buy and that is worth chasing it's great so like when people say money can't buy happiness what they're implicitly saying is it's not worth chasing I think it absolutely is worth chasing but it's not going to give you happiness per se it's going to give you contentment and reduction of anxiety which is wonderful it's a massive increase in the quality of your life but in my definition it's not necessarily happiness but I I I I feel like I hit that I feel like I'm my my wife and I were talking about this last night I feel like I'm in a better mental state of like less anxiety than I've had relative to you know five or 10 years ago which is great you know you wrote the psychology of money um you've studied this a lot I want to ask you what what are the most what are the biggest or maybe the most common leak instead of uh most common I would say the most impactful uh psychological leak meaning a way a TR a psychological trap or mistake people make around money and I want you to answer it for somebody who is kind of on the come up so somebody who isn't totally financially independent yet and then for rich people who still have a bunch of weird psychology and Rel weird relationship with money I want you to tell me what you've seen or what you believe is kind of maybe the biggest M psychological mistake people have around money in each of those buckets I think there's there's two I'll start with one that's probably the biggest which is social comparison which is always Sean just mentioned you know you want to be a guy you should be a guy with $100 million I'm willing to bet if you told 17-year-old sea that figure you would faint but it doesn't seem that ridiculous to you now because I bet you know people who are worth $100 million and so who you compared yourself to when you were 17 or 25 is different now and I think there's no end to that if and I hope you are worth a hundred million doll someday I guarantee you you're going to start comparing yourself to people who are worth 200 500 a billion and that never ends never ever ends the point I always make is like the the minimum wage in um in the MLB is like 500,000 a year whatever it is 400 what what whatever it is a shitload of money by any definition if you're making half a million dollars a year and I guarantee you there's not a single minimum wage professional baseball player who thinks they're doing well because they're comparing themselves to their teammates who are making 10 million a year and so there's no end to that but you always think there is which is why I for myself had this idea once my net worth is X I'm never going to work ever again but once now that I'm here maybe it is because I'm comparing myself to other people other authors maybe that's at least part of it so I think even if I can write these philosophies and made a Liv in talking about these like I'm still susceptible to that as as anyone else I think everybody is so I think it's such a natural thing I mean in all of evolution what matters is not how much success you have it matters that you have more success than the other person because in a competition for resources that's all that matters doesn't matter if you're worth a billion dollars if somebody else is worth a billion in one they have more resources in you and from an evolutionary perspective they're going to win and you're going to lose so that like always chasing no matter how much you have is is a big psychological underpinning to people's anxiety the second that I would mention that's that's probably equally as important is realizing that there is not one right answer for everybody and everyone in finance is always sing is seeking the right answer like quote unquote the right it doesn't exist I think it's much closer to like your taste in music of like there's no such thing as the best music you like this I like that to each their own and a lot of times when you have a financial debate of people are like I can't believe manage your money like that why don't you do it like me you're not actually debating it's people with a different risk tolerance different social aspirations different family Dynamics who are talking over each other and I think it's like it's hard for people to come to terms of like look that works for you this works for me to each our own people don't want to settle on that because it's easier to think that there should be a right answer like there is in math you uh you had this quote I think it was from the book but it could have been from the a blog post that he wrote where he said the biggest risk and important news story of the next 10 years will be something nobody is talking about today and but you're in this weird position where you work at a VC where you actually do have to predict the future a bit or at least you're around people who are trying to predict the future what do you think are there any Trends or topics today that you think in 10 years are going to be a lot more common and popular well the good the good news for me is that since I'm not involved in the the deal side of the VC that it doesn't really rest on my shoulders to make those predictions of the risk that we know of which is like obviously very distinct from the surprises that are going to be more important but of the risk that we know of i' I've been saying for years that the biggest um by far in the global economy is is demographics the terrible demographics that almost the entire industrialized world has outside of India and Africa almost the entire world is shrinking population wise and the based economies China Japan all of Europe are are shrinking very very fast China's working age population age 16 to 64 will decline by 200 million people between now and 2050 it's just like there's no precedent outside of like the black death plague there's no precedent for that in all of human history it's always been the case that economic growth was driven by the fact that there was massive population uh growth and we just don't have it anymore and in the United States we have about the best demographics relative to our peers but it's still way less than we've had for the last years and all economic growth is either population growth or productivity growth all economic growth comes from those two things and so when you take half the equation of economic growth and for the last 100 years it's been really good and now it's at best poor if not a headwind it's a very different world totally different world and maybe like the takeaway from that is it used to be that 4% economic growth was like oh good you're running at full capacity now maybe it's 2% just because we've taken away so much of that so of the of the things that we know are going to be a risk that's probably the most prominent can you explain that one a little more I've heard Elon talk about this too that like uh you know the big risk is that we're not having enough babies and at first I thought he was just saying it to cover his ass because he was like you know knocking everyone up but then I no no he's serious about this he actually believes this to be true uh but I don't fully get it uh I'm maybe just kind of dumb about this so maybe just explain like I'm a I'm a 5-year-old so uh if economic growth goes down but the population shrinks is it kind of like isn't there kind of like a per capita type of thing where it's like yes what's the big deal like why why is that disastrous if uh if economic productivity slows down if there's also less less people to Shar you the pie shrinks but there's less people eating pie um does that matter or is that the wrong way to think about it why is it I think it's it's not the wrong way to think about it because you could look at Japan for the last 30 years which Japan for the last 30 years has had abysmal demographics but I think it's safe to say that by and large it's been a fairly Pleasant place to live it does not led to economic collapse but their their their their version of an index has been [ __ ] yeah from a money perspective yes that's a slightly different topic because the reason it's been [ __ ] is because it was so preposterously overvalued in 1990 got it um so that's like the two two separate different stories but by and large it has not led to economic collapse the one thing I would say though is like what it does lead to is when you don't have a growing economy you have much less investment you're not investing in new businesses new homes new factories because you don't need them you're fine with what you have whenever you have less investment you have less Innovation and so in those situations like when was the last incredible tech company to come out of Japan I I I'm sure I'm sure one or two exist but I can't name it off the top of my head versus if you if if you and I were talking in 1990 and we said what was the last tech company we'd be like oh my gosh Sony Toshiba going like mitsub going down the list they're everywhere because when Japan had a booming population it was investment up the yinyang of like new technologies and so when you once you remove that from the equation you can still have a pleasant Society that's in some form of stasis but you're not going to have growth not just economic growth but techn technology growth Medical Technology growth like all the things that we associate with like a better life kind of grows out the window so maybe is the case that for a lot of the developed world over the next 50 years it's still a pleasant place to live but the idea of like every generation is going to live 30% better than their parents like that idea might kind of go out the window uh Sam just asked you about like Trends or prediction like what what what is going to come in the future but actually your your new book is actually about the opposite it's about what's not going to change same as ever right so y can you explain the premise of the book I like the buffet story that you kind of lead with maybe start with that one but uh give us the the teaser of like what are some of the the like I buy the premise that some things don't change um what are some of the big Sil whats that come out of that but start with the Buffett story yeah so I had lunch last summer maybe two summers ago with a guy who is very close friends with Warren Buffett and uh this guy was driving around with Buffett in 2009 in Buffett's car in Omaha they're just driving around town together in 2009 the economy was a wreck and there's like businesses boarded up and it was like the economic apocalypse and this guy says Warren like how do we ever recover from this like how how's the world ever going to be the same and Warren said do you know what the best selling candy bar was in 1962 gu said no Warren Buffett Warren says Snickers and Buffett says you know what the best selling candy bar is today guy says no he says Snickers and that's that's the end of the story the premise being like don't worry about like how are we going to change like find something that does not change and bet on that and I've often thought I've been a a financial writer for 17 years and it's always bothered me how bad the whole industry is at predicting the next bar Market the next recession the next pandemic the next technology nobody's any good at it that's like a little bit too harsh but that's that's directionally true nobody's any good at it and so there's two things you can do with that one you could become more of a cynic and just say nobody knows anything don't even try or kind of the buffet approach of like find something that is never going to change and put your weight on that and so that was one observation the other was as a student of History realizing when you're reading about the economy from a hundred years ago or 500 years ago or a thousand years ago there's some things that you read about and you're like oh things were very different back then but there are even more things that you can read that make you stop and think that's exactly how it is today the way that people responded to Greed and fear and risk and uncertainty is the exact same today as it was a 100 years ago and so putting those two things together if you can find things of human behavior that are never going to change then you know something that is going to be part of your future so stop pretending that you know when the next recession is going to happen but study how people respond to recessions when they do happen because that's never changeed so it's going to be part of our future and so that's kind of the premise of the book it's just a bunch of little stories of things that facets of human behavior that have always been with us and I think always will be and you like regardless of what is going to happen in our future you know that these little bits of behavior are going to be a part of it and so what's something where when you studied how people let's say respond to Greed or fear or change or whatever and you looked at these patterns of human behavior what's something that you like the best research or books or insights that I get I'm like oh I feel like I have a superpower like you know almost like I could read people's minds now right so it sounds like by studying what doesn't change or how how human behavior Works did you come out with anything that you're like did you change anything that you do or did you have a new strategy or a new plan or any new like um could you action that uh cuz I you know I guess my my skeptical view would be I feel like I could understand how people behaved in the past but attaching that to what the hell am I supposed to do today is is not so easy of a leap what's one that you made yourself doing this I know this is an answer that people will find inadequate but to me it's it's incredibly powerful and important and I think the main plea in the book is for humility it's not even about the the examples that of things that are never going to change that's obviously the core of the book but the reason we're doing that is because we have humility and not fooling ourselves to thinking that we know what's going to change what are the three biggest economic stories of our adult lives by far by an order of magnitude it's September 11th Leeman Brothers collapsing and covid like by an order of magnitude Nothing Else Matters more than those three things and the common denominator is nobody saw them coming they're not in any economic Outlook no analyst forecast unless you were had inside information you were part of those things nobody saw them coming and it's always been like that because you can go back another generation and it was Pearl Harbor collapse of the Soviet Union all these things that even if in hindsight you're like oh you you should have seen those coming Great Depression of course the fact is that very few people did if anybody and something like Pearl Harbor you could not have seen it coming but think about how that changed the entire fabric of society not just the economy but everything and going forward it will be like that too you can state with so much certainty that the biggest economic story of our lifetimes in the future or or even the next 12 months is something that you and I are not talking about today I mean what what's the biggest global news story of 2023 this is this is subjective but I would say it's Israel Hamas which is something that even if you were an expert in Middle East politics you did not see coming on October 6 to let alone people like us so that's and I think it's it's always been like that it'll be like that next year and the reason that we that view like we we tend to ignore that is because I think coming to terms with it is too painful coming to terms with the AA and admitting to yourself that we don't know what's going to happen next is a really uncomfortable level of uncertainty it's much easier and more comfortable to just say to pretend that we do which is why the market for punditry is always going to exist no matter how poor the results are and so I think that's the biggest actionable takeaway for me is I I I don't forecast I I think I think it's much healthier to read more history and fewer forecasts and when you read history you start focusing on the indelible behaviors that never change and you become more humble in your ability to fool yourself into thinking that we do know is what is going to change Morgan I know you got to leave you got have a hard stop in two minutes so let me I want to ask a a very takeaway or in actionable question which is what two or three or four however many want history books can I go and read over the next month that do the best job of me not not a book like yours that Aggregates a bunch of them but literally a specific era or a specific book that I can go and read that does a good job of of showing this where I'll read it and I'll be like oh this is exactly what I'm experiencing now or things won't change I think one of the best World War II books because it's not only a book about the military operations but also the human element on the ground is Eric larsson's book The Splendid in the vial which is a pretty recent book I think it came out four years ago and it's about the London Blitz bombing in World War II Eric Larsson I think is the greatest living Storyteller period and he's so good his book on the Lucitania is wonderful it's absolutely epic so so that book is is is incredible Doris Kern's Goodwin's book no ordinary time which is about how FDR managed World War II it's not about the war itself it's about how he managed the politics and the emotions of it is absolutely stunning I also use that book as an example of I think the book is 700 pages and every single word needs to be there there's not a single wasted word in the 700 Pages it's she's just like such an extraordinary writer those are two that really stick out as like some of the best and you're doing an excellent job of giving Into The Stereotype of 30 or 40 something year old white guys obsessing over World War II what we're supposed to do yeah everyone talks about the Roman Empire [ __ ] the Roman Empire World War II that's where it's at man it's it's so true I I Can't Get Enough it I will say the last thing I say because I do have to jump I I I think the reason World War II is so interesting is because it was the most documented major event and therefore like the emotion the emotions on either end of the spectrum from despair to Elation are there's more documented examples of that during that six-year period than have ever existed in all of human history so it's not just understanding the military and the politics it's like if you want to understand human emotions there's no better Spotlight or magnifying glass than studying World War II well we appreciate you coming on man this is awesome um we're big fans of your first book I I know I'm in the middle of reading the second one same as ever and uh you're badass we appreciate you doing this thanks guys this has been fun thanks Morgan all right that's the pod [Music]

all right now we're ready for part two of the Millie Awards we've got a bunch of categories like breakout company or product of the year the who is the craziest SL most delusional person we met this year uh as well as things like our favorite content books podcasts that we consumed what is the best of the best and U one of my favorites is unsexy business of the year so what's a business that on the surface looks maybe boring or it flies under the radar but actually secretly crushes it we each share our own so enjoy part two of the Millie Awards [Music] all right next category that we have is the craziest most delusional person that you met this year so somebody who is kind of out there they broke your frame a little bit and it could be good delusional crazy it could be bad delusional crazy there's this is just saying this person thinks way differently than you and uh and there there are bit like they're living in their own world and so um this was a tough one for me I was a tough category Sam who did you have so the easy one was Elon Musk do you guys we already forgot about how Elon and Zuck almost got in a fight that was hilarious I think elon's insane but I didn't want to pick him because that's too easy so I chose this guy named Val who I've met via Hampton you probably have seen him on Twitter his name's uh so like basically Val was under the radar for years and years I mean he's probably 45 years old so he just started using Twitter but he built a bunch of businesses he was a Soviet Union uh immigrant came here to America age 19 built a business that made $10 million in profit in year one I started hanging out with him and now he's got this massive set of businesses that probably do like $150 or $200 million a year in Revenue that he owns he's never raised money for any of them I invested in right when I met him I invested into one of his real estate deals and he was new to it and I got a great return and so I did another one with him and I started talking to him and he's like yeah we own this many tens of millions of dollars of Brooklyn real estate and I was like Val what the hell how'd you figure out how to do this he goes well I just did the math and I did this and I did this and he was so logical and yet so calm about it and he was comfortable with the wrist so I got to give love to Val and here's a fun fact about him I started talking to him even more he wakes up at 4:00 am and he starts working at 3M and basically works until 4: am and that's his life and I'm like there's so many reasons why that's bad and he was calmly just saying like yeah but it works for me and he's got five kids I love people that got tons of kids so this guy's the best he seems like a good dad a good husband but he does crazy business stuff just absolutely crazy but he's so calm about it so he's one of the craziest people that I've ever met Andrew you wantan to go next sure so I actually struggled um I think I said Brian Johnson he was the person that comes to mind uh he really really nice interesting guy but definitely crazy all the health stuff he's doing Elon Musk is another obvious answer but I actually couldn't think of somebody that was crazy and so I actually inverted it I said who is the sest calest most most boring person and Chris and I got to meet Michael Dell this year and Michael Dell is worth $65 billion that's insane and we sat down with him I'm I'm going like okay I'm gonna crack this guy open right like you read his book it's all very tame his public Persona is very like you know serious and calm and nice and all that kind of stuff his his book is literally called play nice but win and so me and Chris we go into this office you know sorry go ahead so so we go into this this huge gray like Office Park we're in this boardroom and he sits down with us and Chris and I just walked away we were like oh my God he's like the C I Can't Believe It's Not Butter of billionaires like he's just like steady yeed super nice and we're asking him we're like dude what do you do with your money like you know have you gone like have you you know do you own 20 houses do you own you know a bunch of planes do you do anything crazy and he's like nope I just love you know operating my business and uh growing it over time I own two nice I think he owns two nice or three nice houses obviously they're very very nice houses one plane and that was it we couldn't get anything out of them and he told us this anecdote this is how much of a baller he is he goes yeah so uh about 20 years ago I took 200 million and I started a family office and in the family office I wanted to make like a 10% return and so I hired these really smart guys and they started doing private credit and I don't know if you guys know that is but usually it's um lending to people that the bank will lend to so it's higher risk uh lending and one of the people he lent to was a I think a billionaire who owned a hockey team I think in Dallas or something when when you were saying that I just I was thinking of like your cousin Dom down the street who's like G to go buy like a rookie LeBron card and flip it I guess totally so so he goes he goes yeah and then one day I just got a call and uh they said well you own the Dallas Stars now I think it was the Dallas Stars but some professional sports team and he had just literally just owned it because he had lent the guy money and the guy defaulted like that's how much of a baller Michael Dell is dude he totally sfed your ass he Elizabeth homes you I bet you Michael Dell is just basement dude the basement's got something crazy in it this guy is lying to you Michael Dell is in order to get there Andrew you know more than me but in order to get there you have to be the sharkiest of all sharks I don't I don't agree with that what there is no I think you have to be you have to be very aggressive but I do think you can you can be a you have if you have to be a wacko right you have to go you have to be a maniac you have to go extreme but I think you could be nice I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better dude have you ever used a Dell computer a Dell computer is the technology equivalent of what you just described it's like the uh the most Can't Believe It's Not Butter of computers that that by the way I don't even know what that analogy means but I it just made sense when he when he said it it's kind of an insult I think right no it's like he's just like he's straightforward you know it's it's like saying someone is a you know they're the missionary position of of lending and it's like exactly did you just diss me it's like no missionary is great everybody loves it right and it's like yeah but you don't want to be called missionary he's the dad jeans of billionaires uh Sean what's your's like nicest guy ever yeah right dude no I swear to God right when you walked out the room he was probably here's how I know here's how I know you can always tell whether someone's like a psycho or scary based on how their employees talk about them right their employees love him they gosh about him they're he's so nice he was so respectful to everyone someone came in and brought water to him he looked him in the eye and said their name and said thank you like he is a nice guy the profound story you just told that was amazing I thought that was going to be something crazy what your shot all right um so this was kind of tough but then I realized I had an answer so I did a call the other day with a guy Ben was like you got to meet this guy I met him at a brunch and Ben's thing is he always says this guy's got the juice I was like he got the juice he goes this guy's overflowing with the juice I was like all right I got to meet this guy so get on a call you don't seem like a brunch guy what were you doing I wasn't at the brunch Ben was at the brunch so you know like in when people used to fight back in the day and they'd be like I nominate my second to fight for me that's Ben Ben does all the fighting he gets out in the real order and meets people so anyways he uh he's like you gotta be this guy we get on a call and the guy's like he starts talking and immediately I love him why because I love the Middle Eastern accent anyone who's like Persian Iranian my friend they like oh my God I love like they could tell me any story they could tell me that same Michael Dell story and I would have felt like it's an HBO documentary like it's so good to me so anyways he he's got the accent point one point two he goes love your podcast look look I have a podcast too he holds up these headphones he goes me and my wife we get high and then we record it and I was like okay all right and then he's like that's just how we started we hadn't even said anything yet he's like um I'm like so what do you work on and he's like I uh he's like American food is [ __ ] and I'm like I think I agree but okay where you coming from with this and he's like I um he's like I'm a super smart guy sold my last company decided I he's like I went back to Turkey where I'm from and I ate a banana and I was like this is what food is supposed to taste like so he's like I realize I can use AI to grow better crops like I can literally grow better food uh if I take everything in machine learning he's like I trained a data set on all like scientific papers I scraped all the scientific papers from like the journals and I trained a g version of GPT only on that and I tried to figure out what could I do to get more minerals in the soil so that American food which is like it's the same food it's a banana but it tastes bad and it doesn't it doesn't taste like as rich as it does in other places and it's like deficient in all these minerals and so he's like I'm gonna um grow more mineral rich food he's like I have the best he's like you like dried berries and I was like I kind of love dried berries to be honest with you and he's like I'm going to send you dried berries right now he's like these are the best berries had and he's like one serving of this is 60% of your daily vitamin C intake and I have like we buy Whole Foods whatever you go look at that it'll be like 5% like it's like nothing and he's like no no this is 60% and he's like uh we grow it without soil and I'm like I don't even understand what that means but okay he sends me these berries my kids are obsessed with them they taste so goddamn good and I'm like you know getting all these minerals so I'm like this guy actually might not be full of [ __ ] um then he's like I'm like okay what's uh is that like your main thing he's like yeah it's that he's like but I also love to give back he's like you know I immigrated here it really changed my life he's like so I'm going to bring 10,000 Turkish Engineers to America engineers and lawyers and I was like what he's like yeah my business plan is I'm G to bring 10,000 engineers and 10,000 lawyers to America from turkey and for those people in Turkey it's going to change their life and for America you're G to get high you know super smart Talent that's going to come here and work um and I was like how why is that your goal and how do you even do that and he's like basically figured out an entire like by the book way to get people visas systematically and programmatically um and he's like and he created a model where he's like basically he he brings you over and you have a little income share so you're going to start making 100K plus a year um as a lawyer or or an engineer he takes the income share of that he invests it and bringing the next engineer over he's like I basically have to fund 10 of these guys if I fund 10 I can get to 10,000 and I was like this guy is thinking on a totally different wavelength the way he worked out this this plan I thought was great his overall energy was great and he was not just working differently than most people are thinking differently he just worked on different things than anybody I know like I don't know anyone that's trying to grow like mineral Rich berries and bring 10,000 people immigrants into the country like that's what this guy's game plan was by the way I gotta share you share with you guys a funny conversation I had I shared it with Sean and I'll and I'll read it here but basically uh I didn't want to bring this guy up because I've talked about him so much and I get made fun of but I invested in this guy this guy's company named Brett Adcock he's like my my I have a man crush on him and he's got this robot company and he sent me a picture of like the robots and how they're like moving and it's amazing and uh I was like wow that's amazing you've done all this stuff in 18 months and uh you've not raised a lot of money is this like a business that you can like not raise a lot of money for and you can uh own a lot of it and his response is a perfect example of why crazy people exist and how I'm just absolutely not one of them he says well this is for btim well it's going to cost a little under a trillion dollars to ship 10 billion robots so I don't think it'll work without raising uh and I was like yeah [ __ ] me right like what do I know uh I'm gonna go tweet I'll be BRB basically to this guy's building AI robots and you you asked him the equivalent of like hey have you thought about just doing a newsletter about it instead you're like do you think you could just bootstrap this and not raise any money he's like I need a trillion dollars I felt like such a little [ __ ] when he said that I was like yeah yeah you're you're right um all right what about best and worst Investments for the year yeah this is my favorite category uh Andrew you've had the best stories in this I think you have the most you're the probably the most prolific investor that comes on this pod so can you give us yours give us your best and worst so um yeah my best was I I was in New Zealand I've been working on getting my New Zealand citizenship for the last two years years or so and so I had this yeah yeah they have this um there's this as part of the program there's this mandatory conference that I had to go to and I was absolutely dreading it I'd been traveling a whole bunch but I I you know I got go I had to go and I was thinking about it and going okay well who do I know in Auckland New Zealand and I realized I'd met this guy Matt Buchanan about 10 years ago at South by Southwest he ran an uh design agency at the time and he had started this website called letterbox do you guys know what letter box is yeah it's like a movie thing what is it so social network for film Buffs and it started out really really small it was just like you know hundreds of people at first just discussing films um and then over time and especially over covid it grown like crazy and so Matt and I met up for coffee and uh I just asked him about you know how everything was going I I wasn't at all thinking about investing or buying it and he started telling me that they had 10 million registered users that had grown like crazy and at the end of the coffee I literally just blurred it out do you want to sell and he was like well I hadn't really even thought about that uh and I was like throw me the craziest number you can think of and so he threw the number out and I said okay and I sent him an offer within 48 hours and we just bought that business we didn't buy all of it we bought I think 60% of it uh about three months ago did you buy it for the number he said uh yeah the valuation I think I think it worked out to about $60 million valuation something like that and there was three guys yeah no it was about I think there's about 10 10 or so employees all in New Zealand so totally bootstrapped uh new zealand-based um designer and developer started it like incredible business they're going to keep running it but um it's it's an example of you know we bought a business called dribble about eight years ago uh which is a social network and social networks are just incredible businesses I call them like airports you know if you own the airport you can put a you can you've got this group of people that's going to congregate there uh on a consistent schedule and you can sell them you know all sorts of stuff you can sell them a book you can sell them a hot dog you can sell them a massage and as long as you don't mess with them uh and you keep the community happy um you know you can do some incredible stuff so I'm uh I'm super excited about that dude this is your in for uh for Zuck you can go back to Zuck hey Mark uh I told you it was a good idea social Network owner sh you got one I got two but who's counting uh happy to meet I finally got my end yeah you guys can start your own little Facebook group of social media own yeah social media owners and your best one last year was girl boss your worst one last year was venture capital in general what's your worst one this year so my worst one this year it was an investment I made about five years ago and it's a great example of shiny object syndrome uh lack of focus and what I call money bonfire so I bought a podcast player called Castro about five years ago and at the time I was really hopped up about um podcasts and subscription podcasting and uh you was around the time I started coming on MFM actually and I bought the business because I was excited about the space not because I had a plan and so the business basically um just languished the founders left um I couldn't find anyone uh you know we couldn't find the right person to run it and just every month I you know I I think I bought it for a million bucks and it just lost 10 to 20K a month and it was a small enough number that blended into all my other stuff I just didn't really notice it it wasn't like an urgent thing and so this tiny little Ember turned into a money bonfire and so I think I lost $2 million or something over the last five years on this business um and now I'm in the process of selling it but anyone want it good if you too would like a money Bond maybe maybe someone who wants to get into podcasting um but anyway it is it is one of those things where uh I've done this so many times where I start something and it's a runaway train and I just don't get the right people in and it just slowly Burns money dude unless you're like a huberman or or you know host like us I think podcasting could be good I think podcasting as like Venture Capital companies mostly is [ __ ] it's a very hard business I think to build tools for we get pitched all the time on like people who are trying to make podcasts more discoverable or this or that it's a hard business that's a hard industry yeah yeah 100% uh Sam what you got best and worst investment of the Year all right uh I don't remember what I what did I say last year for best do you know did it say so um tell me that in a second but all right my best investment man one weekend I was talking to my wife I was like Hey we're gonna have kids one day uh do you want to keep working or what do you want to do and she was kind of telling me and I was like well I'll tell you what to make your decision a little bit easier I've got this idea for a little copywriting thing I'm just going to put it together because it's fun and it's how I taught my team how to write and it's how I learned how to write I'm just going to do this for fun and if it works maybe one day you'll want to quit your job and run this turns out she doesn't want to but I made it anyway yeah so it didn't work now I run this yeah so I made this thing called copy that.com it I just did it for fun I did it over the weekend and that one little thing that I made it pays for my living expenses um I I I don't really do much for it I don't do anything for it and it pays for my living expenses and and for some reason like some of my other things like this podcast or um Hampton like when things get a little bit bigger you can't really deviate or move quickly and I just use this and and also I have Partners so I've got like Sean's my partner in this podcast and then with Hampton I have a business partner and I've got customers and things like that I can't really do what I want all the time just like on a whim and so I used this as like a little bit of of a playground to do whatever the hell I want and it's been fun and so really enjoyed it my worst investment so so far Sean I've invested about a million dollars into companies via Angel Investing I have seen not $1 doll back since I started doing it in 2016 I've got a lot of markups that that $1 million is maybe worth $5 million on paper but paper don't pay my mortgage at least not this type of paper and uh I it's pissed me off because I knew what it was going into it and I just don't like having to have the patience or not having any involvement and so that's probably been my worst so far I don't think it's going to be worse in terms of Roi but I think it's worse in terms of I just don't enjoy it you know what's interesting is I've Got a Friend um he's an angel investor and he sold his company like you and he said I've always wanted to be an angel investor and so he invested in um five companies and two of them paid him back 10x within two years and so he learned the wrong lesson lesson right because that's not most people's experience then he doubled down on Angel Investing For 5 years didn't see a single return for 10 years and so I think it's like anything if you try something the first time and it it gives you a win you love it like I guarantee you if you have already gotten $2 million back awesome you'd be like I love Angel Investing it's the best right but what you've really done is you've gone into the casino and gambled maybe with like a slight Edge but you're really gambling and I I feel the exact same way I have barely seen any money back have you seen any money back Andrew yeah I have but it took 12 years for the first one well was it significant uh yeah so I put in 75 grand into a business um and I got 800 Grand back and then I put uh 250,000 into one and I got three million back but I also over the next period invested like 20 or $30 million in the Venture so so it canceled out all the other gains and it it all comes down to like when you're investing the you know the uh the year you're investing right if you invest in 2020 and 2021 like it's just everything's out the window yeah well we'll see Sean have you seen any money that's the year I started my rolling fund um here which is ironic actually the first the first batch of Investments we did were uh so far are the highest performers the first like six Investments we did were the were the best batch um which is kind of interesting well you've picked a handful of winners I know a few that you've picked and you've got a couple really really you don't get the you don't get liquidity until if it's a winner it's going to run for 10 years right so it's not a good thing to do if you need cash you know today which is like you yeah I've got I've got winners I mean it's gon to be good it's just boring just lame well okay my best and worst investment all right so my best I had a couple more interesting examples but I'm just going to say the one that's actually the best so the truthful answer is clearly hands down Shephard um so I had this idea mostly inspired by you Andrew which was wow this guy does really well and he doesn't have to start and invent the next big thing so you know you buy businesses that already are working and then maybe already have a Tailwind so they're going to just keep working at a greater rate in the future like when you got into like the say the the Shopify ecosystem with with wec Commerce I was like oh that makes sense to me buy something that's already working that has a tailwind and hopefully you can accelerate it or make it work better but even if you don't you can still make good money if you buy at the right price and we got like a basically like it's a crazy result so far out of the shepher deal so had this idea which was let me find a product that I use that I like that I kind of believe in of a business that's already working Shephard fit the bill Buy in We Buy in this case a minority stake not a majority stake so that uh Marshall would keep operating the thing um and keep growing it the Tailwinds were were behind us basically first it was covid so people went remote that was one big Tailwind second Tailwind was when the economy started to slow down over the last year everybody started to realize they need to be profitable well one way to be profitable is hire talent for five times less than your currently hiring talent in the United States and so higher offshore Talent became like a very obvious thing for business owners to do if they wanted profits and so Shepard just takes off and and the third piece which was can we accelerate it and we had done a couple of experiments of like look we have this audience right between Twitter is almost half a million people the podcast is way bigger than that newsletter we have a diff you we have not just a big numbers but like big trust that has been built up so if we pick a product that we actually believe in I think this will work we the last I don't know we've only owned the owned our stake of the business for like six to nine months or something like that the business has tripled and it was already big to begin with and so this is just like an incredible result what how much of that is because of you well we could see it because when people people sign up they either sign up through our link or they sign up and they say where they found it from and so that's a minimum like there's some people who they have heard about it on the podcast but don't click the link or don't whatever and uh Nick does a great job too so I don't want to like you know take away from that but like in the last six months we drove like 50% more of the leads to the business it's like a a pretty insane uh you know value driver and so now I'm like oh I have an unfair Advantage if I I don't need to do 10 of these if I just find a couple of businesses that are already Standalone good businesses that I believe and I do the same thing if I can add millions of dollars of ARR to this business I basically can't lose that that is a that is a completely unfair Advantage uh to have and now all I have to do is Choose Wisely and uh so that's what I've been doing we only did one deal this year and um it we saw you know maybe 60 or so but I think we picked the right one because that investment has has paid off that business has added probably that one deal he did like I thought I was getting it at a good price but it has added at least 30 5 million of value just to that business um just based on the growth and so uh that's like a crazy deal for him too so you know good good on Marshall for for cutting that it's interesting because like I think um I assume that he did it as a secondary or something like that he wanted D RIS take money off the table Yeah but effectively it's like a primary still because you've injected call it 10 or20 million of free marketing as part of the partnership right exact it's super smart and it goes back to that idea I think I've talked about it on the Pod but one plus one equals 100 you can take a mediocre business and I think Shephard's a great business so better if it's a great business well that's not how math Works no it's not right but but you can take you can take you can take something you can take a product and you combine it with an influencer and you can get an incredible outcome because you basically have a free $50 million a year marketing budget as a result well people had talked about this but like you know when I think of influencer I think of like Kim Kardashian or like you know uh Mr Beast it's like yeah obviously you know if they promote a product it's going to go really well it turns out that there's a thing like B2B influencer right there's like a person who is respected amongst business people who is essentially like you know I'm not saying my ass is big but like we're kind of the Kim Kardashian of business influencers right like there you can you you could promote to a community that that that understands what you're doing and if you again if you pick a good product with a good business it will actually take off if you have a shitty product or a shitty business they'll try it and then it'll leak out like right away and so it doesn't really work literally this is what HubSpot did HubSpot looked at the hustle and they said well right now they're making call it $20 million I don't know what the number is $20 million of AD Revenue but how much are those advertisers making off that $20 million of AD spend maybe it's 30 million or 40 million or 50 million and so they can pay up to buy this business and then they can just direct the traffic to themselves and make all that money and I've seen the numbers I think it's a good I think it works for them and let me tell you a crazy thing about this she deal I haven't shared before so the way we structured this deal was beautifully done so I was like look here the business is good the business was already spitting off millions of dollars of profit so it's like cool guys I can bring you guys Capital but you kind of already have like a cash cow that's spitting off millions of dollars of profit so like what I don't really want to well that's not really the value ad clearly the value ad is going to be that I can help grow this actual grow the customer base right because because of the audience and so essentially I put a very small amount of money down and then the company lent me the money to buy my stake in the company that's insane and I was like what and I was like did they type this wrong they're going to give me the money to buy the the business give me the money to buy the business like all right deals where where do I sign this is easy and it was a great deal for me but again like I said the valuation of the company has grown over $30 million just in that period of time and so like less than a year so so like I thought dude I'm getting an absolute steal here turns out they got actually even a bigger steal than I got you know was like win-win and so that's deal structure because that's another thing I've learned when you when it comes to buying companies like in Venture there's no structure Venture is you put in money on a safe note or a priced round it's not even negotiating on really the terms unless you're the lead investor and you're doing something really funky but it's not standard at all when it comes to buying companies structure is can make the difference between a good deal and incred rible deal or a terrible deal and uh structure really really matters I learned a ton about structure this year negotiating a bunch of these deals so Shephard kicked ass for you you did great let's move to the biggest L that you took this year what was that one last year at the end of the year this time last year I was like Hey tax optimization why don't I sell a bunch of my crypto for tax purposes because with crypto you can watch trade you could basically sell and buy back the next day you could book the loss cuz crypto was down last year let's say um so you could book a loss on any crypto that you had bought um higher than that and so crypto was crashing crypto went down to like I don't know six Bitcoin went down to like 16k and I had bought a bunch of Bitcoin at uh when we were doing the milk Road probably closer to to 30k so I could book a you know big loss and then I was like great I'm just gonna buy it right back I believe in crypto right but there is a funny psychological thing where you know catching a falling knife it's like I could buy back in but like should I buy back in now is it go lower uh you know should I just kind of wait this out and see how it goes maybe I'll just do this other thing that that that thing's hot right now crypto's cold right now so let me just wait I'm gonna do it but I'll do it you know at the end of the month and I said I'll do it at the end of the month for 10 months straight just enough time for Bitcoin to RI back up another 35 40% and I bought back in and you know it's my tax savings cost me a lot of money so that was a big L that I took falling into a bunch of obvious psychological traps that I could have pointed out for anybody else that I fell into now luckily for me I didn't sell all of it because I bought Bunch lower than that so it wasn't like that part wouldn't have been a Tex loss but uh still dumb that's that's the second time you've done that that I know of by my course sell low buy high right like that's basically what I executed to Perfection this year um I have one more that was like a big Miss wait what is it so we talked about Angel Investing and Angel Investing we're talking about like getting returns every the game of angel investing is you you're going to invest in 30 maybe 50 companies and it's going to be one or two that are like the runaway winners that's really what you're playing the game for it's like you not trying to have a high hit rate you're trying to have a huge slugging percentage so a few just absolute grand slams and um I missed two Two's A Lot two's the number you need to win and I missed two the first is a the realization here was it's not it's not about bad Investments you make it's the ones you miss it's about the incredible ADV Investments you miss and that's in Venture that's what that that's how it goes so I got introduced to a company called whatnot that I don't know if you guys have heard about this business we talked about it on the Pod you were early talking about it it's like eBay I talked about it I believed in it I was like dude I was at twitch it's basically live video streaming and it started with uh baseball cards and then sports cards so basically people would open up a pack live but you would buy the pack so it's like live they're sitting there they got all these packs on the table you would buy one he would open it up and he would be like you got a Luca donic rookie card wow this is amazing and the chat's going wild and you could just keep buying packs and so it was like this like kind of live video sort of like Casino I like all those words live video and casino so I was like all right I want to invest and the guy's like I don't know man we're we're like pretty over subscribed I'm like but it's me it's a pal Sean we just met uh please and he was like all right let me think about it and I didn't he was like I don't think so I don't think we have space so let me let me go talk to some people see if I can make space and I made a big mistake I waited and I didn't chase and uh whatnot is now valued I think at10 billion so that would have been by far the best investment in all of my Angel Investing I was there early on and I believed in it and I wanted to invest and I just did not fight hard enough to find a way to get into that company and um so you know it's in Angel Investing it's not about oh I made this one bad investment and I lost one X it's that I missed out on you know a 200x or a 500x return on that one deal right like that my 150k check that I wanted to get into that would have been like a $30 million position at this point so one one question was it when was it valued at 10 billion um I think it is it might have been at the kind of peak time July 2022 they raised at 3.7 yeah so okay so maybe it's at four billion now instead of instead of uh 10 um so anyways uh you know basically that would have been a multi-billion dollar uh you know it's a multi-billion dollar company now which is all you're trying to do in investing same thing happened with uh a company called Shuffle so my former intern who came on the Pod I did an episode where I was like my my old intern became a millionaire um when we were hanging out doing the Pod I was like so what are you doing now and he's like oh I'm doing this again this crypto Casino overseas and I was like I like all those words when it comes to making money that's I I wouldn't want to take the risk myself of running that company but if you're going to run that company I think it's a it's a great investment because these things you know we've talked about stake.com that is just this absolute Juggernaut stake is you know issuing like billion dollar dividends a year they have so much cash flow and these guys were building like a competitor and I wanted to invest and then our like lawyer in back office was like yeah but they're based out of this country so they're not going to provide the k1s in time uh blah BL blah and I was in a fund and I was like I can't put my fund money into this because again it's like this overseas crypto Casino thing and the fund cost me this thing is going to be a total winner uh it looks like their their volume is growing like crazy I think they have like I don't know I'll look up the latest numbers I mean it's just painful every time he tells me the latest numbers where it's like every day is their biggest day and uh you know they're they're doing millions and millions of dollars of daily betting volume and they're profitable and I'm like [ __ ] you know you know what's interesting is like you might feel like you've missed the boat on that but one of the things I've learned is like think about amazon.com right amazon.com launched in what 1994 and you you you know you basically had until 2012 to buy the stock right now obviously it's publicly traded stock easier to get into but I bet you could go to him and say hey remember your old pal Sean can I put a 100 Grand in or whatever it is and just suck it up right don't get caught up in the fact that you could have invested at some low valuation that sounds like it'll be a winner long term right yeah and I mean who knows that's a super high variance bet like they get shut down tomorrow if like wherever they're based in some little island somewhere gets like you know seized you know uh who knows what's going to happen with that but that's a roller coaster I wanted to be on if you're going to do Angel Investing you need High variance bets that can become absolutely massive or go to zero you don't want things that are low risk low reward that's not how Angel Investing works anyways so those are my two worst Investments they're Miss missed out not lost money what's yours Andrew so um I'm a designer like I like um you know I like things to look nice and I think every designer has this dream of building their dreamhouse and so uh about seven years ago I bought a piece of property and I started building a amazing house and I hired amazing Architects and interior designers and I'll just say now if you think you want to build a house try it it really sucks uh you know everyone has this fantasy but what it really is you know you think it's going to be about approving like beautiful exteriors what it really comes down to is you are choosing where the electrical outlets go you are proving what you know what color tone all the lights are and so you make 10,000 decisions and eventually you get decision fatigue and you start making bad decisions or if you delegate you delegate someone else and someone else is just you know they delegation is great in a company but when you live in this space the things bother you and so what I found was I because I was building my forever home I would approve they'd be like okay do you want um this marble or there's this really really really nice marble that you can get where it's got you know nicer designs or whatever and I'd always choose the more expensive option because I was thinking this is my dream home I only get to build it once and so I'm massively overbuilt I massively overspent I ended up not being happy with the actual house once I was done wasn't the house like 8,000 square feet was huge I had everything I could have wanted a gym I had a movie theater all all sorts of stuff and I ended up not even liking the house when I moved in because i' just walk around the house going godamn it I remember making that decision you know why did I make that beam that height why did I put that light there and uh anyway so I ended up getting divorced a year and a half ago and neither me or my ex-wife wanted the house and so I had to sell it and I took a 30% loss on this house that I'd spent you know five years building and spent tons of money on so that was my uh that was my big loss and my big lesson is I remember my dad said you always want to be the second owner of a hotel right you want someone else to go crazy and build it out and then go bankrupt and then you want to come in and own that I think the same thing is true with houses just go buy a nice house that someone else built that's a great line you had an even bigger one though written down here yeah the other the other thing that happened to me this year so this this is this has happened to everybody but no one feels it so this year uh my net worth got cut in half on paper right so I went from my let's just say what's publicly available so my tiny stock was worth like 750 $800 billion do and today it's worth about half of that and it's really fascinating like when you're when you own a private business or you own a real estate State portfolio you don't have a ticker right if you own a million-dollar house and all the houses in your neighborhood go down by 20% you don't see that you're not reminded of that and one of the crazy things about having a stock a stock ticker is every day you can see your net worth go up and down in radical ways uh and so yeah that kind of was pretty a pretty insane experience to see that happening over the course of six months I would never text you this but I remember like seeing the stock and every once while be like not I just want to be like what is that feel like you know what I mean like because there's been days when it's gone way up and there's been days it's gone way down and I've always curious that I'm like he knows what's going on I wna I'm gonna stay out of his hair on this one it's really weird I mean Warren Buffett has this great anecdote where or or metaphor where he says owning a business is like owning a farm let's say that your farm makes a million dollars a year of profit and some some yokul comes to your fence and he starts yelling I'll buy your farm for 100 grand if you know your farm is worth millions of dollars you just ignore the Y and so there's all sorts of different people shouting different offers on your farm at all times and so that's kind of the approach I try and take is I just go like um you know I know my business I know what it's worth but yeah it's pretty weird seeing big swings like that my worst thing this year was my biggest L was partially inspired by Andrew Andrew you make a huge mistake when you're talking to me the mistake is you say oh it's just easy you just hire a CEO and then and you miss out on two things one It Ain't Easy there's it's always harder than you think there's always more challenges than you think the other thing is managing them you know how how should they manage you how should you manage them the thing with my company Hampton my CEO Jordan he's awesome but it's heavily based on my reputation and I'm heavily involved in the product and so when I want to be involved in the product I've made mistakes where I'll just go directly to certain staff versus like understanding the chain of command and so just like understanding like how to uh like work with the CEO effectively has been a little bit of a challenge with me i' I it's going great and things are going good and I've made a lot of really good decisions and he's wonderful but just learning how to like understand that relationship has been a challenge and I've gotten in trouble a few times partially I I take blame for a lot of the the instances but I wish we would have talked more about how to manage them tactically we've talked a lot about how to hire and fire and things like that but not how to like work with someone on a daily or weekly or monthly basis yeah and I lots of learning there because I think it's very tempting to see a mistake and jump in but it's it's similar to delegation right when you first start delegating to an employee you want to correct the errors as you see them but at the end of the day the hardest part about having a CEO is that they can ruin the business if they're not careful and you ultimately have to let them make their own mistakes and learn from them I think I've shared on the Pod like we've had a couple instances where a CEO wants to spend one two3 million on R&D and we don't believe it's going to work out but we let them because we go if we don't they're going to resent us they're going to say Andrew and Chris were holding us back we couldn't make our bonuses because we couldn't execute on the strategy and so we always say um we want non-fatal errors not fatal errors we'll intervene when they're fatal right so I think for you like intervening when it's something that's going to ruin your reputation you should jump on that or ruin the business or imperil it but otherwise the hard part is you just kind of have to watch them make mistakes and realize that over the long term they'll make more um make more good decisions than bad yeah and it's just an emotional these are emotional issues but um that's mine Sean what do you want to do now which one let's go to one of my favorites so unsexy business so what is a unsexy kind of under the radar maybe simple business uh that stood out to you that you really liked let me go first on this one I've got one that's interesting so there's a this guy I went to high school with named Chris Chris Hoffman he just started posting content on Twitter like three months ago so basically he posted a story but I'd known what his father did so his father owned a heating and cooling company called Hoffman Bros Heating and Cooling out of St Louis where I'm from he posted he goes in 2016 we took over my father's company um I bought it from him and it was doing 13 million in revenue and he goes through 2016 all the way up to 2013 where he explained the changes they made and how much revenue uh the business is now doing so in 2016 it was 13 2020 it was 40 20123 it's going to be like 140 million in revenue from HVAC business that he owns and he's and he like tweets out all these interesting bits of content about things he's doing like for example we're giving an additional holiday off and here's how I think that that's going to impact the business or we created this thing called Hoffman University which teaches people we had to buy a whole building for this much money it's been very very FAS fasinating he and cooling companies that's going to be the new storage business we're going to see lots of people going on and doing that because of this guy Chris Hoffman really fascinating stuff yeah so mine is really really boring so uh in every fashion house or graphic design studio there's a book of colors called Pantone so you might see these they're these big fat books and you can literally just flip through them you look at different colors and what they've done that's incredibly smart is they've trademarked colors so they have intellectual prop property where it'll be like burgundy Blue Sapphire orange you know whatever and this company I found out makes over $100 million a year of Revenue and one of the most genius things about it is they give you that book and they say you need to buy a new book every year because the colors fade right from uh being in the sun or whatever and so they're just constantly reselling these books people are licensing these colors and the entire fashion and graphic design um world is uh standardized on Pantone so it's it's just so boring and wonderful well we talked about wgsn their competitor um and how I think it's publicly traded but they're trying to sell it for like I think they're trying to sell it for like $800 million because but I I don't think they're competitors dude this is like the lower level this is literally the colors it's not saying which wn's like we're going to do research and reports we'll tell you which colors this is like Pantone does that too they do like they'll do like color forecasting and trending and all that kind of stuff too where do they make the money is it on the books is it on the the dieses or is it on the reports do you know I think all of it and then if they use the color so they'll say like this color of red is going to be in next season or whatever and if you want to use it we have some IP around so wgsn did 50 million in iida last year um and they've been around for like 30 years we I I've been like obsessed with this space for a minute I I remember Sean you remember I used to bring this up I think at our old office um I've been loving this stuff uh panton's a good one and I I think it's wgsn and Pantone like own this space it's basically like when Starbucks is going to come out with their new uniforms or their new like Christmas sleeves or their cups they refer to each of these companies to figure out which colors are going to be popular in six months uh yeah it's a really fascinating company and they've been around for a long ass time too love it all right let's do next category so next category is content of the year what are the either books or blogs or TV shows or pod C what was the best of the best right we're all inundated with so much content and we all kind of want a little bit less content but we still want the best so what was the best content that you consumed this year what was yours okay I'll give you one uh so on the TV side the bear season two episode seven you guys seen this this stressful but that's a great episode I've tried to watch it so many times side Jacks I like Breaking Bad I love stressful shows there's something about the way that that show is cut where I just can't watch it I get too stressed out and I have to turn it off it's like uncut gems yeah I heard about this for this show so many times I started I I I wasn't stressed I was actually just kind of like cool it's kind of slow you know like I'm not like there's not really that much going on it's like almost so real it's like the you know a restaurant is not that exciting but I kept hearing about this episode so I powered through I watched the whole first season the whole second season just to get this one episode and I by the by the time I got there I was like there's no way this is worth it totally worth it that is one of the best episodes of Television I have ever seen is such an emotional uh you know High I love that episode I I remember where I was sitting when I watched that and just thinking whoever made this you are incredible and it teaches you a ton about business like everyone after watching that episode went and read the book what's it called like great Hospitality yeah un un something unbelievable Hospitality or something right it's so there's a lot of business Tak ways what was the other one Sean I'll give you one more so I'll give you a book that I I liked this year um it's called have you read this it's called talk like Churchill stand like Lincoln no what is that uh so I go down these random rabbit holes while I try to get better at let's say storytelling or public speaking or you know things like that this is one that's on speaking and storytelling that I I really liked didn't expect to like it I like the title though talk like Churchill stand like Lincoln and it's a very simple book and a lot of it is kind of obvious things but I found it to be a very useful book and it is uh it's about how to speak better and how to carry yourself better in different situations Sam you love it there's a whole there's a whole chapter on on dress how you how you how you should dress and why you should dress the way you dress uh there's a whole whole chapter on that and it's very short chapters that are on simple principles with a ton of examples and it's it's a very old book uh so like I don't think a lot of people will read this book in general um and all of the examples are from like you know old presidents and stuff that happened like you know before 1950 so I think it's just like a I don't know it's like an old book or uses old examples but it's a good one I recommend it uh it's not the best book I've ever read but again I just found it a very simple useful book for anybody that wants to get better at uh how they carry themselves and how they present themselves that's a good one um all right so there's this idea with uh stoicism that philosophy of stoicism I forget the exact term but basically it's where you imagine all the worst things have happened they say you've got cancer your sick and dying your parents are dead now open up your eyes and none of that's true and you're grateful I love that idea and so this year I went on a spree where I read books about people's hardship so I read the wager which was a 10 out of 10 it's about a shipwreck and these guys are stranded for two years and I read like literally four different shipwreck books I read about Lewis and Clark and how they spent two years going through um America in order to find the other side of the country and and all these hardship because it makes my life feel better when I'm just complaining about like a blog post so another thing that I really got into it's on Netflix it's called World War II from the front lines and there's two things that I've been obsessed with the this year a hardship and so seeing like these soldiers and the Jews and what they went through through the Holocaust and the soldiers on D-Day it makes me so much so thankful that I don't have to do that and I'm like oh this shit's easy this money sh stuff's way easy the other thing that I'm obsessed with is charisma even evil charismatic people so I got like I read all these books about Charlie Manson about hit about Lincoln about George Washington and I love seeing this and you see that In This World War II documentary what they do is they take real life footage from that era and they colorize it and you see like uh you know Joseph gobl one of the um one of the folks in one of the guys who led propaganda for Nazis you see him giving a speech and you see all you see literally a million people in the crowd like being convinced to do all these evil things and I find it so fascinating how cult leaders like use their Charisma to do to force people or convince people to do bad stuff and so World War II from the front lines it's on Netflix it's awesome that's probably the best thing that I've consumed this year what's yours Andrew so um like everyone else I've been freaking out about Ai and I go through these phases where I try not to think about it too much and then I go down a rabbit hole and I decided to read two books at the same time that kind of counterbalance one another so one book is called the coming wave it's by one of the co-founders of open Ai and it's really fascinating usually you get these kind of like thinkpiece analysis books by academics or professional authors um and this guy actually is you know he's been on the front lines for the last 15 years um built Deep Mind and has been at Google uh working on you know their AI programs for years so um and he he has a very um extreme view that effectively AI will disrupt all work and that the second and third order consequences are just endless uh and we can't really contemplate them and he kind of argues for regulation and containment and then on the flip side at the same time to counterbalance the anxiety of reading that I've been reading Morgan housel Morgan howel's new book same as ever which is about how things don't change what are the things that stay the same over the long term you know people still eat the same candy bars they still enjoy reading a book they like going for a walk in nature Etc so th those have been two uh books that I've absolutely loved and then I second the book The Wager like Sam before I go to bed uh I always read books about people in terrible situations or in Worlds that are very different than the world inhabit and the wager is amazing I'm just at the part where they're going around the horn so I'm pretty early but oh my God it's amazing it's hard to put down isn't it that's one of the only books I've ever read in one sitting wow Sean you got to get on that shipwreck uh train uh I've got about three more shipwreck books if you want uh I've never bought into the St this the stoicism uh IM the negative visualization stuff I didn't enjoy that I do like reading about hardship or like kind of like people who went through things just to give yourself perspective uh more than it more than to make myself feel good although that's a good side effect but I think it's more important to have a broader perspective than just the little narrow stuff you see in your day-to-day life um but doesn't that stuff just kind of like bum you out like you know I I feel like I get the same effect of feeling good just by um you know being thankful for what's going good and imagining things going well and I can sleep easy doing that am I uh I so the one of the most relaxing things for me is when I'm really really stressed I watch a show called survivor man have you guys ever heard of this yeah the guy who like just is on his own for seven days and he's got to figure it out this poor bastard they put him in like you know the Antarctic with no you know he doesn't even have a hatchet or anything himself he doesn't even have a film crew around he's got an emergency Beacon if he's almost dying but he films himself surviving and you see this guy like drinking his own urine and eating rats and digging you know digging shelters under the ice and all this stuff and every time I watch that I just think how remarkable it is that I live in this amazing worm structure I go to bed s mask up on his forehead his like toes tucked into the duvet as he's watching Survivor man reading his printed emails asking in the glow of my peter AA red phone right he's like ah [ __ ] I saw blue light two hours before bed no EA the rats and drinking p and you're reading the wager and like don't these [ __ ] know that they'll just they just have to eat a lemon and they won't get scurvy what a bunch of morons um all right wildest predictions um what's yours dude I didn't I didn't do any Here Andrew you gotta carry us yeah so mine is that I think assistant and admin jobs could go away or change radically I think that um if you think about a lot of the tasks that personal assist do um I think a very well-trained Google AI that understands your Google Drive your calendar and your email um will be able to do probably 80% of those tasks maybe more and I think that's coming in the very near term um you know these things are just progressing at such an exp exponential rate and so that's something I've been thinking a lot about and I'm I'm excited you know I think it frees up a lot of people to do um you know more interesting work but uh it's going to be pretty wildly disruptive well we got to read our predictions from last year right that I think that's where we got to start for this one so Andrew your prediction for 2023 was that we would see a lot of copies competitors to gpt3 a correct you said Google jumps in correct AWS has something and Azure have something Azure did the big Microsoft did the big deal with open AI so you were pretty spot on Sam yours was Elon dies or gets cancelled in a serious way and then you said open a gets regulated the inputs happened the inputs for Elon Musk were there the output was not dude he's he's getting kind of like a long slow cancellation you know progressively uh through and by the way that's my same prediction for the for the next year I think Elon will admit that buying Twitter was a mistake although I think he's already acknowledged he's like this is hardship that I didn't necessarily need but I think that like with all the advertisers leaving I've been buying ads on Twitter I tested it like the cost per click are like stupid cheap I don't even want to mention that on here because it's cut that [ __ ] up uh but basically I think I think that the Twitter experiment I think it's going to live but not under Elon or something in a drastic way so I'm extending my 23 into 24 okay I like that my prediction was selfish I said this is the year that I turned the corner and actually get shredded up get so get ripped get in great shape and then I also said uh I would start a company that's uh you know special or like maybe a legacy company uh definitely did not do the second one didn't but I also didn't like after that podcast I stopped thinking about that completely and I made actually my goal to not start a company this year um but I and then the getting ripped I actually got to my fattest this year but then before the end of the year fourth quarter was you know the clock was draining and I came through in the clutch and I'm now down about uh let's see 13 14 pounds and uh I've been eating clean for what 45 straight days uh like perfect perf eating exactly what I want to be doing and uh to put that in perspective 45 days probably doesn't sound like much it's a month and a half um probably the longest I went of actual perfect eating where I'm not eating a bunch of chips or um you know ordering a pizza or something like that you know one night when I'm tired or stressed by Pro probably the last time I did a stretch would have been like seven days would have been like the longest I had gone just of actual clean eating and now I'm at 45 so going great with o zic or without he's no zic baby I'm on that no zic plan Daddy he uh and in the YouTube comments you every video is commenting either your skin or your look so it's working people are people are loving your uh glow up what about coolest moment of your year I have a fun one so um last year my Coo's moment was all about me this year it's all about somebody else so I have a buddy who I went to college with my buddy Dan and Dan um we started our first business together straight out of college so we were like The Three Amigos um but then we you know that company wasn't really working out and two of the three of us went to Australia and had this really cool opportunity but like there wasn't really a spot for Dan on that boat uh meaning like you know I got a spot and I was able to get one other guy a spot but it was really too much for me to like convince this Australian billionaire why I need two of my friends to come with me to go do this thing that was like kind of this unspecified project and I felt bad about that and I felt bad about that for like a decade and I was like damn I really wish like even if he didn't come that we had gotten him into a good landing spot before we made that decision I felt like we kind of left you know no man left behind we kind of left a man behind and I felt bad about that I carried that guilt he did totally fine by the way he went and got a job at Facebook and he uh when he was at Facebook he went from like the bottom to the top the bottom was his job at Facebook initially was to like make sure that like no penis will show up on a news feet he's like building like penis detection like systems to like make sure that you never and by the way you ever logged into Facebook and C of penis never he Dan did a great job and so while he was there he went and enrolled in the Facebook developer boot camp and like taught himself to code and um then he became then he went out in the marketplace did a genius thing his job application he's like well I could say that I've been an engineer for two years that's not really GNA get me that good of a job so he's like instead he went out he he reframed it he goes um I'm a Facebook trained engineer I know how to do engineering at Facebook I can make your engineering team run like a Facebook engineering team people loved it he got a job as CTO of a startup that uh went on to raised you know B round C round D round but unfortunately the startup fizzled out and I catch up with Dan and I say um he's like hey man you know unfortunately my options I thought were going to you know make me a bunch of money didn't really work out uh you got any other like kind of I'm looking for a job let me know and I said you I met this guy Andrew Wilkinson and then I met this guy s balky and I've been listening to this podcast that I create and it's all about there's a bunch of these people that are buying businesses I said Dan have you ever consider buying a business he's like I didn't even know where I would start and I was like I'm going to help you and I was like I'll I don't I don't know ton about it but I know more about it than you do so you know like let me be a blue belt and help a white belt here and so I basically helped Dan do this search process I had no stake in it no investment in it except for this is one of my best friends from college and Dan bought a business he bought a uh so after six to nine months and several like close calls but you know last minute we said no no this is not a great business don't buy it um he buys this business and he buys this bag manufactur bag like bag sales company I don't know how you describe it they don't make the bags they they they get them made uh but they sell them to Big retailers so like if you go walk into like a like a Ulta all the bags at Ulta That's My Boy Dan's company and this guy had been running it for you know years he had no contracts with any of these companies he kind of ran it off pen and paper um and so he my my friend Dan was able to negotiate and buy this business at a great price and he just texted me yesterday saying that he's only owned this business now for like three or four months that in the just in the the sort of five months that'll be this year he will out of the profit of this business after paying all the debt that he used to buy the business he will make more than he made at his highest paying job as CTO already in the first five months and he's like dude the lifestyle is great he's like I'm kind of working more but it's totally different the totally different field right like I own my own business I come in every day I'm excited he's like I see this path where we're going to grow he's like I'm the bag I'm Dan the bagman and he's like I can I can do this and this could be like my you know like my asset that I build because like he's like you know even though I'm making more than I did at my job it's even better because you can't ever sell your job but with this I know if I build this business up and it's making more profits one day I could sell this business and cash out like a life-changing sum for me and I feel so good that I got to you know sit shotgun for him while he went on this ride Kudos San what's the name of the company can you say I don't know but if you email me uh I'll show you to Dan if you need bags for your business Dan's got you mine's a bit mine doesn't have any great story so Andrew I saw what you put that is also mine but I'm not going to say that one I'll go to the next one which is actually the most important one I had a kid this year that was my that was the coolest moment this year um I think Andrew you you told me what did you say you said you're going to feel so much Indo uh dopamine every morning when you look at your kid and I get it now so now it's my turn to gatekeep people and tell people like oh you'll understand when you have kids you'll understand understand it I understand a little bit and it's been awesome so that's mine but uh Andrew you do yours I think I said um it's like liquid MDMA gets shot into your brain every time you look at your baby yeah it's awesome man it's and it's brought me closer to my wife too I have more you know I've already I always respected her but now there's more like of a of a spiritual respect it's kind of funny um but what's yours totally um so yeah we had our first ever live MFM in Vancouver uh what was that February I guess uh this year and I kind of put it on like so I I like you know texted you guys and I was like hey we want to do this event let's do it in Vancouver we rented this huge theater and I remember getting the photo of the theater and sending it to you and we were just like holy [ __ ] like how are we going to fill this thing I was really nervous about it and uh we I remember we were backstage and we were like peeking out and the entire theater was packed there was a line down the street like it was really really crazy and this was like this a massive multi-level theater and see like 1200 people 1 1200 1300 people or something and I remember Sam was like we're backstage and he goes I don't use Facebook but I do today because I want everyone in high school to see that I filled a theater I need post a photo of of of us I just love that that was such a great moment there I remember uh Sam you posted this photo of Alexis ohanyan with Serena Williams and he just looks like a like a like a Pasty nerd with this beautiful like beautiful Amazon and you go the Nerds win and in that moment I was like okay the Nerds won he didn't like what I said that by the way he was not a fan but it was awesome that we sold out that theater that that was a really exciting thing and you did the dumbest thing ever you made people pay but then you gave the money back if they showed up people would have just paid yeah I know in retrospect we should have charged um let's go to breakout of the Year Sean what what do you have mine's real simple um break out of the year I think has to be OIC I feel like OIC kind of changed the world um it's not just like a tech thing or a business thing like OIC is everywhere uh and and there's I I don't know the jury's still out on it but there's a lot of evidence that even if OIC has you know maybe side effects or you got to stay on it to maintain the gains or whatever like that people not being obese and people not being sort of uh controlled by their Cravings whether it's for food or they're even seeing maybe effects for for alcoholism that seems just like a really really big deal and I kind of it's kind of the cliche idea it's like what if what if there was the magic weight loss pill and now there kind of is that's mind-blowing to me that there we did it there is a magic weight loss pill well I was picking between Brett Taylor and OIC and so Sean do you remember how you first heard about OIC I think it was June of 2022 I texted you and I was like there's this drug called semi glutide it's I'm in New York and it's like kind of popular amongst like only a small group of like weird biohackers I'm gonna try it and I tried it and I remember messaging you or maybe I even said in the Pod I'm like for some you know I've got I had drinking issues a long time ago but I was like for some reason I even feel like I think this might like cure that too you call you called it 100% not not only do you show you you showed me a picture and I was like wow that's incredible you go um te you go I started this semi glutide thing I was like dude you I've never heard of this like you're yeah I just inject this thing and me and I'm like bro you just inject random [ __ ] into you like that's not smart but you were totally on it and then you said the I think this is g to cure alcoholism and I remember literally like I didn't want to laugh in your face but I remember laughing inside being like dude that's just like sounds like a crazy leap uh you know you can't just say that [ __ ] there's no evidence of that I just felt it I could feel it when I so I don't use it anymore but I tested it for a small amount of time and this is semaglutide that's the name of the drug or the I don't know how you even explain it the the root drug and then there's OIC is the brand name but I remember like putting that in my body and I'm like I think this is going to cure alcoholism because you don't crave anything and I think what's going to happen is in 10 years we're going to see downsides to this drug because right now there's like very few or at least it's impacting only small amount of people so I think that like there's still going to be downsides but I think that what it's got always said he goes it's not chat GPT it's glp1 that's the big thing glp1 this drug class is going to be way bigger than chat gbt and I and I agree with them I think that's a breakout of the Year what's yours uh Andrew yeah that's like anti-depressants or something um so mine mine is pretty boring it's a company called snipped and it's a podcast player and I don't know if you guys have this problem but often I'll be driving that's when I listen to podcast most and I'll hear something incredible like a great quote or just a great line or something I want to follow up on later and until recently I've either um just forgotten it basically it goes out uh the other side of my head or occasionally I would pull over my car and I'd make a note or something like that and snip basically solves that so what snip does is it has an AI that um basically takes the transcript it does um like voice recognition on the transcript of the podcast it pulls out all the key moments so a let's say that you want to listen to a Jo Rogan interview but it's 3 hours and you only really want to talk hear them talk about stuff that isn't MMA you can jump in or whatever but then also when you hear something interesting you can tap a little button in carplay or on your phone and it'll actually grab the text from whatever was just said and I found that incredibly useful and all my nerdy friends that are into like journaling and readwise and all that stuff are going crazy for it so I love that product you're on the homepage um a testimonial from you that's cool oh really yeah they apparently you must I haven't invested or anything you've tweeted it out and they used their tweet and I think MFM is yeah MFM is on here too um that's pretty cool Sam you had you had a snipped moment last pod where somebody was like yeah vaa is this crazy company they uh and we were like what do they even do they go they go to yeah they're manufacturing drugs in space Sam goes there's a pause he goes why he goes what like what's to manufacture Jo in space like what's wrong with Massachusetts I still haven't gotten a good answer I'm sure it exist what's wrong with Massachusetts is just that is incredible incredible content this is the end of the Millie Awards congratulations folks this is uh the end of 2023 it's already 2024 which is crazy I saw someone say um a professor was like hey you you can use um sources in your paper from the previous century and this person the student wrote in and she goes uh Hey it I was going to do something from the late uh 20th century is 1996 is that too old to use um so if you're born in 2000 you're already 24 I can't believe we're going into that year dude that's us now too old to use yeah it's crazy um well that's it that's the Pod congrats [Music] fellas

gone viral on on YouTube where it's a clip from the Scott Galloway pod where he's talking about how much he made I'm talking about how much I made and people are just ragging on us both so hard because they say that we sound so depressed but I'm going to give it number one to Kevin Ryan Kevin Ryan's the founder of guilt Business Insider mongod DB I think Kevin Ryan was the best episode I think he was the most wise person and well balanced person we've had who's had crazy success you know what else he did that I liked at the end of the episode he was like here's how I set up my company to maximize um like kind of the gain I get out of these companies and pay Rel leased taxes and I'll tell you what no rich guy ever says that no rich guy ever tells you this is the structure I use and he said it on on air he's like here's what it does it lets me live in a high cost State and I'm effectively only paying 14% And my kids are only paying 0% on what they're getting out of our our capital gains due to qsbs so he owns the share he's like I only work on projects that are qsbs eligible and long-term capital gains I'm not looking for uh cash flow or income because he's like I got to a point where I I have that like you know day-to-day needs settled so you have to get to there he's like but once you're there he's like you um you take your qsbs you live in a high cost State you then uh gift uh your stock to your kids trust so you set up kids trust you gift your stock to them before you raise a financing round so you're taking only like let's say 100K out of your uh lifetime gift tax and your kids now own qsbs eligible stock when you sell you're going to end up paying only the state tax so you'll pay4 % California or New York you'll pay no federal um and then your kids will pay 0% wherever you know likely whenever they they get it out of the trust uh at their at their given point in time and you're getting qsbs you know the $10 million taxfree for you times each of your kids I can get to 50 million taxfree if I got you know three or four kids or whatever and I was like I don't think they've got I don't think they have qsbs in Canada land do they no we don't have we have there's all sorts of other stuff and benefits and stuff but um there's a great saying on this stuff um whales only harpoon whales only get harpooned when they surface right he just surfaced in a really obvious way and you know there's just some anal retentive IRS guy listening to the stroking beard strike that all from the record what uh what's yours Andrew uh my favorite was Sarah Moore so Sarah Moore uh she's a crazy story she um had a really troubled childhood basically got adopted by this wealthy family they ended up putting her through Harvard Business School and she went out and she bought this business called eggcartons.com and this story was just incredible I feel like um so many people hear these wild stories about tech bro billionaires you know raising a bunch of money and hitting it big making trillions of dollars and I think her story is much more realistic for a normal person you know anyone she really kind of uh is a testament to the fact that anybody can teach thems business and can go buy a business that is really not rocket science and I loved how simple and tactical all of her stuff was uh she's so also said the she go I'm trying to stay lowkey and under the radar and I think it's been our one of our most downloaded and viewed episodes with like 500,000 listens to that episode whoops well so the smartest thing she did is she like she did the um the Michael Jordan like I'm retiring this is the last thing like you know I'm never going out again and now she it immediately as soon as you said that in the intro I was like I have to listen right there's definitely episodes I kind of check out of I I I think that's a great one the uh by the way there's a quick followup to that cuz that sto that that story The Sarah Mo story was falls in the category of kind of like too good to be true so you know look at all the elements it's basically like here's this super hot woman who grew up you know super poor couldn't even get into college somehow ends up at Harvard Business School there must have been something happening there a family like adopted her along the way that's like the plot of the movie Blind Side then it was buys a business but has no money remember because she grew up super poor so bought the business with zero dollars cash down how she found the business was she you know hired 50 interns off of Craigslist and like snuck them into the Harvard uh business school like library to work with her on this it and you know buys this business Ed carton.com for Millions it's a Millions multi-million dollar business super successful there's no pictures of her on the internet there's no interviews of her on the internet right we're like the only guys whove like done this so there was a lot there that like I came out be thinking did I just get Elizabeth Holmes I I might have oh God this I might be part of the documentary here all right let me uh let me at least make sure I look good if this is gonna end up on Netflix one day and she flew out after the episode she's like I gotta meet you so okay why uh and she's like I just I need to know who I'm dealing with here and so she flies out we go get lunch here in the BBS uh in California she flies all the way from Boston and everything checked out it was if she is Elizabeth holes she's the greatest Elizabeth holes you've ever seen uh you know she looks like what she said shows like she told the story she showed me the old photos like you know she everything and she's like I'm so glad you know people have been pretty respectful because I said on the episode please don't bother me um and we we did a form instead of her like email address like here type your questions in this form and then we'll we'll answer the form how many how many messages did she get a lot she said after the first appearance on it she got like like the Netflix Bravo like other people had reached out to be like can I do uh we want to do a show on you or movie on you wow all right well cudos to Sarah Mo what what's your Sean all right my MFM guest year this is gonna surprise you guys is Connor price and Connor price is a was a guy who was working in a warehouse he was stacking boxes in our friend's Warehouse in Ramone's warehouse and he was like a wannabe rapper white guy and you know like that's kind of cliche but he actually made it and he made it in a very interesting way he figured out how to go viral on Tik Tok and he was not a social media guy he refused to even post on social media he was too shy his wife was like you got to do this it's a great way to get the word out and let's just have some fun with it she kind of became his like his manager and they now have racked up I don't know like a billion views on Tik Tok going viral and the reason I say Conor price is not just because that's an inspiring story but but I took away one big lesson of like the it's like I realized that the puck has moved and I'll give you guys the short version of it I think era one of marketing was sort of like U let me interrupt your programming in order to tell you about my product right that commercials that's like radio ads that's how things used to work era two became um hey let me send this to an influencer they'll kind of hold up the product and make a post about the product so now I'm not interrupting your programming I'm kind of using this trusted influencer um but it's clearly you know still an ad the content is buy this product it's great and what Connor price is doing is a little bit different he he creates a little skit and in the middle of the the payoff of the skit the hero of the skit the one that saves the day is this dope song and the 15 seconds of the dope song and that gets people to go and actually want to go find the product and now I see this everywhere this is how Mr Beast sells chocolate too he doesn't hold up his candy bar and say this is a delicious C bar you should go buy it he says I recreated Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and inside this Factory is he makes like the product is baked into the content the content is entertainment around the product and now that I see that I can't unsee it I see it everywhere and it's part of my kind of core business strategy now even our own ads we changed like that instead of saying we're gonna stop we're gonna tell you about this thing we created a segment called The Thrill of the shill we we teach a lesson or an entertaining story and then we tell you about the product in that story and uh that's how I think think marketing goes down cprice got give a shout out to his wife too just a total shark in the best possible way AB yeah she was Hardcore this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated W I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from 3 days ago I totally missed hub spot grow better all right you move to the next one Billy of the year how do we describe this one just a billionaire who's fascinating it's just someone who's balling out of control you don't even have to be a billionaire you just have to have that that billionaire strut the ability to to walk with some Swagger and play the game a little differently so it's somebody who is Uber successful but in a way that we really respect let's go with Andrew first who you got so mine is very obvious it's um landline over there you still have a landline dude you go public and you have to install a landline the gate the gate the the Gate of my house is like the super old school system so I have a landline just for that dude you you better only be talking to presidence on that thing yeah it's red it's red like the bat phone um so mine is pretty obvious it's Charlie Munger I think we all know who he is uh for those of you that don't he's Warren Buffett's longtime business partner he just died last week I think he was 15 days or something short of his H 100th birthday he was 99 and the guy was completely sharp to the end I think a week before he did an interview with Jesse or um what's her name Becky quick um from CNBC and I just want to tell you a story about this guy this is how sharp this guy was so Chris and I were having dinner with him one night and all of a sudden this guy bursts into the room and he's like Charlie I got I'm doing a deal right now I need to know uh an answer to something and this guy walks in he's like 30 years old and he just starts rattling off a bunch of questions he's like okay um we need to do it at 5.6% interest for this many doors and Charlie just asks a couple questions and they says okay good cool and then the guy just like says bye to us and leaves and Charlie explains that it's this neighborhood kid who he is a acidic Jew tried to convert him to Judaism 20 years ago going door Todo with a Bible uh with with uh Bibles and they ended up becoming friends he mentored him they he started buying Apartments Charlie backed him on this and now they own a billion dooll real estate portfolio of Los Angeles apartments and he's just this neighborhood kid uh his name is AI and uh and they built this huge business together and Charlie started doing this when he was like 90 years old his 90-year-old side hustle is a billion dollar real estate portfolio God damn it Andrew is this going to be like a a couple that's been married for 80 years and they both die at the same time is is Warren going to like is he uh distraught you think in the same way a marriage would be I don't know I mean yeah Buffett's really old too and I think um if you think about the Actuarial tables they really don't have much or Buffet wouldn't have much time left but uh hopefully he keeps going for a cou years I think he named or he said he has a successor and everything lined up but I wasn't sure if it going to be like a marriage where like he's going to go like next week but I guess we'll see it's funny is they've had successors since they were like 60 everyone's been saying they'll die at any time so they've gone they've gone a lot longer than everyone thought um all right mine's Palmer lucky the CEO of andrel so we had Palmer lucky on I think two years ago now it was an amazing episode but here's why I like Palmer lucky he says what you want to say if you were a billionaire but you'd be too afraid to say it and so he has got a lot of really good quotes of him he's kind of a loose cannon in in a few ways like him and Jason calcinus have gotten into it but frankly I love it so he's got this great thing that he did he spoke at a conference recently and he goes do you guys know what the number one profession that children want to be it's social media influencer the next is professional gamer the next is a YouTuber and the problem is that you can't tell kids to follow their dreams when their dreams suck uh which is like a great line and he goes do you know what the number one dream for kids in 1971 in 1971 was it was an astronaut we had just gone to the Moon these guys were fighter pilots PhD mathematicians Supermen who all were also really good good-looking and well spoken it was the ultimate American hero ideal for a kid to see that and say that's what I want to be okay then I say yes you we should tell kids to follow their dream but when it's social media influencers I should tell we should tell them their their dreams suck and don't follow their dream so he's got these really like articulated wonderful points that I appreciate he dresses silly he's got a mullet I'm a big Palmer lucky fan yeah I like that one that's now two years in a row Andrew gave him the nod last year for Billy of the year and now Sam comes in again with Palmer I love it he's uh we got to get him back on man he was he was really good on the pot he had super interesting ideas and also like you said speaks his mind he says that he flies commercial and that he prefers to see to sit by the bathroom he goes cuz that cuz my my grand he goes my grandpa was a pilot and I just love being around everyone I don't truly believe that but he cons continually claims that's true what's yours Sean um all right my Billy of the year is going to be an entrepreneur who I think has a I don't know how close they are to the Billy number I think they're probably close when you include their wife that's a little hint for you I wrote down a couple of bullet points on why this person is a badass and you know you're a badass when your couple bullet points goes to the Roman numeral 13 let me just read these off in Rapid succession okay this person has been a rapper an entrepreneur an investor an author they are a motivational speaker they have a badass wife who's even more successful than them they somehow married up even though they're super successful themselves four kids and when I called this person to prep for the podcast they were on their way you know they taking care of the kids uh taking them to their soccer game yelling at at them where's your shoes how you where where'd you put your shoes yesterday and that just told me they're they're plugged in as a dad versus uh you know four other people are raising their kids um they own an NBA team they're part owner in an NBA team they built a coconut water brand a private jet company they discovered David gogin before he was David gaggin they they actually invited David gogin to live in their house and train them every single day for 30 days uh they like running so they created a running festival they like pickles they're creating a pickle brand they created a fake Mount Everest because he's like I can't go climb Everest but I'll take this mountain I'll climb it 14 times and it's the same height as Everest um he came on the Pod and had one of the alltime classic lines about some other competitor of his here he goes keep the money warm you know thank you for keeping the money warm for me I'm coming and keep the money warm has just it warms my soul uh he is just having fun out here he's got great life uh philosophies that about having Adventures multiple times a year to to have a life while lived he he also got angry at me for asking him what his monthly burn was yeah he called Sam out for uh badgering him we had to cut it out of the episode because it got Bader him I didn't Badger him I I said I'll ask whatever I want and I respect your I respect you to say question sever different ways until he finally Wilt he didn't Wilt he was like that's personal [ __ ] Sam you're pissing me off and uh he he is Jesse ller that is my Billy of the year that's a good one yeah I uh I had him on my list I thought you were gonna pick him so I I backed off I think Jesse's an amazing person he also has this calendar I keep getting Facebook ads for it and I'm gonna buy one where he like said what did he say he goes I'm 50 years old I only have 30 Summers left I'm planning exactly how I'm GNA spend them exactly I think it was called big ass calendar um all right category number three what is the biggest change you're making for 2024 but before we do it we have to say what we said last year Andrew you said being better at responding to iMessage you were like I've I've gotten my email system under rep but you know you're like I have so many text messages I'm bad at replying it makes me feel like a bad person and a bad friend uh Sam you said I'm gonna be less of a dictator uh you said I'm going to lead this company without being a dictator and being less metric obsessed I'm going to be more Vibe driven more calm I nailed it by the way just for the record yeah I was going to say and I said um I know I'm I don't know why I think I said something else but I think I said knowing when to use my impulsiveness and when to ignore it um that so those were our three Sam you want to go first so you said you nailed it I nailed it i' I've been way less metric focused I try not to talk about sales or anything like that you're a Vibe CEO I'm A vibe CEO you know I'm not the CEO but my CEO is metric driven but I'm not as much so I I I calm down and I think I'm very easy to be around at this moment but next year so I'm making a few changes one I'm gonna move eventually I think I'm gonna do the most tuxedo guy tuxedo thing ever I think I'm moving to like Greenwich Connecticut that's not a joke that's serious so that's gonna be a big change but you know what I'm gonna do in 2024 is I'm going to get I'm trying gr grayscale you know you guys know what grayscale is that's when you there's like a if you go to just Google it and you'll see the directions on how to do it but if you type in on your phone like color you should see it where you can switch your iPhone to only be black or white so I'm doing that right now because I've been using my phone to read books to my daughter and I hate having that bright all those colors because she stares at them but the bigger switch I'm going to do is I'm going to get a dumb phone have you guys seen dumb phones it's like a Nokia or a light phone I cannot stand phone addiction it's really bothering me I'm totally addicted and I'm afraid to set a bad example example for my children so this year I'm going to move to a dumb phone which is similar I guess to what you're saying Andrew you're breaking up with email so two well two thoughts on that before you jump to that so one um the bright light you get at night you want to actually Peter AA recommends switching your phone so that it's a red screen instead of grayscale uh I can teach you how to do that you tap your uh power button twice and you can make it a shortcut to make your screen red and red light doesn't affect your night vision so that's what I do um that said there's been studies on um color and if you decolorize your phone if you make a gray scale it's less stimulating you're less likely to click into stuff uh what I've done is actually installed something called freedom and freedom plus screen time basically block everything I've been doing that but with opal you know opal I think it's the same thing yeah similar so it's like I basically have no ability to get through it like there's I I I have not been able to figure it out and so I have no email on my phone um I've blocked a lot of texting say I've blocked every basically basically every fun app uh and I feel like an addict like I I feel like really irritable I'm going through withdrawal right now um but the change I'm trying to make so I I nailed texting last year I got this amazing app called text.com which is basically like super human for texts dude you've been twe you've been tweeting out like links you're like like you like refer five people and you get a t-shirt or something I love it I love I absolutely love it but the problem with that is that I've now gotten so respons iive with texts I'm so good with texts that I'm getting more texts so you know you send more emails you get more emails I'm now getting too many texts and because I built my email system last year um I don't respond on email as fast and so I'm getting more and more texts so I have that problem the big thing I'm trying to do this year is I'm trying to break up with email fully so what I've been doing for the last two weeks is I can't access my email and my assistant sends me screenshots literally of any important email that she thinks I need need to respond to and I just tell her what to do with it and what's interesting about that is when you're in a flow State when you're working or writing or doing something you'll often have the thought oh [ __ ] I have to remember to send that email and so you jump over to superhuman you send the email and then you know you might see 10 other subject lines and before I know it I'm like down a rabbit Trail reading like a pachim mccormic newsletter or responding to a problem or something like that and so what I'm what I'm hoping is that this new system will only be the things that I absolutely need to respond to and there's no additional distraction so we we'll see how it works let me just tell you two wonderful rich guy things that Andrew just did that are true rich guy things not these fake ass not these wannabe rich guy things first thing is he said you know what petera recommends which is great because he didn't say you know what my doctor Peter Atia recommends he recomend it to me yeah it recommends to me when I see him because again he's my doctor so that was the first great thing you did you didn't brag when you could have bragged the it's the words not said it's the dogs that didn't bark right that that you really gave yourself away as being a a truly comfortable with yourself secure person and I appreciate that the second thing you're basically at the stage of trump and others that are just like I just get my email printed out and put on my desk and I just quickly Mark with a pen and then somebody goes I don't what is email actually I actually don't understand how the system works it just shows up on my desk you're basically at printed email and printed email is like you got Louis Vuitton you got like you know Birkin bags you got at the very top of the luxury pyramid is printed email and you're basically there you know what's crazy though it's really not it's not an inaccessible thing like um so I have an assistant in the Philippines and it's like $ thousand doll a month and she does it right so it's like it is something that a lot of people could be it's not that it's inexpensive it takes a certain level of confidence in your lifestyle that you're not missing stuff right you you are not lacking something and so you're able to do this type of system so what's interesting though is I've done this I've been in this cycle for 15 years right of getting overwhelmed usually once a year I get overwhelmed and I doll everything back and Sam I've actually had a flip phone I've tried the dumb phone at the end of the day you need to order door door Dash and Uber and do basic things so it didn't work for me but I had this moment where I was going through one of these cycles and this was in 2010 and my friend asked me out for sushi so I live in Victoria uh Canada and I and Vancouver is about I don't know a 35 minute flight away or a two-hour fery away and so I go up for sushi with my buddy and I'm in this mode where I put my phone in my car and I don't look at it so I um go have sushi we have a great time we're catching up at the end of the uh Sushi I get in my car and I look at my phone and I've received an email from Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg at the time was famous but not famous famous not like he is today and I had emailed him because I heard he was coming to Vancouver and he didn't respond for two days and then at 8 8 o'clock at night or seven o'clock at night I got this email that said hey do you want to go for a drink from him from Zuck and there's and I checked this email at 8:30 or 9 and there's literally no way to get to Vancouver after 900 p.m. the fer leaves at 9:00 p.m. there's no flights Etc and so I missed my opport to go out for a drink with Mark Zuckerberg oneon-one while he's out of his element in my hometown and so I always think about that story whenever I block my email and do all these things I still always think about that that's insane that's so funny imagine somebody who's like yeah I really want to make this lifestyle shift it'll be good I'm going to get off my phone but you know what if Mark Zuckerberg just emails me and I happened to be at Sushi and I missed the one time he's in my hometown in my neighborhood you know and then like Jessica Beal was there afterwards and she wanted to hang out but then I just didn't have my phone on me but it actually happened to that's incredible it's a very sad story it's very difficult life have you tried to like catch up with him and be like Mark um hey uh you know was doing a dumb phone thing you know how it is I'm walking around Meno Park until I see you uh you have to do the uh Andrew what I want you to give up next year at least when you're around Me Maybe Sean as well is that stupid thing you you and Chris always do where you can make everyone put their credit cards in at the end of a dinner you did that with me Sean and I I won't name the other person but the dinner that one time it was probably $600 and I don't know this person this person's finances but I I know they aren't where you are and this guy had to paid for like a $600 meal and I don't want to be a [ __ ] and be like call everyone out funny thing is we were at Sushi and this person doesn't eat fish so they pay for the meal they don't even eat I think it's such an awkward it's born so what basically the story is uh we were all out for dinner and Chris and I said hey you know instead of fighting over the bill let's just all put our credit cards in we'll let the the waiter choose the card I would have fought you we didn't have to fight what what I noticed one of the weird things about making money is that there's this weird dynamic that happens where when the bill comes if you pay the bill you're showing off or you're implying they can't afford it and if you don't pay the bill you're an [ __ ] because you can afford to and so that's why we do that well so Canadian of you yeah well all right Sean what's yours um what am I on oh biggest change okay biggest change I'm making this is something I started to do but I'm doubling down on it so this year I turned off two profit streams that I think combined were making like 1.2 two to 1.5 million a year of profit I just turned them off nothing was wrong with him I just turned them off I lied actually there was something wrong with them they were just okay uh they were just okay meaning it wasn't something I really loved to do wasn't something I hated to do it was making good money but it wasn't making amazing money can you say what those are yeah one of them was um my course so I I was teaching this like power writing course and uh you know I was only teaching it basically two to three weeks out of the year you know roughly 10 days on average a year but it would generate you know whatever a million bucks a year of profit and um but I didn't like being a course sales guy like I like teaching but I'd rather just kind of like maybe just do it for free on the Pod or something like that do it do like a master class episode instead um so I I just decided I'm not doing it and I was like okay that's just like less coming in this year all right and that matters to me uh so I'm like but I'm willing to do that and I also just announced that I'm shutting down my rolling fund so I'll only be investing personally now I'm not taking any more outside money um just because it was like kind of another thing to manage like here's a group of investors I gota write these updates I got to keep it like you know I got to keep it organized oh should I do this deal or should I not do this deal I just decided I'm just gonna invest my own money I don't I don't need to do this anymore and with that comes like a stady stream of fees and carry that would come with a fund I turned it off again didn't have to turn off just chose to turn off and the reason why was I realized I was talking to somebody that was I one day like you know uh what's it like a Christmas Carol movie where like he gets visited by the ghosts uh and they're like they kind of tell him the story like I talked to one friend who's in a bad relationship and they're not getting out and I'm like dude this is not what you want they're like yeah but it's not terrible I'm like but not terrible isn't your goal and they're like yeah but like you know I don't know who else is out there when if I meet somebody else then maybe you know I'll feel and I'm like you're just not going to beat somebody else because you're dating this person and then I met another person who's in a job they did like same thing it wasn't a terrible job so they didn't quit and they would they'd be open to a better job but they weren't seeing a better job because they were so occupied with the one that they had and so I just kind of realized if you want something great you got to make space for great you can't just wait till your current thing gets so bad you have to end it or that this new amazing thing shows up at your doorstep and it'll be obvious to switch and you got to just say no to some some things that are just okay in order to literally create space so that a better thing can come and land in your lap and be there you have the time you have the Mind share you have the availability to take the meeting and something better lands and that's exactly what's happened this year better things have landed because I've done that and so now I'm like next year what else is there that's like kind of in that middle tier it's good not great bucket that I should just I should just get out what's it going to be um I'm thinking about what that what that might look like I I don't want to say just yet but yeah there's there's maybe some other things I could do to free up more time or create some space what do you think about that I actually well I um yeah it's funny you mentioned that so one of the problems with having a fund or raising money is that you owe people things right there's people that have given you millions of dollars and I actually had a moment yesterday where I had a really busy day and I woke up and I actually felt really excited and creative and I made this big list of all these things I wanted to dig into that I was excited to learn about and work on and then um there's a really wonderful guy who invested in uh a fund that we raised and he gave us I think 5 million bucks or something and he wanted to get on the phone and understand what was going on with an investment that we made and so me and Chris had to stop everything we're doing and talk to him and we had a you know we had a really nice chat with him but it interrupted my flow state it interrupted what I really wanted to be doing in my day and the problem with raising money is that at the end of the day there's people who can call you and you owe it to answer the phone and they can interrupt you at any given time and especially in a rolling fund there's like 50 of those people and so I feel the same way I really think that um when you give your time to something like that you're taking away from something else but that's we're going to get to best investment or maybe we can go right there but some of the things that you're doing contradict that and same with me totally yeah like I'm doing the Twitter subscribers for example but the thing about it is that I actually enjoy a I don't nobody can email me say I'm a Twitter subscriber I demand your time I've made it very clear that I'm only doing an AMA once a month I don't respond to tweets necessarily I don't guarantee any response and so most months I spend an hour doing an AMA that I find really fun anyway so for now I'm going to continue doing that but um but I've certainly considered that oh by the way I have an up I have an update on my biggest change from last year that IID said where I was gonna be less I was gonna learned when to use my impulsiveness and when not to totally failed at that um we there was a business idea that we had that we were like oh maybe we should do this business and I was like here's the reasons why I'm super excited about it but I was like you know what old Sean would have just started it now new Sean here's what I'm gonna do this business isn't going anywhere I'm gonna give myself a twoe cooldown period where I've done all the meetings I'm kind of like I know what's there I have the information I need but I still have to decide is this a business because you you know you don't date a business you kind of marry a business for like at least a couple years and so I said let me get my a twoe cool down period to get off the impulsiveness and I made it two days into the impulsiveness period before I had my first customer and I was running and it was so good and I was like oh I definitely didn't do the thing that I would have advised me to do which is to say if you still want to do this in two weeks then you know this is a great business for you and uh I I kind of failed at that I got to admit so still working on that one I'm gonna keep that one on the list for this year and impossibly shut down your rolling fun um let's do person you'd bet it all on uh so mine was between two of our guests actually Jason yanowitz and Austin Reef Jason yanowitz started blockworks it's a crypto Media company I don't even like crypto but I love Jason and I love his Media Company he scaled it to I don't know tens of millions in revenue and then Austin Reef started morning Brew who was my competitor now I've gotten really close to him because he's in my core group at Hampton but I'm gonna give it to Austin because he's already sold most of his business morning Brew I think he was 26 when he sold it at a 75 million doll valuation the company now is doing High eight figures in Revenue I think whatever Austin Reef does I would I would blindly put money in I I would I would invest in him blindly wow that's not who I thought you would pick Austin's amazing but uh that's a you've come full circle you're you your former competitor now turned dare I say it hero well look I love these people that have the perfect balance of optimism and pessimism you know like they're like optimistically PES P pessimist like where they think something amazing are is going to happen but they're fairly conservative and they plan for the downside so uh he's interesting to me cool who you got Andrew who would you bet it all on so mine's not really a business person necessarily um you know I've been thinking a lot about like AI disruption and I think that if I had to bet it all on one business that would be incredibly hard because I think in AI there's so many second order and third order consequences and levels of disruption so my thought was actually if I could just be an investor in a podcaster someone with a personal Monopoly and my idea was Andrew huberman so I think he's got a incredible brand uh and he's doing the thing that he loves and is kind of made for he's insanely likable he loves talking to all these interesting people about all these interesting things people have this incredible affinity for him and they will basically do anything that he says if people advertise with him or he talks about a product everyone will buy it which means that his ads like we tried to buy an ad for Aeropress a year ago we just got an ad for Aero press literally yesterday uh and I think we paid some you know very high number because his audience is huge did you see results from it yet uh I don't know yet I can report back um but anyway he his business I'm like that is a completely undisrupted business unless he gets hit by a bus or something the best line was from Rob deerdick we asked him how much it cost to advertise momentus uh on the pod on on huberman's pod and he goes I don't remember how much it was but I could tell you whatever it was it probably wasn't enough cuz he moved the needle for us that much yeah that's amazing all right my uh person I'd bet at all Sam are you sitting down yeah it's you bro me it would be you it would be you and let me tell you why let me tell you why not just for the reasons that you think you're talented but there's a lot of talented people you're smart but there's a lot of smart people out there I this year have really come to appreciate more than ever and I think it's because I've moved out of the I'm going to be CEO and operator role to more like I'm going to be investor uh and other trust other people to operate uh you know these businesses that we own um you the underrated trait that I had been severely underweighting in my little mental model was like are is this person going to be focused are they going to get distracted is this person going to be loyal and are they going to take this seriously and when it comes to that like we have a lot of friends that are you know they're talented and they're successful but they have shiny object syndrome I'm one of them uh we have a lot of people that will uh if they if they do something they kind of know they got 10 more shots on goal and they're just going to keep trying different stuff until they figure out the little thing that works every time you talk to them if you catch up with them every quarter they're GNA have a new narrative you're not like that and I've now learned that people like that they just win and the PE the people uh the people who are steady and and I and I feel like to have a certain level of seriousness about them uh when it comes to doing something like I don't really care what it is like when you were writing your blog posts for the hustle early on even before the newsletter just like yeah we're going to write a blog post that needs to get a bunch of people to um subscribe and follow us and you took it incredibly seriously and when you're hosting events you took it incredibly seriously and when you're doing Hampton you take it incredibly seriously you do one thing and you take it very very seriously and if I'm going to bet it all on somebody that's really what I want is a certain level of seriousness it's something I it's a trait I've come to admire like we hired a CMO into our e-commerce business and uh this guy Chris and he's amazing uh not because he's the most talented marketer and like if you go on Twitter every day there's these like Ecom guys I don't know if you guys see this or just my feed of guys just bragging about this like campaign they did and this new ad technique they did and he's not like that he's just blocking and tackling every day with a certain level of seriousness and the beautiful thing is I know this guy's going to stay focused and only work on this he does doesn't have three side hustles he doesn't have his own podcast and rolling fund he's just going to stay focused on this for the next four years and when he does that and he takes it seriously and he's gonna like do all the obvious things he's going to win bigger than the kind of like talented person who's all over the place and I know that's a big contrast to me because I'm more of the talented person who's all over the place but I've seen the value in the other side now and I'm like that's who I need to surround myself with because those people win well I appreciate you I love the love and I love you for saying that that's very kind I um I we had a m like we did these MFM meetups recently um and I called in one to to one last night Sean and apparently the thing is is they put on their badge who they like more you or me and they'll never tear us apart bro I don't even want to know the results They'll Never Tear Us Apart obviously every brown person every Indian person had shot but I was shocked maybe I shouldn't have been shocked you were you were a fan favorite so by you liking me and them liking you they are now my fans too maybe I hope um but I appreciate that thank you very much I think that um focus will change your game Sean and if you want you know like this is a little crude but you know how you're supposed to like rub one out before you have before you like do something bad with your with someone that you're not supposed to if you want love you you could do that to me I will help you I'll be your hand I'll keep you focused I don't know what that offer was but that was kind I think um I just offered my hand to you yeah I got you all right um all right what's the next one best business for someone else to go into yeah what what's a great business idea that someone else should go do do you know what we said last year I think mine was a washer and a washer and dryer that's two in one uh Andrew said empty empty leg flights and then Sean said school for Starving Artists like turn art into commercial things for example photographers yeah all right so I don't think anybody did any of those three so uh what do we got this year boys we got we gotta step it up I've got a pretty I think it's practical so since the beginning of this pod Sean I've said that I think privacy is going to be more important and it's G that's is a mega Trend I said that uh things like Duck Duck Go are going to get a lot bigger I think they have gotten huge but not as big as I thought because it hasn't been easier than it's been more like a a vitamin not necessarily a painkiller I still think uh it's going to get big that that space and I think in particular what you're going to see is companies who are tailored for it's going to start with first like Executives and people like us who are have audiences and it's going to be something like where they protect your information online so I've gotten like I've signed up for a few of these services and I'm alerted if one of my uh passwords gets hacked or they'll say like hey um we know where you live because because we saw you post a picture of your car and then we did Google Maps and we see your car in front of the house and we just predicted where you live and we and and and so I'm using a bunch of these I'm testing a lot of them out I think these are going to be really popular so for example cyber health. Co I've not used these guys yet but I like like the premise that they provide but I think what's going to happen is there's going to be it's going to start with like five or $10,000 a year services that are a little bit more towards Executives and then it's going to Trail down and I think genz is going to be all about privacy in the next 10 years so that's what I'm interested D that's a great one I like that one a lot I I totally agree with you this feels a little semi Glu TIY like uh hey wait is Sam on to something here I think you I think he might be on to something Andrew what you got what's the best business for someone else to go do so I love this one I think I would do this if um if I was going to start a business and uh my idea is AI Tinder so imagine you go on Tinder so so the what gummy thing about this is um Dolly and all these image generation tools can now create photo realistic images and I don't know if you guys have seen them but there's now Instagram influencers um who are beautiful men and women who make $10,000 a month on Instagram dude I just kept getting this I kept getting this lady come up with my Twitter and I'm like this lady's very attractive what's her story like why do I keep getting the same person going on my story and it they don't say she was fake but I'm like this is definitely fake this person's not real then I had to Google it and and she was fake yeah I mean and and they they can I mean it basically you can look at the image and almost not know so my here's my idea so you basically generate um like thousands and thousands and thousands of fake digital men and women and then you have Tinder and you basically um you make it like a casino right so you're swap you're swiping and let's say you match with a a really hot digital girl and then you have to text with her and there's some sort of algorithm where you have to win her over to exchange photos and start talking or whatever and I just think if you gamify dating right I mean it's kind of it's something that like you know people in relationships can even do this right it's just kind of like scratching an itch I think that's something that would just absolutely blow up but you're saying they know it's fake right you're saying you know it's fake the game is to it's almost like you know flirting as you're getting better and like people might see this as like creepy and it's like no these Bots can train people how to not be creepy right because you're never going to get another photo if you're creepy we've talked about replica do you remember replica it was like a digital girlfriend or boy and they like changed part of their algorithm or something about like what they allowed people to talk about and one of one of the guys killed himself like one of the customers killed himself like these people fell in love with these women these fake women so it's pretty wild yeah that's crazy all right uh best business for someone else to go do okay I had a couple ideas I think anything in the guns and ammo space I think is a great one um but I didn't want to pick that one I think distress Venture Capital Andrew I think you guys are on top of this which is a bunch of companies that are good products have revenues but they are not going to be able to raise their next round and they're going to go die and you know creating a business around that is good but the one I picked is Tik Tock shops so I don't know if you guys are paying attention to this but the number one book in the world right now do you know what it is it's the shadow work Journal number one book in the world what is the shadoww work Journal you ask well it's this goddamn book that you can't you is just going crazy on Tik Tok it's basically and what it is is uh Tik Tok not just launched the ability to shop they launched the ability for anybody to be an affiliate of any product without having a relationship with the company so created this giant like you know Network sales thing it's like almost like an MLM uh Tik Tok is turned into a giant MLM so basically you can as a Creator just find a product in the shop that's eligible for commission you make a video about it and you get a commission every time they go buy it that's why this this journal is the number one product in the world this sold over half a million copies of this journal yeah it's sold Tik Tok tells you how many it's sold half a million this is crazy and that's that's through the Tik Tok shop then you have Amazon it's the number one book on Amazon too so you add another half a million on that right that that's easily a million copies sold of this of this one journal and this is like in a two and a half three month span this is not very long and um you know I'm the type of person where I meet people like I meet Moyes and uh you know he's like yeah I did Facebook uh ads for Native deodorant I like okay well what worked it's like yeah back then you know the clicks were just super cheap there weren't very many people advertising on Facebook especially a product like this it was just mobile games or something and you're like damn man that was the The Glory era of Facebook ads now it's all so expensive now it's so competitive but you know if I was doing this in 2012 that was the time and you know oh I wish I bought Bitcoin back in 2011 or 2012 when my friend first mentioned it back it was you know $130 that was the time and I always wish I was there back in the time well guess what there's a Golden Arrow that's happening right now and it's Tik Tok shops right T Tik Tok shops is currently in that like it's very cheap it's not that saturated and Tik Tok is very motivated to promote these things and Tik Tok customers are not like fully acclimated to the fact that now a bunch of the Tik toks they see are selling products and so the conversion rates going to be higher and these windows don't last for very long but they do last you know and when you you can go make hay during these periods and so I think if I was uh you know 23 years old there's nothing else I would rather be doing than trying to create something that's going to sell through the Tik Tok shop platform Tik Tok is even paying for like they'll subsidize your product so if you have a $60 product it'll be for sale for $30 but you're still getting 60 because Tik Tok is subsidizing products that they want to promote and uh and giving you the full value of them so you're getting Tik Tok to pay for half the half the product sometimes or or 30% of the product sometimes it's pretty insane yeah this is wild and I see that guy Isaac from mini Katan or whatever what's it called Katana yeah mini katana like sharing all of his t TI Tok shop details and it's wild it's pretty crazy kind of like when the iPhone came out people start making apps for the App Store but you can see the charts you can see what's getting downloaded and the same thing with shops you can go see what's selling well and how many units it's sold and you can kind of either use that to either create a competitor or like just sort of like abstract away and be like oh it's this type of product that's doing well at this price point that's doing well on Tik Tok let me go let me go after that all right that is part one I got to go take a pee break get some water take a rest but we got so many trophies still on the table that have to be given out for the Millie Awards we got six or seven of my favorite categories we saved the best stuff for last so after this go listen to part two of the 2023 Millie [Music] Awards

[Music] we have here today the um I would say you did both you did both you fulfilled the Brown man's obligation you became a doctor but then you fulfilled the dream in your heart and you became a content creator and you are now one of the most popular YouTubers productivity guys that people know on YouTube this is Ali abdal welcome to the Pod man I've been watching you for a while it's uh it's fun to have you here thanks so much and I've been a fan of the Pod for years now it hard to believe it's been years because I remember when you guys first started out and it was actually you know how did you make your first million I was like who what a great concept for a podcast starting a podcast and everyone needed an angle and the my first million angle was just so good and I've been keeping up with you guys on Twitter and stuff for for ages as well so it's super nice to be here you gave us a big shout out early on in our podcast I think you did a video where it was like 10 podcasts that I like right now or something like that and that was a big deal for us that was when you that was when my first million was still a small podcast and I was like I've discovered something there's these two guys who like ask people how they made their first million this is incredible stuff I remember when I dm' Sam the name of the podcast I was like I think I'm I think about calling it this and he was just like it's so bad and I was like I'm like coming up with my response he goes that it's perfect Sam why did you why did you think it was so bad what is that so bad that it's perfect well I'm not particularly good at naming things my company was called The Hustle so I'm not good at naming things Sean you're actually quite good at naming things but it was for some reason it was it just I think that we've done a good job of appearing to be like internet markety Shady almost like on the surface like when I go to the barber and they say what do I do for a living and I I want to cringe when I say the name of the Pod but then I'm like but it's not what it sounds like and so we I think it's a good name because it grabs your attention but we've done a good job of staying on the right side of I think like doing the right stuff and having good taste that's honest I think I think it's a fantastic name I I came across some occasionally people on Twitter like to hate on Clips in the podcast I think because you guys are so open about talking about money and there was a quote tweet that I saw being like lol I can't you know what would you expect from a podcast called my first million and I was like that's perfect that's exactly what you'd expect from a podcast called my first million and I think the name is amazing and yeah I just love I just love how Brazen you guys are about talking about money loved the Neil Patel episode in particular you were just like asking him so specific questions huge huge huge fan of the show he to this day I give him credit he's the only guy that has a absurdly high life burn rate his burn rate for month was I think 180,000 he just said it matter of factly he's like that's what I spend for a month me and Sam fell out of our chair and we're like What are you spending 180,000 on and then he's like what do you mean of course I need that here I need that and he's like explained it 390s my two housekeepers my all of that stuff that Tik Tok clip has like 10 million views because it's the whole comment section just hates him in that for saying that but I respect him for coming on here and standing he he told his truth what did the kid say that's your truth man you stood by your truth so interestingly just on on the Neil Patel note uh I was at a a mastermind that he was speaking at and I asked him a question because our business was doing I don't know 5 million revenue or something like that and he was like man why are you in the info products business all you can make with info product is like 5 milon you should be in the agency business CU you can make a 100 million in the agency business and I was like oh but like I want a lifestyle business I want to chill out agency seem very stressful and he was like man I probably work less than you do I work like four five six hours a week and I've got hundred million do agency and then his CEO from the back of the room piped up and he was like no no no hang on hang on Neil's bullshitting right now every we have 800 employees we have so many people problems he's stressed all the time like do not think that running an agency is an easy business to be in just for the record I love that and I love that his CEO called him him out because you do you know our good friend Andrew Wilkinson and I think Sean and I are also victim to this as well where we oversimplify things and we act like it's it's no big deal it's very low stress and that's not the reality I was just texting my friend Austin Reef who runs morning brew and like morning Brew is a similar thing where on paper they're killing it on behind the scenes or uh in the public eye they're killing it and they are killing it and it's so simple it's just a newsletter wow news yeah how H can it be yeah and you know what we were bitching to each other about we were both saying how we have the Sunday scaries I was like I've got to do this podcast I got to prepare I've got this meeting and that meeting and then I got to go do run this errand and I think that it is not it it looks cool just like your life Ali your your life particularly looks cool you share your Revenue you're making profit you're living a nomadic life you got a book coming out you seem well you know you're put together there all of our [ __ ] stinks and it's all significantly more stressful than I think and it looks like what what's the uh what's the hot mess part of your life Ali the hot mess part of my life is that I generally don't enjoy filming YouTube videos uh which is do right yeah exactly there are there are lots of aspects about being a YouTuber that I really like and sometimes I enjoy making videos but I've made like 750 videos to date where I just speak to the camera and I've maybe enjoyed filming like 20 of them and it's kind of weird because like I I love the reading the synthesizing the learning but when it comes to sitting down like you know I I love doing podcasts because there's someone else on the other end and it's like there's energy it's more fun but just speaking to a camera on my own like it's kind of depressing um but hey you know that's that's the price to get the message out there and and I do enjoy other aspects of the process what else do you hate about it you said that there you said there's a few things you like and there's a bunch of stuff you dislike what do you what else do you dislike I don't like doing sponsorship ad reads I this is going to sound like very like first world problems cuz you know a sponsor ad read is I have to sort of stumble through my words doing it every which way the brand says that oh you have to say the wording in this specific way and then I'm kind of like yeah it takes me 20 minutes to do like a 60-second adre just because of all the stumbling and stuff that's that's that's going through there by the way our producer be honest our producer Ari is like grimacing because Sean's actually pretty good with words I Stumble a lot but I you so hubspot's our main sponsor I use HubSpot I like the product I own the stock whatever and I still freaking hate what they tell me to say because they phrase it such a way where I'm like that's not how I would say I didn't even know this feature existed so like it sucks man I'll do it'll take me an hour to do about five minutes worth of reads hey guys it's Q4 winning time and is with the new sales prospecting tool it's like oh God do I have to are you sure I have to say this or listen to this I can't even our podcast on the script they write read this word for word please do not change this one because like we have one we have some we get to improvise and some we don't or we'll do our reads and it's like check out my first million wherever you get your podcast you know like I don't even like doing our reads yeah uh we actually switched to HubSpot like two weeks ago um for or rather have started using HubSpot for our CRM because we never really had a CRM for our course sales and revops and all that stuff is that because it's Q4 and it's winning time it's Q4 and it's winning time actually may actually like I did my first HubSpot adre yesterday because they're now sponsoring my videos as well which is cool it's like as soon as we switched to them they gave us a discount on the package they're sponsoring the videos they're really good H love HubSpot check out HubSpot everyone our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better um I wanted to ask ask you about some of your productivity stuff because if I go to your YouTube channel which I have many times and I'll be honest when I usually go there I'm like okay he seems like so like such a good guy like someone you'd want to be friends with but I was like in terms of YouTube success he's not the the funniest he's not the sexiest he's not the smartest he's not the most successful guy on the platform but you really win and you do really well and one of the things you do well is you just share very useful just useful things and I think useful was actually kind of underrated um so instead of trying to impress everybody you just try to be a little bit helpful like a you know like a friend helping you out and you had this list of productivity things you do you probably got like 50 YouTube videos about productivity but you did this Twitter list that I thought was really good which was how you are more productive than the average person and I want to read you some of these and I want you to explain what they are because I didn't by the way Sean for the record he ranks pretty high on like the sexiest he's got the good London accent he's a doctor like he's dressed nice at least two notches above average on all of those things he's not the most in the world right like uh like if I go on Twitch there's some twitch streamers where I'm like I understand why she's doing well this this makes sense to me why this would appeal to people on this platform right I get it um all right so anyways let's go back to your productivity stuff so you have a technique you call the daily highlight what is the daily highlight uh one thing I would say before is before talking about this stuff this thread that you're referencing thing was actually a bit of a experiment I did a year ago where I got chat GPT to write the whole thing before chat GPT was cool uh so the first two are legit and the rest are just pure it's all [ __ ] made up by Ai and a few days I was blown away your best work I thought and a few days after I posted the thread I did another thread talking about how that thread was AI generated and now it's not news anymore because everyone's doing this but like at the time people were like oh my God AI is taking over our jobs AI is taking over the world but the day highlight is legit the daily highlight is a technique basically where you ask yourself what is the most important thing I need to do today and that's it like it's one of the by far the most simple productivity tip you could possibly have but it's so needle moving because so few of us actually Focus down on what is the most important thing I personally like to phrase it as what's today's adventure going to be because my whole shtick is to really to be productive you got to find a way to enjoy the process and even just reframing something in your mind as an adventure makes you way more likely to enjoy the process it's so true like we are all children inside and we can use all of these different tactics to make us feel good about the things that we're doing and Adventure framing is is one of them so that's the daily highlight with my kids whenever I need them to do something or like walk somewhere to do something like if I just say hey let's go over here they'll never like just wander around they won't come I'm like come on come on let's go but if I'm like hey guys it's a mission we have to find your jackets before we go outside and I'm like it's a mission like it's a mission and then they get really excited and then yesterday by myself I I couldn't find my uh my laptop I was like ready to do some work couldn't I had no idea where I put it in my house and I just told myself Sean it's Mission and I got kind of excited not gonna lie the third grade teacher technique Works Sam do you do this kind of one highlight like he says he calls it daily highlight I call it the one big thing where my to-do I have a to-do list of one do you do something like that or do you have a long to-do list every day look I know what the audience is thinking they think Sam you're this wonderfully attractive man you're so charismatic you're so productive but truth is is I actually struggle with this I I just have a to-do list I keep a notebook here and I just like make my list in the morning and frankly I find it very stressful and like not my productivity scheme is I find very unproductive what I believe and I actually think this is uh I believe Sean might do this too and I think this is actually maybe wrong of us is I leave a lot of open space and I just kind of Follow My Heart of like what's going on and I used to tell myself well Paul Graham said it's the manager versus the the artist yeah the maker schedule and it's okay to have open space and I find myself getting really stress when I have things on my calendar but I found myself just messing around uh far too often than I should be probably the the manager schedule the maker schedule and then the skater boy schedule around the house you know like uh what did Warren Buffett said we made a joke but it was real Warren Buffett says he just reads all day so I would just read like fiction books and I'm like oh I'm productive it turns out he's reading like annual reports you know he's working at actually but no I find my my I find my productivity schedule to be pretty shitty and I'm actually I wrote down the daily highlight and then the next one you have is The Hourglass uh I find some of those like little tricks actually helpful but I don't do anything do you Sean well I do the the one big I call it the one big thing in fact I had somebody build me a Chrome extension so that every time I opened a tab it would say your one big thing is and it's just a huge like text of what's the one thing and the beauty of this is um what I used to do like I used to do a to-do list list and here's how you here's how I would do the to-do list uh it would be written down so there's no particular order like I wouldn't rank it by like kind of most urgent or important I would just sort of write down the things as they came to mind and then I would like it's like if it's a plate of food I would just go for the french fries first every time so I would always do the thing that's not actually the thing I do I do the easy one I would talk myself into oh it's getting me a momentum and then I would go on a tangent and I would just never get the important [ __ ] done and I would never finish the to-do list everything I did would add stuff add more things to to the to-do list oh I emailed this guy okay I got to follow up he said send him the deck now I got to make it make the deck I gota right so I was always adding and it just was a source of stress so I had this um my coach my trainer he said this thing to me he goes uh you know what if you did it a little bit differently so you know like what's one thing where if you just had this one outcome of the day the whole day is a success whether you did anything else or not is there such a thing and if there's not then you're sort of like hunting mice you're just nibbling on little stuff you don't have anything that's actually impactful that you're that you're striving towards but if you have one impactful thing then that one thing should be enough for the day imagine just doing the one most important thing every day for 365 days out of the year you would outpace all the productivity nerds out there I've got these days Ali where like I feels like I was busy all day and at the end of the day I've got nothing done do you know what I mean mate I know exactly what you mean yeah I feel bad at the end of the day I don't feel good yeah I find that that happens for me a lot when I have like the day chocola block with calendar events and that's when I find that like you know as Sean said I I haven't made time to do the one big thing the daily highlight the adventure whatever the [ __ ] you want to call it and just honestly just doing that thing makes such a huge difference to everything else because it's like you've hunted the big thing and now you can hunt the mice if you really want to because like the small stuff does build up and it's important to you send that email send the followup all that crap but actually the thing that's really going to get you to where you want to be is generally making big progress on that one big thing and by the way it's not one big task I don't do it as one task it's one like outcome you're going for like oh today I'm going to find the right person for this role which might involve me doing five tasks like go through the applications short list the best five email them and research them or whatever right like whatever it is schedule a call with them but like it's one outcome that you're going for um what's this hourglass one is this is this for like time boxing yeah so The Hourglass one is is is interesting so one of the things that I've discovered about procrastination from doing a bunch of reading and interviewing professors about this [ __ ] is that procrastination is generally a problem with getting started with doing the thing because usually once you've gotten started like you have momentum and then you can like finish you know it becomes a lot easier to sustain the thing once you've gotten started and so how do we how do we hack our brains into just starting a task and back when I wasn't traveling around the world digital nomading I would have a f minute hourglass on my desk and I would just be like all right going to film the video for just five minutes and i' turn The Hourglass over and I would just genuinely tell myself I'm just doing it for five minutes and then usually I'm I'm into the flow of it and then The Hourglass time is way gone and I've I'm now into the flow with the task but sometimes I would just do the thing for five minutes and it's just a little practical I I I like physical things that help boost my productivity because it's like yeah you could set a timer on your phone but then you see notification and blah the the phone is too much of a multitasking tool whereas literally an hourglass that's five minutes is has one tool and that is this is the thing that stops me from procrastinating that's fascinating so you're saying that's a fascinating Insight procrastination is not um I'm putting off finishing the thing it's I'm push putting off starting the thing and as soon as you start you're light you know you're it's actually quite easy to just keep going and finish the thing for most people yeah absolutely the law of inertia it's like if you're you know one I I I still struggle with working out but if I just get myself to the gym and just do something for five minutes I'm there already I might as well keep going and it's kind of fun and I kind of get the endorphin rush and all that but it's that first step of like getting you know going downstairs to the hotel gym or wherever I am these days and actually just lifting the first weight that's by far the hardest part and that's the hardest part of any task just getting started I um I went to this like conference on Thursday and Friday Sean do you know Nick Gray of course I know Nick Gray he's the uh the inventor of the two-hour cocktail party there there really wasn't one until he he made it Ally do you know ni who have you seen Nick Ray yeah we hung out in Austin a few months ago great guy yeah so he's a character he's like a type of guy where you think you're hanging out with him and you're like is this a stick are you just acting and it's not like like for example my wife and I got lunch with him one day and he goes all right I have a list of topics first I want to talk about my dating life and then at 11:24 we're going to switch Sarah to what you're doing at work and then at 11:44 uh Sam I want to ask you an update on this thing like and it's like that's like his real life and it's it's like exhausting at first and then you realize it's pretty wonderful to hang out super intentional he's like the walking equivalent of may I have a kiss yeah he's like he's he's he's wild and for his 41st birthday he wanted to host a conference that's what he wanted to do and so he convinced Cloud Flair which is a stock that he owns and he loves and so that's why he did it there he convinced them to let him have this 40% event there and he had all these people come um and it was 40 people or so and we basically just went into groups of eight and we would discuss a a topic that was like it could have been parenting and you could go to the parenting one it could have been whatever and there was a bunch of YouTubers there so there was Patty Galloway who's a really fascinating guy and this other guy I met who I didn't know at the time his name was Josh wisman have you guys heard of Josh wisman he's a chef the chef he's a chef youber incredible YouTuber like n million subscribers yeah yeah or more I think it's like 11 million it's a lot and he was in the investing one with me so we were talking about finances and then I um there was a bunch of other YouTubers there and it was first of all it was one of the best events I've ever been to I've met so many interesting people but second there was like birthday conference you ever been to best best 41st birthday conference I've ever been to dude there was this one time so Nick owns a bunch of cloud flare stock and he goes hey I convinced a VP of cloud fair to come down here to meet me he has no idea what he's walking into and and he goes when you guys get here I need you to start cheering for him and telling him how much you love Cloud flare and so this guy this like he's the VP of engine he just walks in and he think he's just meeting Nick and we're like is that the VP of engineerium cloud flare tell us your mission and he goes oh Cloud Fair's mission is to make sure the internet doesn't go down and we're like I believe and we're like screaming and cheering and he like convinced this guy and he never told the guy that this was a joke so to this day this guy still thinks that we were there to like discuss how much we love Cloud Flair uh it was amazing but anyway all these YouTubers were there and about half of them didn't first of all they're making so much money I didn't it would be like a 26 or 27 year old guy who's making maybe 10 million a year if I had to guess a lot of them don't it didn't and by the way you want to know the craziest thing a lot of them they the biggest problem that they were discussing was like they kept a lot of their cash just in a checking account as opposed to like investing it because they were afraid to put it even into a high yield savings account which blew my mind of how many successful people do that but a lot of them it seemed didn't run their business like a business they ran it like almost a hobby but the numbers were astronomical making a million dollars a month I imagine but it seems like you're your business like a real business and like you've hired like I don't know 15 or 20 people um have you seen this with a lot of these YouTubers where they're just like it's like run like a 26 year old who's just creative as opposed to a a business yeah yeah I see this quite a lot this is like the biggest thing I talk about when I hang out with other YouTubers uh I haven't met many who are like 27 and doing tens of millions uh without treating it like a business I think that would that that's a very unusual state to be and by the way I'm not referring to that guy joshh I'm just referring to in general I met people I don't want to like break any confidentiality thing um yeah in general what I find is that a lot of a lot of YouTubers um they're creatives at heart and not business people at heart which is why they started YouTube in the first place and they have this Reliance on AdSense and brand deals in particular like I know I know a couple people with like millions of subscribers who are so stressed and kind of hate their lives because every video has to get a million views because if it doesn't get a million views then their brand deals revenue is going to go down and they need that brand deal revenue and especially entertainment YouTubers find it really hard to monetize off of the platform because it's not you can't just sell a course if you're an entertainment you all you can do is sell a course on how to do YouTube which your audience doesn't want anyway we saw Yes Theory you know you guys know yes Theory uh you know 10 million subscribers they tried to release a course about doing YouTube and the audience hated them for it and we released our course on like the same day about how to do YouTube We charged five times as much and our audience loved us for it so it's like there's this weird thing where entertainment YouTubers in particular are reliant on brand deals and that's a very stressful existence and I think business ifying and operationalizing and stuff is like the way a lot of these guys level up there was this one guy there who had this big audience and he said we were talking about cancelation like getting canceled for saying the wrong thing particularly with Israel and Palestine going on and like taking a stand and do you have to that was like the the discussion and this one guy was like I've basically created an audience that's going to cancel me sometime in the near future I don't know when but I know it's going to happen and uh and like that it was a really stressful uh uh a stressful life he seemed like he had he's like they're going to like I'm their monkey at the moment and I'm dancing for them but they're gonna come after me eventually and it seemed really stressful to be living that life yeah pretty stressful place to me I know one of one of my big things is all about like treating create treating treating the Creator thing more like a business because like almost no one that I speak to actually treats it like a business and I think if you do learn if someone's listening to this and they're a Creator if you learn like the basics of business like what is an sop and reading books like the emth and traction and things like that you end up with like oh [ __ ] I can apply all of these principles of business okrs and kpis and [ __ ] to my YouTube channel and therefore I can like oh I can use a CRM I can use HubSpot I can drive sales to a product oh that's cool and you get this whole new skill set which then serves you for the rest of your life but also really benefits your your YouTube channel or whatever the thing might be well let's put up on the screen on on YouTube your you did this you you're very open about how much money you make and uh you show your Revenue year by year so 2017 you did $227 which was your AdSense Revenue when you got started but then it goes 24,000 uh 130,000 so I want to point out here you're now three years in and you were a doctor so you're in three years basically making less of what a kind of traditional full-on doctor would would make I think you were like in your your um whatever the UK version of residency is some version of that but then 20 in 2020 you jump from 130,000 up to 1.2 million uh what happened there in that jump was that you released the course yeah so we that was when we had a whole year of releasing classes on skillshare which made like I don't know 500k that year probably less 400k and we released my YouTube course which was about how to be a part-time YouTuber uh which is not at all what I'm known for like I should have released a productivity course but I was like ah people keep asking me about this YouTube thing let me just make a course and it was the pandemic live cohort courses were all the rage then with building a second brain and right of passage and all these other cohort-based courses so after speaking to Thiago Forte and David Pell who ran these courses they basically talked me into charging loads of money for a life cohort course and then that became like it was meant to be a bit of a side Hustle but it ended up being the majority of our Revenue uh for the next like three plus years and that is still the cash cow that funds the entire business basically because more than half of our Revenue comes from this this one course it's now Evergreen and we've got like a service based offering on the back of it and like a higher ticket thing on the back of it but just randomly this idea in a coffee shop of like hey let me make a course about how to do YouTube has now just like transformed our business completely so that was the big jump from like 100k to 130k to 1.2 million then 4 million in 2021 4.6 I think that was the last one I saw in 2022 I think you finished a little higher than that maybe um and you're profiting you know the profit margins were very good so when you made 1.2 million in Revenue your profit was 950k so like incredible profit margins I don't know what that is roughly 80% or something uh and then you you know you've done two to two and a half million of profit the last couple years um I'm curious of two things one um why do you think your course hit when so many courses fail um or or fail to get get the same type of traction is it um what what do you what do you attribute that to [Music] um why did our course hit I think we got really lucky we got really lucky with the timing in the pandemic and the thing that I would tell myself the the thing that I would do differently is just spend a lot of time crafting the offer like at the time100 million offers hadn't come out I didn't even know what an offer was I'd never read a book about marketing I'd been on like Russell Brunson and Neil Patel's email list since I was like 13 but always thought they were a bit scammy and I was like ah what you know what could they possibly teach me uh like you know it's all just scammy clickfunnels [ __ ] um and so when we first made the course I think we got very lucky by just the fact that it just happened to hit at the right time when the course made real money was the final cohort after I'd read $100 million offers Doom secrets copywriting secrets and we revamped the entire landing page the entire off of the entire product purely based on the advice of what Russell Brunson and Alex hosi have written in their books and just literally following the step-by-step method and that was when a single launch of the course did like 2 million in a week isn't that hilarious I went to the the exact exact same thing where I'm like Russell Brunson Neil Batel scam and then I like start reading their stuff and I'm like no it's not a scam at all maybe uh I I think a lot of scammers consume that stuff and implement it but but it's definitely not it's really helpful stuff yeah it's incredible stuff when I first read.com Secrets I was like I cannot believe I've been sitting on this for 15 years like i' I I should have been reading all the Russell Brunson stuff from day one essentially the the the before and after was before when I was selling a course I was like oh I'm making a course and then selling the course it's like right so like what how can I just explain what the course is basically it was like a very sort of unsophisticated way of of doing things I didn't have any formula for writing a landing page I was just like oh I think maybe this should go on it I was just sort of making [ __ ] up as I went along and two years later when I read hundred million offers and doom secrets and explored this world of marketing a little bit more that was when I realized hang on people have been selling courses online for like 20 years plus at this point they've got a Playbook they've done all the testing and one of the big Minds shift was separating the offer from the Fulfillment of the offer like the thing that people are buying is the offer and the offer needs to be a grand slam offer to the point that people feel like they're a dumbass for saying no to it and then you can always worry about the Fulfillment later and there there's something weird about separating it into those two of like oh okay cool so now when when we make a course we just focus on the offer we're like until the offer is amazing and the landing page is amazing we're not even going to bother creating the course cuz like what's the point and the creation of the course will be sort of based on the offer is based on like you know talking to users and talking to people in our audience and being like hey what do you need to know about productivity um and then just following a formula for like funnels in terms of like upsells and down cells as per the Russell Brunson method and there's a really good book copywriting Secrets by Jim Edwards He's like one of Russell's like acolytes and that's really freaking good and I was like oh the headline is really important the subhead is really important [ __ ] this is the structure of a landing page you should talk about the users's problems okay let's just do that and we did that and that you know final Cod would have course did like 2 million in a week and I was like [ __ ] I wish i' done this earlier my issue with the the thing I've read all those books too and I think they're awesome my issue that I've always personally challenged struggled with is like for example in Alex Rosy's book he was like for Jim launch or whatever business he had he was saying like you know we'll prove that for you spend 40 Grand with us and then you make $150,000 an additional Revenue like we'll somehow prove that and if you don't you get your money back um what so here's like you got to make it irr IR irresistible so of course you're going to spend 40K you'll make 150k and I was like yeah that's that's irresistible but I got to figure out how to do that and and that's actually quite challenging I mean like it was hard just to come up I mean I could make a landing page sound amazing it's actually quite challenging with the course it's a bit easier because it's a sometimes a one-time purchase and you just have to like be like well here's just the information that I've got to give them how do you bridge that gap between fulfillment and promise yeah this was another big um sort of before and after moment beauty of it you don't that's when your team's values is just [ __ ] them um yeah exactly one of the big insights from from homo's book was this idea of like what what's the dream outcome like what is the actual thing that you're selling and I didn't really I didn't really have a have a a sense of this when we launched the course initially and I've been selling courses online since like I don't know 2013 or something and I I I just never had a sense of what is the actual thing that we're selling what I realized after reading the books is with our course our YouTuber Academy the thing we're selling is time we're saying we will save you time and that is all we're saying we're not saying we're going to make you money because that's we we cannot fulfill on that promise because like YouTube channels like very few succeed people have to put in the work all that crap but we can absolutely save you time and as soon as we changed all of our messaging to hey we just save you time if you value your time you should take our course cuz we've done all the work yeah you canol the the internet and find all this stuff for free if you want if you really want to but if you value your time join our course because we'll save you time saving time is a very easy promise to fulfill because obviously we're going to fulfill it and massively overd deliver on it and also we have a 30-day money back guarantee if someone doesn't like it for whatever reason we literally just give them their money back because we don't need the money so those two things we save time and we give you your money back if you don't like it that gives us all of the conviction we need that like actually this is a really [ __ ] good product because we are not promising hey we'll make you money do you have a so the business is going well I think in your latest video you're living you said you're living nomadically now you said you're going to do 5 point something million in Revenue um what's do you have like a like a Northstar where you're like I think the business can get to hear like is there a world are you one of these guys where you're like I want to get to 500 billion dollar business do you have an ambition and what is it and what businesses are you going to launch to get there yeah that's a great question um I actually don't and I'd love to get your guys take on this um my North star is when I'm dead and people are speaking at my funeral I just want them to say hey I was I was a nice dude but be that my my my stuff helped them in some way like helped them live a better life or like I taught them something or something like that like my whole North Star is how do I continue being able to learn synthesize and teach forever so I'm super inspired by for example people like Tony Robbins uh he's got his downsides but like the cool thing is he's been doing this stuff for 47 years and millions of people around the world say his stuff changed their life that's pretty cool Tim Ferris has been doing this stuff for like nearly 20 years and loads of people around the world would say he changed their life I would say Tim F has changed my life that's pretty cool so that's the North Star it's like how do I just it's it's that thing of like on once you're playing your infinite game which is what I'm playing right now like the only objective that makes sense is to be able to continue playing the game and so I don't have any Revenue goals I don't have any profit goals be I have a bit of a profit goal it's like let's just make as much profit as the year before at least please um but beyond that I'm I'm I'm not shooting for 10 20 50 Mill 100 million we are building like a SAS product on the side that I'm a sort of co-founder in you know I I like hearing the ideas that you guys come up with in the podcast I'm a subscriber to Trends just to see is is there anything interesting that I can I can come up with here but honestly for me the main thing is how do I just keep on being able to make content write books make videos do podcasts whatever whatever formats are going to come along in in the future to be able to teach and so being being a good teacher is my North Star so please do challenge me on that because I don't know if I'm bullshitting myself uh well I think you're definitely telling yourself a story but we all tell ourselves that whatever the answer is it's a story that one sounds like it serves you pretty well so so keep it I would say um you know it is probably worth worth questioning like if I just asked you what would be a more true answer I think what would be more true is I love teaching and if someone offered me an easy way to get to 10 million I wouldn't say no to it but if yeah so there is a number milon yeah the funeral thing I think is uh the part that smelled like you know where we borrow from others versus what's actually true in our core like what makes us want to do something um I personally have never been very motivated by like my actual funeral I do think it's a good signal it's a good side effect of a life well-lived um but it's not not something I would get excited about as like I'm going to do this because at my funeral they'll this will be remembered you know that sort of thing whereas it sounds like what you really have said is you love the learning part you like the teaching part you may not actually like the format you teach today which is um like YouTube videos you kind of admitted that you know you liked maybe 20 of the 700 videos you enjoyed making those but you really enjoyed the research and the learning part that that resonates with me I remember we did a set of interviews in La where we tried to book bigger name guests Mark Manson and Brian Johnson we booked all these guests and to do it I was like okay I'm going to do the best job I possibly can I'm going to research like as deep as I can go on all these people and I I did I went like I spent basically like two or three full days researching each of those people if you spend two or three full days researching somebody you have a PhD I have a PhD in Mark Manson like I I have fully researched him like I I went and found he was like had this pickup artist alra ego back in the day and I went and read all his stuff and then I read his first book that nobody even talks about models rather than the subtle art great book read all of it right and so then and I had so much fun doing it I didn't do three days because it needed three days probably needed three hours but I got into it and I could justify it because I had this big interview booked and we booked the studio so I could justify doing whatever the hell I want and so I indulged myself and just went further because I was enjoying it then came the actual interview and he's a great guy interview turned out fine but it was like a seven or eight compared to the fun I had in actually like going down the rabbit hole myself and actually trying to learn things uh it sounds like that might be true for you too where you the 10 out of 10 is the learning and the seven out of 10 is recording the content for for YouTube yeah I think for me me the the the learning is 10 out of 10 I I think teaching in real life is also a 10 out of 10 like when I go back through my life and think of the most meaningful moments like I quite enjoyed being a doctor but I enjoyed it way more when I had a medical student attached to me who I could teach along the way and you know on days where I didn't have someone I was teaching I would kind of be looking forward to going home so I could make YouTube videos but on days where I did have someone I was teaching alongside i' the time would just fly I wouldn't be thinking oh you know when's the day going to end I'd be thinking [ __ ] love this this is so fun um so I want to do more like live seminar live teaching e type things next year that's something we've got in the pipeline my my therapy my end of my therapy session for you is I think the actual North Star should be if your learning is a 10 out of 10 today find a way to turn the teaching into a 10 out of 10 and then you've won right because then you're literally just doing the [ __ ] you you you truly enjoy in the infinite game you can do that forever I also think Ali that like so my [ __ ] detector was going off when you were telling me what your goals are are because I think that you can have multiple goals so I think that I think that I believe what you're saying about how you how you want to be remembered and all that but I think that it doesn't sound I think it sounds like crude to say like well I would like to hit 10 million in Revenue Maybe by year eight or whatever and I I and I think that maybe you didn't say that because it sounds crude but I think that that's perfectly that's a wonderful goal I I think that like with me personally I think of this business thing you're past the point where it you you have security I think that it's the same way that when you're exercising you know you're like I want to run a 5k at this time um I'm not going to be devastated if I don't do it but it's just a really fun goal to chase after and I think that's the same with a lot of business stuff which is you want to net worth by this age or you want your business to hit this much in revenue or profit or users and I don't think that you need to stake your personal or your self-esteem or your personal self-worth on it but I still think it's exciting like when it's like man this new SAS thing I'm working on maybe one day this could make this much in revenue and if it doesn't it could still be awesome so long as I enjoyed it but that's just exciting you know like it's an exciting thing to shoot for or uh and I think that's okay to admit that but for some reason it seems like you didn't want to yeah I don't know I'm the thing that excites me is is and again I this could just be a story story but it honestly is that thing of I just want to learn and share cool stuff and that focus on the process focus on the things that are in my control has led to like the the score takes care of itself when you focus on the things that are on that that are in your control let me ask you a question you had this story about your the first business you ever launched and you were 18 years old and it didn't go well tell the story of this thousand business that you had when you were 18 years old what happened uh yeah so uh This was um from from like Agee 16 to 18 I was doing some like private tutoring I was teaching people how to do well in maths and science exams and [ __ ] and I saved up about $1,000 and then I was like okay I'm I'm rich now I can buy my first Apple product I was like yeah I can finally finally afford an Apple product and so I went out to try and find a MacBook Air and I bought one of some dude on Craigslist uh but it turned out after it transpired that he sold me a model that didn't work and it was really old and I was a dumbass so I didn't realize that he was selling me a kind of a dead a dead MacBook and so this $ th000 that I'd spent like years of my life working every week like hours of private tutoring like $10 an hour to get to this thousand suddenly all that disappeared and I was like cool I need to find a way to recoup these losses I need to find a way to build a business that allows me to make this money back and so I still have the Evernote file from 2012 when when I was 18 where that happened where I was like okay what am I good at I'm good at teaching I'm good at med school entrance exams I know how to make websites so let me build a business that combines all those things and that was my first business like I've been trying to make money on the internet since age 13 hence why I was on Russell Brunson and Neil Patel's email list since then but that was the first business I made that actually succeeded where I had this strong desire to do it and found this combination of things that I was already good at and then that business did like 10K E1 100K E2 150k E3 and actually sold that business a few years ago to go full-time on the YouTube channel um but because my YouTube channel originally started off as content marketing for that original business which was teaching courses of how to get into med school I've probably I don't know in total yoube Channel and all the stuff around it's probably done over 10 million Revenue so my $1 thousand loss which was like felt lifechanging at the time has now transformed into like a 10 million kind of upside um and I feel kind of like that's kind of cool like at the time I thought to myself I'm going to find a way to turn this thousand loss into a really good opportunity and that was when that first business really really started and and took off Sam have you ever had that have you ever had like a big L that turned that what felt like like a big L in the moment that turned into a w my whole thing was uh like just growing up where like my parents controlled money and where it was like you you're not allowed to do this or you know like when your parents say like well if you're living under my roof you're G to do this and I there's been many times where I was like at a very young age I was like all right fine money equals power then and then basically everything that I've done since then has been because my parents probably because they said to me a handful of times and I said all right then I'm going to be completely free and money is one way to achieve that freedom um yeah yeah I mean it all stems basically every great business person I think probably stems from some type of childhood trauma whether it's your parents telling you no or you see your mother uh be poor or you get scammed out of a Macbook when we sold the milk Road I asked the guys I was like man you guys have been they've just been doing different businesses for so so long and they had a pretty interesting track record like small wins big wins [ __ ] like that and um I was like what's the driver because like you know once you if you Bank a100 million and you're still taking risk in starting businesses like you're not doing it for the money I don't believe and uh I was like what's the driver or what's and he's like I don't know what it is now he's like but for a long time he's like both of them had the same story and it wasn't like this wasn't on the podcast this wasn't to look cool this was like us hanging out and he said it matter of factly he's like yeah this girl reject to me when I was like 14 years old and he's like I like I literally felt like [ __ ] and I was like okay like I don't want to be rejected again how do I make myself awesome and he's like I didn't know what the answer was but I immediately started to be like Oh I'm if I'm if I'm okay at this I'm good at this I'm gonna become awesome at this instead and so he's like I was good at like the internet making websites stuff like that and I just like went into overdrive and he's like the other guy had the same story he's like yeah I lived in this he's like I had six friends and in college and they had H we wanted to live off campus together and they got a house that only had five rooms and I was the odd man out and I was just like [ __ ] these guys I'm gonna okay I'm gonna go live in my by myself but I'm gonna like I'm gonna go into the hole and I'm gonna come out a different guy Sean because you seem like you've had your act together I mean you've seen emotionally stable yeah I've had a few things like this probably not like not like some huge disrespect or nothing I was that aware of but I do remember like I remember hearing this story so I went to this I got into this random accelerator that I don't even know if it exists anymore it's called the mass Challenge and they used to invite these speakers in was in Massachusetts and uh one time was at this this event they had in uh Ben from Ben and Jerry's was there and he told this story about Ben and about the starting story of Ben and Jerry's there's all these like interesting funny things like he starts it off being like yeah I met Jerry cuz we were both like in PE class and and uh I was like you know there people like did you guys get along right away he's like no but we were both the fat kids so like we would have to run the mile every day and um we were just walking at the back and like first we didn't talk for the first two weeks and finally it's like all right what up man like you know it's you again and so they became friends that way and he talks about like you know they start this they take this five he uh one of them was trying to get into med school and he failed the entrance exam five or six times in a row um so like you know he basically for several years couldn't get into bed school and so they instead took a $5 ice cream making course together and uh that's like you know part of how they learned how to make ice cream for Ben and Jerry's so they open up this shop and uh it wasn't like pints like you see today it was a shop but it was in Vermont in the freezing cold winter and uh so they're about to go out of business like in month three because nobody wants ice cream when it's already they snowing outside it's like a blizzard outside and so they uh you know they they're all right what do we do we're screwed so what do we do and they had this uh that came up with this promotion it's like this long acronym like nine letters long and it stood for one cent off per degree celsius under you know freezing or whatever and so you got like 12 cents off if it was 12 below freezing and so they uh and that like that promotion was funny people liked it so they like came and like pied them and basically B bought a little ice cream took them through the winter so then they were like still struggling and they started the strategy of like making pints they're like oh let's go to restaurants and give them the pints because otherwise it's just going to melt here nobody's coming to our shop and eventually they get into corner stores and they start selling and finally the business is working and they're like oh my God this is great we sell we sell pints to these corner stores and they sell our product for us this is a good business and then one day um like they stopped getting orders from like a whole area in uh where they lived and they were like what the hell happened they go and they talk to the store owner he's like oh guys I didn't want to tell you this but you know I got word from from big ice cream he's like what he's like yeah hog and came to us and uh hogendas which is owned by Pillsbury Pillsbury sent us this letter said I don't know who this Ben and Jerry is but like you need to stop selling their stuff only sell hogendas uh or we're pulling all Pillsbury products from your shelves he's like dude he's like I need my crescent rolls I can't do I can't do this guys I'm so sorry and so the guys are like [ __ ] we're screwed but they had this value which was like turn the disadvantage into an advantage and so they were like all right how can we use this and so they created this um whole campaign called what's the Doughboy afraid of and they would put a they would print these like posters that were like the pint of Ben and& Jerry's with the giant like do Pillsbury Doughboy hands about to strangle it and they would just say what's a doughboy afraid of and then on every pint of ice cream they sold they said we're under attack call this number to hear the story about what's going on why Pillsbury is trying to put out your favorite uh ice cream brand and then they recorded like an answering machine that would just tell the three-minute story and say like if you think this is screwed up buy these stickers and buy pint of ice cream just to you know show Pillsbury you won't you won't be bullied and eventually the New Yorker takes the story and you know Jerry standing outside of pillsbury's headquarters by himself picketing as if he's a protester and they take this picture they' run this in the New Yorker and Pillsbury has to like completely back off because it looks terrible for them as a you know as a brand to be doing this and secondly a whole bunch of people found out about Ben and Jerry that didn't know about it before because this story was a lot more interesting than just here's a cool ice cream brand started with these hippies and Vermont and so then they exploded in sales and that they became successful and I remember hearing that and so everything that would happen in our first business like we were you know 20 years old basically trying to start the sushi chain everything that would happen we'd get rejected or we' get a cease and assist letter or whatever it was we were like this is our pillsberry moment all right what's the dough boy afraid of how do we flip this and so very quickly it went from like anything that was bad we got hyped because it was like this could be our story that we're telling someday and that just became like embedded in my mind and so I almost don't even remember the individual like kind of like rejection moments because it was all like all right how are we going to use this to go viral how are we going to use this to uh to our advantage and that's just like I don't know what I've been doing for like 15 years since by the way olly welcome to my life so I asked Sean a question he tells me this amazing story where I'm totally enthralled I was into it he does such a good job of telling the story and I'm like I don't even know what to say I'm interested wor yeah like fall down this slope but I'm like I don't remember what I asked but like what else you got keep keep tell me tell me another tell me learn from you ollie I want to learn uh about titles so I think that one of the reason your course does so well is that it's not called you know how to be how to you know be famous on YouTube It's called The part-time YouTuber Academy and part-time I think just appeals to a whole different segment of people and I always think about these choices because when you see the title what you don't see is the 50 other options that were considered and I think about this with like your entire Channel like if I go to your YouTube channel right now and I by U let's say popular right um you know some of your titles are just really good you know how I type really fast all caps and then 156 words per minute or um how I ranked first at Cambridge University the essay and you're the thumbnails you're holding up like this notebook that looks like it's got you know the secret instructions inside or my evidence-based skincare routine so even though I said you weren't the most beautiful guy you got good skin and you but saying my evidence-based skare routine is so different than just saying my skincare routine um I'm curious what's your method to Madness on getting good at titles or how you come up with the stuff yeah nice um we think a lot about titles what we found basically is that the only thing that allows us to predict the performance of a video is just the title it's not even the thumbnail some people like thumbnail but like in in an educational Channel my thumbnails look broadly similar it's it's very rarely the thumbnail it just tends to be the title if we know that if the title is good then by default the content is going to be at least reasonable and useful that's our main thing is like is this useful and so the video is going to fly or Flop based on the performance of the title how do you know the title will be good though by the way that's the same offer separating the offer from the delivery of the of the offer is the same principle right exactly it was the same thing for the book you know we it took like about a 100 iterations to land on Feelgood productivity as like the thing we had I have still got my Apple notes follow with like hundreds of title options trying to get at this idea of like being productive in a nice fun joyful sort of way and the title actually came to me in the shower like two years into the Journey of writing the book on just on that note one thing I would do differently next time is any feature book that I write I would make sure I've got the title nailed before trying to write the book because the title informs the concept and the hook which informs everything else and there was so much like surgery we had to do on the book once we came up with that title to be like ah okay that's the title so now let's rejig everything in the book to make sure it like matches the promise you know the the offer the title in the thumbnail of of the book um but when it comes to YouTube videos we just do a lot of iteration he's like how do you know a good title from a bad like when you're when you're trying to decide what what are your obviously it's just a judgment call over time you get a bunch of intuition but is there anything you do or anything that led you to be better at titles yeah we do a lot um we we have the strategy that we cutely called viral replication which is that by the the way you grow a YouTube channel is by getting a viral video and the easiest way to get a viral video is to just copy the title of another video that's already gone viral so a lot of our best titles have been just looking around on YouTube sometimes within an nich sometimes outside of an nich and looking at the view to subscriber ratio of that particular video so like back in the day I saw some guy May made a video like how I use my iPad as an engineering student I was like okay interesting but that video had like 2 million views and the dude had like 20,000 subscribers I was like huh that's that's interesting there's something about that title that's really popped so I thought how I use my iPad as a medical student sounds cool so I made that video and that was the first video on the channel that went viral that got over a million views I was like huh six million views and it's how I take notes on my iPad Pro in medical school is that the one yeah that's the one um and that was the that was about a year into my channel yeah are you using software to help you do this or you just browsing uh we're browsing we're using vid IQ the Chrome extension which shows us the sub subscribe account of the channel just next to their name because otherwise you have to click on it and see what the Subscribe account is um we've also now started becoming more sophisticated with AB testing titles and thumbnails so we use thumbnail test.com uh which is made by one of our Twitter friends to just test the [ __ ] out of the back catalog um and that generates a bunch of free views basically every day because we can refresh an old video that's like three years old by just giving it a new title or a new thumbnail it's a lot of like repeating that process over and over again before landing on a title we often have like 20 titles to choose from and sometimes if we're really not sure we'll like test it on Twitter and on Instagram and on YouTube Community post we'll say hey which of these four titles would you be more likely to click on and often there's like a clear winner and we're okay cool let's just do that and we make sure we don't even think about writing the video until we have nailed a title because obviously like the the framing of the title and thumbnail radically informs the way you can do the video our producer by the way I just saw her look down she's like taking notes on how we can improve our Channel what's the um what's the software bit you're fooling around with because I bet you've seen a lot of interesting creators launch cool businesses I bet you've had a lot of opportunities run by you why did you sell this one and what is it yeah so this is uh we're actually launching like this week uh it's called voice pel and it's like a a voice notes meets AI transcription meets converting your voice note into like a summary which you can then turn into a tweet thread or a LinkedIn post or a journal entry or whatever you want uh it's not launched yet voice. me for whenever people are listening to this it will have been launched by then uh this is an idea I've I've kind of had floating in the back of my mind partly thanks to listening to your guys' pod for a few years which is that creators have a massive distribution Advantage but do not know how to make products uh product people know how to make products but really struggle with distribution So in theory if you can combine those two things if you can pair a creator with a product that fits Their audience nicely now you're winning because the product guy makes a product and the Creator has the distribution and so I partnered up with a friend of mine who's a second time founder he's exited like two well third time founder he's exited two companies um and he was like hey we should totally build some cool productivity software together and I was like yes we absolutely should and so the first idea that we're launching is this thing called voice pal which is like yeah you record a voice note and it transcribes it and it can turn it into whatever whatever you want and we're trying to figure out like the messaging around this like double your productivity using your voice something to that something to that effect and we're going to be launching this week for our thousand beta testers and I'll post it on Twitter and Linkedin and the newsletter and hopefully we'll just get those thousand people very quickly how much you going to charge yeah we're thinking like $10 a month initially um we've already got like 20 paying users uh from the alpha friends and family test that we did where we s of found 30 people like 20 of them were like super super power users and almost all of them converted to paid when Pablo the co-founder reached out to them to be like hey would you like to buy Early Access to this and a lot of people are using it already for like journalists and like lawyer and stuff for like recording depositions and and things like that a bunch of people are using it for journaling as well so one thing that I'm really bullish on is like you know to to your point about wouldn't it be cool to get to 10 million Revenue I think the way we get there is I don't try and get there through content but we try and get there through building cool software products on the side that I that I use personally that I would like oh I would [ __ ] love a journaling app that does this I'd love a to-do list app that's different to things and to do is by doing this I think that's so smart and then we plug it to our audience I think that's I think I I I think I would agree with that that theory of you're not going to get to where you want to go by doing the content Revenue itself have you guys seen the app opal so it's opal. so it's like um no man you guys got to check this out so opal. Soo so it says find your focus make the most of every day with the world's greatest screen time software so the problem with iPhone software is that you know like the screen time thing you can just click like Bypass or whatever so somehow these guys made it to where I can't bypass so between eight or nine and 6 p.m. I cannot go on social media on my phone and they've done it in such a way that like I I literally can't bypass it and it's like $120 they've got a crazy amount of reviews and I think that what I think is going to happen is I think I I think there's already a lot of these but these like screen time Focus session app apps I think historically have done pretty good so they're there's a few ones for the past couple years um there's Chrome plugins for this but this one in particular is the only one that's stuck with me um I don't I have no idea who these guys are this isn't like a promotion I just I just thought it was cool I could see you launching something like this I think they charge $200 $300 for a lifetime license and then $100 a year um but I really like like if I'm you I would just look at what are the most what are the best uh apps out there for productivity who's spending the most on advertising and how do I acquire a small part of their company or something similar because I don't have to my margin will be their advertising budget yeah that is like exactly the way we're thinking we're sort of thinking of it as a sort of barbell strategy where there there's a couple of companies that I've invested in to get like a small Equity stake in in the company rise is one of them r i z uh they're like another focused time tracking e type thing that I've been using for like two years and so we we invested in them but we invested sponsorship dollars so like however much it was like four sponsorships worth of investment into the company and it's great because I use it every day I love it it's easy to recommend and when I say I've invested in a thing it's like people like oh he like he liked it so much he actually invested in it so that's for a small Equity stake and then on the other side we're trying to do the sort of co-founding uh software product for like a 20 or 30% Equity stake so I'm trying to try and experiment with both but I'm particularly bullish on like building our own [ __ ] because I think that's where I get to mold the direction of the product in a way that personally suits me and one of the cool things about that is like what I love trying to find is apps where but apps where I can share a screenshot of the thing which promotes the app without it looking like a promotion so for example whenever I do a workout I use the app strong and I just screenshot it and post it on my Instagram story and I will always get like dozens of comments being like what app is that right annoys me because I'm like this is an app I don't own and it's just really good but if I did own the app strong or a workout tracker and I was just posting screenshots of my workouts no one would think I'm plugging a product they would think oh he's sharing screenshots of his product right so I'm I'm always looking for for these organic promotion opportunities that don't look like they're that they don't look like they're or like another one is SC scrier is that what it's called I know you love that app that writing app which I think it's just like a guy in like Montana or something like you know a little bit random like that who owns that writing tool um but you should acquire stakes in these businesses or launch some of their own and I think you'd be very successful at that yeah yeah one thing I've been thinking a lot is that with a lot of these productivity apps they tend they tend not to be differentiated on the product itself like fundamentally all to-do list apps do the same thing and when you watch reviews of them it's like oh well things three has slightly nicer animations and todoist has like teams and this one is available on iPad so you should get that it's like the the the product features that that differentiate these are so small so if we could in theory just clone one of these with in our own way in our own design language whatever and we've got feature parity on the product side we would have a distribution advantage and the market for these productivity apps is so huge that like you know a few users would be would be pretty good how many users to let's say if you owned scrier or opal how many users could a handful of your videos Drive do you think um probably thousands to tens of thousands based on what the uses are that we drive to like skillshare and Brilliant and these other like sponsor type things if there's a good fit with the audience then yeah there was a time where Sean brought up some company that does accounting or his taxes on the Pod um and then afterwards he asked he I don't think Sean you didn't have any he didn't he had no stake he was just like I just met this guy and it was cool and I ended up using their product and it was interesting here's what it was and then he like hollered at them two weeks later and was like did you see a bump and the guy was like raving you know I don't know what numbers I'm allowed to say or not but Sean you could decide if you want to say it or not but it was like a substantial sum and your cend Le was booked out like four months or something like that I don't know if they didn't have a lot of slots or what happened but like that was uh that was great for them um when when that happened yeah but then we both had a light bulb moment and we're like yeah oh there's something there you know what I mean um now of course you have to pick and choose which ones you do and you can't do too many at one time you probably should only do one at a time for a certain amount of time but yeah like we had that same moment as well um so one thing that we did we so we recently launched well recently a a few months ago um a studio called Hey friends which is like a done hun and sah yeah with Hunter and sahill oh yeah because like you you guys are working with them as well um and one tweet from me and yeah just like one tweet drove two million mrr worth of leads that they're still like going through the sales calls and like trying to shore up capacity because there's so many people this 14,000 uh Mr worth wow okay that's a [ __ ] yeah there were like literally hundred hundreds of people that signed up for a 14,000 a month sales call and they were like [ __ ] like we can only onboard like one or two people a month cuz we need to hire editors and script writers and all this kind of stuff and it was just like one tweet and Twitter is isn't even my main platform but I guess it's where people with people people like you guys are more likely to read a tweet of mine than watch a video so if I'm like hey I've got this 15K a month YouTube as a service thing it's like that drove so many leads and we're like H that's interesting capacity now we did this thing I think two years ago Sean or maybe no maybe a year ago we we were like okay so we understand how there's these billion dooll businesses built on Instagram that that's been done uh maybe a couple times uh with the Kardashians and a handful of other people it's very plausible that it's happening or has already happened with YouTube Mr Beast and there's whoever you know there's many more that have built businesses that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars maybe even more on YouTube it hasn't happened yet with Twitter and our prediction was like this is going to happen more and the reason it's going to happen more is because a there's a business audience on Twitter a bit more than those other platforms so you can sell higher pric things and B the conversions quite high so like I don't know what the click theough rate on your video so how many people click a link to to your products it probably is less than 1% on Twitter it's not crazy that to be 5% at times we post a link and 5% of people click it and we're like wow we could just drive way more traffic to a website it hasn't happened yet I think it's in the process of happening hopefully Sean and I and a couple of our friends are are in route to doing that but I think it's gonna happen in the next five issu who's even Twitter famous right like I can I can go on YouTube and Instagram and I know like oh I don't know who Charlie demilio is but I know that that's a person that's Tik Tok famous like started on that platform got huge on that platform has a huge fan base on that platform you could say Dan Bilzerian and others were doing that on Instagram when Instagram first came out and on YouTube you had you know whoever tons tons of people Mr Beast and others I don't even know who that would be on Twitter like who the hell is Twitter famous like sahill maybe sah is our friend sahill the most Twitter famous guy out that that's the biggest like no F to sill sahill is great but like shouldn't it be a famous person like shouldn't there be like the whoever you know like like Mr Beast is like massive PewDiePie was massive these were like massive massive creators who is that on Twitter I don't even know like is there and I'm on Twitter all the I guess you or our friends I don't I don't know it can't be think why does it not have that that's insane I think it also really depends on what audience you're going up like normal people have never heard of SEL Bloom the only people who have are the people who are in our sort of like business yeah that's what I'm saying so who's Mass market like you know on Instagram it was like beautiful people went they were the mass Market famous people right and then on YouTube it's like the funny vlogger Types on Twitch it was like best fortnite player in the world all right fortnite's super popular makes sense that Ninja's super popular and Dr disrespecting these guys shroud whoever I don't even know who those people are on Twitter who is like like is it Elon is he the only guy who is like or famous on Twitter oh yeah Trump like they're famous they were famous off Twitter which is why they're big on Twitter like is there anybody who's just natively so good at tweeting that they just got huge because if not something is broken about this platform it's not broken my point is it's small it's small so how many how many users does Twitter have I don't know three or 400 million million yeah yeah a fraction compared to what the other platforms have so it's just small um and also it's text based so it's a little bit less EX so like uh and you don't exactly see like the view count like you do on YouTube so I see Ali's video that has 6 million views and I'm like oh many other people know this person I'll see a tweet just randomly through my my feed and I don't NE it's more one to one versus one to many so I don't know that other people's are people are consuming it but that's okay it's no it's there is no famous people but that's okay you I think you could still build a big business because there's people like Ali or you or I on there who will SP money years Twitter's like 20 years old it's if it's not big now it's never getting big like it's a 20-y old product there's 300 million people what like who's more than 10 million followers is there like who who is not already famous like Trump and Elon take them out that has more than 10 million followers organic I don't know like I know that got popular right like you that's insane to Me Maybe it's like a couple yeah there's maybe some of these like crazy you know like fjerry like is there even like an fjerry type of account on Twitter I don't know I don't think so is somebody who knows is just yelling at their podcast player right now like why aren't they saying blah blah blah obvious so we're all friends with the most famous guy on Twitter s Bloom yeah congrats and what is it that you say a dwarf amongst midgets yeah that's basically what's going on here like uh well the only reason he's famous is because he's Indian so he has a billion potential fans and he's ripped so he's already's G to track all the dudes by the way it's never women that are attracted to the rip dudes it's always other men like me who see a RI guy uh and he like talk talks about productivity so he's got this whole other angle so he's like this he's a he's a triple [Laughter] assassin he gets Indian followers he's not Indian he's also half Indian so he's super hot also right like amazing combination of dude if he had Alli accent it'd be over yeah if he had a British or a London accent and was sound it all proper he he's got it all he's uh he'd be he he'd had everything um Ali thanks for doing this man the name of the book what is it Feelgood productivity it's coming out in January or December 26 right yeah December 26th feel good productivity it's about how to do more of a to you in a way that's right enjoyable meaningful sustainable yeah yeah did you not know that most gifts are bought literally three days before that exactly [ __ ] good point procrastination date for the prot there there was this whole like astrology that the Publishers did where they were like well if we go before Christmas we're competing with cookbooks and like celebrity Memoirs and those are often gifted over Christmas rather than like self-help books but if we go just after Christmas people are on a new year new me kind of thing so maybe that's when it'll hit I'm not sure how much of this was astrology versus like actual data but I mean they seem pretty switched on so so maybe there was some data behind it as well and your cover looks like an air table spread sheet the cover we okay here here's the thing with with these sort of books the the reason Atomic habits was so successful is because it was picked up by the demographic of uh women in their 30s in the midwest apparently which is like by far the biggest demographic of people who buy books and especially people who buy self-help books and it really hit that crowd like sometime in the pandemic K of the world a bunch of a bunch of ladies named kiny yeah that kind of thing you know they got two kids that kind stuff and so the publisher was like look productivity is too broy we we need to have a cover that will be a bit more gender neutral feel a bit more like kind of fresh and inviting and yeah productivity is likeon D yeah good point yeah sounds about right um but that's why the cover is all like bright and colorful and St it's also my vibe I like bright and colorful well the landing page is beautiful it looks good man you're going to kill it congratulations on all this um thanks man than thanks for uh giving us shout outs and and we'll uh we'll have to repay you in some way when your book comes out and and we'll share it but we appreciate you coming on and uh we'll wrap up here that's the [Music] pod [Music]

dude I was at of dinner and somebody said something as a joke and I put up my finger to my lips and I said I need to write this down because it was an incredible idea the guy goes you put his you put your finger on his lips and then my own lips back and forth and um I was like say no more I need to don't I don't want to lose this idea let me write this [Music] down so today you're going to talk to talk us through a bunch of research products that you use a bunch of a bunch of pipes you call them right yeah internet pipes I called it research tools you said that was dumb well it just sounds boring it's more accurate but it's boring I call them gold mines which is basically some people just come back and show you a little piece of gold maybe a jewelry Steph shows you where the mine is so you can just keep going back to the mind for more and more gold over time because I think people wonder uh you know if they see your tweets or read your blog post hear you on on our podcast they're like where does she come up with this stuff how dides she find this stuff so today you're going to tell us exactly that yeah yeah exactly I think you know the internet is such a special thing and we often rely on something like Twitter to serveice the information of the day but I feel like these tools are like like you said the gold mine there's so much information that tells you exactly what people want or um Aggregates a bunch of opportunities for you so Steph tell me about this patent one because there's actually a handful of like really good examples with this one okay that I can that I know of so there's two parts there's patent filings and patent expiries so patent filings I think um there's probably some databases that do this but the newsletter that I like to read is called patent drop and they'll basically break down every newsletter three or so patents from again big Tech firms like Fang um but also companies like Nike um by the way I think Nike is the company with the most design patents sort it's up there um in any case there's patent filing so you can track what these big companies are betting on what they think is interesting that they want to you know retain some IP around and then there's also expiries um which is interesting I think uh we covered the company hyns before and how they basically leveraged a patent expiry um to build their company or at least their first products um so there's a website called patents expiring today.com which Aggregates these and obviously it takes quite a bit of sifting because there's a lot of things like okay I don't care that some shinard is um expiring but um I think the combination of those two uh definitely can can result in some business ideas have you guys heard of bluechew you guys know what bluechew is blue chew yeah so about three or I don't think they target you in ads but they target us for sure yeah basically about six weeks ago I went to these guys' office and I met the two Founders and one of the founders is a doctor and the other one was a Commodities Trader and basically they worked together and they were like what can we start and they saw that the Viagra patent was going to expire in 2017 and so they like were just plotting and plotting and plotting and HS gets a lot of credit for doing this but bluee I think is actually more interesting so what blueo does is I think they also own med.com so it's basically a a tella Health business where you call in and you say what your issue is their main thing is uh their pill I I guess I don't know if call it blueo the name of the pill but it's a for erectile dysfunction which I didn't realize it it it's like the customer base for that is like 150 or 200 million people in the world and then it's projected by 20 2030 to be like four or 500 million so it's a massive amount of people who have erectile dysfunction disorder um and they bootstrap this company and they didn't I don't know how big they are but I'm pretty sure they're between1 and $200 million a year in sales and they entirely bootstrap the company starting 2017 and it was because of that patent that expired and they built this business because of that yeah that's it's an incredible example another kind of one chart business all you had to do is just show here's the business plan this is the expiry date of Viagra we're gonna make the you know the DDC generic version and uh yeah they just do it through Instagram ads whatnot they own I think it's meds.com so meds.com I think is the tah Health side um and then they have bluechew which is like their product I think it's like seala Viagra and one other that are all uh expired now yeah I went to their office and we were playing poker and they had like a sample like instead of having like breath mitts it was like a sample of like you could just reach it and take one and I was like I was like my wife had a baby like two weeks ago I don't think I need this but like what happens here's a room also a padded room you could just go stand in to see the effects and nobody will look at you then come back when when you're done yeah I was like I don't know if I'm going to if this is going to like be in use anytime soon in my house but uh but they I was like looking at some of their numbers particularly on similar web and they had like two million people a month coming to their website and I was like doing back of the ma back the envelope math I was like I'm pretty sure this is a massive massive company hims gets a ton of credit because they're publicly traded and they're started in San Francisco and they had all this press I think this company is probably almost as big and I'm pretty sure the two guys own most all of it they haven't taken any financing and so anyway this patent thing is is pretty wild yeah and I haven't gone through the stuff happening in 2024 but another quick call out is the public domain stuff right so every year new things go into the public domain we're hitting January soon and so that's another thing uh to call out for folks well I think like a few years ago wasn't it like Winnie the Pooh or something like that like like was it Winnie the Pooh like a bunch of these like yeah and then Ryan Reynolds uh took advantage of that he did what was it in partnership with one of the phone companies and he did Winnie The Scrooge uh as a commercial that's pretty wild that's pretty funny um by the way another one of these trends that you called out a few years ago which I thought was so stupid at the time and I've since spent probably $500 on this crap is you did my wife loves this stuff it it was like minis it was um for some reason oh like mini cooking sets and stuff have you seen this Sean like basically it's mostly women I think Young stupid though I agree but it's so I've SP when she was pregnant I would buy her I bought her this like I bought like a bulk case of it and then every week I would give her like a present wait describe what is it so it's it sounds so dumb the the one that she liked was called mini Brands I think and it's like any famous brand that you know of like Coca-Cola Kit Kat like any type of snack but also like different products uh like a shoe box they make just miniature versions and you open up this small ball it's like a it's like a baseball size thing and you open it up and inside there's like a variety of like eight different mini things and people just love I guess looking at them I I don't even understand what the appeal is but children it's weird Steph seems like someone who's into like this mini [ __ ] by the way this is uh zuru so this is that same guy Nick Mo that we talked about on the podcast the to the toy Mogul uh by the way he said he wants to come on so we should uh we should hit him up and get him on but they're it looks like they're the makers of this this is it called mini Brands yeah mini Brands it's and it's really expensive they're expensive are they edible or are these fake like no no it's just like a it it looks like imagine a Kit Kat bar but just like the size of a penny that's all it is it's just small it's just mini and excellent I have had this theory for a long time that anything mini just works um like I remember in science class there was like a mini Beaker and everybody used to fight over it and I was like what that holds less and nobody wanted to hear me I was like no but that holds less stuff and uh but everybody wanted to have the tiny thing and I was like what's going on on here um there is something to this like either overly large like kind of like the Love Sack like either like an overly large thing or a completely tiny thing is just like one way to make a product more there's a YouTube channel called Jenny's mini cooking show that's the one I remember from years ago where I was like people will just watch this person cook cook these quote meals for hamsters and they'll do the whole thing they'll have like a tiny little knife and cut the pizza and the cake and serve it on the tiny plate people love this stuff yeah and I can't I make fun of these people but one time I ordered a uh a birthday cake that was it was a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that was actually the size of a birthday cake so I I just like bigger things but I understand like which sounds awesome right like you're not you're GNA buy that like right now I should make like the Cyber truck mini basically is like the thing I should do I should make like the really tiny cyber truck that can just park in your garage and that's it yeah it's weird weird man it's weird we're freaks I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hop spot grow better what do you guys want to do next let's the sports one what's the sports dat so there's this website um that Aggregates a bunch of reports on Sports which obviously uh people love Americans love sports um so they have like a state of pickle ball report uh state of the industry report these cost money um so what is the state of pickle ball should we go into that the burning question in all of our minds what is the state of pickall right now um but what I did find was this article that basically aggregated some data from this and it don't open it because I want I want you guys to guess what the fastest growing sports are the 25 fastest growing Sports according to uh um This sfia research which is the Sports and Fitness industry Association what do you guys think were the top fastest growing sports in America I already opened it and I could tell you I wouldn't have guessed one of them I already opened it as well so the game is over uh but I would have said pickle ball and and I would have said that game paddle isn't there like another game that's just like pickle ball but it's for people that are they want to be like no pickle Ball's old this is the new new [ __ ] like there's there two of them uh that's what I would have guessed it does seem like pickle ball is number one but number two I would have never guessed Alpine touring I don't even know what that really is I think it's just like off off country skiing um and then I have never heard of what is winter fat biking it's awesome is what it is it's like so sounds like something I need to research these fat tire bikes are are really popular right now so it's basically a bike with a just a really fat tire is what it is and they they are they're sick looking you see them ride by and is this sport you know yeah it's just mountain bike riding but the tire is particularly fat that's all it is you know we what do we say we like big and small things it's just a normal bicycle with a fat tire that can like imagine a bicycle that could drive on a beach got it but I guess I guess it's a sport um number four off course golf interesting I don't even know what that is I when I Googled it it I think it's just those machines but I guess they've turned that into a competitive sport or and then number seven is trail running I could definitely see that that is the I I've I get so many videos on my Instagram of trail running dude I was at a dinner and somebody said something as a joke and I put up my finger to my lips and I said sh I need to write this down because it was an incredible idea the guy goes you put his you put your finger on his lips and then my own lips back and forth and um I was like say no more I need to don't I don't want to lose this idea let me write this down he said something he goes yeah I do the um the Suburban Triathlon and I go what and he goes yeah Suburban Travon um you you walk you walk a half mile you to this bar you drink two beers and then you go play nine holes of golf and I was like what he's like yeah it's the subur I forgot he said Suburban Iron Man or the Suburban Triathlon and I was like this has legs and I I really think that if somebody created some kind of um thing for you know out of shape middle-aged guys to do they'll do it and I think if you make it if you brand it almost like as the uh the non-fit person Triathlon and it's got to have like some version of eating and drinking being one of the legs um you know a a couple holes of golf as as one of the other legs and then you can really pick whatever you want as the third but dude that's the ne next tough mutter I think that could be a massive a massive Trend that people start doing because it's kind of fun it's ironic and it's it might be pickle ball as the third one actually that that's probably the right bet but um this is this is definitely something that I I think would appeal to people what do you guys think yeah yeah and that's beautiful branding we're working backwards from the brand we really don't even know actually what goes underneath it's just the idea of theb triathlon that I that deserves you putting your finger on his lips and then just just kissing him just give him a little kiss like I love you that's beautiful it's like you bike to the grocery store you chug a beer then you like I don't know run an errand and that's the Suburban triath line and you got to do it on Saturday mornings Steph what's what's another one got to give a shout out to pachy McCormick he aggregated this this and he aggregated this from a site called Tech novel G which is one of these sites where I'm just like I can't believe someone created this um I think his name is Bill Christensen or something like that um who basically took all of the sci-fi novels that have been written or most of them thousands and he put them on a site called technology and what pachy did is he took this kind of very outdated HTML site that's hard to navigate and he put it into this database if you guys click the link you'll see it and you'll see that there's this first page that is just just a Sci-Fi stats so it basically takes all the ideas so not just the books but the ideas Within These uh sci-fi novels and says does it exist today were these ideas in bits or atoms and then it also breaks down things like for certain authors let's say they had like in some cases like azima have had I think like 99 ideas how many of those ideas actually came to be so you can kind of get a sense of like how uh how grounded let's do some certain authors examples so I'm on the idea Bank row 194 it says uh in 1911 the author Hugo gernsback predicted telemotor coasters and these were powered skates for personal transport wheelies basically yeah or like that one viral video that went the video that went viral of people walking but with these like power skates that we're making them go way faster yeah exactly so there's like they basically break down thousands of ideas in this database and then they say if it was created and you can see in yeah the Sci-Fi idea Bank tab in column uh J you can see what year it was first made and then um you can see things like Google right or credit cards when they first appeared in these sci-fi novels so for example the credit card was first referenced in 1888 but credit cards like visa and MasterCard weren't actually created until the 1950s or live news in 1889 and then you know it took until the 1980s for 24-Hour live Ms to actually be a thing and it's kind of interesting because now you look at all these things like credit cards or live news and you think of course right like of course that exists that doesn't sound like sci-fi but then you can extrapolate that and probably deduce that many of the things that sound like sci-fi today or even 50 years ago likely will follow that same fashion and so I like going through this database because there are still many things that still fit in that category of not yet created but Dred up yeah so we can create electric rollerblades that just revolutionize the way we get hit by cars right uh what are examples of things that that you're interested in on this yeah so I mean some of these are certainly at the point where they're becoming real but for example in 1897 uh someone Dred up a non-alcoholic beverage similar to Wine in 1897 as well um electric bicycles which are now a reality but I think becoming way way way cheaper and way more important um vat grown meat in 1984 um which is another thing coming online but I think what's equally interesting is to consider some of the major Tech trends like AI like some of the stuff happening happening in biotech some of the stuff happening in space all of those Trends kind of intersecting and you you can ask the question whether some of the things that you see that again sound way more sci-fi than something like an electric bicycle may actually be a reality so I think like an example of a company that maybe fits this bill is vaa right they're manufacturing drugs in space which I think almost certainly a decade ago would have sounded crazy what's v doing they're manufacturing drugs in space why great question Yeah question I think we all have in our mind what's wrong with doing it in like Massachusetts like imagine Sam in the pitch meeting they're like okay hear me out drugs in space what about Massachusetts so my understanding is that the way that some of these drugs are manufactured the physics when you're on Earth due to gravity and some of the other forces that don't exist in space results in you not being able to create certain chemical structures and that impacts the way that drugs can be basically ingested or uh administered and so there's that I guess immediate function of being able to create almost like drugs that exist today but in different structures but then there's the obvious future opportunity where you're then creating completely new compounds that could not be manufactured on Earth did those guys raise a lot of funding I believe so that's wild what a that yeah that's beyond what I that's beyond my my IQ that's just pretty amazing there's like a list of ideas that were definitely started on like an iasa trip and this is one of them yeah uh well whenever I see these lists I just think of like have you I'm not like I'm not into like Wizards and game games of thrones and all that stuff you know what do I say I said I play sports I don't I don't rate Harry Potter but uh I do like appreciate the fact that one woman just sat down and created this whole this whole world to the point where there's like like we talk about quidd we like that's just like a part of like a relatively small part of this whole universe this lady just thought up and it is actually kind of been crazy crazy to actually see some of these predictions it it's in a weird way it's inspiring to think that an imagination can do this and I do actually feel pretty psyched up looking through this and being like damn I'm thinking way way small and not into the future enough so I I understand that I think it's actually pretty cool I just spotted in row 300 543 in 2003 smart wallpaper so Sam maybe that's coming your way next pod yeah so I'll look less pale uh all right you want to do another one next gold mine so I love this one our world in data um so people have maybe heard of this website it's a website that tries to aggregate data that um is a reflection of of what's really happening in the world so it includes things like um data on poverty it includes really Niche things like I found I went through the website and there was a graph that related to the day of the year with Peak cherry tree blossoms in Kyoto right so like when when the um cherry blossoms Peak the most like so random but they're collecting data on this and I checked this website a few years ago and I want to say there was maybe 200 graphs on here and if you go to their our worldend data.org charts page I want to say there's thousands of different data points now um and so I wanted to call out a few that I thought were interesting but I guess what do you guys think isn't this crazy that there's so much data being collected I just clicked on one it's adjusted net savings per capita from 1970 to 2020 and you could see like how much per capita a variety of countries are saving it's pretty wild Congo and Portugal not saving a lot of money Germany and France really great Savers so like it's just like literally thousands of like different charts you know Sean talks about these like one chart businesses I can't think of anything for this chart but there's like many of these charts where you can see something and just spot interesting things one of them is this uh population of the world distribution so basically this is a chart that is looking at how many of all the people in the world how many are young right now meaning under 15 how many are working age 15 to 65 and how many are elderly 65 plus and the shocking thing about this chart this is a one chart this is a one chart business right here which is the elderly curve goes from today right like kind of like the 2020 early 2020s where it's under 1 billion it's by far the lowest you know uh the smallest line to it's going to cross over the young population and be at you know by the end of where this has it projected 2.5 billion and so that's the biggest grower the working the working age one kind of flattens out the young one kind of goes down and the elderly one has this huge Spike and so if you're building anything that's in the elder care that you're going to own for let's say 10 20 years um you have this immense Tailwind behind you which is just that the population of people who fit you know the customer base is going to grow dramatically we're going to go from under one billion people to over 2 and a half billion people um that are in that market and so that's a it's you know a case to say say you know if you go there let's say let's say it's like real estate like if you owned you know uh senior living facilities or something like that you would be able to just benefit from the fact that oh occupancy is going to go up over time in this in this way now of course technology may may may completely upend things and Ai and all that but it is a very it you could see these like huge trends that are going to be very hard to reverse so uh it's hard to imagine a scenario that we we change the direction of these lines it would take like a whole societal shift population level shift to change where these lines are going did you guys see the video of uh it was Kim Jong-un the uh the North Korean leader he was delivering this speech this week where he was like pleading and begging uh his his people to start having sex and having babies because the population is just dwindling and he's literally crying like you see tears coming down his face crying and the rest of the audience is crying and he's begging them please have babies it's really it was really fascinating and turn though yeah thought crying in front of some man crying in front of you begging you to have have children St me just light some candles and put on some uh some R Kelly and it'll get it done uh yeah I mean it it was crazy I I guess I guess I didn't realize it's funny I'm looking at this chart and seeing his video I didn't realize how big of a problem it is but there's so many here which ones stick out to you Steph so I just linked another one that I think again is this like one chart um business this one's hard to get involved with but I think it's it it's the lithium production if you pull that up I just linked it in the document and you can see that lithium production which obviously is the core ingredient in many of our batteries is concentrated in just a few countries a lot of it's in China a lot of it's in a few countries in South America that's another example of just as you're browsing through a bunch of these these charts I think that one jumps out but the one I wanted to dive into in depth is air pollution so if you click the the the stat uh in here in our document that says air pollution is one of the world's leading risk factors for death which maybe is obvious to some people but to me when I think about it's like what are what are the key causes of death what am I afraid of air pollution is not at the top of that list however um I also stumbled upon Patrick Collison's pollution page he's got a bunch of cool pages on his website he's got a page just a bunch of questions uh one of them's on pollution and he says that the World Bank indicates that 3.7 billion people so about half the world's population are exposed to this metric um of PM 2.5 that that has to do with like the size of particles uh in the air they're exposed to around five times the the unit of measure that he correlates with a bunch of things which include uh lower GDP it includes uh stock market returns being lower uh people making worse decisions like chess players uh making mistakes politicians using Les less complex speech so those are just you know some fun facts but I think what's what's really important is obviously the the health side of things and there's another stat um that I'll just quickly share which is uh from a newsletter called Charter which says that India's capital um this was recently breached the 450 mark on the air quality index over four times the healthy level um and basically they're in this hazardous Zone which is akin to smoking 25 to 30 cigarettes a day and obviously that is an outlier but I wanted to call this out because I think air quality is something that um is is a problem in a lot of places clearly um some more than others but it's something that I think people are going to be caring about a lot more and maybe one one product that came out in the last year or so that's indicative of that that a lot of people made fun of um was the Dyson mask headphones so I I'll stop there what what what were those yeah I never saw those they are headphones that have a uh basically a mask a air purifier attached to them wow and they're expensive they're $1,000 I think right they are $700 from what I can see and what this came out and people just made fun of them well if you if you Google Images it's like a white guy in like the New York subway wearing it you know what I mean like it's a little off on because you're talking about India and uh a few other countries not maybe the New York subway so it's kind of like a it's kind of like a misleading ad they have but that's pretty fascinating is this are these taking off no I think they're in that zone of a lot of people making fun of them however the reason I'm calling this out is because I think there is this understanding that you know it's just in New Delhi it's not you know anywhere close to home um but I think have you guys ever use like a an air quality index um measure in your home or like a CO2 monitor yeah I have multiple times and I bought like these air purifier things that also measure the air quality in my house and I have them and it's like shocking whenever It'll like it basically turns red and it's like oh God there's something going on you know what we need to air this place out or or whatever yeah yeah so I mean air quality changes over time and I don't know I've been noticing more even in San Francisco a few days where people are like oh I'm I'm a mask could work not because of covid but because like oh gosh like I have you checked the air quality and a lot of people aren't doing this still today but I think that'll change and I think if you use some of these like the CO2 monitor for example you literally like if you go to bed with your door closed and you wake up and you check that thing it is wild um how high it is and you know all you need to do is open a window or you know circulate the air in your home but I think as the stuff um I guess is people are more educated on it I think some of these devices like the air quality uh monitors are going to take off and you can see some of this data in Jungle Scout as well of just like the kinds of products that people are buying do you see uh what did you see anything in Jungle Scout that stood out any product that okay so there's one product which is uh has to do with uh an AC furnace and an air filter um but guess how much this thing sells every single month what is it it's an AC furnace air filter and an air quality monitor and so what does that mean literally like the filter I put on the vents of my like like I've got like eight vents around my home and I put these like filters there is that what you referring to like those like the cloth almost filters you it's a filter you would put on your on your um furnace got it okay all right so what I'm looking at here is yeah like the kind of Standard air vent uh filters that you have to swap out every whatever six months or so but also it's a smart one so it has like a monitor associated with it like that has an app this thing cost 250 bucks uh yeah I have no idea but I you know sounds like it might be a little high so tell us what what's the what does jungle Scout tell us for the I'm seeing four entries in Jungle Scout and um they are 17 million 12 million 8 million and 8 million so what is that all total that's like over40 million per month this is this is what jungle Scout is saying so you know take it with a grain of salt I'm not sure how they measure but um they tend to be pretty accurate and so that's an example of I think as people again like try to understand the air quality around them I think there's a there's a growing business here that is fascinating I want to point out another thing so this um this chart that you have of like causes of death so the top uh let's see risk factors I think I might have chosen the United States here but in the United States I believe the top ones are smoking number one high blood pressure high blood sugar and obesity so I have a crazy story to tell you so I can't say his name because he he asked me not to or he said he prefers to stay under the radar but I have a friend who is an investor and he's a very different kind of investor so what you see on Twitter often is people who are investors they like to be loud about what they do they'll just kind of spray and pray they're they're doing a lot of Deals they love to be angels in 50 things putting 20K checks my friend is very different he says that and every year there's like one thing that matters maybe two and he his old job is to just find the one or two things that matter and so I've known him for you know maybe 10 years now and at one time it was like he's like Bitcoin it's Bitcoin right now and I was like Bitcoin really like the you sure this is like you know let's say I don't know 2013 2014 2015 somewhere there he's like it's Bitcoin and then uh he was the one who was like only fans I'm all in on only fans and I was like only fans what what is that this is before any before any of the revenue numbers had come out about only fans he's like I think and I was at twitch at the time and he's like only fans is bigger than twitch it's going to be bigger than twitch and I was like no dude twitch is like one of the biggest internet sites on Earth and he's like ye trust me it's gonna be bigger and he and he's like called it basically each year he doesn't necessarily always get to invest but he's trying to identify what is the thing did he get in on those yeah so like for a couple of these yeah he he's got the ones I've mentioned so far he did so then he uh text me the other day and he goes uh GP greater than GPT uh so this is like I talked to him maybe I don't know nine months or a year ago and he was like yeah I think this soic stuff is the thing for the year and I was like really like isn't it AI he's like no I think this I I think glp is bigger than GPT um and I was like what do you mean he's like I'm trying to figure out the right way to invest in this uh because they're all like basically OIC and the makers of these are all all public stock so he's like I could buy that but the upside is not exactly there so I'm trying to figure out what's the move and he told me he's like there was one company I invested in several years ago that might actually be a beneficial beneficiary of it so yesterday sends me an article kmot this uh Carmo this uh this pharmaceutical company got bought for $3 billion yesterday and that they are a maker of glp drugs he was an early investor in it he invested in it like seven years ago or something and I was like dude how did you get in on this he's like well you know at the time it all wasn't clear I can't say that I I you know definitely didn't know about that but it was uh these guys were drug makers that were attacking obesity drugs in a different way and you know just looking at the charts about what kills everybody you know like the Obesity is a massive massive problem there's not that that many interesting bets of who's attacking obesity in a different way these guys were one of them and I like their team and whatnot so I invested early on and I was like geez man like just to have like A3 billion doll exit out of nowhere kind of am amazing what do you think his return on that was uh I don't want to say but you know he got in fairly early and uh three billion is a big number so I think he did extremely well on that one but I will what I will say is that he kind of looks at these like Mega Trends and uh this is kind of what you're you're showing here Steph is that if you understand how big the wave is then the opport then it then it kind of simplifies life you can ignore all small waves if you know what the mega you know the big Title Wave are and you just figure out okay what's the best way to Surf this and even if you don't figure out the best way even the fourth best way to Surf a mega trend is going to going to work in your favor and I've heard this now from from a few investors but also um Mark Zuckerberg said this a while back like I remember when we were we were working on some app that was like a messaging app like text messaging app and this was maybe 2015 or something and it seemed like text messaging was the big thing and Zuck came out and he goes there's only a few Mega Trends mobile was the last one and then the new one is video he goes video is a mega Trend everything is moving to video people are going to communicate through video they're watching more and more video short video long video mediumsized video scripted videos ugc videos it's all going to video and I had never heard anyone say this I this word megat trend and when Zuck said that I started to pay attention and we actually ended up pivoting our company into video streaming live video we were like oh we'll go for live video and uh that's the company that got bought by when we got acquired by twitch is because we were just partially in the right space like live video streaming there was weren't that many people working on it in an interesting way but live video kept growing kept growing kept growing at this like really fast rate and so it was smart to get out of the text game and get on the the right Mega Trend yeah you know something I'll mention about the air quality stuff that's related to what you said there Sean is I feel like one missing Gap with air quality uh readings and devices and all that is it's not obvious as in I feel like most people would be surprised to be like oh my gosh I inhale all this stuff and it has these ad adverse effects and it's you know it ranks here on you know the the likelihood of of death but it's not obvious it's not in your face like let's say like the gp1s people see themselves every day and they're constantly trying to improve their image and how other people interpret them um so I think maybe one thing that if if someone was going to go figure this out you guys have talked about um the air the water filters people go into your home and did they say like did you know like you're drinking like this much of of like basically like rocks and other sediment and lead in your your water can you believe it and they show you and so I feel like there's an element of that where as it's going to take a while for people to really care about the air quality stuff but there may be some Middle Ground where some company is able to effectively give people that aha yeah I would put it differently I don't think it's going to take a while I think it's going to take a marketer for people to care it's just going to take a marketer and a product design that puts it in your face and that educates you about this and kind of scares you about it but then says don't worry there's a solution and that's how a lot of things get done is you know a great marketer or product designer figures out the way to put it in your face did you guys remember what Rob deck said so Rob deck came on and he didn't spend too much time talking about this but he said he bought a good chunk of a company that is doing water filters for showers and I've got a bunch of friends that are like Health freaks so Justin Mayers is is one of them where he's a health freak and he's a great entrepreneur and he was like man I installed this really expensive basically Berkeley filter which is that big metal it's like those metal jugs that you see in people's homes and he's like I wanted to install one for my whole home because I wanted my shower water to also be completely filtered and I went through this whole ordeal to do this and then Rob jerck invested in this company that is basically making a shower head that is a filter so it's ideally simplifying that entire process he talked about that on this podcast but he didn't spend too much time talking about it and I went and researched a bit of it I think that is going to be a a a pretty big company and I think there's going to be a whole I I imagine it's going to be like a uh like a boxed mattress Trend where no one has them and then suddenly many people have them and there's tons and tons of competition because I don't think that's quite that hard of a company to to to create uh I don't know what the mode is entirely but I imagine there's going to be a whole bunch of people in that space and so I'm I'm pretty much on board with with what he said and I I think you have an interesting Insight with the uh particular with the AC vents that's another product that literally everyone has in their home you have to replace it two or three times a year and it's a really really easy Instagram ad to make all right let's move let's go to the next one what else you got all right next one in here is Gadget flow so this is just an interesting site uh that Aggregates gadgets um friending gadgets uh I want to call it two things here the first is if you look at the most popular gadgets you might say well what's the opportunity here right like I'm not not going to create a drone like DJI I'm not going to create the next arvr device Apple's doing that meta's doing that like there's no opportunity I just wanted to call out that every time there's a new device that ends up penetrating uh a lot of people's homes or wallets uh there's almost always an opportunity for accessories um so a good example that we covered years ago Sam on Trends was uh airpods and you have got a crazy stat on that you've got a crazy airpod stat it this was forever ago I wonder what it is now but back then it was like early on in the airpod journey and it was like airpods if it was a standalone company would be in the Fortune 50 or something like that I was like whoa whoa I think your stat was like airpods make more Revenue than like Spotify Snapchat and Airbnb combined I think Twitter was it was yeah and that was again that was in 20 I want to say 2019 or 2020 um and so now there's some crazy stats with airpods which is just like 70% of all us teens have airpods like that is like true penetration um and so early on in that Trend it's like okay there's like cases there's um trying to remember like keychains really simple stuff but I think what uh is worth just understanding or or what you can take away from this gadget flow website is like okay what are the newest um devices that are not going to have the scale of like hundreds or thousands of people using them but millions or hundreds of Millions what are the adjacent accessories or products that I can create so how do you how do you use Gadget flow so Gadget flow is not as much of like you know a searchable database like something like jungle Scout but um it's more so just what I would do if I came to this page is first I would look at the drop down of most popular right so that's where you're going to see some of those big devices and then the other takeaway is some of the uh drop- down categories I think so the one that caught my eye was pet accessories um so remember Gadget flow is like all tech devices and so if you go to pet accessories um there's a bunch of different things I guess you both uh have owned dogs I've never owned a owned a dog but uh I wonder if you're familiar with any of these devices and in particular there was one that I noticed um have you guys heard of um fluent pet no what's that no what is it it is this uh really interesting trend of these buttons uh fluent pet is particular brand um that I think is going pretty viral because of one account uh this dog called I am bunny this this account has I think a million followers on Instagram and it's it's basically these buttons where you can I don't know how like how well this works for all dogs you can kind of teach them to communicate with you uh by pushing these buttons to indicate what they want and I've seen these and it's and and it is actually really cool so the way it looks is it looks like a uh so it looks like a imagine like a like a twister pad and each color has a button on it and the one button means bathroom one button means food one button means other thing and you could train your dog to click a button to do what to tell you what they want it it's actually really cool yeah it's pretty awesome uh I've seen these and I I we trained our dog how to do that where like he like I I could tell what he wanted based off of a handful of activities that we would teach him how to do this is actually really cool yeah my dog is way too dumb for this but uh this is awesome uh by the way yesterday I took my dog out to I took my kids to gymnastics and we brought the dog and so all these kids love to come pet the dog and this kid comes up probably like I don't know seven years old something he goes oh your dog's so cute and I was like thank you I was like you want a pet he's like yeah he goes what's her name and I go yeah her name's busley he goes a why didn't you give her a better name [Laughter] and I was like okay maybe I and I was like I didn't know how to respond I was like man I just got owned by this little kid what are you supposed to say to that why didn't you give her a better name like Rosalina yeah it's like oh my God what I was I was it's like I got a jab in the nose John did you name the dog I did name gu what was the answer I just thought it was a very Regal sounding name I think your definition of Regal and everyone else's definition is a little bit different like like a butler I don't know like oh busley um Steph are you just what are you doing all day are you just clicking through all these I mean you probably have aund or 50 different links here are you just clicking through this stuff all day many Tabs are open right now uh I want to say 35 and are you gonna go through those or you just a hoarder there's an order there's like the jungle Scout tabs grouped together the like similar web tabs grouped together um I don't know I mean I think so I will spend time every so often just like going through these websites and like scouring for ideas but I think there are a few newsletters and things that I pay attention to that kind of surface ideas that I then if I find them interesting will go and check them you know in similar web or jungle Scout or whatever and I know you're at a16z now and I I presume you're happy but inevitably one day you're going to and you're going to start a company I that you have it in you I I think you're going to do that what do you think it will be which category because you you've seen all this data you look at all this data what what's going to interest you whenever you do it well I don't want to share the ideas that I actually want to pursue soon because which category um you could say games um or I like the idea of you know people we've talked about before someone if you guys remember Neil Agarwal Neil fun um yeah great great website you know part of me we talk about these big Ideas like Ai and biotech and it's all very interesting and you know someone please go become the air quality uh marketer that we all need but part of me just wants to create things that I wish I saw on the Internet or I wish existed on the internet that Aggregates some of the these ideas or gets people to learn things in ways that they never thought of before um and so I kind of just want to be this is too too silly of a term for but like an artist like an internet artist if that makes sense are you and you work at an investor now is this something that you'd raise money for or you'd want to do all all on your own i' do it on my own you wouldn't raise money I don't think it's the kind of it's not a VC internet artist who's gonna they're gonna be like do they have those in Massachusetts like all right well I'm just curious Peter levels is like the internet like the the Banksy of Internet art right now right like he's he's kind of one of those guys yeah exactly and I think you will do that I'm I'm eager to see when you when you finally do do it I think you're going to do really well in it well they have her trapped because I saw her do something yesterday that made me just shake my head she tweeted out who's got the best company swag in the world and she posted a photo of a backpack and like a koozie and like a water bottle that all said a16 Z on and no doubt they were beautiful products it's great to get free stuff but that's how they get you stff I was like no they're wrapping their tentacles around you you know what's the the two most addictive things of the world heroin and a monthly salary well third is free Swag yeah they don't even you don't even have golden handcuffs you have a black umbrella that's what they did for you my the internet artist that I want to follow that I admire does not fall into the traps of company swag they reject company swag they reject company swag when I saw you post that I was like oh no she's she's in too deep it's like an Inception we need to wake her up she's so far she's in level three of inception and uh we got to snap her out of this God well I mean I am human I am convinced by free stuff it looks like they got you with a book bag an umbrella and a poncho that's what so for all the people who have previously tried to coach me that's all you need just send me a backpack and a poncho and well I I'm eager to see you start a company where do you want to go from here Sean uh yeah I think oh let's wrap it up but Steph where can people get more of like this type of stuff specifically so like you have this very unique method tier Madness that you you know you know these nooks and crannies you're like those people where you go to a city and you're like I really wish I just knew kind of like what to what tour traps to avoid what good places to go what's the best place to eat oh she knows this hole in the wall where you can enter through the through the Chef's kitchen and blah blah blah you're like that for the internet so um how can people get more of that yeah so like you said it's my seventh time on my first million which is kind of crazy and ever since the first few where I'd come with these docs and you guys would be very nice and and hype up the dock and say oh my gosh so crazy there's so much ino in here I constantly get people reaching out asking for those docs and you know an aggregation of all the websites that I visit and how to use them and how to internet sleuth um or I like the term to use the internet pipes um so I'm putting together something I don't know what to call it maybe you guys can help me with it that Aggregates these internet pipes and shows people how to use them um so I think the only thing I've done is aggregate them and then buy the domain internet pipes uh but I think uh By the time this episode goes live I'll probably have some sort of like pre-sale up on that page if people are what are you gonna charge for it okay if you guys have a minute I want I want your opinion because I think I'm gonna do something wrong here don't just don't use the CW you can't say course you have to call something else like a re I don't know you got to use chat GPT but something involving the word research there was this one guy that used to really he had a lot of knowledge he read a lot of books he had a Lamborghini in his garage and he too had a course so maybe you could take his blueprint he had a good one I mean so I don't know what I'm gonna call it I don't like the idea of it being a course because I don't I want it to just be like a resource that people go to and it's not like a not like a teachable course or something like that but what do I charge for something like that I when I did my book I did this like tiered pricing scheme where it started at $10 and then it went up for every like 30 or 50 sales but I have no I feel like I'm going to end up charging too little what was that called it's called doing content right so doing content right Sean tell me what you would have done in this situation so Steph worked at my company yeah and she was talented at she was talented she worked at my company while she was doing this and I remember Steph someone came to me and they're like do you care that Steph is doing this and launching this content book and I was like no why why should should I care would you have cared Sean and I think Seth you made I don't know you could say what you made but you made great money you maybe made more than that than we were PID yeah you did did you make more doing the book than I paid you um maybe in the first year and Sean what would you have said if your employee was doing this would you have been Pro or anti uh yeah I would have been Pro I it's fine like I have no problem with that I would have had a conversation just to be like cool where are we going with this like what's the where does this live in your life is this like fun project is this what you actually want to go do then maybe I can help you go do that in a more like I just kind of want to know where that lives um and I just you know obviously you know for you Steph was like a star performer so you know stars get like more rope to go do things if you're like if you are doing a mediocre job and then you got this side hustle that's the final straw for me right like I that then you're not putting your energy kind of towards actually getting a good outcome but Steph was crushing it so you know she I don't think we were pretty encouraging of people to do stuff unless they were screwing up I don't know if we ever lost an employee because of their side thing but I think like that was pre- Twitter getting popular like it is I think in the future I maybe wouldn't have encouraged it is that it's kind of effed up but I don't know if I would have encouraged it but I did encourage it back then well that's what I mean by I want to know where it lives in your life meaning if this is kind of what you really want to do then let's just be honest about it like let's just have the honest conversation we could figure out like what's the right pathway forward and if you're like I just want to make a little bit of extra money we could talk about like hey if you just did XYZ here you can make that here you know you don't have to start a separate business right if that's if that's the motivation if you're just like oh yeah I just use this for Serendipity and networking and I just kind of like to put stuff out there on nights and weekends like this is my hobby like that's what I told people when when I was doing things I was I'd say you know business is my hobby so like you know for you when you log off work you might go to CrossFit or you might go play go for what like what I do is I read I write I make things that's what I like to do on the internet and so you know this is just me doing that hobby you know you you do Taekwondo or whatever you do and uh I think there's just some people that are like that you gotta you got to let them spread their wing I mean I think also to your point Sean it depends is this like an ongoing thing forever you're going to be writing you know doing a course every quarter and it's going to take up all your time I intentionally with this project partially because I didn't want it to last forever but partially also because it's just my psychology to like get something done and out there was like I think I compressed it until like a six week thing and I was like this is all this is the only time I'm going to allocate to this um and I feel like for this this new project that I'm launching too it's kind of the same thing where it's like I don't want to be like doing a course forever and people checking in with me and have this I just have this like little burst of like creativity I need to get something out there to exist and then that's it yeah yeah um your question was what would you what what should you charge for it I don't think this is going to make a ton of money because the who's the type of person that wants to who's the type of person that wants to buy this is somebody like you so there's not that many people that are like you that are like hey I just have some disposable income that I'm going to use so that I can have better internet random research tools and and like ability to lurk and just find interesting things on the internet um I think those are awesome people but there's not it's not like Mass market right so you either got to charge a bunch or you go the way and you charge very little but you use you get the value in a in a separate way like for you what I would be doing is I would use this as a Honeypot to attract a b like the type of person that's going to pay even $99 whatever to $100 a year to have access to this database is like somebody that you would want to go hang out with for three hours most likely right and so I would just use it as like the value isn't going to come from the the direct monetization of this asset but from the little Community you bu build and then the interesting either Investments you get out of it or you know introductions or opportunities or the company you started someone from this that's I think where you're going to get way more value than just trying to charge a premium for this for yeah but it'll pay for her monthly expenses this you're doing content right plus a new thing you'll make 25,000 a month I think we'll see yeah but like your your needs are covered right so like you know one way one thing I think about a lot is like um you know more of the same keeps me I am so you know if I keep doing things that kind of keep me in the same level of the game I'll never have the bandwidth to do whatever it's going to take to get me to the next level of the game and so like for example I I had a course that I was teaching maybe five to 10 days a year not much and it was making over a million dollars a year so that's an amazing like effort to payoff thing and then I stopped and I was like why cuz for me making an extra $1 million a year is not going to get me to the next level of the game I'm trying to p play at so I was like if I'm trying to get to the point where let's just say let's just make up a goal say I was trying to make I want to get to where I'm making $20 million year okay let's say let's say that was the goal then I need to like have enough like room on room on my plate just empty space that will like force me to go create the thing that gets me to the next level um or I might give things away for free in fact if it's going to like create the Serendipity that's it's going to take to like open up new opportunities that are bigger and so that's just something to think about is like how do you do you care about uh you know maybe the next level of Financial Freedom of of you know sort of wealth that will give you more Runway more ability to like use money to do sh the [ __ ] you want like the internet art type of thing um and if you do maybe you could use this as a tool to like get the right people around you and do something else I don't know it's just more totally I mean one of the biggest learnings from the book was some people are like oh you're totally undercharging but it's like how do you deliver a product at a price point that people are like like so happy with that they go and share it and talk about it and and also like yeah want to work with you and like actually digest the information instead of and requires no customer service yeah exactly where it's just like it runs itself it markets itself that's what ended up happening with the book and so I am leaning more in that direction but then I also I was expecting you guys to be like no no no like charge more like you always undercharge but I guess I guess maybe I should keep it Tim Ferris said something that changed my thinking on this Tim Ferris said he goes I have strategy which was Ultra free or Ultra Premium he goes I was going to give away 99% of what I do for literally for free because I'm trying to reach the broadest number of people possible and I want to over be be overd delivering I treat it like it's a paid product but I deliver it for free to the masses because then on the one day and he he he gives the example he did a um this was back when he was doing four-hour work week and whatnot so he's doing uh you know his blogging for free podcast for free and then he said hey I'm doing a two-day kind of like in-person Workshop Seminary thing that's that open the kimono thing or open the kimono yeah exactly and I think he did two3 million in sales in like 30 minutes right because people were like I will pay $10,000 he was like it's it's expensive I don't expect everybody to be able to afford this or want to I'm not even gonna promise anything but if you're a f what I do like I'm gonna do this open the kimono thing it's two days and I think he made two $2 to4 million on that day and he's like if I had been trying to like kind of charge along away like let me do this little ebook for for $9 then let me do this like monthly subscription for maybe I can get $20 a month he's like I would have had a a smaller audience and less money and so and same thing with his podcast ads he's like I would rather have no ad in the thing or charge an Ultra Premium to a premium brand because there's always room he he said there's always a market for luxury right there's always a market for the for the absolute best so I wanted to make the absolute best product and then charge the absolute you know best price I could for that and that was like his his strategy um when it came to that I think Alex Heros does a similar thing so hormos is like look I could be trying to make a little bit of money here a little bit of money there do a course do a do a seminar do whatever um but he's like no no no I'm gonna be really in your face that this stuff is normally what people charge for I'm giving it to you for free builds a bunch of Goodwill builds a big audience and then when he's ready to charge he'll make all the money back and more when he finally does charge for the thing in his case it's you know a combination of acquisitions.com where he's like I'm gonna buy equity in your business at this like super super sweetheart deal for him because he's built up so much Goodwill and like reputation amongst you know his potential like you know acquisition targets um or if he ends up doing ever like a course or a seminar or a live inperson thing he'll be able to charge $25,000 per person to get in and he'll make $10 million on one day because he's kind of built it that way so I think there's something to learn from these people that play the real long game totally I don't think I could charge 25k for anything but we'll see we'll see if I ever get there but um well you do you you get paid more than that that's true that's true so I mean you you definitely do um and you definitely can I think that you will eventually for sure someone by the way I read the comments um and I read one from something one of the episodes I was on ages ago and someone wrote something like wow Steph has a really int intense case of imposter syndrome and I was like oh true um anyway I guess uh if people want to find by the way I'll tell you this now you do I remember when I was negotiating your salary when you first joined and you asked for a number I don't remember if I did this for you it we in particular women would typically do this they would say a number and I would say a number back or I would just say a number to them and they would just accept it and I'm be like hey um you should negotiate with me um women in particular were horrible at pushing back on their salary for what they should ask for and you know my company was small we in aggregate probably hired 75 people but I noticed a small trend of women in particular did not push back nearly as hard as the men there were many men that they would push back and it was laughable what they I'm like there's not a chance I'm going to give you this but I guess I'll meet you somewhere in the middle to like adjust this but like this is crazy I offered I was thinking you were $150,000 year person you're asking for 700,000 that's just ridiculous but I remember with you Steph you were way we gave you a lot of bumps I think over the how long you worked with us but you you started way too low um and I would encourage you to maybe not for this product but to definitely Elevate what you should be demanding for pay I I think you're doing all right now a16z but that I've I've noticed that with you in particular amongst very very very smart and qualified young women yeah it took me around what is it so 21 to 20 eight when I 28 or 29 when I joined a16z so it took me like seven years or so to actually learn to negotiate so I agree can I tell you a a embarrassing version of impostor syndrome that I have which is it's not impostor syndrome but it is what I call Michael Scott syndrome where sometimes I felt this for like 10 years I always hire people that are like super smart that's great upfront but the downside is sometimes you just feel like Michael Scott you're like oh I'm the idiot in the office and uh I'm telling these people I'm actually in their way and these people are like they're kind of looking at me like the way that Jim Halpert looks at you know Michael Scott and I'm like oh no it's happening that's that the Michael Scott thing is happening have you ever felt that yes I felt that way all the time and then I realized that's actually I felt that way for a long time and then I realized oh wait no that just means I'm good at hiring uh so like I should just get out of the way Scott would do he turn a compliment for himself no I felt that way too I remember hiring people that were a older than me and B smarter and I'm like what the [ __ ] are these people did I really just convince this person did I just trick this person into coming and joining anything I'm doing I feel horrible about that one woman that's so good at what she does um in our e-commerce business she's so fast like literally so fast and hyperproductive like she gets the like she gets like three people's stuff done in in the same amount of a day and uh she's the one who Michael Scots me all the time I'm like I'll be telling her something in the meeting I'll be like yeah let's follow up next week on that and she's like I already sent it out and I'm like while I was talking but I was giving you such a good anecdote and metaphor and uh oh you just like finished it oh okay I guess uh I guess I could have shut up five minutes ago huh and I realized actually this is a great thing just like you said Sam it's not that I'm great at hiring I said now this is actually the bar I only want to hire people that make me feel like I'm Michael I'm the Michael Scott of the office that's actually how it should feel when you're doing it right it should feel that means you're good at hiring now you just got to get the hell out the way you did the hard part and you're funny that's the other thing yeah I don't know about that um I'm just gonna quickly shout out if people want to go find it internet pipes.com I guess we'll figure out the price it'll be live when this goes live all right that's the Pod Steph thank you for doing [Music] this

all right someone asked me an incredible question today they said if you had to pick one idea that could make you a million dollars this year and it can't be just a newsletter or a blog or an agency which are usually our go-tos what would it be what would you do one specific idea that you would do and then he also said and I want to hear one specific idea that you would do to try to make a billion dollars that's a good question and me and Sam are going to answer that right now on this episode of my first [Music] B [Music] all right what's up we're doing our Q&A and we got one question that we really love but is the question Sean is it a billion dollar in net worth or a company that's worth a billion dollars I'm going to say it's a company that's worth a billion dollars so and you know you own a big chunk of it okay and what's a bill what's a billion here or there okay look the company's worth one billion you're worth one billion it's all a billion it changes dramatically so I know a guy who sold the company for $900 million $990 million you know how much he made after the sale $3 million that's how much he made he had he had four co-founders or maybe five and he raised a ton of money and they sold it and he made $3 million that's insane right and I don't I think that's an extreme case but I think there's many cases where you create a billion dollar business and you actually walk away with like eight% of the company right which is still a ton of money but it's that's a wild experience it's like a small ton it's a not as big of a ton as people think you get when you're when you make a company that big yeah it just the the the numbers change things a little bit but let's just get right into it the million-dollar one what do you have million dollar one all right so uh you go first for this one so a million dollars in is it net worth like and what do we say three or four years to do it yeah you got a couple years to do it you're going to make a million dollars in profit so to make a million so I think that there if you want to make a certain amount of money quickly you have to ask yourself is it going to come through annual cash flow or is it going to come through selling something like selling a business so for example if you have a business that's earning let's say $300,000 a year you in year one you do 50,000 year two you do 200,000 year three you do 300,000 that's not going to add up to a million dollars however you could sell that business for maybe $900,000 and maybe a million dollars so collectively you can come up with a million bucks I think the easiest thing to do would probably be to sell the business if you want to make that amount of money in a certain amount of time in like three years what I would do so first do you know Quiet Light brokerage yes so if I want to make a million dollars in let's say three years I'm probably not going to invent anything new I'm just going to copy what works and I'm going to try maybe not even do it better I mean there's four almost 400 million people in America like I can kind of just figure out someone that already is doing something and copy it but put it slightly different ladies and gentlemen we're not going to be better faster or cheaper we are simply going to be also in the business of yeah strategy yeah the me too strategy is that what this is like me also no that's a different thing we don't want me too we don't want me too we don't want me too sorry the me also strategy that's what we'll call it the me also strategy um so I would probably go to Quiet Light brokerage so quiet light brokerage I've had a couple friends sell and buy businesses through this I've had uh one friend sell a business via Quiet Light brokerage for 10 million I had another Buddy buy a company for 300,000 that ended up making1 18 million a year in Revenue um and I know those guys at Quiet Light brokerage and I've talked to them and basically quiet like brokerage is a website where you buy and sell businesses it's a brokerage meaning it's not exactly automated but what you can do is you can see Anonymous descriptions of companies that are for sale you can see what the earnings are you can see what the revenue is you can enter in your email and they'll send you all the finan to the all you got to do is say I'm interested in this business and then they send you a packet of information about that business including the name who the owner is where it's Incorporated how they got their first customers how where where they get their customer mix today what are the areas for growth they do this fantastic little interview with the person which is if you're buying the business very useful but also if you're executing the me also strategy it is brilliant and in fact we have a friend who did this we have a friend who was looking at one of these websites saw a business for sale for I think like $120 or $150,000 one of the smallest businesses for sale maybe on flipa somewhere something something like that and he was like well I don't have $150,000 but I do have a lot of time to pick your brain and so he picked the brains of a bunch of people and then they were like cool you want to buy it he's like no but you could you know you convinced me how uh EAS this is so uh see you and went and recreated that and sold it for many millions more and um that literally did that and I think once I heard that I realized oh there are easier ways and harder ways to make $10 million and the easier way is you go look at businesses that are already successful and you reverse engineer which one you could you could create and copy and by the way I don't think I think they make you sign an NDA or something like that so I think you could get sued if you just rip it off entirely but I think but and that's not exactly what I'm suggesting I'm suggesting be inspired by and do something exactly like it but slightly different I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better well let's just look at it right now so for example I'm scrolling uh you go to Qui light or whatever you could use any of these brokerage sites we we both like qul light because it's a little curated so it's it's less filled with junk even though honestly a lot of these businesses on here are absolute junk so let me show you one of these junk businesses so um you go down to the kind of like for sale for two million bucks two million bucks is a nice number right you could be even a little bit worse in this business and uh and still make a million bucks you could if you sold it for two million after taxes you have a million dollars all right so here it is it's a FBA business fulfilled by Amazon it's a money counting machine does that mean that they're literally selling a money counting machine yeah like I like any business that could be called a money printing machine a money counting machine in this they literally so this says launched in 2020 so three years ago it says this business sells money counting machines and counterfeit build detectors to local businesses government agencies restaurants Financial Services Banks event management companies and nonprofits is it one like this like this money counting machine that I have my desk why you have that right now so I have for those not give it a run give it a run that I don't have it I don't have it plugged in but so I have I literally have a money counting machine here with counterfeit money on it when I sold my company Jack Smith my best friend he bought me this as like a congratulations it's $100 I've never used it but I just like keep it there and when I have friends that do something interesting like they sell a company they close a big deal I send it to them and I say uh this is either goingon to be a huge like uh paper weight or you're actually G to use it good luck and it's a nice gift I I think this costs $200 that's actually great we should do that for the for any fan if you're going through the process of you're gonna sell your business uh just email us and we'll send you the counter as the good luck as our good luck charm from us to you uh whenever and when I have like my cleaning lady here I'm like just so you know this is fake money don't even think about it watch this rip it up yeah I like it's fake that all this it's 100 grand in cash that cost $5 that's a great trust test you should uh just leave it out and see like you know what not only did you steal fake money but you're out of a job too well that's actually a test I do when I have like new like vendors at my house is sometimes I'll leave like a few hundreds there and I know exactly how much is there and I'll see like what's going to happen a candy bar and see what happens uh so someone's selling literally a money counting machine money counting machine 1.8 million in revenue $625,000 of net income net profit so they're selling it uh here and then if you go and you you it's a husband and wife Duo they says they spend this this is a classic on Quiet Light this is like the I don't know what Tinder profiles say nowadays I don't know what the kids are doing but I know that on every business for sale the owner spend five to 10 hours a week on this um they just don't have enough time and energy to devote to Growing the business that anybody who steps in could do uh all right so anyways I would look at businesses like this and uh seems like what you're saying is you would probably look at what like not one but like maybe 20 to 30 of these just to get a good idea get enough data points and I would find out which fits my interest so for example uh Sean click where they have membership so they have a membership category they've got me media which I know about media so I would do that one but membership is interesting I think the reason memberships are interesting is I think you could have a really really really Niche Community uh where you solve a very specific problem and I'll give you two examples so for like one could be so if you are if you have a job you maybe work you know in so you work in whatever industry and you know something but you have this problem called the knowledge complex where you think well everyone knows this therefore it's not that interesting to teach and I think that's actually crazy I think for like two examples are automations for HVAC owners another one is outbound sales for like chiropractors or uh for Architects and I think what you can do with things like this is you can charge pretty high amounts you could charge $500 a month where you get access to content that you update on a regular basis um and then you have a community where all the other participants can share tactics and ideas that they're using to overcome the the problem that they've all signed up for another example is um a community where where you have a database with all the right people who you need to contact at a c within a certain niche in order to get a sale done so for example let's say you're an agency it could be like here's all of the buyers of media at the these companies that you update regularly and then you could have a community where people are discussing tactics and strategies in order to accomplish that task and I think when you look at like the the the problem or you're you're thinking about what the customer is going through when they're going to buy this which is well if I spend $3,000 a year on this if I only get one sale this is worth it for me and I got a positive Roi and I think that sale is significantly easier than selling to Consumers where you're having to do a lot of guess work with this if you do $3,000 a year in order to get to a million dollar sale you'd have to look at what those multiples are but I think the multiples on the membership sites are like five times profit so get to a million need $250,000 in profit to get to $250,000 in profit on a $3,000 year service it could be just you and a part-time employee or one full-time employee I don't know what that match is but you don't need that many customers in order to hit that Target and so I would do that over a consumer product because I can just talk to my customers and they could tell me exactly what they want and I'm basically providing a service that they're requesting on a regular basis in order to keep them here's a specific example of that uh exit five I think is the name of it um exit 5 is like a community of B2B marketers and uh I don't know what they pay per year it's a little bit less than what you just said but I think they could be charging you know more like $2500 or $3,000 but the big idea here is go get a 100 people paying you three grand a year and you can even make it exclusive be like this is a community for only 150 of the top B2B marketers in the world we're gonna we're going to invite you in and then you're going to share ideas plus we have this database of whatever whether it's ad creative that works we have this database of vendors or you know buyers with their contact info and we all openly share here it's a it's a sort of give to get uh you know model and um yeah the thing is probably worth two three million bucks right now that that this guy's made and and you know 500 to a th members and the reason if you're starting from scratch is you don't need that particularly big of an audience you don't need to you you'd cold email people you would also build an audience but in order to get to a let's say you have an audience of 5,000 people which is very attainable to get particularly if you give it a year you only need about 100 to 200 people to buy what you're selling in order to hit that Target and you so your podcast doesn't need to be huge your Twitter handle your cold email outbound strategy doesn't need to be huge and so that's probably what I would do to get to a million dollars what do you think about that well you have you basically said two ideas right that was a two for one special you had go to quiet light or a business brokerage and find a business that you can either reverse engineer or legitimately so you know reverse engineer we kind of say and that's I would say a little bit generously let's call it Scrappy the scrappy way to do things you don't have any money you uh you know you need to get I you know rather than just try to come up with an idea from Scrat scratch when you're kind of a beginner the better way is to go learn what businesses actually work how they work why they work go look at 30 to 50 that's like a real world NBA that you picked up and then find one of those that you think you could mimic and put your own twist on right that's that's idea one you had by the way with that comes also you could just buy the business so for a lot of these even a $2 million business you can um go get an SBA loan a lot of these will say that they're SBA loan eligible so let's say that you're in the United you can go get SBA loan put down 10 to 15% so if you can go get 200 Grand you could buy a $2 million business that's doing 600 600k of profit um per year and so you could actually go buy that business and just try to grow it because actually getting a business from Zer in Revenue to 2 million in revenue or 1.8 million in revenue is pretty hard relative to taking a business that's at 1.8 and getting it to 3.1 million for example like you know adding an extra million of Revenue to a business already working is actually much easier than going from Zer to one I think you got both options on the table there it's just more risk well yeah there's there's a little bit more risk because you're personally liable for the for the for the loan there so you know you have to buy a good business you have to you have to be able to know what a good business is and that's where maybe some mentors could help um the other business the other idea you said was basically a membership service a membership a membership Community for some Niche right that's kind of like a separate idea it has to solve a specific problem so a lot of these like you'll see a lot out there that are memberships for launching a business that's not spec that's not nearly specific enough it's has to be geared towards employees and and like there's a clear beginning middle and end and there's an outcome uh and there's a clear Roi as opposed to like accountability or whatever it is you know what I mean right right right nothing soft and fluffy um all right so those are good I think those are really good in fact I think the first one you said is I think the right answer um that's what I would in reality that's what I would go do but to make it fun I'm gonna come up with some other ideas so is that what you had uh that's what I would it's like if it was my cousin and my cousin's like yo how do I do this I'd be like all right look this is what we're doing um you need to do this worst case scenario you're going to go learn what a bunch a bunch a bunch of blueprints for successful businesses and maybe you don't pull the trigger on any of them but still was a good use of your time and best case scenario you find one of these that you say I could do that and either you buy it or you're G to Like Remix it and create your own version of that so that is I think the right answer the second right answer would be an e-commerce company because it's not hard to build an e-commerce brand either on on Amazon or or on Shopify that can sell for a million dollars but kind of again a boring answer so I'm going to give you a more fun answer so here is uh here's one idea the four most beautiful letters in the English language are qsbs all right so what's the qsbs idea you're going to create a qsbs advisory firm what is that that's super Niche H technically this might be considered an agency but but I think we'll allow it because it's so specific in Niche here and off the beaten path so here's what you're going to do now when any company starts uh a tech company starts that's going to be qsbs eligible that qsbs eligibility is worth you have to say what qsbs is oh sorry qsbs is a tax treatment for qualified small business stock what that means is that if you're a business that fits like these five criteria which most tech companies fit then when you sell if you've held the stock for five years or even if it's a little bit less than that you can still kind of roll it over um your first $10 million of your gain are going to be tax-free not only most tech companies most new C Corps that hold for five years would would would fall there are some exceptions like you can't do it if you're a doctor or lawyer or real estate like there are things that are excluded but again that's kind of the point here is qsbs advisory we're going to help you figure out are you eligible or not and we're going to provide a letter that says we attest to the you know the belief that this is going to be qualified small business stock now why is this easy to do why is my strategy this well if I'm trying to make money it's kind of like you described with the membership I need to create 10 times more than I'm taking right this is a general rule of life that's probably a good rule of Life create more value than you're trying to take and that's what I'd be trying to do here so I was looking for something where with a small amount of work I could create a lot of value for my customer well all that sounds generic but like in this case if my stock is going to be qsbs uh eligible that might save me $10 million down the road and that's a pretty big huge benefit so would I pay $5,000 or $10,000 for um you know in legal fees in order to in advisory fees in order to um protect my possible $10 million gain I would and I think a lot of people do and so what what I would do here is I would build a advisory firm that says we are qsbs experts we know the ins and outs of qsbs were respected um I would hire maybe lawyers or accountants that have done this before and I would say hey on a as needed basis I'm gonna when I get a customer I will pay you whatever $300 an hour $500 an hour for your time to do an assessment and write a letter that basically assesses the eligibility you think for qsbs now qsbs is not like a black and white thing um it's not like a qsbs is basically when you when you get the sale you declare you say This falls under qsbs but if you ever got audited you'd have to be able to protect you know uh defend that why did you say it was qsbs eligible and so what companies and individuals do is they will go to go get a letter that basically says we as experts have looked at this business and we believe that this is going to be qsbs this is qualified small business stock you know like the 409 what's what's it called the 409 409 so when in order to do a bunch of stuff with your business you a lot of times tech companies have to get valued every year for year every year you should get valued and then that also is necessary when you want to issue new stock or whatever uh for employees or for investors you typically set a benchmark for but there's a lot of companies that do this as a service where you sp you spend five or15 to $10,000 and you don't actually give them that much information you give them your financials and then they ask you to submit like 10 publicly traded competitors and then they just like say all right we think that your valuation is blank and you you spend five to 10,000 I think for that you're basically you want it to be low usually so usually what you're trying to do is get a low 409a so that everybody's options are priced low um so it's like not not even like you're trying to justify a high valuation you're actually trying to justify a low valuation in most Cas and it's kind of crony capitalism a little bit like they'll like yeah yeah yeah we'll make it low they we'll be fair and then they wink at you uh and they like set it really low but uh yeah basically you're you're what you're suggesting is doing the same thing for qsbs which is 4 is equally valid idea but what I would do is I would I would create this for what I like about the qsbs thing is it's a little bit higher ticket so typically these people will charge let's say10 to 15,000 for the initial attestation letter I don't know if I'm saying that word right um but then on top of that you could even charge kind of like an ongoing fee because there are all these like foot faults so it's not just like a there is some genuine help so for example oh you're going to sell secondary there's things you might do wrong when you sell secondary that could disqualify you there's disqualifying events and so uh you know you can't bill for Revenue in specific ways if it's categorized as X it might take you out of qsbs Eligibility and so it's just an insurance policy it's a cover your ass it's a legal thing it's something people don't want to do themselves it's too high risk do yourself um and you literally can't do it yourself because you can't write the letter for yourself and so so uh you don't have to have it but it is a nice to have and what I would do is I would go scare the living out of every tech company that I find on crunch base and I would say don't you want this $10 million exclusion for you it's it's per person by the way it's not per company so it's per tax return so let's say there's a company with that's gonna be gonna be big every single one of those Executives is going to want their stock to be qsbs eligible and so I would go to them and I would scare the living out of them that they might get this wrong and I would tell them don't don't worry we can cover this for you and here's how we'll cover it for you pay us whatever either the lump sum up front or a monthly recurring fee or an annual recurring fee5 $1,500 a year $2,000 a year and we will uh kind of make sure we're your advisory on that so that you know you're covered at the end of the day that's a pretty brilliant idea actually you know if you just think about it right how do you get to let's say we talked about to sell a company for over a million dollars let's just round up and say you got to have $300,000 of um of annual net profits so how do you get to 300,000 of annual net profits if you're charging you know roughly $110,000 a year you only need 30 customers a year 30 customers a year I've taking shits bigger than that come on if you can't get to a million dollars this way you can't get it anyway right I think what holds a lot of people back would be there's not going to be a bunch of these so there this is not like you can't bring up 10,000 of these like you know social media marketing agencies there going to be a million of those um you have to have some expertise or partner with people who have expertise so they you know some of the some of the the mechanics of how to do it but man there's niches and riches and like that's not that hard to do to get to there so many upsells to that which is like the key to selling a company is they say all right well how does this grow and you say well do these companies also need a 409 409a do they also need these other legal services do they of course they do that's how you do it and you and you sell the dream a little bit of what the expansion Revenue comes from and the key here is you don't need to be a law firm so there's rule all kinds of rules around who can own a law firm you don't actually have to be a law firm to do this because it's not legal work it's advisory and it's like some blend of like legal accounting and just advisory and so I think because of that you don't need to be a law firm if you do this and by the way I've worked with somebody who does this if anybody actually needs this letter feel free to email me I'll I'll I'll route you to the guide you can you can actually use this because what are you going to be like the mob and take a cut for making the introduction you should I got to get my beak wet too all right uh that's actually better than my idea by the way because I actually think this is simpler because it's already a service others are providing and you're just basically connecting yeah yeah so uh I would look for things like that I had like five other ideas that would fit this but okay for this exercise we're doing one now let's move on to the main event the billion dollar idea by the way do I get a thrill of the shill before we get to the billion dollar idea oh hold on what time is it it is is time for the thrill of the shill Sam you are up your first time providing the thrill of the shill for those who don't know this is where we shamelessly shill one of our companies but we have to do it in a thrilling way meaning we got to provide some value some entertainment some insight we got to provide something a little something we gotta have attributes if we're gonna do this here we go Thrill of the show I'm gonna try and keep this one short because this this might be a short episode but basically I remember in 2017 I went to NerdWallet nerdwallet.com I went to their office Tim Chen was the CEO and founder he invested in the hustle and I remember being like Tim I'm freaking out man my expenses went up because of payroll from 30,000 to $80,000 a month and at the time they had just rented Twitter's old office and they were you know they probably had a payroll of $3 million a month or maybe even $5 million a month and I remember he looked at me funny and he was like trying to be empathetic and he was nice and and he kind of like was nice by saying oh wow wow yeah I understand and I was like Tim I'm so stressed out about this and what he said to me was basically look you kind of have to detach yourself and your payroll needs to just you just it's just a number on an Excel sheet and you just have to like figure out how do I deploy this much money here and what's my outcome going to be and what's my profit going to be and that didn't sit well with me until about 12 months ago so I launched this company called Hampton um join hampton.com it's like a community for Founders who are doing at least a million in Revenue but the average memb is like 25 million a year and I remember like that me out forever we had a team Retreat last week and I went out there and right now we've got 16 full-time employees or 15 including me and then we've also employed I think 50 facilitators now so in like 18 months we've created what's that 70 or 65 jobs something like that and I am so not stressed about it this year this is the only time I've not been stressed about payroll and providing people because the way that we've looked at it is exactly how Tim has explained where it's just like what's my input what's my output and this idea of being like a capital allocator I've never had that where it's like been as clearcut as well I hire this person I get this much out after three months it's completely changed how I've um how I've run this company and it's made me so much more relaxed and I don't know what made that shift other than his conversation but you know what I'm talking about have you ever like been through this well we both used to be kind of like oh if you're an entrepreneur you're a product maker and like we'd be sitting there writing you know you're right the hustle and you know I'm sitting there in in designing things and working with the engineers trying to make a product but there is an up level of that which is as once you build the product and the product has which Hampton does has product Market fit people like it they use it they they're in it now you're a capital allocator basically you're take you're you're just deciding where resources go so um I need to be able to like you can't be tight on money because money is your job you have to deploy that in a way that's going to get more output than the input and sometimes you'll you're not going to be 100% but no knowing that that's the job makes it easier and it sounds like having the right conversation at the right time from somebody who's appearer of yours was the key yeah and that's by the way what the one of the whole things about Hampton is that you have peers with other entrepreneurs that are of similar size company uh that that that you have and anyway that like learning I remember having our team offsite at previous companies and I'm like H like this person just had a baby basically I just had a baby how am I going to create enough Revenue in order to like provide for this kid cuz that's how it feels at first or you're like no you didn't I did remember yeah like I the one who did that hey Jess when's our baby shower just and this year it's been or or you'll be like this person cost $250,000 there's no way that's a fair salary it's like well that's a house where I'm from are you a house like yeah can I live in you you have three beds and a bath it's not I'm not paying you $250,000 so that's been my biggest takeaway this year with running Hampton so anyway if you're particularly if you're listening to this and you do at least 50 million in Revenue we're building groups for that join hampton.com all right let's do uh the billion dollar one you want me to go first can I go first okay go all right I'm gonna steal one of your lines so Sean what if I told you I had an idea this is line I'm leaning what what if I told I had an idea that Elon Musk himself would be bigger than Tesla would that interest you I'd be fairly interested keep going do you know who uh I think his name is Kai Fu Lee do you know who that investor is he's the uh no sounds awesome though he's a famous Chinese investor basically one of the early guys at Apple early at Google he wrote a great book about why China's amazing uh in terms of like why they're going to beat America and he was saying that this thing is going to replace 40% of jobs inside the next 12 years would that interest you I would love to replace 40% of jobs in the next 12 years I think that now if you're thinking I'm talking about AI you're wrong here's here here's what it is it's humanoids humanoids that's what that's the technical term basically imagine RoboCop or imagine machines and I think that this whole uh business of humanoids which is robots to automate a lot of processes but a lot of people think like just blue collar job but that's not entirely true it's like every type of job so Elon Musk said that um that Tesla has is working on humanoids I think it's called Optimus is what it's called and he went on to say that uh like at a recent investor call he was like not a lot of you people are talking about Optimus are robots but I think that's crazy because this is actually going to be bigger than our car business bigger than self-driving bigger than solar it's going to be bigger than everything and I don't think you guys realize how big this is going to be I invested in this company uh in a space called figure and I talked to Brett Adcock we had him on here here and he basically has me convinced that this is going to be like the biggest industry mover the in the next like 10 or 15 years and I think that what I would do you invested in figure yeah is that is that did I tell you that for the 30th time no no no no I've never told you that that's funny but uh what valuation $300 million I think okay that's not bad and I invested bad but it's not that bad well I invest and I invested a lot for me which I think is around $60 ,000 well yeah he's like your hero so you know you actually just paid for some time with yeah I paid for Access I paid for him to reply to a text uh but basically that that was a lot of money for me I don't normally invest that much but my reasoning is is like this could I could see it going out of business which is incredibly likely I could see it selling for $3 billion or I could see it becoming like a $50 billion company um but it's like any Angel investment I think the likelihood of it going out of business is incredibly High but basically here's my reasoning if you or why reasoning why I think this could be a big company I think this is going to be like one of the biggest things that happens in the next 15 years I think that the people who are working on this space are typically like hardcore uh Hardware engineering nerds and I think that I could spend a year going to every Meetup going to car car melon which I think a lot of these folks come from and I think I could find a handful of people and do a really good job of organizing these people around company I think that I could do a good job of cold emailing the Brett ax of the world and getting in with them as well as some of the older guys in the space and making them like open up to me and say what are tangentially like the areas that you're not attacking that are interesting I think I can get them to explain to me uh these problems I think that um I think this is so big that there's going to be more of these robots than there are humans and I also think that when you in order to create a billion dollar company or a company that can net you a billion dollars that's just you have to go huge and you I think that the odds are what I'm doing personally in my life I don't have a goal becoming a billionaire but I think that could happen is I'm creating companies that sell for a small amount of money and then I'm letting compounding kind of like do the rest that's going to take me 50 or 80 years who knows how long that's going to take me but if you want to make it in a short amount of time you pretty much have to raise VC and you have to do it in an industry that's like a Title Wave where you're just trying to catch that wave if you want to do it in like 10 years rather um and so I think I would go into the humanoid space what do you think about that well as you know I love that idea because I was going to say that idea and you said no can I say that idea today and I said all that's not what I said I said I said literally read that out already can I have that will you send me that and I'll say it with my lips and I was like all right fine bro um well let me tell you something interesting all right let me add to it so obviously 100% agree I think I I actually was specifically thinking like um warehouse robots like I would even just kind of narrow it down and be like all right uh if I was really going to do this I would try to figure out what job in a warehouse I can eliminate by using a robot um which is what like packing boxes B I would look at the minimum wage labor class and I would say um nobody wants minimum wage essentially the workers don't want to be minimum wage the employers don't want to pay minimum wage and get like kind of a flaky output and so I had a friend once that was telling me he's like uh I invest in companies with no product Market fit risks my friend V and I said what do you mean I've never I just thought every startup has product Market fit risk that's the whole point you're trying to get to product Market fit he goes no I invest with no product Market fit risk I never heard that before and he goes I'm just looking for technical risk meaning if you could build it the job is done and he's like of course you'll still go sell it but like there it will be so easy at that point the market will obviously absorb this if it can actually do it there are many things like this so like self-driving if you can actually make self safe self-driving cars cars that do not crash that are you know uh self-driving and obviously there's always the edge cases but there's infinite market demand for people not to want to be driving and sitting in traffic and having their car parked instead of having it go run around and earn the money by dropping people off and so he his idea you know he invested in this pizza robot company so it was like basically which was awesome Zoom yeah well there was there was like a few of them at the time I don't think any of them worked out there's always like these waves and it's like it was too early the tech wasn't there and all the companies crash and burn but like the next wave should start right now and actually that's maybe where I would go with this so he's like you know if you're Domino's do you want to pay you know whatever I don't know what they pay $15 an hour for somebody who's gonna call in sick they're going to be checking their phone they're going to be goofing off they're going to be eating pepperonis off the pizzas they're gonna you know uh they're going to get in fights with the other people there and you know then they leave and then you have to replace them and then you have to train that new person or would you rather buy one machine that prints a perfect pizza every single time 247 never never calls in sick never complains never asks you for more money never asks for a raise never spits in the food never does would you rather have that it's like oh of course you would always have the robot that makes the perfect pizza and he's like making a pizza is incredibly like it's a it's a sandboxed thing it's like not like a robot that can do anything it's a specific robot that can make a pizza it can flatten the dough into a perfect circle apply the cheese apply the sauce whatever bake it for a certain time and then put it in the box and cut it and like that's what that needs to do and I'm going to you know so so what I would do is I would go and do exactly what you said like go to MIT go to Carnegie melon and be like hey guys we're building a pizza robot and when we do there's whatever how many pizza chains you know how many pizza restaurant location how many pizza chains in the US and by the way there was a company called Zoom Zoom Zoom I forget that went out of business and people made fun of them they're like in the headlines they got totally mocked they raised $500 million that was cool and that definely could have work I think they screwed it up they like went they like made restaurants that you could go to that that was not right there's 80,000 Pizza chain pizza restaurants in the country 880,000 and you would start with the chains because the chains actually have the most to gain by doing this right they they budgets they'll they'll sign letters of intent like I remember when boom supersonic the airplane company came out at YC and they were like yeah we have a hundred million purchase order from Like Richard Branson if we could build this plane they're going to buy it so now the question is do you think me and packing nerds behind me can build this plane that's the bet and like whether you do or don't believe it that was the BET and I like that idea I'll I'll tell you another thing about the robotics thing before I like test I like Tech RIS a little bit more than like demand RIS for sure yeah yeah I agree me me too um even though that's not at all how I've you know thought about it before but if I was gonna go try to build a billion- dollar company I would go try to build one with only Tech risk and not demand risk um so there's here I'm GNA tell you a little little story here so shout out to this guy Abe you probably don't know Abe but his boss Kevin Ryan came on the Pod so Kevin Ryan comes on the Pod he's fascinating but like he had this Aura of I'm a badass who does badass things but I'm kind of busy and so uh of course Ben applied Ben's law so the the Ben's law for those who don't know is you don't try to contact Sean you contact Ben Ben is the faster more approachable smarter better better human being to to approach and get the Insight on and and get in touch with me than trying to go to me directly and so Ben applied Ben's law Ben goes and he finds Kevin Ryan's Ben and so he finds the number two that's you know like there and so he finds this guy Abe Abe Murray and uh I was I'm subscribed to Abe's newsletter and he just had a good one which he goes um he goes why the consensus view of Robotics is wrong and he goes I think that most people think you know the future of robots is is this humanoid and maybe a humanoid that walks and has arms and legs uh is the is the eventual solution but that might be too far out right now and actually we should look at the most successful robot in the world today what is it the dishwasher it's installed in everybody's home already it's a robot dishwasher it replaced that job of having to wash dishes for you know the majority of homes he goes it doesn't have arms and legs it doesn't look like a human it is a purpose-built robot that one specific need and they have some company called renovate Robotics and the picture is basically it's a robot that sits on a roof that does Roofing jobs so it'll go and it'll replace a roof basically it just goes up and down your roof uh you know or like not replace but like you know uh lay down the roof or whatever like you know install a roof on a on a home and he's like if this works it's going to be he's like we just did the first robotically installed roof if this works again you have lower cost higher quality more like consistency uh more availability you know for for roofing companies and so I like this idea of these purpose-built specific robots the equivalent of dishwashers and pizza making robots and Roofing robots uh if I was going to do the billion dollar idea that's what I would do but I'll listen to their home page their homeage is labor is the biggest challenge for roofers our robots make roofers twice as productive and improve safety by reducing work at height easy that's an easy sale another and I'll another reason why robots are interesting is you are only working within the laws of physics and the laws of physics I find I find those to be a bit easier to work in compared to say creating the next Louis Vuitton like to creating a brand or consumer product I actually think it's more complicated than just saying well I like because that's an infinite number of options within Hardware it's just like it's just like so much simpler and straightforward versus generating demand or creating a brand that people love or creating a social product that people love which is so much more rare and more challenging have you heard Elon Musk quote uh the the only real laws are physics everything else is a recommendation no but that's brilliant uh all right so that's a great idea I think these uh purpal robots um that's a great idea I came up with says you well I'm saying that's these these these this robot idea I think is is the right idea um any by the way here's a way to like create more luck like this our buddy furcon uh has this space in San Francisco called Founders Inc f. in and what he did I was like so what's the plan he's like I'm just going to recruit like the smartest hackers I can find and just be like hey here's a free office here I'm gonna help you out and I'm gonna invest in you before you even know what the hell you're doing and uh I'm gonna help you get these off the ground I was like well that's great but how are you gonna get the best hackers he goes I'm gonna give him toys like what do you mean toys he goes I took the first floor of the entire office there there's no desks it's just a hardware robotics lab he's like so I'm buying like 3D printers drones laser cutting equipment robotic arms stuff that the average hacker can't buy you know the average you know 22y old engineer can't go buy this you know $15,000 thing or $30,000 thing but Fon can buy it and he's like I'm just gonna make it available for free and come in here and work on it and so now he's got in that lab there's a guy who's got a brain device that you put on your head and it like makes you more focused there's a guy who's there's a company called Orange Wood Labs that basically they have this robotic arm that can um do whatever you program it to do so when I went in there they were like watch we're g to make it uh you know make a margarita watch this uh we can make this and the the application they're doing is painting or like I don't know powder coating or something like that yeah powder Co like you ever done powder coating and I was like no you know what dangerous I was like no stop asking me questions and they're like well I think everything is powder coater yeah it's basically like how you you know you do it on Floors you do it on any metals or whatever like for a car or something like that so they were like yeah this thing can powder coat basically better and faster like automatically um and so it could do jobs at like you know one fifth of the price of a human being because we just give him the robot the robot just goes and does it and then it comes home and that's it and so I was like oh interesting um but there's a lot of people building stuff like this and one way to increase their indiy is to like go to these kind of Hardware Labs or go find out where they hang out and just go talk to people see what they're what they're building and they people who do thisal they're not they're not a lot of them don't care about business a lot of them are unorganized it's like the the typical like scientist who wears like who forgets to put one sock on and only wears like one sock or like their shoes on on the wrong foot it's like they're just like these brilliant people who don't necessarily care about stuff and I think if you can be the organizer you can win um what do you have all right so my path to a billion uh do you want the dark idea or you want the light idea do you want the the good idea or the evil idea which one do you want I don't know uh that's I want to go dark I think but okay give you both but I'll do the dark one fast so here's the here's the big pitch for the dark idea andil for some other country you could figure the rest out from there uh what Palmer lucky has done with andril for the US defense department do it for Israel do it for do it for another country go find a country that wants you know Advanced weapons technology and be like cool I'm going to recruit the brightest mines and we're going to give us like you know 50 million to 150 million dollar contract and we'll get started here dude Palmer's on a tear lately I would literally go look at the road map for Andre I'd be like oh they built this like uh missile that can fly itself you know and lives in this like vending machine I don't know if you saw that video of like yes amazing heet inside I'd be like cool do pick from the Ander Roll menu we're going to figure out how to build those and you guys will own the IP that's what I would do if I really had to you know if I was if I wanted to go into more of the the gray or dark areas where it's you know there's a bit of war and destruction involved but here's the light idea here's another idea um we're buying a university okay so what are we doing there are a lot of colleges for sale more than you would think uh are they on they're on Deal stream so go to a website called dealstream come on that was kind of funny well they could be deal stream is literally like Quiet Light it's just different name it's the same idea it's a business Bridge uh but if you look colleges for sale they're they're there and they're not that expensive you could buy colleges for like $5 million $10 million so to do this you're going to need a lot of money but the good news is that universities are worth a lot of money like what would you Peg the value at let's start at the top end like what do you think Stanford or Harvard is worth if somebody really if Mega billionaire genius wanted to buy Stanford or Harvard what what would it even cost could would it be like a a Harvard hundred plus billion dollars I mean the endowment alone I think is like what the endowment alone is almost h100 billion do right so yeah it's hard to even the whole inada has got to be 500 billion it might like these are companies that are worth sorry universities are essentially properties that are worth you know a Facebook they're crazy they're crazy Harvard endowments is is 53 billion so yeah I don't know they it 100 to 200 300 billion something like that yeah like so big that it's hard to understand hard to even fathom right not for sale can't be bought essentially same thing with Stanford now let's even go to like a Belmont right so like let's just do some quick math here where I went Belmont University you went to Belmont what's the tuition at Belmont back then it was 30,000 let's see what it is now Belmont University tuition $38,000 all right so $38,000 and how many students go to Belmont let's say 5,000 5,000 uh per year per year per or the whole whole university you could say um let's say 1,800 per year all right so let's go let's Round Up to 2,000 so even a small small private SCH where where Isabel I don't even know where it is Nashville Tennessee it looks like they have 7,300 students so 2,000 per class let's say cool so 76 million dollar Topline that's not counting endowments that's not counting gr grants and research it's not counting the facts that it's tax-free that it's has like all these other benefits like we so you can actually see see the numbers by the way the Belmont's uh annual revenue is $464 million their expenses are $350 million so they make $100 million a year in profit they only have $200 million in liabilities and they have $1.5 billion in asset and that's for a nowhere University so that's the game plan we're we're building one of those now what are we going to do so we're going to go buy one what are we buying we're essentially buying two things I want the campus and I want the liquor license and by liquor license I mean the accreditation as long as it's already accredited I want have to go through that process now uh why do I want a campus Because I want the land I want the buildings I want the depreciation I want a physical place because I think it adds to The Prestige um we will have a large online component but whatever now the main go goal here is we got to Brand this school and so what are we going to do we're going to make it a bit of a luxury product meaning it's going to be only for the elite of the elite so um you know we have to have a lower acceptance rate than Harvard we have to be known for we're going to sponsor competitions for like mathlete type of competitions hardcore science competitions we are going to go around the country to high schools and basically be like we're going after Gamers programmers and hardcore math kids and we're going to sponsor ton of competitions guess what those sponsorships cost pizza the currency is essentially you provide free pizza there is no competition when I was doing our Esports company that we sold to Twitch I was like all right we want to create the world's biggest high school Esports league and we did in like less than a year guess what it cost like 450 pizzas is what it cost me to like sponsor these programs uh it cost nothing and so we're going to go and we're going to first we're g to get in front of them now uh when I why did I go to Duke University I went because like in fifth grade Duke did something called the Nationwide Talent identification program and I'll be damned if my mom didn't want to find out if her kid was talented and so we take this test and we take this test and is that like the Indian version of like a uh like one of those model competitions they have at the mall when you were 12 yeah it's a beauty it's like sports but for brown people so um so my mom puts me in this I really I I think every kid in my school took it they just went to the school and they were like Hey we're trying to identified the most talented gifted and talented kids also parents can you put your uh income on the statement as well so exactly that impacts your IQ a little bit and uh you know we got to get paid so I got a scoreback and a goodie bag and literally the goodie bag was a Rubik's Cube and I I don't know what the hell was going on but whatever that is I'm going to go find the marketing coordinator that did this Duke Talent identification program we're stealing that we're going to go get them while they're young fifth sixth grades we're going to be identifying these special you know special gift and talented kids uh so we're making it super prestigious you already know the name's gonna have some old money right you know you know um you know we're going I've already done this before with the private school names but like bridgemont Oakland or walf uh Kennedy exceler yeah exactly so we're definitely going that way um we're gonna have our own entrance exam so we don't take the SATs because we're not peasants and so you're gonna uh we're going to go from City to city and we're going to have our own entrance exam it's going to be a Sixpoint exam uh I don't know what that means but I let's just say that's what it is um now what else are we going to do you know these speaker bureaus where you can go pay like $50,000 for Obama to speak yeah we're doing that more like $2 million for Obama but yeah okay well we're we got a budget all right and the budget gonna be like we have like a $6 million speaker budget so when I'm raising this money for this I'm gonna basically raise 50 to$ 75 million maybe $100 million for this and a lot of that is front-loaded in brand building and one of the things we're going to do is about five to six million dollars a year at speaker fees and so I'm basically goingon to pull the Sam bankman freed without the fraud so you know s bank freed took the money and basically was like how do I everybody that FTX is like a thing and it's legitimate he's like Tom Brady um Larry David Steph Curry this Arena oh uh this guy is like a super connector in Hollywood I'm gonna put a hundred million dolls into his fund and now he's gonna make he's gonna get me you know dinner with Bill Bill and Hillary Clinton and like that's what he literally did and although he did a bunch of screwed up things honestly it's kind of inspiring the way he just threw his weight around using money to like build a brand um if he had not literally stolen money from customer deposits to do so that would have just been an incredible uh approach by an entrepreneur like it actually would have been very like lauded of how he did it in the same way that like you know Uber is is sort of praised for the way it just like brute forced its way into different cities and actually like built a huge Global brand so that's what I would do so speaker fees those are going on the website those are going viral um to get those people to do like kind of speeches to our kids um and we're going to also spend a ton of money on Direct marketing so no University really goes D Toc except for the low-end University of Phoenix type of um that's crazy and by the way they are amazing at it they are really at it they buil5 billion business doing it in the world of like direct response there's like Financial newsletters then there's like Omaha Stakes who like crushes it and the stamps.com world and ere erectile dysfunction and then like video game people and then universities University of Phoenix crushes it I think I think them and like full sale are in the top like 20 of Spenders on Google yeah yeah exactly and you know it Technical Institute of running TV ads and stuff like that that's what I would do so I'd basically go through podcasts I'm going to blanket them every every intellectual podcast that parents listen to I'm going to blanket it with with ads for this um and the ads aren't apply apply now come here the ads are going to be about how hard it is to get in about it's going to be more native stuff about controversy is it right or wrong that the school is so hard to get into that it's only for the gifted and talented that they're discriminating and only allowing the smart kids in and I would actually drum up controversy around that in order to uh to build the brand because there's no better brand than a brand that of something you can't get into so there's this amazing article that says lessons you can learn from for-profit universities on cosper click advertising the University of Phoenix in the last five years has spent $3 billion do in marketing on Google alone it's estimated they're spending roughly $5 million a month and they receive roughly 70,000 to 880,000 clicks per month off of Google that's insane that is insane that's wild now what else would I do okay so I'm spending a ton of money on ads um I hired the best branding agency in the world I'm spending money on the speakers fees again I'm spending spending spending now how do I make money okay well obviously you have things like your tuition but I actually think there's another another way you could do this it involves my good old friend nfts okay so uh hear me out hear me out you're going to respect this idea when you're hear have you ever seen when a stadium launches that they sell something called psls do you know what those are is that like season ticket holders for a certain period of time or like founding Club think you're paying 225 $50,000 oh you must be getting tickets no no no you got a personal seat license and the license just allows you to buy the ticket you can't even buy the ticket without the license so literally imagine every chair in the stadium and they basically have their own license each one has its own license you have to buy the license in order to buy the tickets once you buy the tickets now you can now you can sell it now you can sell the license you can sell whatever right they use this to fundraise so I kind of had this idea around universities which was if I wanted to start a university let's say it was going to have you know 5,000 or 10,000 students a year well why wouldn't I sell 10,000 why wouldn't I mint a 10,000 nft package for around this and again I built the brand up I have a real story here unlike most nfts I have a real story and the story is this what would it be worth to buy a seat at Harvard to own one seat in every admissions class in Harvard you could use it for your own kid you could gift it out as a scholarship or you could sell it to somebody who wants to go to yeah because the the rental property the value of a good diploma it should go up every decade so like a Belmont University they don't have any street cred so like my value isn't going up a Harvard a Stanford goes up but then if they have a controversy like Penn State did it goes down correct and so I want to have 10,000 admissions licenses essentially so this is a a a ticket you buy there's one of one you own it you could decide if you use it if you gift it or if you rent it out to a student that year and it's going to pay you rental income you're going to get a piece of the revenue a piece of the profits from the from the uh from the from the tuition now I think that you could sell these for probably at least 25,000 if not 50,000 each right so like I think that's a low end for what you can do if you again tell the story properly and your boy's a good Storyteller so let's say we get we end up getting to $50,000 a piece we sell 10,000 of these um I just raised $500 million okay so yeah that's a that's a pretty big initial set of funding but I think you could do that to get this off the ground without having to go get rich VCS or billionaires to fund this thing and so I think what you could do is do maybe 10,000 or $20,000 per per seat here sell 10,000 of these and you know we're going to price these all in eth that's just five eth five eth that you own uh you know a seat at this prestigious University and so I don't know if I would do it year one but maybe year two I would move to that once I built a little bit of the brand momentum and I would say uh you're G to own something that's GNA pay you back every single year so you might have spent 10 grand on it but you're going to get back you know two grand a year or a$ thousand dollars a year in in income plus you own this prestigious asset that's going to appreciate over time and you could sell your whole seat later I think you answer the out of this question uh I think that's that's it's a very compelling argument I would probably do normal tuition but I understand that you do normal tuition in addition that's the beauty of these psls you do normal tuition on top of selling this initial seat it's just that person gets a REV share of the tuition the biggest thing that's wild here is that you can go onto dealstream which I am and I'm looking at universities that you can buy here's a university for $8.5 million that you can purchase fully accredited which I don't know what the value of that is uh and you get a campus y uh this particular University had Peak enrollment in 2017 with 2 million in Revenue this is wild Wild's one right here fully accredited University Southern California a fully accredited University in SoCal all right 25 million it's accredited its degree is recognized all around the world they can the school can offer F1 Visas so you know we're getting that international student money because you know who likes being accepted into a hard to get into program in the United States more than a US citizen somebody in China and so we're going to go ham on International students we're g to you know uh that's gonna be a big part of the marketing so this says this the school has about 900 students enrolled in undergrad MBA and DBA programs um there's one physical campus and one branch campus so they I think this particular one has it says Title 9 is possible and I think with Title 9 I think that means you get government funding for sports yeah yeah exactly you're eligible for for getting funding uh from it and this is crazy right so I would you know I would just keep my eyes peeled for about a year I would go around and you know one thing that every rich person likes is the idea of like fixing education and I would just go tell them this is a school that you would have wanted to go to right it's a school that is um you know based around people who actually build things and make things it's going to be a school that prioritizes projects over lectures it's a school that is um you know it's uh it's competitive and and it's not online it's not online and we're trying to uh build the next brand these old Brands like you know even the best you know the the Harvard's the stanfords the whatever there hasn't you know what where is the new one these are like hundreds of years old There's an opportunity to build something fresh and we want you to be a part of it you know I think that that pitch would get a lot of people excited to cut you know mlion doll checks I think that was a 9.5 out of 10 pitch I think you did pretty good you did a great job by starting it off of what do you think Harvard's worth and I'm like I don't even know unlimited money not it's it's it's not even sellable probably it's not even buyable rather what's Stanford worth what's University of pen I like it's I don't know it's they're it's invaluable almost um that's a that's a very good pitch Bravo all right well that's that's the episode that is the how to make a million bucks and how to make a million dollars uh from from your boys at my first million a million and a billion that's the [Music] pod [Music]

Jess ma she is the most impressive entrepreneur I've ever met how did you have the confidence to go into a space like that they studied computer science at UC Berkeley and when I was a senior at Berkeley I was running in the computer science club and I brought in these speakers and one of the speakers I brought in was this kid named Sam Alman he was building a company called looped and I'm like hey Sam what should I do after college and he said oh you should do YC and he helped review my application my first company was called indera and then a few years ago I went through a really tough experience where my boyfriend who I was living with died very unexpectedly and I was not able to work I'd be super depressed and I didn't want to do anything and I thought what would I do if I was going to die this year if this was my last year here because I'm so depressed and I have to make myself happy what would I do what would I do if I wasn't scared of failure and after my boyfriend died I thought a lot more about that I've seen Rock Bottom my life can't get any worse than it is today so I might as well try something

the average sale of a New York home is like $800,000 the Mansion tax starts at a million you have a second bedroom mansion yeah so their mansion tax it's close to 4% basically if you purchase a two-bedroom apartment in New York City you basically have to say all right here's an additional 40,000 just for buying a two-bedroom apartment in New York City it's a very challenging place to live because of that you live in New York right I do live in New York what will it take for you to move nothing I've come to the realization that I'm willing to pay for the experience yes the taxes are higher but I feel like the money that I give on those higher taxes is very much in exchange for the density of New York City the experience all of that and so to some degree it's like the biggest expense I pay every year but it's because of the quality of life that I want and so I just come to terms with it and like you stroke the check every year

all right today we're talking about an app that is taking off that I think might be the next Tik Tok it's a Chinese app that you've probably never heard of uh Sam got all the numbers behind a cold plunge business that's doing over hundred million doll a years including their ad numbers which is rare you almost never get to see that and lastly we talk about lessons that we learned from Jess ma a Founder who has built a business up to $900 million and she shared one or two golden little nuggets that we wanted to talk about enjoy this [Music] episode all right let me give you an update on something so we had you know I take a lot of pride in the fact that we've had some people on here right before their like Fame Arc really took off we had Brian Johnson on here uh you said that he mentioned like yeah you guys are one of my first people another one Andrew humman we talked to Andrew humman I remember we talked to him and I think he was like in this hallway in Stanford or something like doing an interview with us and after the pod or during the Pod I told him that like cold plunging is interesting to me and after the Pod he goes hey I want to send you a cold plunge and I was like that's very kind of you I I would love that and so he introduced me to this guy named Ryan Ryan Dewey Ryan sent me a cold plune and the company now it's it's uh what's the URL actually is it I don't even know what is it plunge. comom plunge. comom it's just called plunge um he sent me this thing and I started using it and I loved it and I dug it and by the way this also sounds like an ad this is not an ad I have nothing to do with these guys um but but Ryan I will take a free pledge I said no earlier I Chang my mind did you say no when he offered you one I said no I said no the first time that's crazy and uh I was wrong I'm I'm man enough to admit it I was wrong I would like a plunge thank you yeah they're awesome but here's the deal when he was selling them at the time I think they were like $3,500 now I think they're like $5,500 and I didn't know if I liked doing it so I was like yeah I'll take one that because that's a lot of money to spend just for to test something out and so I got an update on these guys I think they only launched in 2020 and in preparation for this podt I just went and talked to him and got a bunch of numbers this year they're so here listen to their revenue in 2020 so the way it started is Ryan and his partner Michael they each separately owned um brick and Mort bus businesses one of them Ryan owned this thing called a float therapy uh Center or I don't know float tank yeah it's like you go it's like a I I used to call it a deprivation T I used to do it in San Francisco every once in a while you like sit in this like tanning bed that's filled with salt water you basic float and it's completely dark and no noise and you feel funky it's kind of cool his other partner owned like a like a I think it was called reboot it was like a sauna that you could go to an LA but Co happens so both of those businesses get screwed and so they're like man we got to figure something out and they noticed that at their places people were asking for coal plunges and they also saw that online I think at the time it was like 15 grand to get a coal plunge as opposed to what a lot of people do what I used to do in college is you get like a big trash can and you just got to go to like 7-Eleven and buy ice and fill your your thing up your your bucket with with water hose uh or hose uh water from the hose and it takes forever whatever and they're like all right let's create our own so 2020 they did 270,000 in Revenue 2021 they did 8 million 2022 I think we got it in 21 or 22 whenever Andrew came on 2022 they did 33 million in Revenue this year 2023 they're doing around 10 million a month and they're going to surpass 100 million in Vue off freaking cold plunges it's wild insane and the way they the way he told me they got started was they basically DMD Aubrey Marcus who's this health guy on Instagram who owns on it and they were like hey man we're gonna we'll come to your house and just set up a cold plunge for free and so they get a U-Haul and they fill it up with this like little homemade thing that they did they Ed like a bunch of parts from Home Depot I'd imagine because I have an early version it looks like something you could kind of hack together and they brought it to his place and they set it up for him and they were like is there anyone else you think we should talk to and he's like yeah huberman talk to this guy and so they get a U-Haul and they fill it up with five more and they start delivering it to these guys and I guess that's how I got it plunge tour they would they fill up four or five of these go on a plunge tour and they would Instagram while they were doing it and so people on IG would see it like like me I would see it on IG and it' be like damn this must be like some super successful company cuz they're they're they're only delivering to people that I know like you know influencers basically even though there were no other customers it was only those customers yeah and there's it was only like a few of them it was like they they they threw this thing together and I guess that's when I kind that's when Andrew like I guess they were like Andrew you know we have this money for you to give away do you want to give away to whoever they gave one to me they gave one to sill they so far they've given away hundreds of these things and they're killing it and never in a million years would have thought a cold plune business would do north of 100 million in Revenue by the way they've given away over a thousand plunges that's insane right that's like the that means influencer marketing was like so important uh to to them at the beginning our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better a couple other fun facts got I say a couple of these that you have on your notes yeah do it they bought plunge. comom off of a New Orleans jazz band for 250k which is just hilarious that's a that's wild they basically are riding this wave so if you look on Google Trends we'll put this up on the screen on on YouTube you could see basically cold plunge versus ice bath and just both of them rising over time as like you know the kind of the huberman era kicks in here so they they're right in the back of that but the insane thing is this ads spend you got to talk about this you talk about it because this is in your this is your wheelhouse but basically what they did was they um Ryan I've met Ryan he's almost like he he I don't know the best way to describe it but he's one of these guys that was doing iasa before iasa was cool like when I went and hung out with him like he had his toenails painted because like there's something around that I don't exactly know what it is but there's like something around that like he's like eccentric and I don't think he probably knew anything about Google ads or Facebook ads and so he said he hired a guy on upwork to help run Google ads for them and that's how they started so what and and he even sent me a screenshot basically it shows their revenue it shows their ad spend it shows it broke it down on Google Facebook and even Bing a little bit but like just looking at their total paid media I want to zoom in on this this is these are kind of Bonkers numbers so this is is this a month wait what what is this I think this is last monthly I think this is monthly which is crazy so last month I don't know if it's last month but one month 860,000 in ad spend so 860k in a month and then their row as on that return on ad spend was 7.1 to get just to put this in this is the that's bananas nobody has seven or eight X row as they said they've had that basically from the beginning they they used to get uh 10 over 10x now it's sort of like between seven and 10x um to get a 7x row as that means you're it's you have a machine they put a box in this guy's house and it's a magic box and the box says if you put $1 into this box you get $7 out that's what that means and so they have this box that they're able to put $800,000 in each month and get out you know6 million I dollar back and they're just doing that month after month after month and so you see it on Google their roaz is you know 5.8 on Facebook it's 10.7 I don't know why they're saying this by the way I would never reveal this information if I if I found a magic box that does this uh you know I would never share this with anybody but they said to do it so you know here here you go I think maybe they think they're they're pretty far ahead in terms of competition but I don't know that if they can get these numbers anyone can get these numbers on Facebook there's not they have no Special Sauce there that that's going to be you know uncopyable I guess why why did they agree to share this I just said I'm going to talk about you in the Pod like let me interview you and I said whatever we talk about this is like on the record uh so I guess if they change their mind they'll let me know well I mean it's cool that they get a big feature that's cool but also this is crazy and just props to them these numbers are insane so basically they own the whole thing so they bootstrap they haven't taken any funding and this is by the way 2020 so they're coming up at four years so on Facebook and this snapshot here uh if this is accurate the the SN this the CAC on Facebook so the cost to acquire a customer on Facebook for them is $387 they're selling this thing for $5,000 so you can see you're paying just under 400 bucks to get somebody to pay you 5,000 bucks uh amazing trade on on the ad spend and you could see why this thing is scaling so crazy you know over wild 8 million 33 million and now over 100 million and they bootstrapped it this is profitable they didn't raise any outside money and now they're expanding into like saunas and other [ __ ] too so that's pretty insane what do you think this company could sell for let's say they they get to I have no idea what the profit is let's say they get to 100 so 2020 they started at 200 a quarter million dollars me 2020 in year four their fourth year business they're going to do 100 million what could this sell for is this could this be a two or300 million company definitely definitely um you know I would if you're getting like just to put this in perspective if you're getting adx Raz on your money and let's say that continues let's say they can if they said they're doing you know whatever eight to 10 million a month so they're over $100 million say 120 million in Revenue the minimum that they should be selling for is onx revenue so 120 million in this case let's say that because of their growth rate because of the insane profitability on their on their ads this company has to be you know Mak a bank right like normally people most people in e-commerce are Break Even or slightly losing money on first order the you know that gets you that's like you have a row as of like between one and two these guys are doing you know six or seven times better than that so so that's kind of insane this company should be worth you know 250 $300 million right now you know I I don't know how big that clear light Sonic company is but I'm pretty sure it's pretty big man if I'm these guys I might take that sale that to make that amount of money in three or four years and I don't know what their financial situation was before but let's just assume that they were just getting by owning a brick andmar business that's why that that is a crazy story I would take advantage of that or I would sell like $30 million of secondary I would sell like $30 million at even like a $100 million valuation and dilute 30% only but now you guys you know you put 15 million bucks in the bank and you can keep going if you really want to keep going that's what I would do uh in this case because you could bank that huge life-changing sum uh because these e-commerce companies let's say that you know ad flips competition flips whatever they don't like retain that much value because the s is already done in the past you basically get no credit for past you know past sales here because it's not recurring Revenue it's not like a network effect style business so you know you're really only as good as your next year when it comes to e-commerce I think at least so yeah I would I would definitely take some money off the table it's crazy though and and by the way I don't know like what the science is behind Cold plunging I still I've had how long have I owned it for two or three years I still use it three days a week like I'm into it it's clinically proven to make you post on social media at least three times more so that's one proven effect there was this one Tik Tok where these guys were joking they were like you know it's crazy to think about it but for the first 20 minutes after the Titanic sank the passengers were actually healthier uh until they died uh they actually were increasing their lifespan by 20% during that first cold plch until they suddenly died they're like they're like too bad whim Hoff wasn't there to teach him how to breathe right uh they reduce their risk of heart attack they're like they're like imagine if whim Hoff was there like this feels nice but there was about 15 minutes with he should do he should Rebrand to the Titanic method he should be like oh you don't do Titanic breathing this was this would save you would live even if you on the Titanic if you learned this [ __ ] there was about 15 minutes where they were in Peak Physical shape um anyway that's the update on pledge I finally got an on them I'm shocked at how they're doing um I guess I'm not that shocked it's $5,000 product I guess I guess I'm shocked at how many people would buy into this never in a million years would I've thought this many people would buy into this and want to get cold however many times a week um so that's my update on plunge I got one thing I want to jump right into it's something that's been on my mind it's been grinding my gears it's been a little uh a little itch I need to scratch and that is supplement testing so you're a big supplements guy it sounds like you're setting up an ad by the way we have to say this is not an ad no no this is not an ad this is just me being uh corny so uh I've been thinking about this idea because I've been buying a [ __ ] ton of supplements and um I don't know about you but like people are like oh you know you take that I'm like yeah they're like um how how do like is it working I'm like how the [ __ ] how would I know it's a supplement you never know if a supplements working right like I feel that way I don't know if I'm just not in tune with my body when you take stuff do you have like a clear like this is helping me versus this is not when it comes to actual like supplements there's basically only one or two supplements that I've ever taken where I'm like this is working so I take either melatonin or magnesium at night um and that's the only those are the only two where I'm like all right I'm it helps me go to sleep faster besides that protein so but protein is it protein is a supplement but it's you know it's it's a nutrient so like when I eat more protein whether it comes through a powder or not I notice my muscles get bigger besides that I don't think I've noticed a difference in mostly anything even protein for me it's not even like I feel my muscles getting bigger I just feel more full so I'm like okay that did something like that is like kind of like a meal replacement uh got it but like even creatine I started taking creatine and um I thought that creatine would be I thought creatine was going to be the hard [ __ ] I was like oh okay here we go I've crossed the line I'm doing the hard [ __ ] now now it's just going to be like a little unfair these gains that I'm about to be having can't feel anything you with [ __ ] no I don't feel anything when I was taking testosterone I felt that but that's I don't know if that would be under the the the heading of supplements but like basically if it's illegal or banded Sports I've noticed a difference besides that if I could buy it if I could buy it at Target I don't know if I've noticed a difference right if you're not having to text a guy guy to get it you're not going to feel it so I feel like with supplements There's an opportunity the opportunity with supplements is to be the most trusted Source when it comes to supplements so for you where do you go when you want to find out if which brand you should be taking or which brand you should not be taking or what's the most effective what's the cleanest what's the healthiest for you where do you go to get that information right now so I use examine.com to figure out which uh supplements are like which the science has shown that it works but examine.com the brand right that's yeah exam.com in order to stay neutral they don't promote any Brands right and so I go to Amazon I talk to friends it it's pretty challenging it's also challenging because do you remember the mattress review websites like the top one it ended up being owned by Casper exactly and so it was incredibly challenging to find like which like for example some protein Brands will say we have 25 gram of protein per scoop and then you go research it and it's like no this one actually only has 18 or this has some certif certification which means they had to jump through this hoop or that hoop it's actually quite challenging to figure out who's clean and who to trust yeah I think it was Casper that owned was it Casper or purple that that owned a bunch of the the top mattress blogs that had like they were like for 15 years they were like a normal blog and they went bottom out and then they like started promoting their own [ __ ] and it's a same thing with with supplements you know like the what's rule number one if you create a protein brand you go you buy your brand name your domain and then you buy the truth abpr docomo need that too in order to promote your own [ __ ] it's really hard it's really hard the reality is that supplements health and wellness are on the way up uh people are are it's becoming more and more normal to take a wider and wider variety of these things there's more and more brands in the market because now you have dtoc Brands so anyone can create a brand you don't need to fight for shelf space because you could just be on the internet the infinite shelf and I think the need has become bigger than ever for somebody to become The Trusted person and I say person specifically here The Trusted person around supplement testing and um have you seen this guy flave City no how do you spell it f La V uh then City so flave city is this guy that my mom will send me my mom will always send me the thing so this guy's stick is genius like in terms of content creation this is such a good Niche and um it is so perfect so what he does is he's like I'm a trusted guy I'm not like some super expert or whatever but I just I'm a guy who knows things what he does is he goes to a grocery store if you go look at his Instagram he'll go to a grocery store be like Costco he'd be like the thumbnail is him holding up let's say parmesan cheese and he'll be like don't buy this see and he'll turn it around he'd be like see it has parmesan cheese milk that's fine but then it has artificial flavors we don't like artificial flavors because they're gonna be bad for blah blah blah instead buy this one and he'll have another one at Costco that's better he's like see this one doesn't have artificial flavors doesn't have this it does have this but it's the best one you can find at Costco so he's doing it right now on Instagram he's doing it for veggie straws which is like those potato chips that are like whatever they're supposedly made out of vegetables he goes this is bad for this reason here are some Le uh here here are some better ones for you lesser evil power curls ciete Puffs Jackson's sweet potato chips and you and he looks at the back of veggie straws and he tells you what's wrong with it right and I'm giving this to my kids right veggie straws oh that's better than chips veggies right and it's like so he's he just debunks a lot of things and he's got his whole thing he's very high energy he does mainstream products that are in shopping Cent uh in shopping stores and he'll be like um this one Bobby approved and he's like got his own little stick where he's like this is Bobby approved and he's like he's basically Doug deorro but for you know um packaged Goods instead of cars he has 2.5 million followers that post of the veggie straw ones that I just said has 25,000 likes exactly cuz it's super fortable because as soon as he says something and you know somebody who eats that you share it with them and then he becomes a trusted Source he's not selling you anything he's just telling you better and worse he's telling you what to avoid or he's like okay it's it's the holiday he's got one holiday booze Hall it's like these are the things to you know to buy and de buy when it comes to booze or farm salmon does farm salmon good or bad and he just uses the like thinker Emoji so you're like oh [ __ ] is there something I need to know about armed salmon is that not is that not healthy I thought that was um he's got another one ditch the Goldfish right so he's taking these popular products he's doing this so I think this is genius I think more people should literally just copy him um because there's room for more here and you could differentiate by being you know a mom who's going to be trusted by moms and do more mom products than than what he's doing or you could be a meat head who's doing more protein gym Jim bro type of content that's kind of what more place more dates is doing but I think this format is beautiful so let me just tell you about this opportunity okay so here here's how I'm thinking about this do you know Consumer Reports they test like every product ellipticals and you know uh coffee machines and whatever else do you know about the company itself Consumer Reports I do we brought them up I'm not gonna I'm not going to steal your steas here but it's wild it's wild well they're nonprofit do you know that you could give give me an accurate guess you don't have to give me the homie guess where you guess low just to make me feel good give me what you think the real guess is their revenue per year do you know 100 almost 300 million a year 289 that's insane it's crazy right and it's all subscription Revenue what's that it's all subscription Revenue too I think uh yeah I don't know the exact mix but it's it's a nonprofit so you can actually go find a bunch of their stuff um so and they have like 250 million of assets on their books which like nonprofits are are famous for like having you know High Revenue High expenses and then just like a a lot of assets on the books and so you have to you have to spend A1 UH 60 bucks a year in order to get access to their articles and it's old it's old as hell like you go there and literally like the website looks old you know like when you see videos of people from like the '90s or the 80s and it's just like the haircuts are old the fashion is old it's all old and like these people have 80s haircuts and I just realized when I saw this it's time for a new Consumer Reports JD Power does this for cars right JD Power what is it JD Power and Associates I don't know who these people are I don't know what they do 240 million a year in Revenue so I think there's an opportunity to create the new age Consumer Reports JD Power around supplements specifically and I would do it in the Tik Tok format so what flave city is doing I would do it that way and I would test every single product and I would test it in a scientific way that people can't so they claim that it has this many you know grams of protein per scoop let's find out Truth or Dare right I dare you to have the amount of protein you say and you do a little 15-second 30 second video that's kind of uh you know talking about each one of these products the beauty of short form video is for the Mr B said this to me and I and I kind of was like huh I never really thought about this before he goes for the first time ever short form video is the only content format that can be posted on every social network at the same time I was like what he's like yeah basically let's take uh you know Instagram is a single photo that's filtered cool you could post that on Instagram you could kind of post it on Facebook you might be able to post that on Twitter but it wasn't the native way of doing things and you know like but you can't post that on Snapchat the same way like you can't do that but with short form video you can literally get on Tik Tok YouTube uh Instagram Facebook Snapchat every single social network is compatible with short short fromont video which means short font video is now the dominant the dominant content format to be creating it and um I so I think if you do this you could go across all of them you can't monetize that the so typically the way there's basically two ways that you maybe there's three there's two main ways you monetize this so there's affiliate which is wirecutter.com I've got a I know a guy named Dennis who started bestreviews.com he sold it for $110 million to the worst named company on Earth it was called trunk which was uh it's basically the company I think that owns LA Times uh and he sold it for 110 million bucks after trun should definitely be like a women's jeans brand that's like trun all about your butt or something yeah trunk is a horrible name got junk in the trunk you know what I'm saying it's a really bad name it's one of those names that sounds like a noise uh and so they they sold the trunk I I think after four years and they monetized it the same way as wire cutter so it was through affiliate but wire cutter is one of the few I think NerdWallet does a good job where they do trust where some for some reason I still trust them even though I know they're getting paid per click right uh and then the other one which is harder to pull off but a way better business is um subscription and that's what Consumer Report does you know why wire cutter I think can has that trust even though they're clearly pushing you know they're clearly making money off the recommendations I think it's two things one it's like good design and copyrighting so it feels like a person is talking to you and it feels like it's like clean same with the Points Guy they're not saying who's the best what they're say what they do is they say best on a budget this is the one we recommend if if price is no no problem this is the best one period on the market and then kind of the most common popular option is this one so instead of it being here's our favorite and yeah it's the one we're getting the best kick back on they kind of give you options of like depending on your situation we think this is the best in that situation and I feel like for some reason that changes and then it's like yeah we we make money you know we get an affiliate on each one of these but like they're all equal we're not saying one is better than the other we're saying one is better in this situation so I think that and one of the reasons why I think they do that is I know the founders of NerdWallet and if I remember correctly so nerdwallet.com SLB best- credit-card so that's one page if I remember correctly that one so basically their whole business model was to make that page rank number one in Google if you search best credit card and for a long time that one page was making like 40 million of their like $45 million a year in sales and then they were like all right now we need to do best credit card for students best credit card for fixed income people best credit card for your firsttime credit card and they had to diversify because best nerdwallet.com bestest credit card was getting all of their sales it was that that and their whole company strategy was write articles that get linked back from like uh you know USA news.com or business inside or whatever get high quality links and then in those articles link back tobest credit card it it was a pretty wild strategy and it worked or it's working yeah you basically want to write articles that get linked so your overall domain Authority goes up but then you got one or two Money Maker pages and those are those are the pages that you need to be the number one search result for the way you do it is by creating all this Goodwill around the other Pages this sort of SEO Goodwill so I think you would think that short form video is hard to monetize but that's not what you're monetizing you're not monetizing the short for video You're monetizing the trust so today who is both the most trusted voice in science and supplements and the man most likely to be in Sam's fantasies yeah my husband Andrew hberman exactly and as a what do they call them my my hubman husbands or something like that um what did they say uh so I I posted a shirtless picture of him and he's like and I and I was like uh people were like what do they say they're I'm Huber I'm Huber's man uh yeah he he posted his first shirtless video the other day and uh men around the world were gasping clear the calendar honey yeah all right so huberman makes money through his ads and his podcast but remember when Rob deerdick was on the Pod and he was talking about momentus protein and he's like yeah momentus was kind of dead in the water we thought we had made the best cleanest protein but really wasn't going anywhere and then we did a deal with Andrew huberman and we were like how much did you pay him and he goes I don't know whatever it was it wasn't enough it wasn't enough and he was just like laughing at like how crazy that that was so you know I think the business model here is you build trust for a couple years and then you come out with your own branded supplement right you want to be in the supplements game you don't want to be that ruins your whole premise though of finding the most trusted no no no no you you are the most trusted you build the trust by say and then finally you say look I've had it with these companies I've had it with these I am just going to make the one that I wish existed the one that is truly clean that is going to hold the up utmost standard right Derek from more plates more dates that's exactly what he did uh somebody like Jessica Alo with Honest Company kind of did the same thing she built up a bunch of Fame and Trust in one area but then she comes out with the Honest Company and she's like this is going to be the honest brand the product I want to give to my kids which by the way I buy momentous protein in part because I trust Rob and Rob was involved and I buy bpn which is uh Nick bear you know the Jack guy who runs fast I was like these guys both seem trustworthy I'll buy their stuff so I spend all my money with them right because what else do you have to go on you have nothing else to go on this packaging or that packaging right like what else do you have to go on besides the words of somebody you trust and so I think that's the way you do this ultimately is you uh you ultimately build your own supplement franchise around this more like The Honest Company but I think first for a couple years you are just becoming the most viral trusted Source when it comes to the truth about X and you got to pick things that are going to be very sharable um as well as you know you know establish your Authority in that Niche to be able to I'm I'm the most knowledgeable trusted Source when it comes to what should I be taking by the way we've talked about the Eat This Not That category and we we loved it I think we talked about it a year and a half or two years ago we love to eat This Not That category it's the best I love that when did we say that because I remember talking about Flav City because that's his thing right Eat This Not That he was doing we I thought I mentioned it maybe a year ago uh but I really hadn't like fully wrapped my head around it so eat This Not That was a line of books um I remember buying it Barnes & Noble like I don't even know how to say how do you say I used to call them Barnes & Nobles uh I remember buying it at Barnes & Nobles uh years ago when I was like in fourth grade it was Eat This Not That and it would just show a picture of Doritos and then it would show an alternative and it would explain why it was a massive hit for a book series and I remember buying like all of them um and I think we said we're like fine for a book but this has to be beyond that and we talked about it I think with Steph two years ago yes yes so I think this is a a clear like content Niche that can turn into a pretty Monster business um and there's a bunch of different and there's a bunch of different angles depending on who you are Derek for more plates more dates obviously hits the Jim bro Market but then flave city hits the like Mom shop Costco Shopper market and you should just keep there's there's a lot more niches than that the New York Times did this article the other day or a few weeks ago and it was my Guru is better than your Guru and they talked about how people like you and I you know you you and I are team hberman but then there's this other group who's team Peter AA and then there's this other one who's team Peter like my father-in-law loves this guy named Mark uh mark kind ofan or something like that uh and it's like well my Guru said this and it's just crazy how we find these guys that we stick to and whatever they say we don't know like I can't tell you entirely what why herberman suggests X Y and Z but I know he suggested that and I will go to bat and fight other people who their gurus said X Y and Z and I don't even know why I just know that I trust Andrew that's my guy and I thought it was really interesting how it is turning into to be something like that have you ever heard this explanation of why gossip exists evolutionarily no it's sort of nerdy but it's it's kind of fascinating so everything has uh a value right like even like what we consider negative emotions like fear why does Fear have value well you know if you're hunter gatherer and there's a lion you know fear or paranoia can be a very useful survival tool and and you needed to be super fearful and paranoid at a certain period of time maybe less so today but we can see why that's evolutionarily baked in but that that applies to everything and so gossip is a good example gossip if you just talk to most people gossip negative thing right shouldn't do it bad you know poor form it's a it's sort of a lowly thing to do and actually gossip is extremely useful so you think about uh humans live in tribes and and we're in this Society well it's impossible for me to know one by one with each person about their character and their reputation myself through only firsthand experiences and so how does a tribe function well gossip is actually a necessary thing I should know that if this person's untrustworthy because rumors should spread so that the tribe as a whole becomes almost immune to this charlatan uh through gossip and I don't have to myself go and have a firsthand bad experience so in that way gossip has saved me from getting my you know my hand burned off on the stove many times and so I kind of feel like the the same thing exists where it's sort of silly in a way to uh you just trust these online influencers these gurus don't you know they're just trying to sell you something well yeah and there's there's some amount of that but at the same time what am I going to do go test all my supplements myself like the inefficiency that would be brought in if I didn't trust these people what am I going to go read all the white papers myself about clinical studies no I'm not going to do that I'm gonna we're all gonna Outsource that task to somebody and we're going to trust them until they burn our trust and then we're going to move on to the next one but like EV almost like as a tribe it is the if efficient way to do things even though it's kind of seen as this low IQ move it's actually not a low IQ move it is the like sort of like Game Theory optimal move to trust people or to trust gossip in certain situations where you're not going to want to do the firsthand work yourself look if George Forman tells me what Grill is best for my brw worst I listen to George he looks like he eats a lot of brator no I get it where uh did you just go and read a book on gossiping where did you get this I heard this a long time ago and uh you know my brain was just connecting the dots just now I I want to tell you about another Health company that's related to all this but before you do we have a quick segment it's called Thrill of the shill and so it's a time where we're Each G to take a turn your turn is is this time to promote whatever we want but it's the thrill to shill because you're G to shill something but you're going to Thrill me a little bit so about eight months ago you invested in a company called Shephard yeah you sent me a graph I get up updates every once in a while I try not to get too much information because I don't ever want to reveal something I'm not supposed to reveal but you sent me a graph things are going more than good I think I think it's you could say how many times it's multiplied but now is your 60c thrill the shill moment amazing oh the pressure is on to Thrill with this shill listen the way I'm going to make this thrilling is I'm going to share a little info all right share a little info not about the business and the internal numbers necessarily but about what's working so I can what I can say high level we uh the business was already doing great before we joined compan called Shephard and what they do is they basically make it easy to hire so I was using them to hire for my e-commerce company because I wanted to hire more people but I didn't have the budget so I was like all right Shephard has talent in the Philippines in latam so like we needed a Shopify developer all right I can either pay an a expensive agency or hire some guy but I found a guy for 2500 a month who's awesome and I did the same thing with customer support and I did the same thing with all a whole bunch of these roles and so I was using them and I was like this is a great business and I'm going to buy into it so I bought into it and since then the business have basically tripled so we've tripled the business in eight months and the business was already doing well to begin with so that was kind of like way exceeded expectations now what actually worked well when I joined I thought all right boys I'm coming in hot I got ideas I don't know if you've heard I got a business podcast I think I know a thing or two about business why don't you listen to my ideas and I had all these like exotic ways that I thought we could you know make things better in the reality was the the big lesson the big takeaway here was a lesson that I had heard early on in the podcast there was a guy who came on this podcast I don't remember his name but he made this he has this bag company Peak design forgot his his first name sorry but Peak design and I was like dude you sell like 80 million doar worth of this like camera bag what the hell man like what's your what was your growth hack what's your secret and he's like oh dude I used to listen to all these business gurus and they talk about this like Advanced planning and like you know like long long-term thinking and super strategic stuff he goes to me business is the six inches right in front of your face and I was like what and I was like this is also the speech From Any Given Sunday and he's like yes business is the six inches in front of your face and you just got to keep knocking out the six inches and so when we were talking about shephard I was like all right well you know cool ideas Sean but like what's the six inches right in front of our face and uh we basically did one thing one thing that really really worked uh and the one thing that really worked that was not expected for me was they just did a very simple analysis they go how do we get more of our best compers customers and less of our worst customers which is I think an exercise anybody should do like did you ever do this with either advertisers at the hustle or like or Hampton like did you ever def like bucket out like who are the best customers who are the worst customers because the worst customers take up 80% of your time basically what happens is you get in this habit of where you're just like I'll take any amount I'll take any customer and take any money whatever I'll just do whatever and then you get all these [ __ ] people and then you're like oh my God this sucks like this guy takes so much time and I don't even make that much money from them I have to learn who do I fire and who who's who who do I go after instead exactly and what most people do is they do it at the beginning which I think is the wrong move because at the beginning you don't really know and you do need to be just a little bit desperate and kind of Brute Force things but there's a point where you got to check in like you know if it nine months in you haven't checked in do this checkin which is basically draw a little piece of paper and write our top you know 10 to 20% of customers and our bottom 10 to 20% of customers bottom is like drag out your time lowest profit um you know like most headache most support required and then the top is the opposite and so we did this little exercise and the thing we realized was we thought the business was people hiring virtual assistants because that was the most common thing people would come in for right you come in you need a VA just to do some tasks or maybe it's a personal assistant for you or help with travel booking meeting scheduling that stuff and it does do that that's fine but then we were like yo who's this group of customers that they hire twice as much as everybody else and the like LTV the lifetime value of these customers is also like you know 40 50% higher so who was it and it was people who needed bookkeepers I was like what and they're like yeah bookkeepers and they're like you know the reason we didn't see it is because it's all concentrated in certain spikes so basically bookkeepers everybody hires them after tax season it's like you go through the pain of tax season and then you're like all right never again am I going to feel that um and so you're like companies will basically hire a bookkeeper like dude it was such a mess a Time suck this year we just need a b a bookkeeper and we're like a small business we don't need like a fancy bookkeeper let's hire an overseas book bookkeeper and so they they do that or accounting firms or anybody who is a tax tax company they need more bookkeepers or they're a bookkeeping firm they need more bookkeepers and so they would hire they would hire lots of the same talent that Talent is priced a little bit more so there's more profit on that hire and so anyways we just just by identifying one little thing but there was like three things like that that we did those were the like tweaks that weren't very sexy that made a big difference that's so kind of that's my little my my thrill of the shill today is to to remind you go do that little 8020 exercise on best and worst customers once you're like I don't know about right around a year into the business because it will refocus you in a good way you got to give the URL oh yeah so go to support shepard.com for whatever you need to hire for whether it's bookkeepers virtual assistants developers designers they got you know basically they go find the top 1% of talent in these countries they got boots on the ground there're like literally interviewing people and then you can go find the Elite Talent there for basically 80% less than if you hire people in the states all right that's the thrill of the show that's pretty good pretty good first thrill shill yeah I I was thrilled um all right so let's do another one so I got uh I got one thing for you so did you see Trung tweeted this out and I found this kind of interesting so he tweeted out about this Chinese quibby did you ever see this tweet no but is it working so uh yeah I think it is which is the funny part so is it Chinese as in in China or for Chinese American but Chinese content it's Chinese like Tik Tok is Chinese it's made by a Chinese company but it's at the top of the US charts it's a company called real short real short it's called real short um so basically here's what he says it's bite-sized English scripted video content so it's like quibby but instead of paying for Hollywood hitters it's cheesy degrad soap operas homark films the shows are all about Affairs scandals marital Intrigue and absurd plots for example son-in-law's Revenge I'm getting married without you or never divorce a secret billionaire ays let me just pause here I'm in on real short okay that was all I needed to hear I this is this smells like a winner to me all right so so I I like this General concept short video that's scripted versus just like people's you know Tik toks um but it's like junk food it's junk food content um it's it's like you know Mory poic Hallmark film like you know it's just stuff that like it's not highbrow it Just appeals to people people are gen you know people have to turn their head to to look at this stuff it's like Hallmark right so he goes a show is typically 50 episodes each episode's only 90 to 120 seconds each um they started off by adapting a bunch of Chinese romance like kind of soap operas for Western audiences um it's free to watch but you watch ads uh to unlock more episodes or you could pay coins to unlock them faster um Tech crunch estimates that this app has been downloaded 11 million times already across IOS and Android and generated over $22 million in Revenue since August 2022 so $22 million in year one not bad uh it's owned by this Chinese Company Co group and they're expanding Their audience because the shows were so kind of like addictive and like you know bad that they banned in China so where do you go America the Las Vegas of the world where anything goes and so they brought it here um pretty crazy and so so don't you what do you think of this concept I'm it's this is insane to me so the actors and actresses they're white people so is it white is it like are they appealing to as this is po Americans it's like everything else made in China made four Americans so who's who who's buying I mean so this is just boggling mind so you know Hallmark you know Hallmark like you know the cards and channel familiar so that that company still does about 5 billion in Revenue I think it's a familyowned business so it's still like a huge thing so the hmar is it the shops plus the TV or are they separate businesses it's uh so the whole company does five billion in sales um but I think a a significant amount of the revenue is not from cards I think it's from the the channel so it says worldwide Hallmark has 27,000 employees holy crap um so and Hallmark channel is like a big line of their business which I think they sold part of it to uh Liberty Media and so it it's like a huge Company still and I think it's it's family-owned based out of Missouri yeah yeah that's great uh okay so Hallmark's great so you're in it just tell me you're in so a few years ago I I've told this before my friend Ramon and I ran a test where we created this book called um captivating CLA I think that's what it was was it called captivating CLA and basically Ramone ran a soap opera website and he had this guy on his staff that loved to write short stories and they were erotic short stories and what we did was we created a WordPress blog a WordPress blog and I think we called it short but romantic. and basically over the weekend we he had wrote a story on a Friday on on Friday night the WordPress blog was made and at the very bottom of the WordPress blog it was basically just one page of a blog post and it said uh we hope you enjoyed this first iteration of of captivating CLA from short but for short but romantic if you want to see part two here's a PayPal link it's $10 a month sign up and we will mail you the part two of the story next week when it comes out and we used Fiverr and we got a narrator to do it this whole project took $400 we drove tra traffic for it the next day on Saturday we had like $300 in sales um and we were like holy crap and if you look up the blog you might have to use web archive to do it uh but because I think we took it down or the domain expired I remember reading it if you look at the blog and you go to the comment section you'll see these people were obsessed with this they were like oh my God Claire did this I can't wait to read part two and it was mindboggling and then we were on Sunday we were like we don't really want to be in this business business like this doesn't really fit our interest uh I think he should still should have done it well he he was going to he he Ramon was going to do this business we we both invested in him he was about to do this business and then one of his other businesses kind of took off so that that be yeah dog ramps took off but he was like really dead set on this and I was like I don't know it seems like it could be pretty great and this real short is proof that that that that that idea I think was on to something it's it's I was amazed at young women what they wanted to buy me and you were undoubtedly you know uh we're trying hard with this channel we go every every week we work on this channel we have a we have YouTube and it's growing we're doing we're doing great small and mighty we've been climbing up the charts and in about a year we got to about 350,000 subscribers and when we really knock it out of the park with a great episode we might get few hundred thousand views well just go look at real short on YouTube so somebody started uploading the real short episodes but like the like episodes 1 through 20 together so real short romance um 330,000 subscribers they posted a video uh like two months ago and it has uh you know it's it's the double life of my billionaire husband 3.7 million views go look at the comments it's exactly what you're talking about Christine Joy says I hope there will be more video from these two the chemistry they have hard Emoji prer Emoji dude and they're not even optimized they have a real short uh watermark on them and it's vertical video yeah exactly and then another person you know Jolan Bongo 96996 says oh I watched this on Facebook reals I got hooked by it I love the story and the cast good job guys I can't wait for the next episodes and there are thousands of comments uh in this comment thread that are all about I can't wait for the next episodes I love the storyline this is better than Hollywood oh my God I'm hooked this is working um and this is you know what is my take here so my take is number one interesting business that I never heard of good job trunk I I never heard about this so I'm glad he put this on my radar second thing the difference between a good idea and a bad IDE idea is just a few small decisions quibby gets made fun of as a classic Silicon Valley idiotic startup it's like oh man remember quibby it's like a it's like the butt of a joke in Silicon Valley uh yeah this will be as successful as quibby quby I think was the right idea small micro content like you know TV shows shrank down I think can be really successful the problem was they raised two billion dollar and spent it all on like really high production quality stuff that wasn't that juicy and never got people hooked um whereas real short is basically like starting with getting people hooked and then figuring out you know the rest as it goes the third thing is the third takeaway is why do I have so much faith in the Chinese like when I even started to read his tweet I was like oh a Chinese Company's trying to do quibby but better and I was like probably gonna work I would bet more on this random Chinese company that I've never heard of than Jeffrey kenberg the guy who created quibby that was like the creator of DreamWorks and why is that I don't know maybe it's because through my Ecom brand I like do business with you know Chinese companies and the way they run their businesses I mean like that's my real MBA is when I talk to like the factory owner in China about how he's running his business and I watch how he moves and he came out here to meet us and we're talking to him and you know just that the way they conduct themselves is awesome the way they work is awesome the like level of complexity they can like handle is awesome and it used to just be with manufacturing only and then Tik Tok came and was a total narrative violation it was like oh you think they could just you know make cheap plastic toys no no no watch this we'll make the hit social app that's all about cool and culture we'll appeal to the US team better than an American startup could amazing to me it's a lack of ego is what it is so uh quibby was this cool La company I think they even reached out to you and I they're like you guys want to make content for this show bued yeah I was like I I I I don't know but but not that we're quote cool guys but we we are based in San Francisco and we lived a on paper what seemed like an interesting life like people building startups whereas let's say it if you were gonna spend money on us to start your platform your platform is gonna [ __ ] fail all right obviously we we should not be part of your platform but they went after like cool people like you know I imagine they had like high like big- time celebrities and [ __ ] like that whereas I think a lot of people in Silicon Valley and La I think they do the same thing you know if you look at a lot of the DDC Brands it's like they spend most of their money on [ __ ] branding some agency that was overpriced with lowercase letters based out of Brooklyn and in reality like this whole Middle America I think particularly since a lot of entrepreneurs in the tech Bas are young men they forget that there's this whole contingency of 150 million people who are at home and they just want to goof around and watch something like this and their ego prevents them from creating something that's quote low quality which exactly this fits that bill you would see this and you're like this is stupid no one will watch this whereas someone else who just like yeah dude I just want to win I just want to do whatever it says I'm going to follow the numbers and I think a lot of people would be embarrassed to create this thing and I don't think they should be but I think they feel that way whereas whoever we're talking about these Chinese folks they're just like yeah but we're just setting out to build a great company right Supply demand what is their demand for we can be Supply versus uh you know we hired you know if your company has 20% of people that wear non-prescription glasses like it's you're not going to make it in this game because you just have too much uh you know sort of like hipster in you that's not actually going to focus on what the market wants you're going to try to sell them what they should want rather than what they actually do want someone tagged Us in this picture of a Thai restaurant and it was called Thai near me Tha food near me yeah Thai Thai food near me where it was clearly someone was just naming the restaurant uh you know triaa locksmith in order to rank high on Yelp yeah and that's that immigrant hustle that I appreciate and I respect and they actually made their branding cute it was like a it a cute sign and it was clearly a joke uh but that is lacking I think in a lot of our circles and this app real short they don't have near me yeah it's tyon near me they they've got they're just a they own a store and they're like oh looks like people buy a lot of Vapes looks like we're in The Vape business you know what I mean and I appreciate that like man these kids love this grap flavored smoke right we're going to start selling more of that uh even though I don't always agree with it I appreciate the mentality so you weren't there for this one but I did an episode with Jess Ma I don't know if you heard it heard it yet yeah I started watching this morning I love Jess ma do you know her besides like the episode like had you met her because she's friends well so Jess ma was um I I was gonna ask you all about her but Jess Ma I know her as like she was The Prodigy so she was like on the cover of magazines at the age of 19 or 20 for starting indero and accounting soft she was like the the person on the cover of Inc before right the month before me was Elizabeth Holmes yeah so she was like the IT person for a minute but then over the last like six years she's went silent which in my head that either means you've done something bad or you're just quietly killing it and you just don't want to talk about it and it sounds like the second one was definitely the answer and Indo has been crushing it and she's been taking the profits or money from that and doing more things is that right yeah pretty much exactly so she was like all right IND is a good business it's not going to be a monster business she had like a crazy life experience where her boyfriend died suddenly and then she was like just kind of depressed didn't want to even go into work and was just like all right what do I want to do with my life like you know reminder life is short nothing is guaranteed but she didn't say how big indero was though did she It's Over N it's nine figures and it's profitable is what she had said um so it's over 100 million in revenue and profitable so she was like all right I don't want to run this company anymore I'm hiring somebody to run that and I'm going to do whatever's most interesting to me and so her bets were kind of like she wanted to like she's like well you know like what am I like what if I wasn't afraid of failure what would I go do so she had a couple things in the episode I think are going to get lost in there but the big thing that I took away that I went like basically after every episode I send a voice memo to Ben about like here's the three things that like really like that that are my notes from this episode dude I I I keep my notebook right here but basically the thing I wrote I was like she had like three or four golden questions one of them was what would I do if I wasn't afraid to fail um the other one was uh what was the other one wasn't it like what would I do if I was a billionaire yeah if I had you know if I had $500 million in the bank what would I do with my time um and she had another one which was How Will I deal with being an absolute beginner because if I'm going to go do something new by definition I'm going to be a beginner and suck at it and I know I'm scared of that feeling and I know that feeling is uncomfortable especially now that I have a little bit of an ego I've been on the cover of magazines people think highly of me how will I how will I deal with being at the bottom again and just asking that sort of acknowledges that and then it kind of takes the power away from like that insecurity so I thought she had some like golden questions and one of them was like she's like yeah like I was I was like dude you're building these like biot tech companies you're telling me about these technology that I can barely even understand do you even understand these like is this your background are you just a science genius and she was like no like I was a c student in biology like you know and now I have a biology company that's valued over $100 million doll like there's some irony there and I was like you know so what is it are you just like fing it until you make it or did you like get really good really fast she's like well no like I partnered with people who are experts and I do the stuff that they're not experts at like commercializing it she's like but also I just started as a beginner she's like I literally hired a biology tutor and I started watching podcast and TED talks and I would go meet the people and I would ask them like a thousand questions and I would go do research after they answer those and I would ask them 10 more questions after that I would just keep doing that until like I felt like I had a handle on things it's amazing and I was like oh well it's simple when you say it like that and so similarly um I don't know about you but every day I go on Twitter and I see AI magic in my feed and AI is the best magic trick like awesome cool demo product that I've ever seen in my life is just like an endless supply of awesome cool 10-second demos I don't know if those will all become big companies but they're amazing demos and you did a tutor thing and so I did a tutor thing I was like oh yeah I should just hire somebody who because I'm was like either I'm gonna drop everything that I'm doing and like go learn about AI from as a beginner or I'm just going to sit this one out because I don't know it's just this fast moving thing that the kids are doing and I I guess I'll just kind of catch up later that doesn't feel right either so I was like why don't I do this I was like I put out a tweet that was like well if you're somebody who plays around with all these tools knows how to use them I will pay you $500 an hour I'll pay you whatever 500 plus an hour to just sit with me a couple times a week and just show me just teach me about these tools to save me the kind of like 10 hours of fumbling around I would be doing myself how many emails did you get I got like over a hundred replies from like interest like really interesting people so it's gonna be hard to kind of pick I might pick a couple people actually instead of just one because there's so many good ones and I might publish this so I'm thinking about creating a side Channel that's just like Sean's playground my little YouTube channel while I'll actually just publish the call so that even if somebody's not paying $500 an hour for this they can just get the benefit from it um because I I don't need to hold this close to my vest or anything um but I think this is great and I want to give myself a little pat on the back but I really want to say it out loud because there's probably a lot of things like this like I know you're taking a finance course right now and that's like the same version that's like the same thing like like don't be afraid to go be a beginner you're supposed to be S par business podcast sold a business you know you're supposed to be the guy who knows a bunch of stuff and you you came out and you're like I feel like an idiot when it comes to finance like Corporate Finance I just really don't know what the hell I'm doing what's the best course in this place in this thing I could take and you're I think you spent like five grand on a course right how's that going yeah it's called um the 4day MBA with Keith Cunningham um and yeah I'm trying to learn how to do all this stuff it coincidentally someone did a video some billionaire guy did a video and he's like don't get an NBA just go take this course I know huge endorsement I like I saw it when you said it I went to the website website sucks and I was like this sucks why did Sam do this and then I heard that clip and I was like okay that's now two people that said this is awesome I will now go do this thing it's a great course it's a great course and I think I think my opinion how do I say this without sounding like a chge douche once I got a little bit of success I got way less nervous about hiring people to teach me how to do things um additionally I mean we talked about a ton my body Tutors or and hiring a Fitness coach hiring coaches and things like that kind of changed my perspective of of the whole quote coaching industry which I used to think was [ __ ] no like teaching having people teach me how to do stuff has kind of changed my life a little bit um and this course is awesome I have nothing to do with it I posted that link and people thought that I like I was like no I I just think it's cool um it it's changed my life uh to be honest like going back to school and like learning and having people just teach me things I think it's going to be really smart for you to do it this way I also think that if you promote it it will uh pay for itself so that's always fun um but I think you're gonna have a life changing next two months if you follow through with this yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm already you know the the ROI is is is baked in in into this because because of it but I guess like I want to say it because I wouldn't have thought to do this unless just m she said she just said that thing in passing like I hired a biology tutor and I in my mind I was like tutors are something that end when you're 20 years old there is no more tutoring after that and it's like why why is that the case hold on there's no rule about that um and there's probably other people out there who kind of could do something similar so anyways I said it out loud mostly because if you're the one% of people that hadn't really thought about this but could benefit from it like do it do you know really what I want to do is what I wanted to do was I wanted to take a like one of those two-e MBA courses at Columbia or Stanford or something like that that was that's my goal for next year to do it and I went and I looked at like the list of topics that they're going to cover and I was like I don't I don't even know what those topics mean so I got to go take this online one just to prepare for this in-person one because I was so embarrassed to to like see this and I used to make fun of these people that would put like Stanford uh you know like twoe course one warning though so I took a a similar like a finance thing last year I think and it was good there's nothing like it was a good course there's nothing wrong with the course what you did it in person uh no it's an online online thing but I intended it and I paid attention like I was like if I'm doing this I'm going to do it where did you do it at what's cool it was on maven so it was a maven uh Finance course and so it was a really good course there was one thing that I'll say out loud which is before you go drop thousands of dollars because oh s par said this course is great make sure that like to me the way the analogy is like these are all clothes on a hanger but you need a hook to hang things on and like if you don't have a hook the hook would be like a business you're currently running or like a a place you can go apply these learnings then I think they can be kind of like fancy procrastination or just like not worth the the time of the money so you have to have enough either Battle Scars or like a place to go apply these that's actually going to be like relevant for you otherwise it's very easy to just like intellectually sit there and be like yeah cool all right well I hope I keep that in mind one day when this becomes relevant like you're better off like building the business and then learning the things just in time that you need to know when you need to like when you need to know them versus trying to learn everything in advance and then be like now I'm prepared to go do the supportive business well the reason I'm doing it is because when I was selling the hustle we like this whole thing came at the end called networking capital and I I was like I just don't know what this means and I optimized my business in one way but then I I didn't know what this term was and I there was many things that I could have done differently that would have helped and like I felt so emasculated and stupid when these people were talking to me about networking capital and I'm like I just can't figure this out when you're explaining it to me I don't want to experience that pain again and also I'm getting my balance sheet and my income statement and cash flow statements every month from my accountant but I'm like I I don't know if this is good you're just you accountants typically tell you facts and I'm like but I don't know how to interpret it I need to know how to interpret this to spot strengths and weaknesses and I just remember when I was selling my company of not I'm like well I know I kind of know how to make the money but I don't know what I don't know how to optimize any of these equations and I don't know what they mean and I felt so stupid during that um it was just so challenging to figure out can I tell you one lesson I learned from that thing that was probably one thing I remember that I didn't know going in um I just never even thought about which was the course I think is called good business bad business or something like that and um one of the things it's talking about when you differentiate between a good and bad business financially is your reinvestment Runway so I don't know if you've ever heard this term or thought about this but it's essentially the idea that every business let's say you know $100 comes in and you get $20 out out of the bottom line right you have $20 net profit what do you do with that net profit so idiots like us you I think you probably ran your business same way I did I don't know it just sits in the bank account I don't even think about it really like uh it's there I I hope one day to take this out or maybe I'll I'll I'll use it to spend if we need if we have some expense or rainy day I don't know I just think I won't even think about it and then you uh start to realize that okay the best business is they can either reinvest into the business itself so that like when a dollar profit comes out you can reinvest it back to the top and get more than another dollar out and so he broke down like some of Warren Buffett's businesses that had no reinvestment potential so like basically profit comes out and that's why Buffett would take it to the headquarters the hold Co and just say you the the best optimization he could do was when he bought a business he's like you're reinvesting Capital poorly I'll take that money I'll reinvest it in a whole different business and you will be a little cash cow but I'm not going to keep investing back for more organic growth into this business which in our case would be like would be like um maybe like a course business or maybe even this podcast like this podcast like grows like mostly organically we don't need to spend more money in order to grow correct spending more money is not going to create more money out of this business the best thing we can do is take the profits from this bad business and invest it in a better business that actually can do that um and so you know that that was and what he talks about is like every business over time like you start out being able to reinvest but you had a certain point where a certain dollar threshold where now you can't reinvest more than that into this business at an efficient rate so have to identify that point and know that and then you could judge the business based on that so similarly um you know the best business like constellation software or Burkshire they're famous for basically taking profits from one one bad business you know bad defined as like it's a normal cash C business but you're not investing it back in that one you're investing it to buy another one of those and you invest that to buy another one of those and that that's the whole point of this book good profit or profit first um Andrew recommended I read it this weekend he recommended the same thing was take money out of the business at least and put it into a different bank account and then redeploy it into the your fast growing business if it if it warrants it or if you have a business that can take the reinvestment then you know that that business is actually even better than you than it looks on paper because it has this extra capability that most businesses don't have which is what cold punches all of pretty beginner for like anybody in like private Equity or whatever that's not where we came from right like we're basically like dorks on the internet who then started creating internet companies who then like tried to get rich off internet companies and now you know like we're starting to wrap our heads around like a lot of the like you know one 101 type of concept which by the way I think it's better to go that route I think it's harder to start things from scratch and then learn how to optimize eventually versus you optimize you're a good Optimizer but you don't know how to start things from scratch like just creating the widget that someone wants I think is more challenging 100 per. plus it makes me feel good that that's true but like YC did the same thing he's like it's going to be easier for me to take badass engineers and teach them the basics of fundraising and hiring and firing than to take an NBA who knows everything about fundraising hiring firing but can't build [ __ ] and that was like the core bet of YC was we don't need to start these companies with NBAs we could start these companies with Engineers because we could it's easy to teach them that it's impossible to teach the other way yeah I I and I completely agree with that and yeah it makes me feel better that way so therefore it is true in summary we're the best yeah we bragged a lot in this episode maybe we'll have another episode where we'll just make fun of each other um no the comments will do that for us here let me move the microphone so you get a good look uh here's my face here's my hair here's my body you can hear my voice I I I stutter sometimes what what whatever you got go ahead hit us in the comments um all right that's a [Music] pod

we issued a million doll bet to anyone on Wall Street and we were like we'll take Bitcoin you take any other asset like just pick anything over the next 10 years if you beat us you get a million bucks if Bitcoin outperforms we get a million bucks and no one took it Bitcoin had gone from 1,000 to 20,000 in 2017 it crashed down to like 3,200 bucks and I went on National Television I was like basically you guys are idiots this thing is going to come flying back we're buying also they could have perfectly hedged that if they just bought Bitcoin in addition to making the BET right so like yeah I like to think we issued the BET before the smart people started paying attention or somebody would have figured out how to definitely beat us on it were you inspired by the Warren Buffett million dooll S&P 500 bet of course like Warren Buffett was the original Finance influencer I've joked a million times that if he was today Buffett in his 30s he'd have a substack a Twitter account a podcast he'd be streaming on Tik Tok like doing all this stuff he understood how to leverage the tools he had at the time with the media he didn't need to do it but a way to really continue to drive like the lore of Warren Buffett is like issue the BET and say no hedge fund manager can beat the S&P over like a decade

one of the best investors over the last 50 years is Bill Miller he was the only investor to outperform the S&P 500 for 10 years straight in the '90s Amazon was one of his big bets and so Amazon crashes 90% in theom Crash bill just backs up the truck and buys more and I think at one point he was the single largest outside shareholder of Amazon and owned like 15% and so you look at that one you have to like find Amazon two then you have to like not get scared when it drops 80 90% And then three is even if you're not scared you then have to hold your nose and put way more money in to buy all of this extra Equity that is a common theme it's just like conviction and the ability to just bet over and over again regardless of what's Happening

all right this is going to be a special episode I think that the best episodes we do are the ones where we highlight a business or a person who is amazing that you've never heard of and that's what today's episode is the person that we have on Jess ma she has built herself uh I don't know 10 companies that have combined you know they're worth $950 million she um and not only that just has she made a bunch of money or been successful with business but she's just a force of nature uh people that I respect think she's one of the best entrepreneurs in the world and that's kind of amazing for somebody who you don't know her name you've never really seen her do interviews uh you know Paul Graham when when he met her and she was at YC put her on the very short list of a couple people with Sam Alman and a few others as the most impressive people the people that he thought 30 years from now will have done done the most and gone the furthest uh I was at a dinner that's how I met her and a friend of mine pointed out he goes that woman over there is the best entrepreneur I've ever met and he's lived in Silicon Valley for 15 years and to say that that's High Praise uh so I had to have her on the podcast to talk about everything from her beginning where she was basically a loser amongst loser losers in school she talks about like you know Not only was she not cool even in the computer Club she got bullied and didn't really fit into school didn't get good grades really like was just kind of like School wasn't for her she ended up dropping out a high school because school wasn't for her she but she started a business and it started off as a very and you know when she was a teenager she ended up making hundreds of thousands of dollars on this little server business that she was creating just paying for her own video games we talk about that all the way to where she is today building these biotech companies that are doing crazy stuff uh and I asked her I was like were you like a science genius like how did you know to go with this how did you have the confidence to go into a space like that like I think we all I think there's a part of all of us that wants to go do the big bold crazy change the world thing but we're afraid like who am I to go do that at least that's a thought had and uh it was kind of amazing to hear her talk about she felt the same way like she's like I got a C minus in biology and now I have like a nine figure you know hundred million do plus bio company like that's crazy to do that and and how she approached that how did she meet these scientists how did she get the funding how did she actually talk herself into doing that from Rock Bottom where she was completely depressed and didn't know what she wanted her to do with her life to now you know living the kind of life she wants the other thing that's in this episode that I think you're going to like is she talks a lot about the lifestyle and financial stuff that come from people who are already really successful so she know like I'm gonna give you a trigger warning now uh she talks about like you know yeah I just like I hop on my jet like you know and I bought this jet I bought it for this reason here's the tax write off that I got she's very open and very um clear about this stuff and and I think for some people who are at the very beginning it's going to feel unrelatable or it's going to feel like oh yeah you know the the classic YouTube comment guy who's like easy for you to say you're already rich but I think the important thing to figure out is she successful because she always thinks this way she she talks about her mindset and that's why she was able to do this and also I love when people talk about money stuff I love when they're open and honest I hate the billionaire who downplays it and pretends like you know they're flying coach and oh you know money's no big deal and I oh you know I don't I don't really do anything with my taxes no I like to hear what people actually do how they use money to improve their life how they architect their businesses she does that she's very open about it so that's all in this episode I think you're going to enjoy it uh this is an episode with Jessica [Music] M all right it's good to see you good to see you again um I want to tell people the story of how we met which is not like this extravagant story but it is one that um I don't know it's like it's this thing that happens that is like I would have bet any anything that you're an interesting person just on the way that this meeting went so we got a dinner together so that's like signal one uh you know a a friend hosts a dinner and it's like only friends inviting friends to this thing that's going to be like a you know some sort of founder investor type of dinner so already you got filter number one filter number two is I'm sitting at one end of the table you're sitting at the far end of the of the table but our mutual friend sea tells me he's like uh I was like oh what's her name and he's like oh yeah that's Jess ma he says uh and he's like yes she is is um the most impressive entrepreneur I've ever met and I was like okay I didn't even ask and he just says that and he's he G basically gives you this extreme compliment and I was like that's extreme and he's like yeah she's extreme and I was like okay I got to know more so already I got a signal next thing I noticed that you had your dog in the restaurant and I was like okay that's awesome love dogs dogs here and later I was like is this like a service animal because this is kind of like a nice restaurant you were like yeah uh Amazon you could buy this for $10 this vest and like look and you flashed me like an FBI badge that was like a um service dog thing and I was like did you buy that and you're like yeah this is great and I was like wow this person is just you know so there's all little signal somebody who Rolls by their own little rules my friend telling me that you're you know one of the most baddass people that he's ever met literally in the game of Entrepreneurship and uh and then when you did your intro you said something you go so uh yeah I'm working on like I started this thing in daero which I've heard of and you were like you know it started that and now i' I sit on the board like you know whatever 10 companies and uh we do like bold science bets and you didn't even explain it and I was like okay well you have my interest what's a bold science bet you're like you know like curing cancer but not like the typical way like this other path to curing canc you like you like kind of nonchalantly gave me some answer as to what a bold science bet would be and was like okay say no more I need to meet this person I need to get to know this person and I've gotten to know you a little bit now and uh yeah you are just that impressive so this is my buildup um that is my perception and tell me what that feels like to hear because that's people never tell you their actual perception first impressions as they remember it uh you know in their own head that's amazing it was super fun to have that dinner and meet you that night I just had a good feeling that we were going to have a fun time and normally I don't go out I'm kind of like a loner like to be at home and you know just take it easy after work and uh you know it's a lot to deal with with 10 companies we're g to add more companies this next year and trying to figure out like where do I want to spend my time as an entrepreneur and that's an ongoing question I'm sure we'll talk about that but I've heard about you um you know i' I've seen your podcast and you're famous so it's kind of an honor to get to be friends with you too so our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better well the other thing that's cool is you have a hold Co and like you know if I was going to say what are some of the themes of like almost like entrepreneurship trends like there's fashion trends but now there's entrepreneurship Trends one of the entrepreneurship Trends is this hold personal hold co- model but most people are doing with the personal H call I would say is kind of like small boy stuff it's like we acquire this little SAS app or like you know I'm GNA I'm gonna buy this this Plumbing business and I'm doing this hold code to roll these up um and you kind of have a hold code but you also have the big Venture change the world kind of thing inside of it which I find really fascinating so you're like yes I'm doing a hold Co but the hold Co is going to be all sort of Game Changers type of like go big or go home type of bets I find that really interesting I also think that another entrepreneurship trend is doing hard stuff so I think Elon really popular you know popularized like yeah you can create the next kind of app and that's cute but I'm gonna make rockets and electric cars and then you know then you have ai and Sam Alman and that's like you know the kind of Cutting Edge science do hard stuff movement and I think you're a part of that too and so I really like that you're here because you represent you know some intersection of these Trends and there's very few people that really play that game and and uh that's what I wanted to to learn from you today is is why do you play that game and how do you do it but let's give people like I guess the quick background um of you so can you give me kind of like your how do you introduce yourself when you're trying to brag a little bit um about you know why anybody should pay attention to what you have to say I'll I'll be honest I'm really shy and it's hard for me to talk about these things because everyone I meet is so impressed so no matter matter what I feel like the dumbest person in the room and the least successful person in the room and um and so that's really hard for me to talk about still but um just to catch everyone up I'm an entrepreneur I've started so many companies now my first company was called indera and inder is a financial SAS company we do accounting tax billp management software and services for businesses and our customers were companies like slack right Pinterest door Dash instart coinbase and I started that straight after college I studied computer science at UC Berkeley and when I was a senior at Berkeley I was running in the computer science club and uh I brought in these speakers and uh one of the speakers I brought in was this kid named Sam Altman he was building a company called looped and I'm like hey Sam what should I do after college and he said oh you should do IC and you helped review my application and uh and then the rest is history so I did that for 10 years screw that to a few hundred people um valuation and the hundreds of millions of dollars but the way I built that business was I didn't raise uh traditional Venture funding so I didn't bring in VC capital I only brought in some Angel Investors I was able to retain most of uh the ownership in the company and uh and it's a cash flowing you know profitable business to this day so that was kind of my first uh forr in a business and uh lots of ups and downs and like you know being weeks away from insolvency multiple times over and I think it's because we were under capitalized and I always ran things a little too close to the edge there and um and I was pretty public about that I mean if you Google search me you'll see that I've survived a bunch of near-death experiences with that business and eventually I I realized I didn't want to be a CEO anymore I grew up with this mindset of you have to be the operator and if you're not the CEO and make a company a unicorn you are a failure and I just didn't that didn't land well with me I I Google searched you know the world's billionaires and I'm like how do these people become billionaires and most of them built companies a lot of them were Diversified holding companies and they held on to these companies for decades and a lot of them they weren't the CEO or the operator they were more like investment manager and um I mean Warren Buffett's a great example love this um but there are many many more like that and so that kind of got me thinking H am I doing this wrong am I just listening to Silicon Valley rhetoric that's pointing me in the wrong direction and um and then a few years ago I went through a really tough experience where U my boyfriend who I I was living with uh died very unexpectedly and I was going through really dark period after that where I was not able to work I just couldn't I woke up in the morning and I be super depressed and I didn't want to do anything and I thought what would I do if if um I was going to die this year if this was my last year here because I'm so depressed and I have to make myself happy what would I do and running a company was not on the list so I immediately hired a CEO for Nero I had another company that I had started that I brought in a friend to run it's a litigation fintech company and um that company originates and funds lawsuits so you know like the personal injury uh Billboards you see on the side of the road we do that in a very sophisticated way um a lot of details I I really would wish I could talk more about but uh you know I don't want to invite competition there and then I've started a bunch of other interesting businesses like that which also if you go look at my website mwe.com I don't go into much detail actually I don't mention any of the detail on these businesses for the same reason um I'd rather build quietly and come up with these really interesting ideas find someone to go build those businesses and a good chunk of them are businesses that would just print cash but a lot of them are more bold and that's why I got interested in the biotech stuff I just thought what would I do if I wasn't scared of failure and after my boyfriend died I thought a lot more about that I thought like I shouldn't be scared of trying and failing because I've seen Rock Bottom I can't my life can't get any worse than it is today so I might as well try something you know and uh that's that's where I landed with that that's an amazing story and uh that question of like what would I do if I wasn't afraid of failing is like up there in the pantheon of great questions I asked myself that same question and it change I wouldn't be doing this podcast if it wasn't because I had three paths that I had written out I remember I made a figma file and I was like drawing like a flowchart of my life and I was like I could start a company and maybe it'll be this maybe it'll be this and that was like you said the Silicon Valley rhetoric because what gets written about is the Visionary CEO founder who creates the next big thing and that's the movies are about social network and uh you know the the tech crunch articles are about that the VCS want you to be that because they're like yeah it's sweet I get to write a check and chill and like you go do the like you go win the lottery and do all the hard work at the same time like do the low odds hardest thing you can do you know over there so I was like I could go start a company I could invest and just kind of like be on the other side of that that's I don't know if that would be the most fun thing that I would do and then I was like and I literally wrote or I could be Tim Ferris and I was like I think I want to be Tim Ferris I was like well why don't I just do that I've been thinking about this for like seven years in the back of my mind and I was like well because what if I'm not what if it doesn't work then I'm just a guy with a podcast it's cool to be Tim Ferris it's not cool to be the guy with a podcast like a podcast just normal podcaster with 100 views or listens per episode or something and I was like all right so am I just gonna not do it because I'm afraid that I might fail at it like what's the worst I could have and I kind of had this whole talk with myself you know the most important talks are not with mentors is the talks with yourself and it sounds like you had one of those too where you were like what would I do if I if I wasn't afraid to fail can you just talk a little bit more about that talk with yourself because I think everybody should have that some version of that talk with themselves yeah I I think just to expand on that a big question I asked myself was also um How Will I deal with the insecurity of feeling like a beginner and terrible at something despite the fact that for the past 10 years I got pretty good at being a CEO and running a business I'm sure you felt the same way right where you're a great entrepreneur and then now you're getting into you know building content and interviewing great folks and that's the new skill set that you had to become good at but for a while it's awkward and like the I'm sure your first videos were not nearly as good as the ones that you posted over the past few months right and so that's a lot of the self talk it's like oh my God I didn't do a good job I still don't know what I'm doing people don't take me seriously do I even take myself seriously and meditating on that and thinking you know what it doesn't matter because I'm having a great time I'm learning a lot and the outcome will work itself out that's how I deal with it but how about for you like what's what are your other best practices yeah so being a beginner uh and being okay like that mental prep for yourself of I'm going to be a beginner at this I think is also a very important part of that conversation I'm glad you said that because it's one thing to just say um what would I do if I wasn't afraid but then like the fear is still going to be there it's not just going to disappear when you ask that question and the fear is what the fear of being wrong being failing looking dumb all those things and so that beginner conversation is important which is cool if I go into this I'm going to start as a complete beginner I'm going to get better at over time because I'm good at learning and I'll try and um you know if I don't need to become the world expert at this but I need to become competent at this and that might take me six months to a year that's like a reasonable expectation if I really put my mind to this um it reminds me of this story I've told on the Pod before of Moy Ali who created native deodorant and deodorant's not curing cancer or whatever but it is uh you know still it's a totally different space and so when he told his friends he's like I think I'm going to create a deodorant brand and they were like cool uh random you know do you do you even wear deodorant like do you know anything about deodorant and he's like today I know nothing about deodorant but in six months I'll know everything I need to know about deodorant and that idea of like writing yourself a blank check I think is really important to uh to starting anything and you told me this when I was like dude you're like working on crazy science stuff I like that idea and I wish I could do that but it feels above my intellectual pay grade uh H are you just a science genius and you were like no I got like you were like I got like a c in biology in school and then like you know you're like I hired a tutor to like as an adult to like learn about this and I watched TED talks and podcasts and and then I flew out and I met the scientists and talked to them you just did all of the like normal blocking and tackling I feel with like just like uh is that how you would describe it like that that was totally different for me I just put you on a pedestal I was like oh maybe she's doing it because she's just smarter than all of us and that's why she can do this and nobody else can no I still have major insecurities about about this in fact last night I dreamt again this is a recurring nightmare where I am getting seas in school and I am very close to flunking and having to repeat a grade and I got seized in by and also in biology when I was high school so I thought I could do a lot of things with my life but anything related to biology is not one of those things and then when I was um so I was on the cover of ink magazine um a bunch of years ago and uh there was a woman who who was on the cover a month before me her name's Elizabeth Holmes and you know obviously we all know what happened and so when she got uh you know when thos went under and the whole thing happened I thought Wow bio really hard and I would be so paranoid and scared of doing anything in biote because I don't want to go to prison now obviously you know there's more to the story there and I don't think I'm going to go to prison but like the thought crossed my mind like should I even risk my life and my career if everything's okay like why do something hard and where the last woman who tried to do something here you know got you know totally destroyed by the media and is now prison like that's not a really good inspiration for me to be try to be the next Elizabeth Holmes but he didn't [ __ ] up as bad you know that's so that went through my head and I had to overcome that and then eventually I decided you know what [ __ ] it I want to give it a try I'm want to you know just learn and so I hired a biology tutor I like d digested all the information and I brought in people who've been running biotech companies and who had been part of uh big bio so that's that's really how I operate it's just bringing other people smarter than I am another question I would want to ask you and it's something I asked a lot of my best friends is what would you do if you were a billionaire um and if you had like a billion in hard cash in the bank account and uh you were not allowed to do what you're doing today how would you devote your life and it's so fascinating to hear the answer answers that that I I get from my friends and I'd say occasionally it's I I'm doing what I'm doing today I would just keep on doing that I I hear that from my more successful friends but from people who hadn't made it per se it's very thought provoking that is a great question I can tell a quick story and then I'm gonna answer that question so the quick story version is when we got acquired by twitch I grabbed I was like first day what do I want to do I was like let me go find my people because I went into this all of a sudden I'm in a company of 2,000 people who you know each are doing their little function in this company and I was like where my entrepreneurs at like where are the people who like to like you know make [ __ ] happen and so there was a company that had gotten acquired a few years earlier and uh three years earlier and they got bought for like I don't know I want to say like hundred million do and the founder was one of the founders was still working there and so I we go out to lunch and I was like hey can we meet he's like yeah let's go to the cafeteria I was like no no I just need to leave this building I'm having like big claustrophobia they had to get out of this building so we go to a lunch and I say um why are you still here and he's like oh what do you mean like it's going great we're working on stuff I'm like yeah but like uh you know is this what you want to do like you're here you're three years in and I'm looking in the mirror thinking uh you know do I want to be here in three years there's no way I want to be here three four years from now you're going on year four and uh you're drinking this company Kool-Aid what what happened to you why are you still here and he was like you know slightly offended but he was like uh no it's great I'm having fun I'm learning a bunch I go let me ask you the question differently it sound it sounds like what you're saying is you don't want to be doing anything else right he goes yeah and I go so let's say that I had put a $100 million in your bank account tomorrow would you show up to work and he's like well no like I'd be I'm like okay so you're doing it for the money let's okay now we've established that because if I all I did was I Chang the money part of the equation and now your answer is very different he's like well I would buy a ranch and I would you know I have for kids and we'd be outside all day but then on the side I'd be building this type of project I was like okay so that's what you really want to do I'm not saying you have to go do that but let's at least be honest I didn't like the part where you were telling me this is exactly what I want to be doing with my life and I can say today there's things there's a part of my life like this podcast part of my life that is exactly what I would be doing regardless of what the number is in the bank account um and there's a part of my life where like we spin up companies but like we SP up companies like for example we just spun up a company that is I would say it is opportunistic it's not the most fun sexy company in the world I don't want to operate it forever I'm like oh this business will work it'll be successful it'll have a great exit it'll provide a great return it'll you know uh it'll put you know millions of dollars in people's bank accounts in the next three to five years and that is good but if I was totally post-economic there's no way I would spend an ounce of my energy doing that company like just the reality of the situation so I'm like you know partially following that that philosophy but not all the way yet and I'm kind of honest with my at least I'm honest with myself of like yes and no but the my answer to the question of if I was totally post-economic you know I have more money than I'll ever be able to spend uh the thing that I would do is I would teach and I would either just teach in the way that I do today like podcast write a book uh you know just basically be curious go learn something and then explain what I learned to people who don't have the 12 hours to go down the bioelectricity rabbit hole um you know you know but that's what I would do or I would extend that if I wanted to be a little more ambitious and I would actually create a campus and a school for people like me and be like cool let me create the ideal school that I wish I had when I was younger and do that um I just don't know how much I don't know how much that would be fun like the kind of reward versus extra effort that that takes versus creating content online and doing the same thing but not having any of the like students and physical campus and stuff that I need to deal with you we should talk about that sometime because I've thought about that as well I wish there was a better school for me and for people like us who are you know are creative entrepreneurial quirky and the traditional school system does not like satisfy our needs um and what's cool about it is you know if let's say we came up with a concept for how we would do this like I would just put my whole team behind it and then we'll find a way to find the money and then it will just manifest like these things don't have to wait until you have a billion dollars in cash is the point and but I asked you the question because I I found that bio was on my list like oh I would do more bio stuff I just fund it and like but I know people who could fund it so I could just call them and have them fund it and I I don't need to fully fund it and I'll manifest um and I think I think a lot of us um have so many of these things that we want to create in the world and it's dangerous to eat because life priorities change and I think that I see this with many of my friends to go on to get married have kids they get comfortable they're building their ridiculous house and then life goes by and they never go through this Liston it always stays a dream or an aspiration and I I just couldn't allow that to happen to myself and I'm so glad that you're you know doing most of the things on your list that's a a great phrase it's dangerous to wait um because I think most people feel like it it'd be Ry to go do it and I think they vastly underestimate the risk of allowing yourself to just wait on the things you really want to do in life because actually what happens is you acrew this like um it's not like by waiting you get closer to the goal by waiting you actually get further away from the goal because you add all this space that gets filled up with other activities other responsibilities thoughts you know uh you train yourself to not take action on the [ __ ] you actually want and to like go down this like long winding path I remember when I was um back to when I was working at twitch there's a guy Dan who's now the CEO at the time he came in as like I don't know Chief product officer or something he was he became my boss so we go into this like one-on-one and um he's like so like what are your like career you know what's your like goals for yourself here you know at the company and I was like um well I have two options here I'm either going to lie to this guy and say oh I can't wait to get promoted from L7 to L8 to L10 like you know like that's like the ladder literally it's a ladder and you that's your goals CL Ang goals I was like I'm either going to lie about this to him because he's you know he's my manager I guess that's what I'm supposed to say or I'll tell the truth and so I told him the truth and I was like uh yeah I can't wait to go build another thing or just go on my own and like I don't see myself being here and uh long term and he was like okay well that but he didn't he didn't I thought like that's going to put him in an awkward position but he was like you know he's an experienced guy he toally you know rolled with it he's like okay great uh now that I know that and I was like you know I don't want you to totally write me off because I said that like I do think I'll be here to earn out this part of the deal I think I can do good work while I'm here like you know I think you'll you'll get value from somebody with my talents being here um so I hope you don't just like you know say oh this guy's not here for the Long Haul like write me off but that's the truth and he was like done I appreciate that now let's talk about the thing you really want to do what is it that you really want to do and I was like oh I want to do this this this but you know before I do that I need to kind of like you know I'm trying to get you know save up you know enough Capital because I'm gonna that's going to require a lot of capital and I'm going to learn some things I'm going to build my network and and he's like yeah I'm not really a fan of the like I want to do X so I'm gonna go do a and C before I do X he's like you're better off usually just going ahead and trying to do X and I was like all right you're right that's true I don't need like you don't even need to say anymore you're right I was bullshitting myself a little bit um thank you for saying that that's actually a really Val Val piece of wisdom and um it reminded me of um there's this Tony Robbins Ted Talk have you ever seen the one time Tony Robbins went to Ted yeah he's like on stage and he's like um what stops you know I've been I spent my whole life basically studying like what stops people from having what they want in life and he's like you know um what do you think it is what holds you back and people are like oh like you know from whatever it is you want you want a better relationship you want a better career you want more money you want better health whatever whatever it is and people are like oh I I don't have the time and other people like I don't have the the knowledge the skills I don't and the people in the crowd are saying it and Al Gore is there and uh this was like right after Al Gore had lost uh the presidential race to Bush I think there was like a runoff like they had to recount the votes in Florida or something and like they it went to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court ruled that whatever Bush won and so he hears this voice that says I didn't have enough Supreme Court Justices and he's like what the hell what do you mean like who's oh Al Gore's here and Tony Robbins gives is this like one minute thing that like actually kind of like bits slapped all their answers he's like uh you know everything you guys just said is a resource you lacked money time Capital Supreme Court Justices it's a a thing you lack Supreme Court Justices yeah that's the most hilarious example he's like the only thing you actually need is resourcefulness he's like that is the master skill the ability to go get the resources you need when you need them for the thing you're trying to manifest and he's like if is it not true that if you are MO at enough charismatic enough playful enough convincing enough um you know like determined enough and and Charming enough can you not get everything that you want like is it like is there really anything that is outside of you if you really put your all into acquiring that resource could you not have gotten the time the money the the network all of those things like Al Gore if you were not more passionate when you were on that stage in that debate would it ever ever even come down to that Supreme Court Justices no right like you would have just won in a landslide uh if you had acquired the things that you actually needed to get there and that's kind of what you're saying of your little manifestation studio type of concept I love that because it's like you are completely striking out from the thought process of an entrepreneur they're like do I have what it takes either personally or financially or uh you know knowledge and skill-wise you're like well if I want to start a bio company I'll go recruit the best bio people and then I'll go raise the funding we say like you don't have enough time or money those are always the excuses but you create the time by hiring other people to do the work who are better experts at whatever that thing is and you manufacture the money by raising the money and in my case I've got a multi-person investor relations team they have connections to tons of billionaires and family offices and we're trying to like place these deals with our family office connections and that's going to be you know within the next year that's going to be a four-person team and a capability I had so instead of creating a hold Co let's create manifestation CES that's what I'm talking about are not always G be right I I mean you coined it it's the manifestation code and uh because now if it could be a profitable Endeavor great sometimes it won't be and but the point is all of us have that thing we want to create in our our life and we want to have the ability to do that in a way that's painless fun and exciting for us as the IB eater what about like um you know crazy science dreams you have you said you have ideas or you're talking to scientists all the time what are some things that are you know in the future that you're excited about that is not just a pipe dream like there might actually be a pathway to do it like you know I don't know if the the grow test tube baby in a vat type of thing like I don't know if that's like just a dream or there's actually people working on the that that might be scientifically possible or practical can you tell me about some parts of the future that I should be excited about or my kids might get to experience I actually think that is very viable the test two babies um I know of I've talked to several scientists who are doing the portion to like for example let's say you wanted to be the mother of a child not the father and we could take your genetic material and create an egg out of that I think that we're going to see that within the next five years and than the converting you know having a artificial embryo generated Avatar Style that's a little harder to do I I met scientists who've been able to um get to maybe six weeks before the whole thing falls apart and that will get better and better over time um but the implications there are huge like for women imagine not having to deal with this and uh not having to do egg extraction um if you're you know if you're having trouble conceiving and then what's also realistic I think is extending Our Lives by 30% I think we need to be prepared to live till we're 120 or longer and right now theer liim our head is oh I'll probably die when I'm 90 we're not thinking about the exponential rate of change here and I am talking to a lot of longevity scientist I'm seeing the data it's compelling I think we're going to live longer and we need a plan for that future what's the short version of how we get that extra 30% is it drugs is it uh diet Lifestyle Changes is it reversing aging is it you know uh getting blood from Young uh you know baby seals what what are we going to do to to make that happen it's probably going to be a combination of multiple factors and you all these projects fall under what you call bold science can you define bold science what does that mean yeah there just so many uh companies working on very incremental uh you know companies where it might extend your lifespan by 3 months or six months that's not a great outcome like you're going to be going to the hospital and taking chemo drugs for another six months before you're dead what do you do that's like I'd rather go to go to hospice than prolong my suffering but if you could instead patching the problem like putting a bandid on a gunshot wound is the analogy um what if you could get to the root cause and reverse cancer for example so right now everything we do within cancer is about um trying to kill the cancer cells through chemo radiation surgery carte therapies are super hot and trendy but that just basically involves using your immune system to Target and kill your own cancer cells but what if killing cancer is the wrong approach and actually cancer happens because your cells are trying to protect themselves in some way and if you could train them and Coach your cste of Killing Them let's rehabilitate them get them to integrate back in with their surroundings then you could fix cancer and so we're working on a company around that um that's what I mean by buold science that's that's uh that's great so it's basically non non-incremental a big leap in function or leap in quality of life so like you know a a step complete step change and usually that's going to come from taking a different approach than like you know uh or taking a different point of view on the problem looking at it through a different lens and um you've you what you do is you partner with Scientists to make that happen one of the things you said that I liked uh when we were talking before was you're like I get on the plane I get on the plane every time yeah and um I don't know exactly what you mean by that but talk about that because I think that's just an entrepreneurial as part of the manifestation Studio you got to just get on the plane sometimes what what do you mean by that that I have a real example I have uh there's the successful entrepreneur who I'm sure you've heard of um maybe you even interviewed him he lives in Vegas I live in LA and I just said hey tell me a time and place on Sunday and Monday and I will fly to Vegas and I will meet you I will literally take my plane and fly there just for the meeting and then fly home afterwards and then Tuesday same thing I have um Patrick hollison from stripe asked me to hang out with him and have dinner and it's like all right cool I'll just get on my Jet and go see him and then fly back and be back in my Ved after dinner you know and does does that only work if you have a jet no buy a Southwest ticket I mean just get creative about it I do it so often though that it is really nice to have my own airplane but like I think that um it doesn't matter like if I have to fly to London and see someone I will I gladly know book a ticket and do that and uh I think that it really you know I had Delan Aire do this for me where he literally flew in from South America and he went straight from the airport to dinner with me and that was the first time I had a one-on-one meeting with this person and it really made an impression on me I'm like wow this guy went out of his way he was planning to go to some other City instead he came to LA to meet me just for dinner and and he's more important than I am by by a million miles he's so much more important than I am that made me want to be friends with this person and um you know I have another billionaire who I hit it off with we hung out for drinks um we were part of a bigger group and we had two hours where he just talked about the meaning of life all of his regrets all the things he do different he's like this 70 something year old dude and he's like yeah everyone wants me for my money but no one just asked me these questions that you're asking me about life advice and I'm like you know what we should continue this where do you live I'll visit you he says I live in the Bahamas I'm like great I'm visiting you and we booked the time I'm seeing him for dinner in three weeks and I want to literally go there just to see him and he's so happy about it and I want to get four hours of downloading this man's Wisdom and uh it's it's super cool I think it's massively underrated uh we uh my uncle calls it meeting belly to belly he's like you got to meet belly to belly in business and he's in the real estate game it's a totally different game but I loved it I was like not face to face we're going belly to belly and I just think that that was like created such a good visual in my head if you were going to score it let's say if I gave you one point of like trust productivity relationship building for a zoom call versus um meeting belly to belly if one is if one is the is the call how much is the in person well um yeah I would think B the other way I mean it's it's it's just they're totally opposite ends of the spectrum like a belly to belly like flying out to see them is the ultimate 10 out of 10 way to engage with someone there is no better way than to say I'm flying five hours out of my way to see you and I spend you know dinner with you and a call is definitely a one and a zoom call is maybe a two it's like that's how wide the Delta is right and uh oh the other thing I want to mention is that even I think a lot of people think oh but Jess like you you've already like Meed a bit so of course people want to hang out with you well I was getting meetings like this when I was 16 and I knew nothing I cold emailed the retic guys I cold emailed Justin and EMT from twitch I guess it was Justin.tv back then and I said hey I'm this idiot 16-year-old I think you just put it on the table like I'm an idiot and I think you are brilliant and I'm willing to fly to you and I just want to be a um a fly on your shoulder and see you do your work and just like you know just follow you around for a day and so if you pull up the Justin.tv archives you will see me driving him around San Francisco and going to a poker game with him and like all this random stuff just because I was Will to do that Mark Benny off replied to me also again I'm an idiot 16y old that's amazing this is when you're a teenager you also told me because I asked you because um I think one of the valuable things in life is to study like to become a good evaluator of people like if let's say you're an NBA general manager you need to be able to spot Talent um I think any business person or investor needs to be able to spot talent and ideally Spot the Difference between good and great great and the best in the world and um when I met you I really felt like oh this might be somebody who's one of those like Elite best in the world at what they do and they're going to do special things that are Beyond even what really great smart you you know intelligent people are going to do just because they seem to be operating differently but I need to understand them a little more so I asked you a question when I was getting to know you and I was I was like if I met you when you were younger like 13 years old what would I have seen and would I would there have been any signals for uh for this and I I said you know and I will say on my side I was a totally unimpressive 13-year-old you know um you know there was no signals that I was going to do anything out of the ordinary um you know forget like being great at something just like out of the ordinary Beyond average and um so I wasn't that way but I've met a lot of people who were you know they're like teenagers they were flipping things like you know on eBay or they were building a product of some kind or you know whatever you have an amazing kind of backstory uh can you tell it what were you doing what was like your first you know interesting little business you were doing when you were you were a teenager when I was 13 I started a dedicated server and collocation business business because that's what I thought you did in high school that's just I don't know why but I thought it was kind of normal and I grew that set about a few hundred grand in Revenue did you know somebody else doing it why would you think that's normal I don't know I was the internet forums you know there are lots of people who do this so I thought okay this is like a commodity business but I could probably figure out how to do it and make a few bucks and offset my gaming server expenses that was the goal I just wanted to make like $10,000 a year to offset my own costs and buy some clothes and not have to like go work at the shopping mall or like Rak leaves or shovel stuff so you're like I'm playing video games I want to scratch my own itch be able to play my own video games and and like you know pay pay off that buy some clothes were you cool in school were you like a no smart popular kid or who were you total geek loser I was so lame I so I had no friends I went to the Computer Club at my high school um which is all the Nerds who also had no other friends so you have to be friends with each other they were making fun of me and they were bullying me I was literally on the bottom of the bottom TM po like that's how I knew it was really bad I'm like okay I have to get out of here as soon as possible so I ended up dropping out of high school uh halfway through my sophomore year but I got into this really cool college program called Simon's Rock College you know Simon Rock and going to college early it really Saed me because I was born in high school I wasn't doing well I was I was getting terrible geds because I was uninterested and because I had no friends and I felt like I couldn't relate to anyone all other girls um and guys just like were interested in things that I had no interest in so when you said hey I would love to create the school for people like us I just thought holy cow I want to create that school too we can make this happen let's do it let's brainstorm it let's set aside sometime another day or let's just go meet up for dinner I'll come wherever you want any day you want I will I will fly to you and we will put together you know a game plan for what this would look like and how we would Manifest this without having to wait till we're you know sitting on a billion in cash yeah okay done I love it belly to belly booked um you tell me about this server business uh did you make the 10 grand off that I was making like hundred of thousands of dollars a year off of it I was making more money than my teacher I remember in biology class it's 800 a.m. and I can't pay attention and I'm like doing like the biology teacher clearly doesn't like me cuz she knows that I'm high potential but I wasn't doing well because I was up till 3: in the morning answering customer service and sales emails so of course I only had like five hours of sleep and when you're 13 and you're operating on five hours of sleep you're not going to do well and but to make myself feel better I thought well at least I'm making more money than my biology teacher well I'm asleep moral Victory uh so when you were meeting these people because you were like I'm a I'm a dumb 16-year-old college kid you're College because you're 16 because you dropped out of high school yeah and like just went to college um you met Justin Khan you met Mark benof you met uh you know these different YC Founders did you do you learn did you learn anything they stick with you was there a story that like you remember uh like what did you get out of those meetings yeah what I got out of it was that holy cow there are other people like me who are a little crazy who are willing to approach life and Entrepreneurship in an unconventional way and who are willing to do uh you know the hard things so when I saw Justin and when I saw Steve Huffman Reddit I I realized wow like I don't need to wait till I'm older to start doing this today and I also don't need to have money I don't have to have like a job to demonstrate success first so it's more of the Mind mindset I would say it's always mindset and psychology more than tactics um when you're meeting these people that I focus on yeah yeah and you you also told me you had met these other people like when I was like oh what's um uh I forgot I was like I think I was asking you like what you do with your money and you were like yeah I uh you said one interesting thing you were like you're like you know uh taxes um people I think I was asking you something about taxes and you were like people don't spend enough time on taxes so can you tell me um we'll put this in the bucket of billionaire secrets uh you you said you've met a bunch of successful super rich people and the way they think is a little bit different than the way everybody else thinks and I'm interested in that Gap what's different about the way that the most successful the richest people that you know think what is it that they're thinking about differently um one of the things was taxes but you had a few more can you tell me the taxes point and anything else you kind of remember on that yeah top tax optimization is a really big deal because if you think about it if you're spend it if if half your money is going to Uncle Sam it's really going to impact your compounding like do a you know compound interest uh calculator and you'll see the Delta is very wide if you're starting at age say 30 and these billionaires employ the best tax strategists in the world So eventually I said hey could you introduce me to your tax person and that person of course works with like 30 other billionaires and has saved them you know collectively hundred billion dollars in taxes and then I I've gotten enough of these tax professional intros where now I have a whole collection of them I call and I combine advice from multiple tax professionals and merge it all together and I think that's the next level most people just pick one person they say oh I've been working with Betty is my tax accountant for the past 10 years well Betty doesn't work with billionaires it's time for a new tax accountant I literally had this conver conversation with someone over lunch last week and he texted me right before we got on this call saying oh my God like this is going to make me millions of dollars more over the next few years like well this is so true uh I feel when I uh like I have like a lawyer and a tax person and if I feel like I if I talk to another tax person or a lawyer I'm like kind of cheating on them and it's like that's so silly that's so dumb of a way to think about it like first of all it's your job to get the best opinion possible to get the best answer the best answer is not going to come necessarily from the one person you know who you picked one time five years ago without vetting anybody else um they may also not specialize in other stuff you're doing oh now you're doing real estate deals well they don't know anything about real estate deals or you're doing uh you have an exit and m&a they don't know anything about m&a so you know you should be talking to people who really understand that stuff um a team though multiple opinions is better than one uh Specialties matter um also when you said that it reminded me I was like oh yeah the person who I have doing tax strategy stuff they they stopped giving me strategy after year one like we you know like the bulk if I had a pie chart of 90% of the like strategy convos convos we had were at the very beginning and then like now I'm just like the client that they you know stamp the the thing on like every year right like that happens naturally same thing with legal legal stuff and so you kind of need to keep dating in order to have like fresh ideas or advice coming in uh from that perspective exactly you also said like there's a certain amount of time you think people should spend on or like you know maybe not should but like the math tells you you should be spending a certain amount of time on taxes and actually the what people actually do is maybe less than 1% of their time yeah exactly less than 1% way less than even 0.1% because if taxes impact half your income potentially if you invest just even five or 10% of your time this year to finding five amazing tax strategists get all their advice and figure out how to apply it 10% of your time as the up upper bound here and you're making like way more money as a result it pays for itself like 100 fold it's the highest IR investment you can make and it's way better than like investing in the stock market with the money you're paying these tax people no that's so true because your tax is always your biggest expense uh and if you're a business person you have your you know your business tax then you have your personal tax you have like investment tax capital gains tax you have all kinds of taxes every single year you know the same dollar gets taxed a bunch of times um so you're right basically it's the biggest it's the big biggest expense even 10% sounds absurd because I'm like oh that's 36 days out of the year it's Overkill you don't need that much time I mean even five days in the year to do this gets you a lot you're right on the math like you would be justified spending 36 days out of the year you would be justified spending 10% of your time and intellectual mind share on some on your biggest expense that's going to compound every year for the rest of your life like of course that would make sense so that is a kind of like aha moment for me right what about like um coaching or uh you know some sort of like what is your like basically if the studio the manifestation kind of like vehicle here is an extension of you and your brain and your dreams and your desires and then like getting the brain to be like functioning well seems important do you do anything whether it's therapy nutrition morning routine like do you do anything like that to like make sure you're the psych ology that you know the the little voice in your head is saying the right stuff yeah for sure I have um I have two different coaches I talk with each month and I think of it as like going to the gym or taking a shower even if I think I'm happy or in a good mindset I need to still go see them to make sure that my head is screwed on properly and yeah cost me a ton of money but it pays for itself right away I also have my CEO group I is it once a month it's kind of like alcohol an Alcoholics Anonymous for CEOs I'm in YPO young president organization but there's also entrepreneur organization and Fage list goes on and on and they're yeah you think oh I don't have time for it but I actually think you don't have time not to do that that's a good way of putting it um also help stuff we don't think about that what if you could optimize through better nutrition and neut tropics and through IVs you're not only your longevity but your mental acuity so I work with five coner doctors to come up with my own custom plan and I'm actually going to put something together that I could share with all my friends so anyone I love can get on the same program um and it includes the supplements custom compounding my own supplements into you know just two pills um so it's a little easier um and then doing the exom IBS once a quarter which I'm I'm a huge fan of and I don't what what is that what is that word you just said what what are you doing exosome IVs and uh yeah I mean so it's still the science on it still a little um you know up in the air so I just want to be you know good on the disclosure there um so it's not necessarily the Fountain of eath but there's the belief that you know if you're if you're doing if you're bringing in stem cells you know through an IV um it will help you uh lower your biological age give you more energy and help you with um with your autophagy so basically your body's ability to get rid of uh old and dying cells and if you do that then the thought is you're going to have more energy more energy means or brain power more brain power means more ability to manifest and create great things in the world and so this is another area where let's say you were able to improve your mental function and your energy by 25% by the way if you do all these things you could probably do like better than 25% is that worth $115,000 a year which is roughly how much I spend on this maybe I spend 20 or 25 Grand on it it's not a lot of money you don't need to pull a Brian Johnson where you're spending a million dollar a year to get 80% of the results this is the 8020 rule of Brian Johnson uh yeah that's what I need uh good I I'm going to hit you up for some recommendations send you some referrals and um and then yeah I I'll I'll eventually pull us all this feedback to make it so that we could share it publicly and for free so you guys don't necessarily need to pay for your own con doctor to do this for you I think it's ridiculous that like all the work I'm doing here I'm spending this money on it like this should be like a public service that's offered yeah because it's not so personalized to you basically you're saying no it's not that personalized 90% of what I'm doing like anyone else should just be able to do on their own it's just not this whole longevity optimization arena is so new and in order for other folks to monetize on it has to feel bespoken unique to you when so uh give me the quick rundown so you spend this money you have this this program that you're doing you said you do this exosome IVs uh okay great what are like if you were going to go from like most impactful to like you know whatever Fringe you know stuff what's the most the most impactful stuff you're doing again I'll be super honest it's hard to know where the impact is um like on just what you what you kind of believe in or what you would recommend to your cousin or your your your friend who you you know who you're like look we we get all the disclaimers you're not a doctor this not the your this not you know bulletproof science cool okay amongst friends you kind tell what your opinion is yeah uh I'm a friend of eeg1 I'm sure people have talked about that on your pod before um I'm a fan of uh adding in other there's this whole list of supplements and neut Tropics that I can't even recite the name of for you but I could publish the list for you if you'd like and then having them all again put together in you know a few compact pills that you could take um and then have a friend and who does that you you like go to a compounding pharmacy and you're like hey can you make these pills for me like cool we'll have like 32 pills delivered like how does that work yeah I have a friend who actually has his own so I get it at Cost but my plan is to work with him to create it so that he can make some profit and then my friends will have basically what I take and not have it be marked up too much like all these other scumbag internet companies are trying to do shout out to the scumbags out there keep keep doing your thing that's it in a nutshell I know that's isem I us on a hug fan of and then there's also um yeah I mean there a bunch of peptides as well if you want to do the more advanced thing um and on the peptides you know some of them are injectable um so you know that I would consult a doctor on but the supplements you you could probably just do right and I would Benchmark I would take um the true Diagnostics um biological you know age test just to see how you're doing before middle and after and um yeah so that's another so taxes Health um coaching and mindset what are the other categories for you know billionaire secrets we haven't covered um I think those are the big ones the I mean the other one is what you talked about which is um being non-operational yeah create a vehicle that's going to create all your other vehicles um and and be able to recruit Talent that's going to be able to put the pieces together the way I look at it is like every project needs kind of like a vision it needs Capital it needs an operator it needs what you know what are what does it need okay I'm gonna be able to create those packages and so that's I think that's what a lot of them do is they they get out of I'm gonna go every day and work on this one business and toil away like turning the crank myself and you know that's the the higher leverage way that they they operate is is like that yeah exactly yeah I think that's great and um I think also billionaires have a different mindset when it comes to buying expensive things so you think oh they have so much money that why would they waste that on the boat or the plane or the exotic cars and the truth is um on a lot of that it's taxes so I have a friend who's buying a $30 million yacht right now and he found a way for it to give him a $30 million right off he's going to Charter it out for a bit but like he receives more money on taxes than what he's spending on the yacht and his bank will finance 80% of the yacht he's only putting 20% down so it's net net cash flow positive for him to buy the yacht ironically and the operational costs are offset largely by the charter and you don't think that but it pays for all his cost and um people do this with airplanes too I did this with my airplane I mean I had a bigger write off from buying the airplane than what I put down in cash to buy the airplane so can you give the quick math on uh it doesn't have your specific plan but just like just a general math so people that know like how does the buy a plane work from a tax perspective yeah well it the rules are changing but I I closed online about a year ago and um let's say you buy a plane it's 5 million bucks and your Banks willing to finance most of it so you put a million dollars down um but you get a $5 million write off on the plane and it's a year one write off right that that was a accelerated bonus depreciation year one um but now the problem is this year it's only 80% you could deduct up front next year at 60% and then 40 and then 20 um yes it's getting worse and worse but um but the point is you do get a tax benefit for buying these assets they are financed and then also if it enables you to do more what you want then there's that like incalculable benefit that you receive right um seen with excited cars a lot of people I know who have excited cars their excited cars are worth more than what they pay for them so they buy the car they drive it for a year and then they sell the car at the same cost or a higher cost than what they paid for it because other people can't they want to have access to that car but they don't have a relationship with the manufacturer and they weren't willing to wait four years on the waiting list to get that car yeah I was surprised to learn that that the um there's just a whole class of really expensive cars that you basically get to drive for free it's like putting a deposit down so you go buy this car uh I don't even know if this would classify but like our our friend had a McLaren and he's like yeah it's great i' driven it you know for a few years and I'm gonna sell it for exactly what I bought it for it doesn't depreciate or it's up you know I'll make 10 20 grand on this thing for the privilege of driving this around and uh there's a whole bunch of these like Rich get richer uh style setups like you know where if you if once you start to play It's like a snowball it's like you use the money to buy something that's going to make you more efficient and have more fun or uh you know Do Better Business and then that also is going to save you money on taxes today and then it also going to hold value because it's a rare asset and so you're going to you know if you ever sell it you didn't lose anything just for holding this so you know you get all these like gains and they start to accumulate once you start to get there and I think that's a um a real advantage and you know some people who I think are on the other side of that hate that and they feel like that's so unfair and unjust uh you know I don't really give a moral opinion either way it's just that is what it is and uh you know you could choose to either um benefit from that you can choose to ignore it or you can choose to be upset about it you have many choices on how you're going to react to uh you know a bunch of these things that that come with you know the the snowball of of of you know wealth yeah I think I think it's easy to heat on it but what's cool is that people could learn about mindset and how to get there and that's what you're doing with your pod like you're very specific about like how to do these things I've noticed and this was not available to people five years ago so yeah um well well it's funny because like money is this uh taboo thing it's like we're all supposed to not share anything we know about money how much we make what we how we invest what the returns are what taxes what do you do with your taxes like everybody plays you know Clos guarded on that and it's a real shame because it means it's very hard to learn uh until that gets cracked open and somebody starts sharing then more people start sharing then you start to learn faster and uh there's this great Conor McGregor quote where he talks about like Conor McGregor went from plumber to highest paid athlete in the world in a span of five years and along the way he was higher paid than any UFC guy ever was faster than anybody was and there was a lot of guys who had been paying their dues for 15 years fighting for you know going out there and like fighting in a cage match for $20,000 and then they have to pay for their flights their hotels the medical bills and they're left with two grand at the end of it and they were very bitter and someone asked him in an interview they go Connor you know do you ever think about kind of toning it down because uh you know there's so many people that are you know get upset when you talk about you call your shots you say how much you're making you wear the nice watch you wear the nice clothes and he goes um no that says something about them not me he goes some people see this and they take inspiration and that's who I was I saw people doing things and I took inspiration and other people see things and they get bitterness and they will end up bitter it is not my job to figure out you know they get to decide if they're going to go on the bitterness path or the inspiration path um you know the right people will get inspired and uh that actually kind of freed me up in this podcast to do things that I think you know ask questions or talk about things that I think are you're supposed to downplay everything you're supposed to not talk about you know certain stuff um but [ __ ] that you know that doesn't seem like like I know I I when I was growing up I couldn't wait to get a little more information or inspiration or hear you know that somebody oh this guy has a private Chef damn that'd be awesome I don't feel bad that I don't have one now I now have a new thing that I've decided that would be really awesome fun to work for and and a great like a way to improve quality of life that I had never even thought about and um thank you for putting it on my radar thank you for putting it in my in my uh you know in front of me that I now wanted to go go do that I love that yeah like I think it is difficult to struggle with the feeling of jealousy and aspiration and another trick that I'm not sure if this came from Tony Robbins or someone else but if you're surrounded by people who are more successful than you instead of envying them um maybe you could interpret it as hey this is a great sign because this means more success and more happiness is coming my way now that I'm able to surround myself and attract these people into my life how awesome and um I remember having to deal with that a lot especially when I was a upand cominging entrepreneur and I knew absolutely nothing and I have you know Drew from drawbox and Sam Altman coming to speak to me and these like CS students right like we didn't know anything and um and the Gap felt very wide but just having them there to spend time with us and to say hey we're open to like just email us if you have any questions about what it's like to be a Founder we're going to be there for you just feeling like all the more approachable and accessible I think made it easier for me to focus on the education instead of the EnV right that's a that's a great way of putting it can I ask you one thing before we go because I know I took too much of your time sure uh Sam Alman is now like this extremely interesting public character um very few people actually know him sounds like you've had interactions with him in the past uh can you give me your impressions or any story you remember of Sam Alman um because I remember reading Paul Graham's essays like 10 years ago where he's like of the five most impressive people I've met it's like Bill Gates or whatever you know Larry and Sergey and Sam Alman you know and it's like at that's when he was doing looped and nobody you know there was no there was no track record he he sort of was was like it was just very apparent in meeting him at that time that this guy's going to go on to do great things did you get that sense or um I don't know how much interaction you had with them yeah I actually I mean this was probably 13 years ago now but I I had a one-on-one with Paul RAM and I asked him to share like who do you think the most um you know successful people you've ever met like who will Who will that end up being 30 years from now if we have another one at one like this and Sam was on the list I'm not going to share who the others were on that list um but they're all also doing extremely well and um what a question by you by the way fantastic question yeah and I asked Paul what are the things in common with these people what what did by the way he put me on the list I'm the worst one by far so I'm embarrassed I felt like I disappointed him but we'll see that for another day um and I asked him for like what are personality traits you find in these people like how you know what do you see and for him it it was less about the intelligence actually it was not about the it it goes back to this common theme we've had throughout the past hour and a half here on like grit and being willing to be unconventional and to try different approaches and to you know to collect ideas from multiple species and merge them together to come up with something even better than what a domain expert in anyone field would be able to come up with on their own um and just like how they show up and what they're willing to do to meet the right people was a big part of um what Mak so that's that also reinforced my wanting to have this policy of just get on the plane because that's a trait that successful people perceive will lead to you know you being destined for greatness so to speak like all right well I don't think I'm destined for greatness but what if I could manufacture making other people think I'm destined for greatness maybe I'll actually maybe I'll create that reality somehow yeah eventually you know it walks like a duck it talks like a duck hey it became a duck you know by the end of it actually so so those traits you said just now sorry to recap was um grit or resourcefulness like you know the the willingness to make things happen you said um uh going into M being being able to collect ideas from multiple spaces and and synthesize it so that you actually might create something more than any domain than the than the individual domain experts had been able to reach you get to a new a new ceiling um from that that was like the second thing you said third was uh wanting to meet the right people ask the right questions and being willing to go to certain lengths to to kind of meet them right that was that was the third one did I miss one that you said yeah just to build on that third one it's that how can you meet yourself interesting enough at a dinner party so that they would want to invite you back to spend more time with them how do you broaden your field of knowledge to be able to be an advisor you know someone that you know a king or president would want to call upon for feedback and you know you to Paul youram sass or this was years ago before you left for the UK he has a huge library of books and he's read most of these books and and he's just fascinated by so many topics and that also left an impression on me okay like should just learn about random things that have nothing to do with our day-to-day business because they'll help us with category number three on that list right right yeah that's such a good call I went to a farming conference last year like two years ago like farmand love and it was the best conference I had been to in like five years because i' only been going to Tech conferences and you know I'm not learning anything at these Tech conferen you know like I'm adding the same incremental knowledge and it's the same thoughts and philosophies and same types of people in that bubble and there's nothing wrong with that but like there's definitely like you want that 20% like total change up that is um completely at a left field that's like wow these guys talk about different things think about different things have a different perspective live in a I was in Kansas City right like it was like uh you know you go to a different place and you have a totally different perspective and I literally started a company while I was there because I was like piecing together like two ideas one from the tech world and one from this like farmer that we had met and like it you know that was you know when we created the milk Road and we even the name milk Road was like because we're at a freaking farming conference and there's like a Dairy Farmer next to us you know like it all kind of played in to to to having that if you know we hadn't stirred the pot in that exact way you know maybe you would have come up with a different answer yeah that's super cool that you did that and I I'm curious to download from you what is also on your list of like the next areas you would want to learn about and um I think it's actually good exercise for me too to think about because for me it's been bio lately but I I would like to brought in it even more so give an example of one of the bio companies that you founded what it you know to give us the high level of like the problem the solution you guys are trying to do and like you know the the rough stage where it's at yeah the high level is I set up a holding company uh for biotech uh Venture creation centered around the scientist named a Mike Levan if you search Mike Lon he has a TED Talk he has a three and a half hour interview with Lex fredman that I highly recommend you watch and you will get sucked in because he's a scientist who studied he got he got PhD in genetics at Harvard and then now he's devoted his entire career to basically proving the fact that genetics are actually not that relevant in the whole scheme of things and that it's this other thing bio electricity that dictates how long we live um whether or not we get cancer um how our Limbs and body shape forms it's actually not as much genetics as you think and genetics is like the hardware level of biology whereas he says biology is like the software so you you told me this you you were like uh we have one companies astonishing Labs it's about bioelectricity and I was like what I've never even heard this word and you said it in in a really interesting way you go um you know people think that it's like genetics is kind of like what your genes say or your DNA says is kind of like what ends up manifesting and you're like turns out it's not that at all which already I was like oh that's a kind of narrative violation what is what do you mean that's all I've ever heard so what is the answer um and you were like yeah there's this idea of bioelectricity and I went and I watched his Ted Talk and he talks about like you know they're able to like you know grow an arm on something's on an animal's back they're able to like grow a third eye right they're able to do all these like show all these amazing like phenotype outputs without any genetic modification and um so can you just like explain that a little bit more about like you know the kind of the Layman's version of it yeah well I I'll be honest I don't even fully understand the science of it but that's everything you said is correct like if you manipulate the bi electricity on an animal um you can create weird outputs like this so when they saw that a tadle was growing an eyeball the bi electric signature of the cells in that area changed and so the question was oh what if he created that same bi electric signature but on another part of the body what will happen will it grow an eyeball not only does it grow an eyeball there but it grows connection to the spinal cord um and so you don't have to micromanage biology if you try to change that through modifying The genome how would you do that there'd be no way to do that is the answer and so if you just think about it logically genetics are therefore not that end all be all so anyway I heard of this it blew my mind and I said this this is brilliant like is he does he have a commercialization partner what's the status of it and the answer is it's still in the lab and there was no one commercializing this yet and Paul Allen was funding the whole lab and then Paul Allen tragically passed away and then the funding dried up so he needed money he needed people to help him make it a real biotech company so I come in I say I know nothing about biotech I know a lot of rich people who would love to fun crazyy stuff like this and wait wait wait when you say I came in that means like I cold emailed him I I called him I I met him what what did you actually do I met him through a friend so I had a friend who was telling me about Mike over lunch and I thought this is brilliant this is amazing could we fly out and meet Mike like next week like I'll literally clear my calendar and I'll spend a few days and I will get to know him and figure out what we could do with this and so I met Mike spent some time with him and realized that this is really compelling and we could do something cool out of it so um so I hired this guy named Tom Tom had taken a drug called elonis from Lab all the way through FDA approval full approval for $16 million which is absolutely crazy and the drug world like normally it takes hundreds of millions of dollars to get something approved by the FDA but his drug actually worked it was putting patients in full remission the first eight out of nine patients normally they would be dead within months with his drug they were they were going into remission so I brought him in to go do uh due diligence on all M Lev's science and figure out a strategy for turning these into real biotech companies and so my contribution was I have 18 I have 12 people who work with me at my holding company or whatever you want to call it for me I don't really think of it as a hold Co or a venture studio for me it's just an extension of me where if there's something I want to manifest in the world I have a team of brilliant people will figure out how to help me make that happen that's amazing and so um so you do that what is the like uh you know what's the product or what do you guys actually building we are building um several companies under this hold code so the first company we created um is called sju and it's essentially a company that will help overcome drug resistance and um how do I make this more concrete if you're taking uh drugs for your leukemia or you're taking chemo drugs it might be effective and work for well you have lots of drugs that are effective in work but then one day they stop working and when they stop working um unfortunately there are sometimes no other viable options for the patient which means they're going to then die but a month late a month earlier the drugs were working and they were fine right so that's one company there's another company that's developing um programmable human biobots and in fact this got you know there's article about this in nature as of today and that company is called anthr robots wow so I'll send you more info on that if you're curious um that is really cool I think CNN's going to post their interview with Mike today about that as well and so is all your all your bio stuff under the this lab with Mike Lev or is there are there other bio bets too because like you've talked to me about uh you know at that dinner we were talking about um I don't know like pregnancy or something like that and you said something kind of in passing you're like yeah like in the next I don't know 10 years uh you know you know you'll women may not need to birth a baby like you know you'll be able to just essentially grow a baby and I was like what um so like like Avatar how cool would it be if you could see like a BB rowing in like a fish tank and all you have to do is I could swab your mouth and swab my mouth put it in the machine and then the be you will start to grow out of it you know there's just get the genetic material no sperm and egg no sperm no egg just raw genetic material and uh you know I think that will eventually be in the future I don't think that's going to be the next 10 years probably not even the next 20 years but I I have random ideas like that this and I think how cool it it be to find who's doing that research and and if if I find people who are then I might support their work and fund it if not then I'll have I'll put together my own team and go try it ourselves and it's likely going to lose money and fail and not work but like this is fun F like not everything has to be for the profit I know your your whole pod is all about making money and all the whole shows are about how to like compound cash flow and blah blah blah but like what if we could have fun doing this and by having fun being Mission oriented you think bigger you think more Grand about what the world could become one day and then you're more likely to end up like Elon or whatever like that's kind of the direction I'm going with with my company here um which I realized is not as sexy it's not as compelling as saying you know we're you know making money well you know maybe it's more sexy I don't know uh like you know when when Facebook was uh going public Mark Zuckerberg wrote this letter to like the potential shareholders that were going to buy the stock and it was like I think it was called The Hacker Way it's a really great thing I you know I know people are very skeptical of Zuck but I think a lot of the stuff he does is is pretty awesome including this letter that he wrote and he described the way that they do things and one of the things he said is like you know we don't build products to make money uh you know you know uh we we don't build products to make great money we we make money to build great products like that is the the core of what we're doing I think Google had said a similar thing when they went public and you know I don't think it's one or the other but there is a first order bit and second order bit meaning like if the first order bit is we are trying to fund bold science that might change everything um even though it has a high likelihood of failure even it might take many years and a lot of money to get there uh but we think that advancing the research and ultimately trying to commercialize the research is the way um that to me is the version of like we don't do that to make money we make money so that we can do that um so I think in a way it's it's a lot more attractive and sexier to to to most people I think if they step back for a minute a lot of the like money first comes from the insecurity right like um just the the sort of wanting wanting that success wanting that wind under your belt wanting that safety in the bank account um you know that's where a lot of that comes from I don't think anybody really if they looked at their life would say I'm so glad I devoted it to maximizing you know how much money I made that's a very unlikely scenario I think a lot of people would actually be more uh inspired by you know the way you're doing things now which is like what's fun what's interesting what gets me out of bed in the morning that's exciting that will if done well um can like you know change change change the world uh in in the non- cliche way because stuff you're doing actually is more change the world than like than you know the end and arrows of the world where it's like we're going to change the world one set of books at a time and it's like well maybe maybe you're just doing bookkeeping actually yeah exactly that's how I felt I I literally had this nagging feeling in my soul that I was wasting my capability and I'm sure a lot of people feel that way awesome well sounds like we got another couple conversations to have thank you for coming on where should people go find you reach out to you where do you want to direct people yeah um I mean I'm on you know my website's ma.com and I've got a Twitter jesa um JMA official on uh Instagram and if people want to reach out you could uh either guess my email address which is what I've done with Mark Ben off and everyone else that's a good filter actually you don't want the inbound that's easy you want the inbound of at least you at least able to guess an email address it's not that l just likeed I had like I literally emailed like Mark sales first mark. Benny off M Benny off uh you know like every per I could come up with and most of them bounced and one of them worked so that's awesome uh thanks for doing this you're awesome and uh yeah that was a great episode yeah great great time hanging out with you thanks for having [Music] me

today there's going to be literally a thousand threads that are Charlie Monger was lived till 99 here's 99 lessons I learned and they're going to regurgitate the stupid quotes in Wikipedia but this is my first we do things differently around here we're not just G to give you the regurgitated quotes I got to give you that you know little special jeo that oldo that you could dip that sandwich [Music] in all right Charlie Munger has died at age 99 and all around the world people are remembering Charlie this guy who's Warren Buffett's business partner he's a billionaire but he's so much more than that he was a guy who uh he was in the military uh he dropped out of school went to the military then he somehow talked his way into Harvard Law even though he didn't even have an under undergraduate degree um you know he started a law firm that people don't even ever talk about that's you know do hundreds of millions in Revenue uh he you know started investing with Warren Buffett and has basically outperformed the stock market over like a 50-year period by a huge degree and um you know Bill Gates called uh Charlie you know maybe the broadest thinker he knows he said that um he has the best 30 second brain of anybody he's ever met and we wanted to dissect that brain what's inside that what made Charlie so prolific why did Warren Buffett say that Burkshire is shaped uh in the mold of Charlie Munger and that he is one of the you know the smartest and wisest men he's ever met um and we pulled out seven of the Big Ideas Charlie said a lot of things over the years but we we identified what we think are the seven big big bits of wisdom uh that Charlie has shared and what we wanted to do was instead of just making a listicle which you're going to see a lot today you're see people on Twitter you know every thread boy is going to be like Charlie mugger died at 99 here's the 99 bits of wisdom and they're G to copy paste Wikipedia we didn't want to do that what we wanted to do was take the seven that we thought were really really impactful and specifically tell a story of how that's happened you how we how we learned that lesson in our own bu business life or in our life um it made for I think a pretty amazing episode I told Sam I said dude this uh this notes document uh that we have for this episode thing is you got a handkerchief this thing is dripping with wisdom and you're that's how you're gonna feel at the end of this podcast you're gonna need to take a shirt you're gonna need to wipe the old podcast player because this episode is about to be dripping with wisdom I hope you enjoy this episode on the seven bits of wisdom from Charlie Monger so let's jump into the wisdom so what I I think would be fun is we just sort of trade our favorites because this guy's got hundreds of little Charlie isms uh you know uh little little quips or or quotes about the way the world Works about the way minds work about the way the markets work and I just thought it' be great to just like pull out you know this is trade you go first and then I'll go on you know some of our favorites and either I think we can just you know talk about them or share you know a way that we've e we've either heard him talk about it or how played a role in our life all right you go first okay um I I'll start with a very easy one so one of you know one of his big Ideas is to get what you want you need to deserve what you want and so he says you know the easiest way to get everything that you want is to deserve it and it's so simple that it's almost like obnoxiously simple this advice uh but he's like whether it's the like you know if you want the partner you want you should be deserving of that level of partner right make yourself worthy of a partner like that uh same thing with Investments he kind of actually calls out a few things that money can't buy so he's like um trust in other people uh success and admiration those are things you cannot buy you can only earn and so if you want somebody's admiration deserve it if you want somebody's trust deserve it if you want success deserve it and uh I'll share like a very simple more practical anecdote about this because again like his big ideas are amazing but they just sort of float in the clouds unless you bring it to earth with like a real tactical example so when we sold the milk Road I've said this before but one of the reasons we we sold to the guys we did was I really really respected these guys it was not the highest offer but these were the highest quality people that we could sell to and we just had a hunch that like selling to the highest quality people will result in the best long-term outcome and even if every even if like you know we lose a dollar today um actually just being in business with these guys is going to create you know for every we're taking less today we might create three more dollars in the future just by being around high quality people and I'll tell you a story that came out of the due diligence that like was like a nugget of gold that stuck with me that was exactly this so these guys that we were selling to uh had built businesses that one of the guys had sold his businesses for about 90 to 100 million and the other guy had sold his business for over 200 million and both of them had built businesses that were SEO based and I know a lot of things about marketing and growth but I know zero about SEO I am an ABS absolute beginner novice I never touch SEO I don't do businesses that are SEO based I literally know nothing and so one of the ways I priced in the deal was oh I'm Gonna Learn SEO from these guys who were frankly Masters at SEO and so we get to the point where we do the deal I've built up you know that we're not negotiating anymore and I'm like oh good I'm gonna start digging I'm gonna start picking these guys brains for SEO [ __ ] like tell them and so I sat them down I was like you're going to teach me about SEO now and they started to tell me something but I was like okay okay that's the general stuff I've heard that stuff before like what's the like real like Master [ __ ] what's the real like you know black belt [ __ ] that I don't know about that you can't just Google and read and you know some blog that like helped you guys create you know one guy created um the number one search result for if you say I want to buy gold online and that's the business that was you know sold for a few hundred million dollars that he bootstrapped that you know never raised any money and he did it because he knew how to be the top result for Buy Gold Online how'd you do it bro what' you do was it some some hack some technique and he's like um you know we did all the normal things and he's like and I tried some of these hacker techniques it didn't really work and he's like so then he's like you know what happened was one day I Googled how to buy gold online and we were the fifth result at the time he goes so what I did was I clicked the link I he's like I just you know thought to myself what does Google really want Google wants to give you the best search result meaning if somebody searches for how to buy gold online they want you to to get to a page that's going to answer those questions and not have you go search again he's like so then I printed out all five of the results us being number five and I printed one through four also and I sat down for an hour and I just looked at them and I read them and I was like I had an honest conversation with myself of why would I click on my page what is better about my page than these other pages and I was like wait so you didn't like do some like black hat SEO [ __ ] that was like this like Advanced trick yeah why AR why aren't you using the word Ai and he was like no he's like we didn't deserve the click we weren't better Pages he so he's like so all I did for the next year was every week I printed out all the pages and then I made my page like you know 10% better I figured out one way that we could be better as objectively better even if we weren't moving up in the ranks yet that I could look at it and say this is a better page we deserve to be higher ranked and I had literally never heard this and I was like on one hand in the moment honestly I was kind of disappointed I was like dude I came to you for that secret Ju you about SEO like I'm not trying to have this like you got to work hard and and just actually make a better page but it was also kind of like refreshing it's like you go to the people who are masters of SEO and they're like yeah you can do all the tricks but at the end of the day you have to have the best result like you have to have the best page and you have to have an honest conversation with yourself of is your page better than these other Pages he's like if you really want to sustainably like climb the Rings and be at number one that's it and that was such a like tangible business example of like to get what you want you have to deserve what you want and um I'll never forget get that that was like one of the biggest takeaways I had of the whole process that's beautiful our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right if you're loving this episode I'm glad I also want to tell you three things that we are doing as a podcast quick little news flash news announcement about MFM I have three things to tell you here they are number one there's like this Meetup thing going on so uh this is kind of cool so um there's a woman do you remember her name I sorry I'm not remember her name the top of my head Rachel I think it is I think her name's Rachel um sorry Rachel if it's not Rachel uh that's all right she runs a company she runs a company that basically helps like contact creators like a spin up Meetup so basically what's happening is in a couple weeks we'll put the link in the in the description I'll also tweet it out but uh in like a week or two around the world there's MFM meetups which is kind of fun we're not going to be there because it's like you know they're they're all happening on the same day in different locations but forget us if you're one of these people that listen to the podcast you're probably going to get along with other people who listen to the podcast it's just like a thing uh you know like people who listen to this podcast you're business nerds with a sense of humor and if you like business nerds with a sense of humor they're all getting together everybody's going to like a a bar you know like there's one in Toronto there's one in California there's one in Austin and they're they're going to hang out it's called River so you go to get river. so get GE and then River like a stream river. you scroll all the way to the bottom and you'll see my first million Meetup there's um they're happening in Austin in Houston Denver Nashville Atlanta Cincinnati all all over the North America I believe right oh her name's Ray you were right okay so Ry uh move us to the top for this week because we got a oh here we go so my first million so so yeah uh they did this for all in I think and that's kind of one one of the proof of Concepts um I think is going to be fun so so do it we'll try to like I don't know call into a couple of these and say hi but um this is cool so that's happening next week that's fun go meet some other people who um are part of neckbeard nation um and then what do you think is that a thing um number two uh we're doing the poker tournament so a while back we talked about this business that we thought found fascinating which was a cloud poker tournament it's like his digital poker tournament where everybody's webcams on it could be private for our community and uh 300 or 400 people signed up we just never scheduled it but now we scheduled it it's December 13th it's happening uh we will give away merch and some cool stuff as prizes we'll come up with some dope prizes maybe like you know whatever thousand bucks or a call or free merch or whatever um so yeah it's at Cloud poern knight.com so cloudporn night.com MFM so if you want to register for that if you already registered we'll send out an email uh to be able letting them know that that's happening uh and last thing is I do a thing every year which is I uh this month this month of December is the plan for you know other people are thinking about Christmas I'm thinking about end of your next year hit my goals and so I basically use this time for planning for 2024 so uh I'm GNA host a free session which basically is I I'm currently doing it for all my businesses I make like a one-page plan for what I'm trying to do next year and it's basically like the big goal and then the breakdown of like how I'm going to do it I have a method of how I get to that answer and you walk away with kind of like a clear one pager for your business uh Ben had the idea he was like dude I love when we do this he's like we should just like do this together with other people that own businesses that want to do it and so um yeah people want to do it I'm just going to be on a zoom and I'll walk you through my process totally free uh you'll walk away in an hour with like a bunch of clarity on what's what your next year looks like uh I have a bunch of good questions that help people get clarity so if you want to attend that um plan for20 24.com so go to plan for2 24.com uh Ben's going to spin up a website and we'll we'll invite people to that um if you're the type of person that wants to kind of like set the vision and the intention for next year I like that one he also had another line Munger did where he's like I never try to disagree with someone's opinion unless I've under unless I understand their side better than they do right and and that's like a specific example of like let's say debate of how he was like I need to I need to deserve this right so that's number two I love that one he says I'm not entitled to an opinion like I can't have conviction until I can argue the other side better than someone who believes the other side and he's like he's like people think he's like people think this is some like crazy high bar and those people haven't ever asked somebody who believes something why they believe it like it's actually quite a low bar to surpass their own like con their own understanding of something um and you know I think about this with like Bitcoin for example I'm a Bitcoin believer and my approach to this was always to say here's all the reason reasons why I believe in Bitcoin it just makes sense for you know reason a b c and d but actually the better way to do is to say smart people who don't believe in Bitcoin would say a b and c and I understand that and here's what I think about those and why I've landed on the side of conviction that I have it's just a much better logical way to think than to just say here's what I believe and I'm going to come up with all the evidence I'm even going to make up some of it to justify my opinion which is I would say how steel Manning yeah so steel Manning is like argue the other side better than they would even argue it um so one of my favorite I'll bring up one uh good line but I uh whenever I hear about these like freaks I call them Freaks and I mean that in in in a ad admirable way I like when they're on the birkshire Hathaway Podium giving their speech they're basically set up like a comedian in order to like give these beautiful lines what I try to find is just weird dated day quirks that they have and like ways that they're acting on a day-to-day basis and so I've got you know our good friend Jack like when I'm with them he'll be like oh I didn't name my daughter I was like why he was like well I need to get to know her first um you know we're I'm gonna wait to name her so she's just named baby for now but once we get to know her and I'm like that's so weird and then you start thinking about it like that's actually not weird it is kind of weird to name a human being before you got to got to meet her so that's like an example like in every day one of my one of our friends Jack wildly successful he's been successful in odd ways and you see how he acts and daily life there's this cool uh story from I think it's called making of an American capitalist and so they talk about how here I'll read just this part from the book they go physically Munger was unimpressive he had an elf-like face pacy skin and glasses an inch thick though something of though though something of a snob and highly Jud judgmental he had a deep sense of ethics and his smarts were matched by churchillian self assurance once uh he was asked if he could play the piano and Munga replied I don't know I've never tried and I thought like what a telling line like what a telling lie so most people you say no I can't play the piano this was I probably could it's there's definitely potential that I will be a great piano player I just haven't tried and when I read that line I I just thought this man's beautiful this man's one of a kind and I love people like that because myself you most everyone we default to can you do this it's like of course not I I don't have the capabilities I I I cannot do that where that little mind shift of like well not yet dude even noticing that props to you I read that line in the research I didn't even understand what was remarkable with the line I just moved on I didn't even notice it till you just said it like you did uh so good on you for even observing it that's a good one well that's what I'm saying when I'm reading about these guys it's like these little one-off lines or these like like for example they'll say he found founded this law firm and then next he was bored there next like whatever and I'm like well hold on let me go look at this law firm and then you start reading about this law firm and like dude this is quirky this is a weird super strange law firm and so anyway yeah this line it's a beautiful line uh about just showing like the day-to-day about how you can be different let me give you number four so my number four um Charlie ISM I want to bring up is let me tell you a little story about where I where I felt this first and I'm going tell you the Charlie ISM so let's rewind the clock 15 years I was living in Indonesia and in Indonesia I lived in this building that had a ping pong table and I don't know anybody because I'm living in Jakarta Indonesia I don't have any friends there and so I used to go down and just hang out by the ping pong table because I thought well that's maybe like you know my equivalent of like going having a drink at the bar let's just go see if anybody's down here to play and maybe I can meet some people and uh so sure enough I would go down me and my brother-in-law we would go down and we would play and my brother-in-law is better than me at pingpong and he the way he plays is what you imagine somebody who's good at pingpong I would serve and he would hit back but like we would get to this point where he would hit like a smash and my brother-in-law is kind of a character if you've ever met him he's like he's not just gonna hit it fast he's gonna jump even though you don't need to jump he's gonna be like w but he's gonna just make you feel like he just smashed this shot and like I was so like I was trying to get better than him he was trying to get better than me and I thought okay he's just got higher skill he's more advanced he's brilliant at this like he could just hit these amazing shots and I got to be able to hit amazing shots so I'm practicing hitting amazing shots and he and so whoever used to come down he would beat them he was the best guy in the building until one day this 55 60y old man came down named Poppy uh oh and we're like your name is Poppy he's like I'm poppy we're like okay I don't know if he's bit flexing on us if this is a real name and he takes a a paddle out of his um of his like case and we're like oh dude he's got his own his own paddle oh [ __ ] it's like the guy who brings his on bowling ball to the bowling alley you know this guy means business so so we already on on like aame basically and so uh I play him and Poppy beats me but he didn't do anything like he wasn't smashing the ball he wasn't doing it and I just thought oh man I was off today all right like Aaron you play him and so I have my brother-in-law Aaron play him I'm like all right Aaron's never lost to anybody in this building let's see what happens and he starts playing Poppy and he's trying to do what he always does he's trying to hit brilliant shots on the corner down the line crosscourt you know drop shot and none of it's working poppy is destroying him and the way that Poppy plays is like this is for anybody who's like a real ping pong fan I need like something to demonstrate so use this pen Pretend This is the paddle normally when you play ping pong your arm is back you're doing like a full stroke like a tennis thing just looking dope he used to just hold it like this forward like the paddle just facing you and then he would just move left and right like a wall and he would just whatever you hit he would just hit back and the thing about poy is poy was never hitting brilliant shots but he would also never hit it out and never hit the net and so inevitably he would just keep hitting it back and one of your brilliant shots would go out of bounds you would hit it too hard too soft You' hit the net like you would mess up and he would always score based on your error and he crushed us and he crushed us that day and he crushed us every day and he would just chuckle and say good game and he would go upstairs and we'd be like [ __ ] poppy man I'm gonna get this guy and we never got him the whole summer I was there we never one time beat this guy and then one day he invited us up to his house afterward his apartment in the building he lived in the penthouse beautiful he was so successful in business we're like poppy dude you're balling out of control he had like a secret poker room he had a a wall of just like super fancy Like Liquor like people have a wine seller he had like a fancy liquor wall it was crazy he had a shower with like six showerheads and we were like dude this guy poppy this and we're like What do you do and he's like I sell soap and we're like you're like you make soap he's like no no I just Import and Export and we're like is it better soap he's like no it's just soap um he's like it's good soap it's not the best and we were like well who how do you sell it he's like well I just go to people that need soap and we're like this [ __ ] poppy like this is how he lives his life too he's just making no no brilliant shots but no unforced errors and so this is a Charlie merism which is avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking Brilliance and he says other people spend their whole life trying to be so smart all I'm trying to do is not be idiotic it's harder than people think but this is more important than trying to be brilliant and so Charlie was basically like how do I just avoid the great errors in life let's say it's investing how do I avoid the great errors of investing if it's Health how do I avoid the great errors of health and that's basically what he oriented around he wasn't perfect at it but I thought what a totally different you know a different strategy than you'll ever hear which is about being the best and becoming more advanced and becoming you know being brilliant and talented and his thing was just just avoid stupidity and you you'll outperform everybody is there a category in the Oscars for like podcasters who can weave in a story into Charlie Munger if if if yes I think you might get I think you might get that nod that was a wonderful we got to give it up that was a wonderful you you you had being enthralled and I didn't know where you were going to go with this I didn't know where I was going to go you just open your mouth and start talking and see where it goes and you won that Mr wonder you you you totally won that one that was a beautiful beautiful way to tie that in copyrighting that's what that's what that was well honestly the reason why today there's going to be literally a thousand threads that are Charlie Munger was live till 99 here's 99 lessons I learned and they're going to regurgitate the stupid quotes in Wikipedia but this is my first we do things differently around here we're not just going to give you the regurgitated quotes I got to give you that you know little special je that old je that you could dip that sandwich in well you came with he that's going to be hard to compete with I um Let me let me ask you something so right now it's uh it's November 29th so most people are doing their next year financial planning for their businesses for years at the hustle I made a very similar mistake that I bet you made and that is over optimism have you ever hit any of your project in the first six years of your career never I've never met a goal I've ever set yeah dude if you ask people at the hustle like one of my big weaknesses is is it's looking at the numbers of the Excel sheet and you know you see like a seven million here uh and you're like what if we took that seven and deleted it and put a nine I'm like look how much more profit they gave us let's just do that a genius yeah that's basically people would be driven crazy because that's what I would do I would just look at the sheets I'm like yeah that looks good but hey look if you just delete that number and put it to that number look how much better this looks so let's just do that and I've made that mistake so many times I um I bought a property uh recently or a few years back and I remember like thinking like okay this is only an okay price property but yeah you know I I'm going to like take better pictures or I'm going to like do something when I sell it and I'm going to make that's how I'm going to make all this money is I'm just going to increase revenue and I'm I'm going to do this this this and guess what just like years of failing at projecting I totally effed it up so now I try to be way more modest uh with my financial projections but I but I completely uh have always messed it up and uh munger's got a bunch of good quotes he's like it's dangerous to rely too much a models and formula the the reality is way more complex than that and he says um we're very disciplined in our approach and we're not and we're not swayed by flimsy optimism and then he goes on to say he's like uh where's the exact quote he talks about how um he basically says like it's pretty ridiculous that people are are biased by both uh over skep skepticism and over optimism in in the business world if the micro reality is good good decisions and good systems are what I look for I don't I don't use predict or not predictions of macro environment changes and so basically the point being is his whole philosophy was to buy businesses where if I bought a good business at a good price I'm golden and then if I ever want to sell it or if something crazy improves that's icing on the cake whereas what I do and I bet most people do and I try my hardest to avoid this nowadays is I say I default to no the optimism is actually the truth the truth is just that's just what they did because they don't know what the hell they're talking about you know what I mean right and that's been one of my biggest mistakes in business is over optimis or uh over optimism and what it does is it crushes team morale and it gets you in a losing state of mind and it just sucks um what what Munger said was he goes you make a lot of money on when you buy a good company at a good price but you make all of the money by letting it ride for 20 years so the patience is where the big money is and I struggle like crazy to do that I have this this year we're I'm trying to a little bit differently but I have never hit any of my projections because it's just too optimistic and that is B it's basically just mental masturbation Is What It Is by by making these projections and it's harmful it's it's a liability well there's like there's like the the thing you want to hit you know some people say you want to hit 70% of the goals um that you that you set and that's like the right balance between ambition and um you know practicality you know zero hitting 0% of your goals is obviously means you're setting the wrong goals and hitting 100% of your goals means you're you know obviously being playing it too safe and conservatively and so there is some number in between you can pick 70 50 60 whatever works for you and uh yeah I think most entrepreneurs and investors for that matter are on the side of optimism because boy doesn't it feel better in the moment to uh to be optimistic do you want to know something I'm trying to do no goals I'm trying to do no goals and I it's it's not working out with any of the partners who I'm involved with who are trying to fight this you know what it's not doing working out yeah I'm trying no goals and I'm getting no no Buy in so I hate i' I've grown to hate goals man like it shouldn't change but this is like your thing with money do you have like a you have like a weird relationship with money that you need like money therapy you have probably like a weird relationship with goals that like uh you just need to work out like you know these extremes you know crazy goals that nobody can hit or no goals like you know I would just assume that the answer is actually somewhere in the middle right theism is probably somewhere somewhere in the middle not not either extreme the analogy that I would give people is like let's say you say bolt is in the Olympics in the 100 meter dash and he runs this race like it doesn't matter if he if if we timed the race a he won and B like just tracking that that time like he he ran faster than everyone else who cares who cares what the you know who who who cares about that stuff and so I'm like it doesn't matter so compare yourself to others is the answer instead well we're talking about Munger and these guys were the analogy Kings man come on um in this analogy you're you saying bolt correct yeah okay good I just I I get fed up with overt tracking and over planning so like we're you know Hampton is uh 18 months old let's say 12 months old and we're trying to look at so they want to plan 12 months out and I'm like yeah that's 50% of the company's existence let's go to one of his other ones that I think is kind of related which is one of munger's Big Ideas the one one that he is is well known for that I have taken into my life is this idea of inversion so he he says invert always invert and so you know that what does this mean it's basically a way to Think Through problems backwards so if you let's say you wanted to solve a common thing that people ask which is you know how do I be successful um or how do I be happy in life and there might be like a thousand different answers to that question but what Munger would do is is in order to get to the answer faster he would invert right why does Bill Gates say he goes from A to Z faster than anyone he's has the best 30 second brain of anyone it's because munger's default way of problem solving is to invert and so he'll say instead of figuring out how to be happy let me just figure out what is the sure Surefire path to misery and he literally wrote it out like I can read you the answer what he said is the Sure Fire path to misery or what what what did he say uh okay so his his prescri he he actually did a talk and he calls this say prescription for misery so he says um what a be what a beautiful line by the way is that beautiful language or what it is it's wonderful and he says um in you know number one ingesting chemicals to alter your mood or perception so if you rely on chemicals to change your mood eventually this leads to misery this is like you know alcoholism or like sort of like over stimulation whatnot um number two is Envy uh he has this great quote which is the world is not people think the world is driven by greed it's actually driven by Envy uh he goes um you know I'm lucky that you know I'm an old man now and I've conquered my Envy I don't give a damn what anybody else has I don't want one anybody else has and I don't care what they have uh but most people are not like that for most people it drives them up the walls if they see that the neighbor has a nicer car or that their friend has a higher paying job or that their cooworker gets promoted they didn't even want it in the first place but as soon as somebody else has it Envy kicks in and it drives them it drives you know so much of their behavior and so number two of the prescription for for misery is Envy third related is resentment if uh if your joy goes down when other people's Joy goes up that is a Surefire way to have a miserable life so those are three that he stole from somebody else and he saids I'd like to add my four on top of that he says um number four be unreliable uh if you are unre unreliable you will be distrusted by all those who matter and that you might be a mighty fine Turtle but you will be outrun by hordes of mediocre turtles if you are unreliable and even some turtles that are on crutches so it's like this idea that uh you know availability is the best ability that that if you are unreliable it sort of cancels out any talent that you have that one hit home for me because as you know I am a bit of an unreliable person and I've have paid the price for that in many many times yeah hey by the way should we bring up that uh MFM podcast meeting that you missed yesterday yeah just was on a different call and forgot about it and so these things happen and it is a penalty I pay it is part of my prescription for misery um here's the next one so he says another number five is learn only from your own experience and your own uh you know trials basically um if you decide that your firstand experience is your only way to figure out good versus bad and you're not going to learn from other living and dead people uh that is a Surefire way to misery because you will you will learn much slower than than somebody who who learns the other way um next one he goes when hit with adversity go down and stay down that's another prescription for misery is to not bounce back from adversity the INE the the inevitable and unavoidable blows of life and the last one he goes don't be objective stay stuck in your ways hold on to your initial ideas your most loved ideas hold them with a death grip and that is his final prescription for misery is to uh to never change your mind in light of new facts my um of those that you mentioned my biggest weaknesses are Envy so this pod is fun for you and I to do sometimes it creates a lot of Envy because have all these amazing people on here or or if it's just you and I like Sean just did great uh Sam didn't do as good or uh if we have all these amazing people on and you start talking to them and you're like huh I'm just as smart as this guy but this guy how do you know because when you ask how old are you that's the that's the trigger of like I'm feeling terrible can you really just do the finishing blow and tell me that you're two years younger than me yeah like we have so many and every once in a while there are people uh who I'm like yeah you're just better so Zillo people's houses after you uh after you see them that's not really nothing good happens on the end of a Zillow so I have um I've got I I read I read a lot and I I like reading biographies and whenever I read a biography I do sort of what I did up here where I write down like let's say it's a business biography I'll write down the years and I'll make notes of interesting things that happened to that person in that year and then if it involves a dollar amount I'll write the dollar amount and then in one sell over I'll say what's that dollar amount in today's numbers and then I'll say how old were they and so I'm like reverse engineering different people's lives but you know what I'm really doing I'm comparing myself to yeah of course I'm comparing myself to them you're running that race except for you're not Usain Bolt you're Tyson Gay and you're watching Usain Bolt in front of you and I justify it by saying uh uh like if I read someone and I am better off than they than they are uh I say great I'm doing better than them and they ended up wonderfully I'm going to end up wonderfully or if they're kicking my ass at my age I just think mother [ __ ] this sucks I got to give you credit for your honesty and vulnerability because you're being honest and vulnerable admitting this but I do not advise anybody follow this game plan this is a recipe fory not saying that this is I'm not saying this is helpful I'm just admitting and and the last thing that I sort of suck at is being bendable what what was the last one what did how did he Des he's like you know um don't be objective uh don't change your don't change your mind you know stay stuck in your way stay stuck in hold on to those Initial Ideas you had before these new new facts and circumstances came out yeah I I you know I uh I try to think of myself as bendable but I could work on that for sure the ones that I uh struggle with out of this are the unreliable one for sure and then um maybe Envy as second one I think that's probably like number two I think I'm pretty good on all these other ones that's interesting I would I I I wouldn't have thought by the way of you as an envious person I think that's a hard one to kick uh you know I don't think I'm like let's say uh terrible at it but it's definitely there it's not something that I could be like yeah I have conquered that mountain no no no I'm still somewhere on that mountain hey do you know what the uh what I think it's the 61th Commandment is thou sh not Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife right right don't be jealous don't be jealous my friend so if I said this joke it's going to get me in trouble with at least five people at minimum in my life so I'm just going to not make this joke all right so um I want to give you some examples of the invert principle because I think this is one of the most important ones so when he was a military meteorologist it's World War II his job is to keep pilot safe and he's like okay uh what What's everything I need to know about pilot safety and he's like you know there's like seven textbooks about everything a pilot needs to know and then instead he's like no no no okay let's work backwards what are the most likely causes of of crashes or in for pilots and he went and studied that way simpler answer he's like okay I just need to be able to predict snow ice and fog really well as a military meteorologist those three if I can avoid if I can get my Pilots out of the way of those three uh I can ignore everything else because those three are the the real killers and let me like so he inverted in order to like do his job let me tell you another example of this when I was in college um I got picked as part of some like thing called chyos that was like uhr top College startups in the country honestly it was like worse than Forbes 30 under 30 in terms of like credibility literally if you signed up you won and um even better if you signed up you won and then you you uh made friends with the person they would take you on this all expenses paid trip to China for a week to go meet uh Jack ma the CEO of Alibaba or the founder of Alibaba and so we go I get picked on this trip I go fly to China I don't even know what Alibaba is we go to their headquarters I'm like holy [ __ ] this is like eBay for China or something this is crazy and uh we get a sit down meeting with the CEO this guy's like one of the most powerful people in China and somebody as you know we got to ask questions one of the kids ask you know the S simpleton question like you know what's your advice you know I want to be successful what's your advice like what are what are the keys to success from your experience and um and he says uh you know I was obsessed with this question also what are the keys to success what is the blueprint for success and I talked to 100 successful people and I got a 100 different Blueprints and I thought thought well that doesn't really help and this is Jack uh this was actually a guy named David we I think is his name he was the current CEO at the time he was the one answering this part and he goes um he goes every success is different it's its own little unique snowflake but every failure is the same and we were like you know we lean in and you know he had his answer and his answer I don't think is actually the right answer but for this but like he goes um it like tied into the Alibaba story and he goes every every every big company that that eventually fails so his his answer was like not how to be successful but how do you not screw it up once you're a big company which was the problem they were having he goes too much money too much technology and too many people and so he tells a story about like how they were going to compete with um with Google and with eBay when they were coming to China and he's like we needed to invent our version of Google AdWords and he goes Jack ma said cool you get um I think it was like 125 people he's like 125 people this is like going to be a huge part of the business Google has 2,000 people working on this he goes did I stutter you get 12 to 15 people uh you're going to work um he's like we need some office space uh you know give us like a couple floors of the office or whatever he's like you're going to work out of my old apartment he's like your old apartment we need a proper office he goes I started Alibaba in that apartment I think it'll work and he goes uh technology is like you know we're going to need this many servers we should get the best stuff uh and you know we need this much but let's have double that for redundancy in case you know the servers go down we don't want to lose anything he goes if I give you redundant servers you're going to design a system that goes down I'm going to give you only the servers you need and in fact uh you go get go get used servers so it can run on even shitty servers and you know he sort of David goggin them that was like the story that he told about like and they they eventually did it they pulled it off but I wonder if that guy found that inspiring at first or like what the [ __ ] Jack it was definitely like a [ __ ] you man come on but uh you know when it all works out then you can tell this great story um basos has a simple inversion too they were like you know Jeff Tech you're you're you know one of the like internet CEOs internet's evolving so fast technolog is always changing what technology Innovations are you most excited for what's going to change about Amazon in 10 years and he goes oh I don't think about that instead I think about what's not going to change he go customers are always going to want the most selection the lowest prices and the fastest delivery and so everything else can change but that's not going to change and so we focus on what's not going to change because we have to change with the times in order to like constantly beat cons customers expectations on delivery speeds low prices and and vast selection and so you know this idea of inversion is so powerful even in my own like life I was telling you like I'm having a bunch of U progress right now with my diet which is great because like you know the scoreboard is currently 3 you know 34 years of no progress and you know like a month of great progress right now well what changed and well I did a bunch of things but but I also actually just inverted so instead of trying to figure out what's the best diet program what's the best workout program exactly how many grams of of this how many milligrams of creatine how many grams of protein how much how much of this instead of trying to like go is it the Paleo keto diet Mediterranean diet what should I be doing it was just the inversion like what's a Surefire way to be fat and that answer was quite simple like I need to eat way more I'm gonna burn um eating shitty foods that are fried and ultr processed um you know right now I eat late at night pretty sure that's a recipe to get fat um you know sitting all day instead of walking for my meetings probably pretty good way to get fat is to sit all day and I just inverted and I was like okay cool I'm just going to walk more I'm gonna you know eat less calories than I consume and I'm gonna um not late night snack because I always eat crappy food when I do that this literally all I changed and like boom like started to get results finally after like you know instead of like being like let me go download 19 hours of Andrew huberman and try to like follow this protocol it's like that wasn't the problem right like that that was the complex solution rather than the the easy inversion that's great um let's do a couple more do you have any other ones that you like here I I have a story he told that I thought was pretty cool let's wrap up with that story all right so he's uh he's teaching a class at some college he goes to like an economics class and he's like um so he has this general idea of you need to learn all the big ideas in a space so he's like I don't know anything about psychology but I figur there's probably 20 Big Ideas in the world of of psychology and I should just like read the books and try to figure out what are your what are the 20 Big Ideas in your space he's like if I know those 20 Big Ideas I'm going to be better than like I'll know more than 98% of people who spent their whole life you know 0% of people including some people who spend their whole life doing this because they're so lost in the weeds and so one of the big Ideas he had was like so he goes into economics same thing what are the Big Ideas in economics everybody knows like economics 101 is the supply demand curve and uh you know basically the the idea is that you know as the you know um you know supply of something goes down the demand will go up or the price will go up similarly if you drop the price of something the demand should go up so like people know this generally about economics is but Charlie has a thing he's like you learned the big idea but then you also how do you make this useful is you need to understand the exceptions to those rules so what is the i before e except after C so he's like how do you understand that okay generally when prices go down demand should go up for that you know the demand for TVs is let's say you know X at $5,000 but if you drop the price of a TV down to $5 there's a lot of people that will buy it and so he's like but what are the exceptions so he goes into this economics class and he goes everybody understands you know when prices go down demand goes everybody says up he says okay fantastic what are the cases where that's not true so let me just put you on the spot as if you're one of the students so what's a case where that's not true where the opposite happens an item that is supposed to uh signal Prestige exactly so hands go up 50 hands go up and they say luxury Goods uh any item where price is a signal for quality or status um and he's like you know this is luxury hand bags and whatnot you know if a Louis Vuitton bag was $2 tomorrow the demand would actually you know briefly go up but then in the long term go down and um he's like so everybody gets that one and he goes what else and now you get crickets right like [ __ ] what else and he goes um he goes any industry where demand is based on bribing the purchaser he goes what he goes yeah there's like many Industries the defense industry uh me many parts of the the medical industry where actually it's a screwed up kind of perverse incentives where companies take profits and they use those to um you know shower you know Goods or or or money or um experiences on buying agents purchasers and um whether that's through advertisement so like I spend a ton of money advertising and that's how I create the demand and if I didn't have any advertising budget I wouldn't be able to create the demand or it's things like the you know um the the military industrial complex where there's like some cronyism where it's like yeah you give me this contract today because in five years you're going to be on my board and your retirement package will be 10 times what you're making in the government and because we all know that that's true because I have so much excess profit you want to reward me with big contracts and actually you want to pay more for these contracts so that we can be this really successful company because it rewards you in the end um and he's like once you realize that that's an exception to this rule you will understand how the world actually works you will understand where the laws of gravity actually break and I just love that story I think it told like it's an interesting Little Nugget business-wise but also the way that capitalism works but it's also shows kind of the way this guy thinks which is this i before e except after C mentality where he goes into any space he tries to speedrun and figure out you know what are the 10 to 20 Big Ideas of your space and then he looks at the exceptions and um you know I did this recently I was I went to Brian Johnson's house and afterwards I was like think about longevity and I was like all right should I be one of these Tech guys that like really [ __ ] cares about longevity like has longevity gonna be my [ __ ] or am I gonna zag and be like longevity overrated and I was like I need to have an opinion and I decided what would Munger say hey Munger lived to be 99 he didn't look like a longevity freak well somebody said this well V said this he goes Buffett and Munger these guys are like in their 90s and uh you know they famously like you know eat McDonald's breakfast every day and you know eat you know M&M's and drink Diet Cokes maybe for show but you know they at least do it they're not sitting there taking metformin and like cold plunging every morning and uh he's like you know it just goes to show how um how important like not being stressed is actually to your health yeah uh because these guys actually were quite low stress in the way that they they lived their life you know SP most of their days reading playing bridge Talking thinking uh very few meetings they didn't sort of like you know stress out about Investments they were Buy and Hold long-term investor type of thing like low stress compared to a lot of uh successful people um but on the longevity thing I was like all right let me go learn what are the 10 Big Ideas in the longevity space and I literally carved out two days and me and Ben all we did was just Deep dive into longevity like I read I read like power skimmed through some books I read I I I was like who are the five like thought leaders and what are their most popular TED talks and like let me go watch those let me go see what these you know what does petera say what does Brian Johnson say what what are like the quotes so what's your takeaway of all of it my takeaway was that the big ideas and this is like somebody who's a big longevity person will will argue with me because I'm going to do the short version of this but the big idea is essentially everybody in Everybody's Health declines we are probably past the age of like the live forever so there's like one big idea which is that if we ever figure out a way way to reverse aging or like minimize cell damage um it's not just going to be this gradual thing like we used to live till 80 then 90 then 100 then 110 120 130 it's going to be like there's going to be a stepf jump once we figure out how to stop cell damage but if you've already had too much damage they're not going to be able to like get you back into your 20s you're going to be like past the point of return and so like the big breakthrough is if you can figure out how to stop sell damage we don't know how to do that yet when that happens there's going to be an age sort of point a Tipping Point where people below that are going to live to like 300 and people above that are still going to live to like 110 and like there's gonna be this big like disper you know polar you know polarity between those two outcomes that's interesting the second interesting thing is like in terms of the Peter AA school of thought of longevity which is not live forever but it's like live a longer Health span so Health span versus lifespan is one big idea and the health span idea is at the end of your life everybody's going to have a marginal decade which is like your last 10 years of life your your health is going to decline pretty dramatically from like being immobile and pain and in pain to like you know really you know not being able to wipe your butt by the end right so it's like that's typically the like bad version of Aging what Peter T and these guys are trying to do is basically push that decade out so if it was going to happen to you from 80 to 90 let's make it from 90 to 100 or if it was gonna happen 90 to 100 let's 100 to 110 and the cost of your today lifestyle in order to affect that final marginal decade I personally was like H not worth it I'm gonna find the 8020 of like healthy things to do that are not so costly like not so painful or hard to follow or like regimented or whatever like I'm not going to forget to live today in order for my age 90 to 100 to be like better um I will take the instant gratification please and so I was like you know my takeaway was basically I don't care about the marginal decade I'm not going to orient my life around that there's an8 20 of like healthier stuff to do that's like h i don't mind switching to that lifestyle I'll do those and then that's good enough for me and if like you know Wonder drugs come out in some point in the future hopefully I'm in time for that cut off that was my conclusion do you think that Buffett is gonna die like next week now that like is this like a you know like an old couple that they die together yeah is that like that very well might happen he uh I think he Buffett announced recently they like I I he's like I I finally found my successor at the age of 92 i' I've found my um all right well that's the Pod before we go if you made it this far Sean I want to tell you the people in the YouTube comments have been making fun of you and I what they are saying that I dress like a serial killer which I don't know what that means entirely or that I now that I'm a father I'm starting to dress like a father or look like an accountant and they're making fun of your hair I don't exactly know what they're making a fun about your hair cuz I think you've got great hair well no I looked at that video and I was like I'm also looking exclusively at my hair in that I had a bad I had a bad hair day in the sense that I wake up roll out of bed I do this podcast right away and I don't even look in the mirror and um dude I'm like the hairiest guy on earth like I got hair on my [ __ ] Palms like I'm like a you know like a a gorilla and somehow I think I'm losing kind of some hair in the front I'm getting a little light and uh people were like yo he's got to start taking um whatever the drug is called I forgot what it is but like so to all the commenters go f yourselves right we're just doing our thing well I don't care what other people think of me unless it's related to my looks or my intelligence and um so I did go ahead and and and wet the hair a little bit today and uh you know try to try to Spruce it up it does hurt my feelings too sometimes if I'm being honest but besides that you're gonna hear me say oh I don't read the comments it doesn't bother me hey but you know what's what's working sha P my little Gary ve branding pivot is kind of working in the comments every day they're like sha P sha P for president and uh right now we're a small but loyal Army I don't think anyone said sha B for president there's a small but loyal Army there's as they said in Arrested Development there's tens of us out there and uh but but it is from that small base that we shall grow Sean P it is all right that's the [Music] pod

[Music] um well I guess we're live pom do you do do people ever introduce you by your real full name are you just are you are you pomp at all times um yeah some people do but uh people get offended if I go to a conference and I introduce myself as Anthony and then later they're like wait you're poomp like who knows you as Anthony like well that is you know my name my my parents didn't name me that well then then we're going to keep you as pomp we have pomp here pomp you've been on the Pod a handful of times and we've talked about you a handful of times and we've been on your pot a handful of times and so it's nice to have you back congratulations on on new family member uh and you're here recently after doing it so we appreciate that yeah of course just uh just three dads hanging out on the internet who who could have guessed I had a good uh joke that I didn't get to do the other day when Sam Alman was in the news and then like it's like Jack Altman comes out and says something and then Max Altman comes out and says something then his sister Annie Altman comes I'm like how many [ __ ] altans are there there's more Altman than Panos now what's happening here because I feel like you have like brothers coming out the woodwork as well do you feel that your um you know your your sibling dominance is threatened in any way by the Altman right now I did see people making that joke and I did Google how many Alman there are and they are not more alond than Pomano so we're safe for the moment what um I don't even know how to describe you so I think a lot of our listeners will know who you are so we don't have to spend that much time but like you started out as like kind of a one- trick pony you're just basically the guy on Twitter who talked about Bitcoin but now you've evolved significantly beyond that so you've got like the pp media Empire but then you've also like started I don't even know how many businesses many though hold on Sam C can we do an analogy um you know pump going from Bitcoin laser eyes to real estate and all kinds of other [ __ ] that he's doing now is it uh is this Justin Timberlake from in sync now going solo Justin Timberlake you know what's the what's the right analogy here who who has made such a transition such a life pivot like this is there anyone that's done this in Hollywood well here's the thing is uh it's not really a pivot if you kind of expand out off of the internet right so if you think about I started my career building companies then I went and I worked at Facebook uh then I started investing and once I was inves that's really where kind of the Bitcoin stuff happened um but even the stuff on the internet I work directly with you know Mark Zuckerberg Cheryl Samberg for a short period of time at Facebook when they were trying to figure out how do they grow their audiences on Facebook I remember early on when [ __ ] Jerry the Instagram account they were trying to go from Instagram and figure out what's their Facebook strategy and so the reason why I say that is like I don't know think of like a Kim Kardashian she goes from like sex tape to reality TV star to like entrepreneur billionaire to now like Criminal Justice Reform to I think she's going to be president of the United States one day uh and you look at that and you're like actually the same thing that makes the sex tape go viral get you elected to be president today so like in some ways it's actually the exact same skill set just you know packaged up in a different way and with different Ambitions or or aspirations you have this really good job of like brute forcing yourself into like interesting networking opportunities so like I feel like I think Sean is actually better than this than I am but like I just hang out with a small crew of just like internet nerds you've done a really good job of like meeting actual big shots I think right I mean like you I don't even know all the people you know but you were telling me how you met Julian Robertson who's the guy who started tiger man or is it tiger management tiger management but you you actually like you and then you just you weren't trying to but you just name dropped Zuck and I think you've worked for Snapchat and hung out with uh Evan a bunch you you've done a really good job of like meeting all these like crazy Fascinating People people you know what I mean yeah I mean I think it's just like if you're curious person uh other curious people want to be around those types of folks and then also uh I probably more so than many of my friends say yes to Opportunities um even when it's not very clear like what is the purpose for doing this um and so if you do that enough times like it's just kind of like shots on goal like you will meet some of these fascinating or successful people uh but each one of them is very different I mean Julian Robertson that story is um Mark uh mark who uh started Morgan Creek Capital Management uh we did a joint venture with him to uh raise a couple Venture Capital funds and Mark was this former CIO of the UNCC endowment back in their late 1990s early 2000s and at that time Julian Robertson was kind of like in his Heyday right this was like hedge funds were really getting off the ground Mark yuso and UNCC had a really big hand in getting uh endowments specifically to invest in these hedge funds uh and Julian Robertson was on his board so that's how Mark and Julian met now as Mark would tell the story uh eventually Julian was like Hey this kid Chase Coleman who now runs tiger Global he's leaving I'm gonna give him some money and he sent him down to go talk to Mark and Mark gave like the sixth and seventh million dollar to Chase Coleman to start tiger Global now when you look at that you're like okay Mark yuso and Julian Robertson had known each other for 20 or 30 years and I think it was 2019 Mark calls me up one day and he's like hey Now's the Time like we're gon to go meet a bunch of like the legends of Wall Street um and one of them was Julian Julian was actually the first stop of the day and so uh the things I remember from it is like one you kind of feel like you're going to meet a legend so like more so than usual you're like nervous but excited um and we walk in and he's had the same office for a number of years uh he had three secretaries which I thought first of all is just like that's baller they all sat outside his office and like each had different responsibilities so I was like okay like that's uh that's different and mind you Julian at this point is I think like he's definitely in his 80s and so uh we go into to see him and he sits down uh kind of in like this like almost like living room area in his office and he was the single most curious Legend of Wall Street I've ever met he sat with us for an hour and just kept berading me with questions and and just trying to actually understand Bitcoin and blockchain technology and all these things and you're just like man this guy does not have to be here right now he does not have to be doing this stuff like he is Rich on rich on rich and he's also like pretty old he's got to know that like he doesn't have another 50 years to live but he's sitting here trying to learn and so about halfway through the conversation all of a sudden you could see like the proverbial like light bulb goes off in his head and he just sits back in his couch and looks up at the ceiling and like starts talking to the ceiling and I remember being like uh damn am I boring like did I lose him and he had a microphone in the ceiling and a speaker so he could talk directly out to the three like assistants and he basically just started asking like hey send so and so in here like go find this whatever and I was like this guy like built like Jarvis in his office like way before anyone else has this he is absolutely a legend so it was a really cool experience uh unfortunately he passed away but uh but things like that are just you know once in a lifetime opportunities that are that are prequel I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay align no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases hopspot grow better and what I know about Julian and and maybe Sean I don't know if if this guy if you ever researched this guy so I'll explain to you but also the listener but Julian uh he was it it was called tiger right I mean it was just tiger management so he started like tiger which was revolutionary and made him worth I don't even know how many billions it was revolutionary why because what what did they do differently they made good Investments or did they actually do something different he's one of he's one of like the very first like true hedge funds right like he he basically was hey I'm not just going to do like value investing like I'm I'm a true hedge fund um and I think that he had like a lot of what we all look at on the internet today we're like oh that person is doing something interesting it was different he had high conviction and he ended up being right and so he was able to gather a lot of assets he was able to drive a pretty good return um and he did it at a time where this whole concept of like hedging or like going long and short wasn't necessarily the traditional way of investing and so I don't know if they actually consider him like the Godfather of hedge funds but he basically could be considered that um and then you know the lore of Julian kind of expanded even more when a bunch of people who worked for him left he would seed them and when he would seed them to get them off the ground those guys now known as tiger cubs became very successful tiger Global probably being the most successful and so it was like hey he was good as an investor but he was even better at like a talent uh um you know kind of identifier and then seting these people to create these great firms tiger cubs is like PayPal Mafia basically of Finance but it's way bigger so so Google tiger cubs Finance Wikipedia and you can just go to the Wikipedia page but they have sections where it's called tiger cubs tiger Grand Cubs and tiger great grand Cubs and it's literally it looks like if I'm just scrolling through it looks like a 100 plus names and I guess it's he he found these guys and he because of his culture and because of kind of his Vibe they've all kind of taken a little bit a little bit of them and it's some of the biggest names like including that guy uh what was the guy named Bill who had like that who like brought down the economy was it a he like unplugged he unplugged Wall Street accidentally he like tripped over the cord and unplugged it yeah yeah he like brought down the economy like through a couple bad bets and then there's like Chase Coleman who is worth I don't know2 billion dollar who has tiger man who what was it called I'm getting all the names wrong tiger uh and then you have like cotor uh I can't even say these names these are all names at like juicy oh wow this guy's prolific man he started Gucci C these are no I know what you're saying it's a word you've only read you've never had to say out loud like you know yeah it's embarrassing and I was like I just reading this word I don't know what the hell is this what's her name I have no idea how do you say this it's the words that you accelerate through you just say them really quickly and hope no one noticed that you mispronounce them what uh what attributes do you think other than curiosity did he have that kind of spread to all these other guys who have done for example Chase Coleman's an interesting one because you can't really like if you Googled Chase Coleman the guy's worth I think 15 billion something in that range there's like four pictures of him on the internet uh like what and so these like mysterious guys are always they're always fascinating what attributes do you think some of these people have that started with Julian yeah so obviously I met Julian there's a bunch of other folks that I've met over the years uh that would kind of fall similar to Julian and usually it is not uh unfortunately in a situation where I'm like hey I just want to learn from you you're usually going to like ask them for something whether it's for money for an introduction or whatever so like the power Dynamic is definitely off and it'd be weird to like sit there like hey by the way now that the pitch is over like let me Grill you for 30 minutes um but in those conversations what you basically find is like they're all very very curious two is like these guys just have like brass balls right like I don't even know how to describe it other than that they are willing to just make insane bets at times when other people are not you know another person that maybe doesn't get the same fame or recognition as Julian but I put up there as one of the best investors over the last 50 years is Bill Miller and you know Bill in the late 90s people were giving him [ __ ] because he said he was a value investor but he started to buy tech stocks and so obviously Tech exploded he was outperforming everybody uh there's a book that I recently read where he was the only investor to outperform the S&P 500 for 10 years straight uh in the 90s and so everyone was like you're not a real value investor and like first of all like it's stupid to be like oh you don't you're you're results don't count because like you didn't actually do it the way you said you were going to do it um but Amazon was one of his big bets and so Amazon crashes like 90% in the dotcom crash bill just backs up the truck and buys more and I think at one point he was the single largest outside shareholder of Amazon and owned like 15% and so you look at that you're like okay one like you have to like find Amazon two then you have to like not get scared when it drops like 80 90% And then three is even if you're not scared you then have to like hold your nose and put way more money in to buy all of this extra like equity and so I think that is a common theme it's just like conviction and and like the ability to just bet over and over again regardless of what's happening and then the last one is like these dudes are junkies man they're obsessed I almost think of it like a kind of a gym rat they not only are curious but like they do the work and so in that book about Bill Miller they talk about he uh was in Baltimore and he had uh seats behind a home plate for the Baltimore Orioles and heed used to bring research reports and read them in the stands in between Innings and it's just like like okay nerd right like like that's insane but also like that's why you end up owning 15% of Amazon is because like you did the work it doesn't happen by accident and so I think that like that's just a great example of all of these folks who've been super successful those are common themes that they all share that's intimidating I think right like to hear the story it's like what when I hear that I get I my re by there's no more intimidated phrase then that's intimidating I think right I'm scared right guys um no you're right and also I think the hard part is is the the line between genius and idiot is so so thin it's like oh am I Bill Miller backing up the truck uh you know when Amazon crashed 90% or am I just a [ __ ] idiot putting all my money into a loser that like is showing it's a loser right now and you know that uh you know the history of is told years later and so I think that's the the hard part is you have to have not just conviction in the investment you have to have conviction in yourself that I despite the market conditions despite the current results right now am able to correctly differentiate between a winner and a loser um if you don't have that conviction in yourself you can't even make you can't even have the conviction in an investment to pull that off yeah you're basically saying I'm smarter than everyone else right like everyone else is selling this thing yeah and I'm going to go buy it and like I mean again that's why they call them you know kind of like the Masters of the Universe in the hedge fund world is like the people who end up making a lot of money they actually seem to be smarter than everyone else now how many of those are there well there's way less than the number of people who claim to be you know those Masters of the Universe and that's I think Sean like the difference between the fools and the Geniuses well I'll tell a story that's that's like that my uh my friend was in he's in real estate and he was around he was making his fortune early Fortune he was like in his mid 20s um 2006 2007 and then 2008 happens and you know he's gone from zero to you know $25 million in like two three years thinks he's you know super smart and 2008 happens and he described it later he's like I he's like oh there was like a tunnel and uh everyone was running out like there was a fire on the other side of the tunnel and um they were running out and they were like here take this and I was like wow they're just giving me this this is amazing this is way like this price is fantastic fting is that I just kept marching forward and everybody else was running away screaming fire and handing me their their assets on the way out and um yeah it turns out I should have ran away from the fire because he lost everything in that 08 crash now it's that same you know that same feeling would be there at the dot crash everybody's yelling fire running away selling things for pennies on the dollar and you know the difference I think ultimately comes down to a do you uh can you can you tell yourself why you were buying something when everybody else is selling do you have a belief in this right like um you know I heard somebody say once I had somebody else who made a fortune during the dot crash and she goes um she goes yeah it was amazing everything was on sale it was Black Friday everything was 80% off I couldn't believe it the best companies in the world were 80% off and I don't know if they were going to return back to where they were then but I just knew these are still the best companies in the world and uh you know they're now 80% off and and so you know I think that there's there's you hear stories on both sides and I think you got to be careful that uh you know you don't want to be the guy running into the fire and how do you differentiate I think you have to have like some ground truth that you believe that uh that you you're willing to stand on you're willing to lose on you're willing to look back and say uh I'm okay if I'm wrong on this I'm willing to lose the money I lost if I if it turns out that this this idea was incorrect but when you guys hear those stories is this like one of those things where you're watching a UFC fight and you're a little drunk and you're like you know I think I could maybe get a lucky punch and and compete you know what I mean or do you guys hear this and you're like I'm just not in the same league or I don't even want to be do you know what I mean like do do you what's your reaction when you hear the stories I mean I think it just depends on like this quotequote circle of competence right you know if you look back there's only one time in my life where I've had the conviction felt like I did the work and like really backed up the truck and that was the Bitcoin stuff and Bitcoin had gone from a th000 to 20,000 in uh 2017 it crashed down to like 3,200 bucks and I went on National Television I was like basically you guys are idiots like this thing is going to come flying back we're buying you know blah blah blah whatever uh we actually one of my favorite memories that's kind of gotten like lost in uh in the internet archives is we issued a million-dollar bet to anyone on Wall Street and we were like we'll take Bitcoin you take any other asset like just pick anything over the next 10 years if you beat us like you get a million bucks if Bitcoin op performance we get a million bucks and no one took it and so at some point you're just like okay that's enough of a sign that like people may not have conviction but they also like know the person not to bet against and I think like that's something in UFC is like you may look at like a UFC card and you're like okay I think I know who's gonna win like these five you know matches but that one match I think I know who's gonna win but I'm not gonna bet against the other person so I'm G like sit that one out I feel like uh a lot of times there's that level of conviction across the market and so Amazon you know people knew it was like a pretty good company but no one had the conviction to buy same thing with Bitcoin when it crashed like everyone was like I think this is interesting but like I don't have the conviction to buy so really it's less of a leap sometimes than than people realize um but again I've been doing this now for a decade there's one time I can think of that I was like oh yeah I think I actually know something everyone else doesn't any other time I've even tried to think that way I'm like I'm probably gonna lose all my money I should just you know sit sit down yeah yeah I think that's a good point you have to identify that these things shouldn't be like once every month you have this this Grand new conviction bet it's like maybe once in a decade that you you you see something that that is so nonconsensus but you believe in um it's also hilarious did anybody consider taking you up on that deal where they just like uh somebody walked into tiger they're like uh sir um Tony Pompano has has offered a million dooll bet and they're like I don't know Tony uh I'm out on that did anybody even like did it register like what what happened you want to know like CNBC wrote an article about it like it it was like it was definitely out there right but here's the funny part about the whole thing the people who were like even considering it were like all the like fools that just wanted like media coverage so they were like trying to come up with these like weird uh um you know aspects of the deal like okay I'll take your bet but we have to take the return divided by two times it by like the number of times I jump on my head you know and then also I get a multiply and we're just like dude you're way too smart for us obviously like we just want to straight up bet uh if you're interested in that let us know yeah also they could have perfectly hedged that bet I think um if they just bought Bitcoin in addition to making the BET right so like yeah I like to think we issued the BET before the smart people started paying attention so like yeah we were good or somebody would have figured out how to definitely beat us on were you inspired by the Warren Buffett million dooll S&P 500 bet is that the is that what where you took of course I think that that was one of the smartest things that he's done like buff Buffett's interesting because uh a lot of the advice that he gives I think is you know pretty solid you know circle of competence being one um you know uh kind of value investing like like all these things that were kind of talking about here uh I I think uh very much draws back to Buffett and then obviously Graham and Dodd and all these guys but uh he also is like a master marketer like Warren Buffett was the original Finance influencer right and I've joked a million times that if he was today Buffett in his 30s he'd have a substack a Twitter account a podcast he'd be streaming on Tik Tok like doing all this stuff um and so he understood how to like Leverage the tools he had at the time with the media and so he didn't need to do it but a way to really continue to to drive like the lore of Warren Buffett is like issue the BET and say no hedge fund manager can beat the S&P over like a decade or whatever we just talked about in the 90s only Bill Miller did it right so it's very hard there was like a period where I remember I was like beating myself up even over this podcast where I was like am I gonna be a content creator or or am I gonna be a businessman who actually does the damn thing and I started reading you know I read a lot of biog biographies and I actually started thinking about it differently and you realize that a lot of these great people whether in business or not they actually had newsletters and they like I remember um what's the guy's name uh chamath chamath like recently came out with like a newsletter and I remember thinking like why the hell does this guy need to do this why is he doing this paid newsletter but then uh like Warren Buffett his annual letters were basically newsletters I mean he he wrote them as such and then like I remember reading about like Ben Franklin Ben Franklin had a newspaper and he actually wrote constantly about this I'm reading about George Washington George Washington constantly wrote editorials or Bill Amman does this you know where he he's like he uses Twitter now but before that he had some other things and I remember thinking like no actually like some of these greats who are great business people also are content producers uh you know maybe they're not that's not their income Source but they they really are like wonderful content people you know what I'm talking about well I I like how you just used content producer content producer is is nice that's that's better than content creator which is better than influencer actually I think that's all that we need guys is like you just laid out you're like do I want to be a content creator like an influencer or a businessman and I think we actually just need to be content man like I think we need to like we just need to level up the phrase so that we don't sound like little [ __ ] when we uh like oh I'm I'm a I'm a content creator who tweets all day it's like no no no you're a businessman I'm a Content man we're just couple couple of men couple of producers well I remember one time we had this guest on and Sean asked this particular guest this particular guest created courses and Shawn said something where Shawn goes you know I create courses too and sometimes I feel like a fraud because if I'm so good at this instead of teaching it I should just go and do it and I thought that was a really good question and this question really offended this person but Sean you didn't mean it to offend this person and and so I wasn't I didn't think that they should have been upset but I also have that same like I'm like well that's am I a fraud but then you start thinking about it well you know Warren Buffett actually t a Dale Carnegie course he actually also taught a finance course I forget at which university uh but it's actually common that some of these people are teaching are creating and that has kind of helped me like feel like less you know like less embarrassed sometimes about what I do I I think that you can go through tons of entrepreneurs you can go through tons of uh you know kind of financial managers uh this is very very common and there's a question of if you can't teach it do you actually understand understand it right like like it's almost like a flip side to it but if you really kind of just zoom out you're like okay what is all this content stuff I've been there right people would be like oh uh he has a podcast and I used to be like cringe it was like somebody like stabbed me in the stomach and twisted it when they would introduce me that way right and I'm like you are disrespecting all this other work that I did to say that I have a podcast like yes I have a podcast but also like I wear shoes are you g to introduce me as like oh Pop Weare shoes and so I remember uh kind of going back and like thinking about like dude it's it's it's it's like calling um milk cat food you know what I mean cat food yeah it's like that's not totally fair so but but what what you eventually realize is like it's just marketing right at the end of the day like it really is just marketing and uh whether it's Twitter whether it's podcast whatever the people who tend to be good at it don't think of it and like sit down and like create a marketing calendar like I don't know they're like taking a poop and they pull out their phone they start tweeting like random things and like they go viral right at the end of the day it's just marketing and so in some weird way uh maybe we all shouldn't like be ashamed or cringe when people say that stuff like if you're better known for how good you are at marketing like maybe that's actually telling you something right and so I think it's uh we all have that as almost like a uh something that eats at us or it's like an insecurity but whatever who cares like if they could do it they'd do it themselves yeah to clarify Sam I never said fraud fraud means one thing I said I feel like a little [ __ ] when I do courses and there's a big difference fraud means you're misrepresenting yourself a little [ __ ] means you're representing yourself as a little [ __ ] and and you have to ask yourself is that accurate or is that not accurate and um yeah that's how I felt sometimes I felt like a little [ __ ] for for doing courses when I like should should I be doing something else with my time this is I like to teach but uh but maybe maybe that's like you know not the best use of time sorry I I paraphrased that incorrectly I was trying to I I I actually think I made you sound better but you know be honest I'd rather be honest okay pomp you brought some ideas for us you know that this is the idea podcast um you brought some ideas let's rattle them off so uh start with number one what ideas and Trends or opportunities do you see right now in the market yeah so this uh this first one is one that we're actually doing um so I've thought a lot about it housing affordability is the worst that's been in uh this Century um we continue to see people are worried like hey I want to buy a house should I rent should I buy what are interest rates going to do all these different things but there's no dominant voice in terms of news commentary and data um and so we started a company called resi club uh the idea really in the beginning is just go educate people about what is happening and so uh I'm not an expert on residential real estate uh I don't know that many other experts on residential real estate um so we were able to partner up with a gentleman named Lance Lambert uh Lance was the real estate editor at Fortune Magazine so he's like quotequote legit right's got 75,000 followers on Twitter a lot of people in the industry all follow him and we basically just said to him like look man we want to go build the dominant platform in residential real estate coverage why don't we do it together we know how to scale things we know how to grow this stuff and monetize you know how the content you are the expert um and so let's partner up and so we've gone ahead we've got started it's about two months old um and you know I love these types of businesses because they kind of look stupid almost in the beginning they're like oh you guys just like created a newsletter like yeah that's exactly what we did and then it turns into like a media and then it turns into a data product and then like I don't know 10 years from now are we going to have the information where we can go and Seed like you know General Contractors and different markets to actually build affordable housing like maybe and so you start with this small little thing that you can build profitably and you don't have to raise money or or kind of do anything where there's these you know huge expectations but as you grow the business you can increase your ambition over time and so I think a lot of people start with like massive ambition like let's go to Mars and sure there are some companies where that definitely Mak sense but for businesses like this it's just like hey there's a problem and around housing affordability a lot of people aren't talking about it we should have more people talking about it and then we'll figure out how big it can get and how ambitious we can be over time but we kind of earn the right to go do that and so that's what we're doing how much did you fund it with um way less than people would think uh we were profitable within the first month uh and so we actually wouldn't have even need to put money into the bank account but I think we put $100,000 uh to get started and never touched it because basically you know within the first week we were profit and the market for this is is it Brokers real estate agents that want to pay for this or you look at investors or is it the average person who might be you know on Zillow looking for a home yeah so the beauty of residential real estate is it's the largest asset class in the world but none of us who are like oh we're so smart we're like business people we're Finance people we have podcasts we never think about residential real estate as like the largest asset class in the world we're like oh stocks or crypto or bonds or whatever and so what you end up getting is it's a very Niche thing in that it's residential real estate but it's a very big thing in that it's the largest asset class in the world and so what that involves is home builders it involves real estate agents it involves people who want to buy or sell homes it involves uh people who are doing mortgages like lenders Etc so there's a huge uh kind of ecosystem of folks who all need to be aware of what's happening in this industry and so it's one of these great businesses where it's n it's like small and specific but also large and Broad at the same time and I think you're doing it why so I'm looking at your pay wall and you're saying that um like basically you get access to a Regional Housing tracker data like some type of data set I think that's smart who is was it just Lance because it looks like Lance is doing all of the writing is he also somehow aggregating all this data as well so Lance is uh think of him as like the editor-in-chief like like this guy is lights out right and so as soon as he was like interested I was like oh I'm what do we need to do how do we like run through brick walls to like get to work with you um so it's very much like go find partners that you like look up to and want to learn from Etc um and he does all of the content today eventually there will be an entire team but I think one of the big lessons that I've learned over the last you know five or six years of kind of like playing on the internet and building these businesses is you just don't need that much and yes we have an advantage I've got a big audience right Lance's been doing this for a long time and and really understands how to create content and kind of write articles and and interview people Etc but at the end of the day we've now created multiple businesses like this where we start with like two or three people and you can run for six or 12 months and get them profitable with serious cash flow and then you start to hire a team salese other editorial folks Etc can I give you a critique yeah I think this is awesome I love the real deal uh which is the a real estate blog your your premium Pro Plan is $150 a year that is so stupid man why aren't you charging way more it's so hard to do stuff on $150 a year yeah we we eventually like for for sure we'll increase the price but if you think about um a lot of times like even uh I'll give you another example so Barry at times is a uh kind of daily news for Tech business and finance um and started as an email and when you're building these businesses you basically have a choice you can like have a high CPM and be okay with not selling out 100% of the ads sometimes or you can have a lower CPM and just sell out the ads I tend to always go for like let's sell out all of the ad inventory and build the muscle of being able to do it and you can always raise prices later same thing here with the subscription for resi Club is starting at 150 bucks it's like if you're interested in this and we're actually creating something valuable there is zero friction for you paying 150 bucks a year over time we will increase the price but that's much better and gives us a better signal than let's say we came out with like a, a year and people are like man this is valuable but it's not worth ,000 at least now we know okay we have something that people want it's helpful to them they're not churning and now we got to go and do price Discovery over the next 12 months or so we'll figure out what that price point is um but I'd rather start with a lower price make sure we've got the right product and then raise prices later I like this idea a lot I think it's a really good idea this is like A50 to100 million dollar win bootstrapped I think it's gonna be great uh you know maybe more but like I think that's a very realistic outcome from this but I got to ask you you know it's interesting to see ideas when you're at the end of the idea maze meaning like you figure out like oh this is the opportunity we should go with you're a guy who's got a thousand different opportunities thousand different ideas of what you could go do can you walk me through the idea maze how did you land at this and like what were the kind of like other paths that you considered and you know like for example this is residential why not commercial should it even be real estate or should it be Finance because actually you have a good foothold of finance and I'm sure we haven't talked about this but I am sure that there was a little bit of a walk down in idea maze looking for oh wait what is the real opportunity here and then it all sorts starts to come together you get the right operator you figure out the right idea the right yeah then you go for it 100% so uh this one's actually a great one to talk about this because we actually uh I would call it like a false start we had partnered with somebody else who they were not in residential real estate the way that they cut the market was by geography and so they were very focused on South Florida and so it was like okay we think that there's a massive business to build uh that content first that eventually leads to kind of data products that is in the uh real estate market and when we got started we didn't know a lot of people right and so I went around I talked to a couple people I found someone I said hey they do really good work uh it was a person I really enjoyed kind of working with and and talking to on a day-to-day basis and so we got started but it was very much like small geography all about South Florida and then the idea was like We'll go to like Tampa and then we'll go to like Orlando and then we'll go to Atlanta and then we'll like just go through these geographies and it didn't work for a whole bunch of different reasons uh probably some of it was our fault some of it uh was the other person was you know very focused on like what they wanted to do in terms of the the content that they had already been creating and and uh um so we kind of just were like hey this isn't that this like explosive thing the market isn't like pulling this into existence and so like rather than bang our heads against the wall for the next 10 years together like you had a great thing going before we came along and try to convince you to do this with us like why don't you just keep doing that thing I don't want to like you know hinder your success and your growth uh and then we'll like go back to the drawing board and so that's the second attempt was with this resi club and so you're right that like one there's an idea maze but also uh I think a lot of people don't realize how often there's false starts to these businesses um Nikita beay who is I think friends of all of ours he's talked about this a bunch with consumer social ABS he's like product Market fit is not a single metric like you just know right it's like everything's exploding and you obviously have product Market fit but in both of the apps tbh and gas that he launched and eventually sold to Facebook and then to Discord uh I think he's publicly described many times he would launch it it wouldn't hit they would go back like make a couple changes like launch it again and sometimes he would launch like five six seven eight nine 10 times and then eventually there was the right combination of all these things that work and so there's two ways to do entrepreneurship one is like I'm G to bend the world to my will and like here's the thing that's going to work regardless of what the market tells me I'm going to make it happen uh and then there's like this iterative approach and a lot of these things that I work on are much more iterative uh and so you just have to be really good at like go 100% in run the test as perfectly as possible but be willing to cut bait and try a different combination of the inputs if for some reason it's not exploding in the way that you want it to Sean you got to tell the Nikita story which one just just the the this last one this last thing that he did yeah he was he was telling us as he was building the app and launching it over and over again and renaming it and like what was happen one time they renamed it to one thing and then it like took off in the gay Market he's like all he did was change the name of the app and it appealed to like you know only gay people and then he changed the app name and it went back and it it CH you know changed how the app was going um you know he I think he says something that he's like you know the most important thing for a consumer startup is like you uh develop a machine that will allow you to launch tests like real like High Fidelity tests of your product like that is actually your most important product at the beginning which I kind of agree with but also kind of disagree with I think that's a really good way to do the apps he's trying to do which are like it doesn't work if it doesn't have a k Factor over one right like if it's not viral his apps literally like don't work and then this app was like I don't really care about retention long-term anything like it was like I'm gonna get you in it's going to spam invite your friends and then there's a pay wall and I need like 2% of people to to buy the inapp purchase and if under 2% of people do it this doesn't really like make a lot of money but if I can get two or percent or more this thing will make a few million dollars of profit in the next 90 days and um you know so that worked really well for that but if you go look at how some of the great like consumer products are built they didn't do any of that [ __ ] like Pinterest not like Pinterest was sitting around being like okay I need to create a system where I can launch systematically in high schools over and over again until I get this correct right and uh you know Facebook and Snapchat like they did eventually figure out a way to like roll out and grow that that they did but they didn't have this like thousand shots on goal with different variations trying to get the virality to be just right like I like I think what Nikita is doing is awesome because it's such a different game than one anybody else really was playing however you know his advice is basically like how to build a virus not how to create the next like you know social network and I think people think of him as the genius consumer social network guy and it's like no he's basically built like viruses that goes on team teens phones and uh you know like that that he's very very good at it's like what are you optimizing for right you know if you want to build uh the next great social network like yeah K Factor matters in the beginning but actually what matters more is like what is the 30 6090 day of retention if you want to just like go viral and be on every single you know 14y old's phone in America then the only thing that matters is K Factor right both his apps both of his apps within I don't know a 100 days of getting acquired or 200 days of getting acquired you know shut down and rode off to zero right because they didn't have retention but the one thing I would give him a ton of credit for which I think was really impressive was a he went back to the well what most people don't do is they do a space they become super knowledgeable about it and they get so jaded and have so much scar tissue that even though they are the best equipped person in the world to go back and build in that space again they are so turned off they go become a beginner at something else which I think is a fine life choice to make from like a variety of life but like not optimal from a from like playing the game of Entrepreneurship the second thing is he was in the world of I'm going to build a hit hit social app and the way that a hit social app works is like get a 100 million plus users and then start to make money on ads and like raise Venture Capital do all this when he went back the second time he like broke down the fourth wall of Silicon Valley I was like What if I don't fund this and what if I just like charge a little bit of money and like what if I just make a few million dollars of profit like every every month and like I don't know how long it'll last but I think I can make like whatever you know like five million bucks in in the summer that sounds pretty awesome let me try to do that and nobody nobody in consumer like the mobile gaming guys were like yeah of course like get a bunch of downloads and then charge like you know a small amount and see if you can you know make you know your key metric is arpo but like the cons the mobile gaming guys don't build social apps the social apps guys don't build mobile games the those guys don't build Enterprise sales like people very rarely are able to like rethink the rules of their game and he rethought the rules of the consumer social game and was like I'm gonna build a consumer social app but it's going to have the monetization of a mobile game and I think in basically like a six-month span it made like seven or eight million dollar in in you know gross revenue with like you know uh and you know it was very profitable for him in that period of time then he sold the thing and the you know that that is a very impressive way to like most people can't do that most people can't rewrite the rules of the of their industry of their game there's two things that you made me think of the first is there's a whole group of these people who are like trying to rewrite the rules or think about this differently one of my favorite examples and I don't want to share who it is because I don't know if they're they're okay with it but um they created like a ability to make photos in your Instagram story blurry and basically you would have to pay on Apple pay to like unblur the photo so obviously like all the only fan girls would put it on their Instagram story and it'd be like just blurry enough where people like oh that looks like something I might really like looking at and then they they'd pay like $2 $5 $10 like whatever it was set at and so you're like bootstrapping off of these massive audiences these people already have but it's like a little feature and they don't raise money for it it's just like basically how much money can we generate as quickly as possible and I mean they make a lot of money right and so it works so it is possible speaking of uh folks who go back to the well do you guys know who Brad Jacobs is yeah he created like six billion dollar companies now or something like that the guy he's the goat we're I'm trying to I've been trying to get him on the Pod I've been trying I I can't I can't he's got a book coming out he he'll definitely come on he's got a book coming out so he's 100% going on I can't get in touch with them well we'll talk later but he's 100% going on everyone's podcast because he's got a book coming out which is like the best time to get these guys but uh so about four or five years ago somebody like almost like uh like a back alley drug deal was like check out Brad Jacobs and I was like never heard of him like who's that got on Wikipedia and literally for a week and a half like didn't sleep was just like all over scouring the internet trying to figure out like what obscure podcast did this guy do because he just did it over and over and over again and what he essentially does is he just does rollups like Wayne hazinga is another guy who's like famous for doing this um and what Brad did uh is just figure out a business model figure F out a funding mechanism start winning and then go around and tell everyone like hey I'm going to do the same Playbook and I'm going to win again and then people gave out money so explain what he did so uh one of the things that they did was in the waste industry which also I think Wayne heis Zinga had a had a big one as well um in the waste industry basically they would go and and where he started was he didn't go to Major markets he didn't even go to like what he calls like secondary markets he basically went to like Podunk towns and was like I'm gonna buy the landfill and then once he bought the landfill he was like okay there's like seven companies that all pick trash in the surrounding area and they bring to this landfill and he would just like start like sniper off each one of them he'd buy the first one he'd buy the second one the third one and eventually he'd own all seven of the companies plus the landfill and so he just did this across the country and he would roll it all up that one uh was like I think early 90s was called United Waste Systems um and so he took that company public and it ended up being like a multi-billion dollar outcome he's done that same thing like six or seven times now and so you're just like okay building a billion dollar company's cool cool building two you're like damn like you you've got the the Golden Touch if you do more than five there's like one of you right I think he's done it with uh so he did the waste manage management thing then he did United Rentals which was like renting uh heavy uh like uh dump trucks and and porta-potties and bobcats and things like that then he did it with EXO Logistics I think which is currently public XO which is currently uh a publicly traded company and I think he did it two or three times I mean he's done it many many times I think his book is called how to make a billion dollars or something like that like it's it's a pretty it's a pretty baller title like I'm not coming on my first million um quite literally beneath me you want to know something funny about uh about how he describes himself he's like you know I'm a career CEO serial entrepreneur like he has very much like what you would expect from a guy who's built multiple billion dollar companies but if you Google his name uh you know on LinkedIn how there is like um a uh like a preview of the site on LinkedIn it says Brad Jacobs is an influencer because I think he has like the influencer like categorization on LinkedIn and they just like autofill it but it's like the classic imagine telling Brad Jacobs like ah you're not really like a multi-billion dollar entrepreneur you're just an influencer he' like blow a gasket yeah that's so true that's what it says his first top link on Google Brad Jacobs is an influencer period got him like stop disrespecting that man the reason he's cool is like okay so he lives grge Connecticut he wears like a suit and tie most of the time he's he's he looks like a he looks like a suit and I'm sure he's very professional and a wonderful CEO but if you actually like listen to some of the things he says he's way more of a uh he's way more entrepreneurial than like his picture looks you know what I mean like he's got that he's got that artist Vibe a little bit uh the the guy's the guy's special he's very fascinating but before his book came out and or is coming out he's been really under the radar for how successful he is he's a really fascinating person person yeah the the um one of my favorite activities is like if you're ever reading an article like uh Bloomberg uh does this a lot and um actually the financial times they'll like randomly talk about these like really wealthy people and I'll just immediately you know copy paste Google like hey who is this person and uh recently I did it and um let me see if I can find this guy's name real quick because it was like one of these things where uh as soon as you go down the rabbit hole you're like wow this is like a whole different game um what is this dude's name oh here you go Benny Steins so they call him an Israeli Tycoon but he like got in a bunch of trouble and there's like fraud and I think he maybe even got arrested Etc but like he's in the Commodities game and you're like I've never heard of Benny Steins he sounds like he's built some massive companies but also in the Commodities game like sometimes there's gold in the mine and other times there's a promise of gold in the mine you know type thing and so you're just like how many of these people are out there that are not on the Internet or not well known in the like internet Circle and sure you can go look at the fors 400 you can go look at like all these lists that people put together there's way more people that are completely unknown than I think known and so it does kind of reminds you like you don't you only got to be right once or twice and you can achieve immense amount of wealth or success by doing just like the basic things go buy assets that end up being valuable if if you Google this guy he looks like one of these guys that can like find a pressure point on your neck that makes you like collapse he looks he looks he looks very legitimately like a killer and I researched him as well he was in the IDF so like he's a trained military guy and if you Google him he looks scary he looks like he'll he'll put you to sleep um what other ideas are interesting to you at the moment so uh I'll give you a couple categories there's one that I uh the best name I have for it is like persistent Patrol companies so if you think about one of the big problems that city states and the national government's going to have is like they have to get more money they're broke right and if you're broke you either like cut your cost as much as possible or you go make more money uh they're not going to cut cost so they got to make more money um one of the best examples is in New York City the congestion tax that's one of the few taxes that I'm on board with you're on board okay all right let me explain what it is first and then and then we can debate uh the way it works is like I don't know 9 to5 Monday through Friday if you drive from like outside of Lower Manhattan into Lower Manhattan they charge you like 20 bucks like it's a pretty large tax every single day so it only is charged one time but you can imagine all the cars that are driving from above 59th Street below 59th Street between 9: to5 Monday through Friday and they're getting hit with this $20 tax it's away for the city to raise more money get more income um it's called a congestion tax it's the first one in the United States but this has been happening in Europe and other places for for quite a while so it's not a New Concept it's just new to America they're also considering charging uh people like $1,000 a month or something really high in order to own a car in the city there's all kinds of ideas because it all comes back to this thing like they need more money right that they're broke and over the last couple of years in cities like New York people who were paying a lot in taxes they left like there's the infamous story of David terer he was in New Jersey and he was responsible for 3% of the state's budget in the the taxes he personally paid and he moved to Florida and there's all these articles that were like the state of New Jersey is going to go br because David terer is moving and so I think it was for like some sort of Family Medical situation he moved for a couple years when he moved back the way the story goes is that he called up the state treasurer and was like yo you got 120 million coming to you next year like put into your budget I'm back baby so like wealthy people yeah and it's New Jersey it's not like it's like North Dakota right it's like the state of New Jersey was dependent on this guy for material percentage of uh of their state budget so wealthy people have been moving so my idea is like uh well how are they going to get more Revenue right now a lot of Revenue is derived from like parking tickets or like stupid things where they have humans walking around trying to like catch people doing things they're not supposed to be doing so I think there's going to be an entire rise of businesses that just use computer vision to do the same thing like anything that can be automated will be automated rather than have humans with their lazy eyes walking around just have computers that constantly monitor it so parking tickets is an easy one Fire Marshals like how many times have you gone to an event and it's like Fire Marshall saids 220 people can be here you're like I think there's a thousand people in this uh room right now right so like they can just automate okay you get hit with $500 fine every single time at this event venue Etc um elevators like you can just go through this and see over and over again that computer vision will just become like the persistent eye it's scary like I don't like the idea of this but I do think someone's going to build this technology and it's not going to be the government and so we're likely to see a huge rise of these businesses that Ed what is pretty like standard technology at this point to just like count the number of humans walking into a building and stay on top of it so that the government can generate more Revenue well there's also like in LA don't they have the Mansion tax right like it's like oh if you sell a home for more than $5 million there's just like here's a new tax and they're like what what do these people New York has it too live in small homes like they'll never do it they'll never downsize like we got them we can charge literally anything we want and they're still going to pay it um you know I I I kind of agree with you that that getting this Revenue stream is g to be gon to be important obviously I hate the idea of the like persistent Patrol computers basically finding you for for taking every misstep but um I think you're the root thing you're talking about like how do you help governments make more money is going to be a business opportunity because you're right they uh they do need it there's a competition right now between uh taxes and tipping like when you go to the coffee shop there's literally going to be a competition between is on the bill if it's itemized does the government get more money out of the bill or does the Tipping because we've become this like tipping Society where somebody like pours a Cofe they're like that'll be 15% on top of the bill and so if the government continues to increase sales tax like very much these bills are going to get inflated because it's just everyone's got more hands in the cookie jar so Sean New York has a uh Mansions tax do you want to know what the threshold is in order to pay it no what is it all right so keep in mind I think the average sale of a New York home is like 800,000 the Mansion tax starts at a million dollars so basically like you have a second bedroom mansion yeah so their mansion tax I I think it's uh close to 4% it ranges I think but I think it goes up to 4% so basically if you purchase a two-bedroom apartment in New York City you basically have to say all right here's an additional 40,000 just for buying or is it for selling I don't remember which one but someone pays roughly 2030 $40,000 for a two-bedroom apartment that and so they have it as well in New York City it's pretty wild I mean that's like a $5,000 mortgage payment right like if you're like hey I don't want to pay s $8,000 for a two-bedroom I'm gonna in that buy and I'm gonna have to pay $4500 or $5,000 with eight% interest rates on my mortgage like a million bucks like yeah that you're getting hit with the Mansion tax it's pretty wild but yeah New York has that New York gets you in so many different ways it's a very challenging place to live because of that you live in New York right I do live in New York like what will it take for you to move basically nothing like at this point I'm not going to move um I moved uh and I think that I've come to the realization that I'm willing to pay for the experience like yes the taxes are higher but I feel like the money that I give on those higher taxes is very much uh in exchange for the density of New York City The Experience like uh all of that and so uh to some degree it's like the biggest expense I pay every year but it's because of the quality of life uh or a specific type of quality of life that I want and so I've just come to you know terms with it and like you know stroke the check every year and compared to other cities New York does a half decent job of like making it feel like you're you're getting what you paid for you know you you good Parks subway system whatever but damn it's still challenging particularly I mean you were in Florida for a while I'm in Texas at the moment when I'm thinking about going in New York I'm like golly this changes the math a lot the math changes at a significant amount yeah just close your eyes and don't look yeah all right I got I got one more idea before we go which is uh AI agents I don't know uh I sent you guys the link but this kid I don't know this guy uh Jacob Greenfield we love this we love him I don't know him either but he posts amazing stuff he he immediately is awesome in my book because he posted this yesterday and I was thinking like what we could talk about today um and he basically used these AI agents which like that's all I know about them is they're called AI agents uh but they like go and do these jobs and so he was like all right I'm gonna go have an AI agent that finds opportunities and I'm going to score the opportunities based on like how much money could I make and how difficult would it be to execute and he basically populated this whole list and then he's like but haha I'm gonna create a second AI agent that then goes and looks at all of the opportunities that are high earning potential low difficulty and I'm gonna have them create a plan on how I could actually execute to do that thing and then he's probably going to create like a third AI agent and be like and then I'm going to have them carry out the plans from AI agent number two but it's just like again yes you have to be technical to be able to figure some of the stuff out or or work with technical people but the world is changing at a very rapid pace and what we're seeing is everyone was worried about like the blue collor worker was gonna get automated away like damn it sounds like Jacob is automating away my first million like now all of a sudden no one has listen to the podcast they're just going to get a Excel sheet with like how do I get rich without doing a lot of work and go do those opportunities right so so it's cool to see but um I I do think that there's a lot of things that people are going to figure out here uh of just like how to find better opportunities without having to spend you know thousands of hours doing the research this is awesome this tweet is awesome I'm looking at it now this is very good they are awesome but also like like okay I I like like I think the the it's like one of these things where like the demo shows you what's possible but the demo is not like usable uh in I feel like you know the same way kind of about VR right now like uh every I buy the new VR I buy the new VR every time it comes out and then I put it on and I'm like holy [ __ ] this is amazing I can't wait to show five other people this and then I'm going to put it on the shelf and not touch it for a year like but it it soon this will be like this will be it'll it will solve all the pain points like um you know you used to have to be Tethered to a computer now you don't it used to be where it was really hot and sweaty in there now it's not you used to not be able to see the room when you're there there now you could see through you could see the room like they're improving it one step at a time like for example the things on this list are uh you know like clean energy solutions for shipping innovating fuel Al Alternatives like okay yeah sure Money Maker battery that lasts forever you know cool I got you pop why isn't real estate blog on here not enough money and way too difficult yeah where is real estate blog it didn't make the top 30 so I think the idea of this is really cool but uh you know in practice like if you if somebody sat down was like great I'm going to that thing I'm going to go use that that thing to make it happen I I don't think any of it's like usable at this point I will give you one example that I think is usable so um I think somebody could do this right now I think uh you know somebody who wants to play a different game could go play this game upwork has like I don't know three or four billion dollars of gmv every year of people basically paying for tasks that get done in up and uh I'm pretty sure a huge number of abor tasks and Fiverr tasks are automatable right now or like maybe they're not 100% automated but like you could take that same person use uh you know use AI uh use use um you you use technology in order to be like 10x your output 5x your output so you get just like better leverage operational leverage I think if somebody combined private equity and AI you could go roll up and buy the top profiles on upwork and Fiverr so you basically buy the search juice that these guys have so that they're going to get the top like you know logo design you're going to go get the top jobs because you're the number one rank because you were there since 2013 on Fiverr or whatever and I think you could go buy all of those and then you could put them all under one roof and be like that's wild we're gonna use AI to fulfill a huge number of these um and you can make a lot of money because those little properties on top of Fiverr on top of upwork those are valuable rental properties essentially they go get income every month but now you have a way to get more margin out of that rental inome so I I think already you could buy them at a good price because nobody else is really buying those but on top of that you could probably get some more operational leverage out of it this was the whole idea that like thaso and other Amazon aggregators had was they were GNA like go buy up a bunch of Amazon stores and uh I know somebody who financed a lot of them and his thesis was like if you're the first search result for a very popular product that is like real estate and so it's like location location location like you are the first search result and so you'll constantly get traffic obviously there's platform risk if there's some sort of algorithm change or whatever but they were able to kind of model out that risk um the hard part is like you're dealing in physical Goods in on Amazon and what you're talking about is like you're basically just dealing with software and so there is 100% somebody some obscure place in the world who is like the best Fiverr logo designer right now and they are just like a mid Journey like power user yeah right and so it's like okay uh I used to be able to design X number of logos per month now I can do 100x that and oh you want to give me feedback no problem I'll just change the prompt to make it exactly what you want and I can do it in you know one 100th at the time yeah like that sounds awesome to that person and frankly like that's how the world should work like you should pay the same for the result because you're buying the result not the amount of work and like that person after having figured out how to do it is going to be financially rewarded like we want that Financial or economic system to be exactly how business Works do you uh of all these companies that you're working on how much time are you allocating to each one how many businesses do you have now I don't know how many but let's just call like around 10 um I I think of it uh kind of a like a a 2 by2 Matrix to some degree there are some businesses that are young and need lots of time and then there are uh a lot of companies that are older and don't need as much time the only thing that changes between those two things is uh like fires right so it's like if you look at my day uh it is mostly distributed to the companies that are just getting off the ground we're trying to figure out how to build momentum we're trying to get to profitability we're trying to like figure out the first couple of hires we're trying to like make sure we got the product correct like all those types of things and then uh maybe 20% 15% of my day is like oh we just lost a big customer or there's some like fire to put out with one of the companies that's already pretty mature but after the first I don't know six months like the company works or it doesn't and if it works then actually I'm probably doing the company a disservice if I'm like still meddling in uh the day-to-day like decision- making and Leadership of the business we have somebody who runs the company like they should be the ones to sink or swim uh and I think they appreciate the autonomy to just go do it themselves without you know having me like micromanage them over their shoulder um the only thing that I do do is every week I get a weekly update and frankly like I read them you know I give a little bit of feedback here and there but it's more so for the people who run the company uh because it forces them just to write down you know what do we get done this week and no including myself ever wants to send an update it's like we got nothing done so um that's really the only thing that's like persistent week in week out regardless of the uh the the age of the business how are you balancing the two things of a like buy versus build so I think Sean and Andrew Wilkinson they're toying around the idea of buying parts of companies or wholly owning owning companies that they buy as well as focus of well these one or two things could have outsides returns I should only do those yeah um so buying versus build is like really interesting I've gone back and forth over the years like we've bought a couple of businesses not a lot but but a few um and then we've obviously built a number of them and you know there's a sector right now that I'm looking at um it's in the media space it's very specific type of audience I think that it's kind of a unique thing I'm not usually big on like uh ideas are valuable this to me is just like we understand something about an audience that most other people haven't yet discovered and so we think that it could be interesting to go after there's two players in the market that are well known in that industry um again it's a a niche but also like very big and both players you'd probably have to pay like over $100 million to buy them in in kind of total cost and you probably can't buy a minority stake and so it's like at this point given our track record I probably could go try to figure out you know a bunch of these like big institutional investors who want to buy media businesses and like go put it together it's a lot of work you have to convince someone to sell it to you you have to get the terms right integration like like there's a lot of challenges but then I'm like dude I think for 100 grand we could create a competitor and like it's not going to be worth $100 million doll you know within the first two or three years but like could we like take a big dent into their businesses probably so when it's that skewed I obviously tend to lean towards building versus buying I think where it's harder is like hey the business is worth like $10 million or $5 million and you're like that's like two years of progress versus not spending the money up front and like maybe you get there that's where I probably lean much more towards like buying versus building it's just like it's it's a lower risk and the deal's easier to get done than trying to go and you know buy these these huge things that you know frankly uh there's only so many people in the world that are actually good at doing and what about the focus thing I mean I only do one thing I I I remember your face seared in my brain last time you asked me this and I was like no I don't do a lot of things I do one thing we provide capital and distribution to businesses I think that's I think that's inspiring I think that Sean and I fall on sides I actually think Sean I'm slowly buying into other viewpoints oh [ __ ] I'm trying to go over to where you're at I'm trying to focus more Sam has no no hold on a second This Is A Lie Sam you have multiple businesses like you're not just doing one thing although you think of like I don't know Airbnb short-term Rental Right like you built that out like that's a project that you were working on right at the same time you were getting Hampton off the ground right like like there's all these things where sometimes it's not like okay I'm going to raise money and go build this big business it could just be like projects but you're you're constantly doing multiple things I call them Hobbies so I I have a 40-hour week thing which is actually so I'm disproving my my own point it's actually podcasting and Hampton um but so that doesn't exactly make my point but that's like my nine to-5 and then like i' I've got like weekend projects is how I consider it so meet Sam par he's a podcaster with weekend Hobbies podcast influencer content man producer content producer I think I think I think we've done a really good job of rebranding that Creator just sounds weak for some reason there's a bunch of people changing their uh X bios right now they're like just deleting Creator and putting producer yeah it's just for some reason it's a weak that's a weak that's a weak uh uh word I I don't know what it is but we do need to Rebrand that well just it bulks you in with everybody else that's the problem like uh it's like oh no I I'm a I'm not like them no no no that that guy's just unemployed uh there's a difference you know uh I'm a different thing I need to have a new name I met a guy who uh he was one of the early hires at paler and uh he he essentially like I don't know he didn't tell me this but like I think he was like basically the COO right or whatever in the early days and he was like yeah one of the cool things about the culture is like you kind of like jointly with your boss made up your title and so his was like Risk identifier and Destroyer right and it's just like man names do matter like what does that guy do I want to go work at the company where like that could be my title and it's very clear inside the organization what the president does at different companies may be different but the guy whose title is like Risk identifier and Destroyer is 100% focused on risk and so uh same thing like content creator like maybe it's the wrong name and just change the name and then all of a sudden everyone's really excited about it chamath has a good story about this he says when he was at Facebook they were trying to hire like you know some PhD level um you know math and stats guy and they were like cool like you can come be a data analyst he's like I don't want to be a data analyst I'm gonna go get my PhD instead he's like I don't know did I say data anal data scientist where you have a new field called data science and you're one of the first to be a data scientist on Earth and he's like yeah I invented the tag data science and then now it's like you know a whole like prestigious job title in Silicon Valley is is data science is that story true that's that's a that's a hard story to believe is you think that's true uh yeah I believe it I don't know I have no reason not to believe it [Laughter] I did I I love those guys so much on the Allin podcast but I was laughing uh that people were giving them [ __ ] about the uh using scare muchi as a measuring stick you guys see this yeah no what's that like scare scare mcci was the white house uh communications director for 11 days I think right I mean like the infamous photo he's got the sunglasses on with the finger guns like probably one of the the greatest stints in the White House of all time um and uh so people always tweet at scaramucci like when some you know like EMT Shear was the CEO of open AI for like 48 hours they're like hey how many scaramucci did he last and scaramucci were like calculated like you know point2 or whatever um and so the Allin guys they had been saying it for a while and they were like yeah we invented that they were like on Twitter they're like give us credit if you're gonna use it and uh and then the the internet loves to hate on those guys if you're not like the tech industry so they were like waiting for them to say something and of course they all started pulling up like articles and whatever and like man this is like PEAK Internet right is like somebody wants credit for a term that no one's really clear where it came from and then a bunch of people who don't like that person is wants to critique them and yell and scream and like go do a bunch of work uh to disprove them I was like we are all wasting our time we should just get off the internet like go do productive things but uh it's kind of like when I when I say MFM uh we get credit for making Andrew huberman and Brian Johnson famous uh the longevity guy according to us yeah you're welcome world I actually think that Kim Kardashian's famous because of you guys didn't one of you tweet about her early on yeah it's like you ever heard of Rob dierck first one to watch her work I think uh yeah um P thanks for doing this man we love hanging out with you absolutely I appreciate you guys very much uh can I plug one thing before I leave yeah yeah we have a job board it's called dream startup job.com uh used to be called poomp crypto jobs it was just crypto we've now expanded it to be crypto and everything else uh We've helped three three people a day on average for now over two years get a new job um and so there's 10,000 open roles on there if you want to get a job at your dream startup you should go to dream startup job.com and uh and check it out all right appreciate it looks good uh I I I remember what it used to be I think this is a this is a smart move well we'll figure it out I appreciate you fellas

Okay so we've talked about onechart businesses before and this is the idea that you could be the midwit in the midwit meme where you got to explain and analyze and give you 10 reasons why this might be a good idea the pros and the cons and you're overanalyzing it or you could just be the badass and the badass the Jedi it just puts the one chart up and says this is why I'm doing what I'm [Music] doing all right we're back just Sam and Sean back uh the band's back together for the first time in a long time um you have a bunch of topics but I want to kick us off can I kick us off okay go have you ever read the book 48 Laws of Power I've never actually read it but I've read some of the laws It's a Wonderful book it's cool and there's one law where it's law number 25 and it says you know something like be able to reinvent yourself and the author says create yourself with a powerful new image that stands out and draws attention rather than letting others Define you then change your appearance and emotions to suit the occasion or stage riveting dramas as backdrops for your actions and I love this book and that's that's that's law number 25 where he talks about changing your image there's a person who I've recently discovered that has done this excellently and I think that you and I can learn a lot about him and so there's a rumor about this guy they say that if you arrange seats like a boardroom he magically appears so this guy listen to his uh listen to his background so he graduated from Stanford then he went on to join Google at the age of 22 where he was the lead product manager and he helped create Google Maps after that he started this social networking site called friendfeed which he sold to Facebook and Facebook Incorporated it and one of the big things that Facebook took from it was they actually created the like button because of it he sold that for about $50 million few years later he becomes the CTO of Facebook after after that he founds a company that I can best describe as a note taking company but for Enterprises he sells that to Salesforce for $ 750 million after a couple years he becomes co-ceo of Salesforce which I think what do they worth hundred billion dollars more I I don't even know hundreds of you know one of the biggest companies in the world then he becomes chairman of the board at Twitter he's chairman of another really large publicly traded company that many people haven't heard of they make security cameras he's also on the board at Shopify and last night he was named chairman of the board of open AI this guy is amazing he's only 43 years old you know who I'm talking about one and only Brett Taylor that's right do have you ever like spoke or hung out with this guy I had a dinner once uh he was there and uh but we were on opposite ends of the table so he was at the far end on on the head of the table that way I was at the far end of the head of the table the other way um it was like a slope of like success like most successful person on that side of the table and least successful person over here I was like the bottom of the puddle at the bottom of the slide there so it was uh he's a good dude though he good energy good jokes um yeah he seemed like a good good time but he also seemed like the guy that could flip a switch would be incredibly serious if you wanted to so the this guy is so fascinating and I'll explain why but that's funny that you're at a dinner with him because he credits that as being one of his reasons why he is where he is and so starting at Stanford and then at Facebook he started attending these dinners and he said that like Marissa Mayer when she was early in her career would go to these dinners he said that uh Cheryl Samberg was there he he like Mark Benny off or not Mark benof the guy started Zinga uh was there he said that like all these amazing people would go there and that's actually how he got to know Mark Benny off from Salesforce was at these dinners and I was doing research on this guy and there's very on Bret and there's very little stuff about him there's not too much stuff about him for given how impactful he is and I found this old video about 15 or 10 years ago with him and Mark Zuckerberg they're sitting at a table and they're it's almost like the like a post UFC fight press conference where they're just like sitting there and there's like reporters it's like really a press conference announcing the acquisition of Facebook or a friend feed to Facebook and he's wearing like a scruffy t-shirt like he doesn't look good his hair is messy whatever he looks exactly like you would think an early Facebook engineer looks and so I watch this video and then I see another video on YouTube where it's with him and the figma founder at a conference and he's wearing something like what what I'm wearing which is like he looks like a corporate guy but he's still got Charisma and uh the founder of uh figma Dylan he asks him like what's been your biggest learning of your career and Brett goes well you know I remember being at Facebook and I was like it just wasn't working out for some reason and Cheryl samber said something to me that like changed my perspective and the next day I said to myself instead of getting the company to change to me I'm going to change to do whatever the company or job that I'm at needs to have whether that means how I dress how I act and what you what you notice is a shift in his demeanor all the way from how he dresses so he starts wearing different clothing sometimes when he's supposed to be this like tech nerd and someone wants to come up to him with engineering advice you see him dress like an engineer then he becomes Salesforce CEO you see him start dressing different he's wearing the classic plaid shirt suit with brown shoes the classic look and it's really fascinating to see this guy's demeanor change and later on in some of these videos with him these interviews the guy just like screams Poise you know like when you think of the Salesforce CEO you think of like one of these guys could be chair of a of a important board like Twitter he just like scream like he's definitely has Charisma he's got Poise he's not vulgar at all he's he he doesn't seem crazy emotional but he smiles at the right times and he dresses like the part and I thought it's really fascinating to see this guy's Evolution and for him to say that at a conference and I thought it was exactly what Robert Green talked about where he talks about Reinventing yourself and a lot of times guys like you and me or people listening they think clothes don't matter they think you know I'm just going to curse and people are going to think that I'm real and all this stuff I've grown to think that's complete nonsense that like you know we act like we shouldn't play this bureaucratic political game but I think the more we deny it the the more we actually need to embrace that and Brett Taylor is a really fascinating person uh because that's one of the examples that I've noticed you're take away from this whole thing you tell this beautiful story you have these amazing points but the big one that stood out to you was you got to dress better that was the whole thing no my point is is that appearance and demeanors matter and dress is one attribute of that my point is is that when I look at him like I first of all the guy's a genius so when there's these stories about him when he launched Google m Maps there like the code sucked and over the weekend he rewrote it and it was awesome and by the way the guy who tells that story is Paul buite the guy who created Gmail built Gmail inside of Google and was one of the co-founders of YC combinator and so for Paul buite to go and say he said in that thing he goes Brett Taylor's not just a a great engineer he's not a 10x engineer he might be a hundred or THX engineer he's that good to get a compliment like that I mean it's like Picasso saying you know this guy's handy with the brush right it's like okay that means something depending on who it comes from somebody who actually worked side by side with him I think they co-founded friend feet together also our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better yeah so he's a genius so like he has like that part so there's no doubt about that he's got that's 90% of this or 80% of this I mean he's brilliant but um and he and he does a really good job of making big shots like him and so there's like an example where Mark benof was like yeah I used to attend these dinners with him and he did a great job of asking good questions those dinners are hosted by Michael Burch so Michael Burch is uh hosts this like CEO dinner Benny off's in it Brett Taylor's in it that's how I got to go to it um I think we did an episode on this a long time ago like called I went to a Billionaire's dinner or something like that and it was I got to go as a guest like each time they host there's like the Main Stays which is like Reed Hoffman and whoever and then there's um mer Myers in there and then it's the the host can invite two or three guests like new new people fresh blood into the into the mix and so I was a one of the fresh Bloods I guess that time was it awesome uh yeah it was awesome I mean it was it was amazing uh you know this just it's amazing to be at that table I guess um the interesting thing was like I think I've said this before which is um if you want to stop making money the priority hang out with people with a lot of money because the conversation was not about business and money making and you know the markets or investing or hot deals because these guys are like post economic they're past that so it's not that they don't do those things it's that that's like it's like if somebody brought their to-do list to dinner it's like oh come on man like we're we're here to have a good time what are you doing here and so all the conversation at dinner was about things that were you know nonfinancial it's like you got your status by having non-financially related things to say that makes sense yeah yeah yeah money was lower low on their hierarchy of needs you were low on you were only addressing like the low thing that's super Satisfied by them but if you had a really unique experience or you're like oh dude I take this drug it's this I you know you lick the back of a horn toad and you trip out for four hours everyone's like tell me more and it's like wow you guys really want to talk about triping ball it's like yeah that's what they want to talk about or it'll be there was a neuroscientist there who was talking about you know all of his his lab or he studies the brain and the effects of both these drugs but also like a whole bunch of other interesting like psych studies essentially and everybody was fascinated by the brain dock it's like you know if hubbin was at the dinner it's like everybody wanted to hear huin um not they didn't want to hear about you know this great private Equity deal that you did you know and how you're getting you know you 45% cash on cash return that just doesn't matter at that table and so it was I to me actually that was the biggest takeaway was like at these things like you know humor matters stories matter different things matter but like it's pretty interesting to hang out with people who have achieved all the things you want because they no longer care about all these things and uh it's a good reminder that uh you know don't get to totally wrapped up in just the the kind of the business only like I am a business nerd I do like that stuff but you know the people who have sort of the high have played this game at the highest level they uh you know their their game is now about this variety of experiences and and totally un unfinancial non-financially related things that they talk about yeah by the way sorry one last point on that if you if we hang out in a group of like our peers how many times is the conversation about who knows like uh you know content and followers or investment or deals that they're doing or like new businesses that they're bootstrapping or creating and it's like it's like the contrast between you know our group is kind of like early 30s uh age um and then these guys were all probably like you know closer to 50 um and so you know that in that 20 years I think you know what changes is uh if you're talking about like you know how this piece of content went viral and popped off and you got all these followers like you're literally a loser if you're talking about that at that table and so it's like at each table what's the discussion like and uh well in the minimum net worth at that table was probably $500 million well I was there so no the minimum was lower than that but the uh median was probably that yes well I when you were there so here here's one of the reasons why I'm fascinated with this person is because with Brett is because smart people referred to him and when I think that when I when I think of I'm I'm not in the league where I even totally understand chairman of the board and how it interacts with the CEO of a large company but I imagine that it's like part therapist where you don't really need the answer but you're good at asking the right questions and in order to be a good therapist you have to have this image well in a reputation uh and track record of like this guy somehow gets to the helps me get to the right answer or somehow like he's got that Sensei Vibe and I don't know if he's particularly smarter than anyone else at that table I imagine they're all just the best of the best was there something about his energy that stood out or were they was everyone quite good at that he was very poised he had a booming laugh and and at about two hours into the dinner he was like that's all for me boys jacket on left and like and the dinner like dragged on for like you know another hour and people trickled out from there but he was sort of like um I've had a great dinner I also have things to do and um I own my time and my schedule I'm out of here and I thought that was like a very obvious like it like a very obvious moment where he was like cool I you know 80% of the meat is off the bat now fantastic um you know I got kids I got I got a board to go go be on or whatever and he bounced uh it was just kind that part was kind of funny but again I was on the other side of the table I didn't talk to him directly too much uh I will say a couple things so I think you're uh reinvent yourself is actually the right takeaway I think this guy's had a prolific career as a PM at Google then a startup founder then CTO of Facebook then started found her again but now BWB Enterprise and then sold that to to Salesforce and you know they they kind of Mark benof was basically grooming him to like you know take it over even the Twitter thing he's not just a board member like he was the board member that basically forced Elon to stick to his offer he stood up to Elon and and basically forced Elon to buy and got an amazing deal for the Twitter show holders whereas you know Elon was applying a lot of pressure at that time to tr and and Brett stood up to him in a way um and he's just a trusted neutral Third Party U like in crypto this happened where there was this one guy who was this like meme poster but the whole Community just trusted this guy cuz he had been in it for a long time he had because he had been in it for a long time he had already gotten rich in crypto so it didn't seem like he was trying to get rich off anybody or make a buck off anybody uh he had a podcast so people heard him talk is this guy Kobe and uh he had a podcast so people heard him talk all the time and so whenever somebody needed to make a deal in crypto as like a bet like A10 million bet they would just wire the $10 million to Kobe as a trusted neutral third party and I just thought that was kind of amazing like this guy there's no contract there's no nothing it's just a social social reputation and I think that's the Brett Taylor thing like they brought him into this open AI thing because he has a social reputation people find him when they need somebody who's going to be a um you know a voice of reason a stable third party a trusted neutral voice and um that's that's just an interesting job to be done so so yeah I think this guy's very fascinating my point is is to do the right thing is actually not terribly challenging like to be this Kobe Guy where you're trusted he like well you just got to follow through no matter what to carefully craft after reputation I think takes a lot of discipline and I find that to be challenging and I'm really fascinated by these guys who are able to do that you have to have a lot of discipline you can't like everything matters whether it's your dress your website all you just are into dressing well right now and you're looking for examples you're like see that justifies my enthusiasm around this right now let me give you another example so Josh Kushner wait wait hold on hold on True or False you decided you wanted to level up your style before you had this epy about Brett Taylor correct like recently the last few months somewhat I want to figure out how to become more I want to level up my life and dress is one ways one way to do that what did Deion Sanders say he said uh dress good look good feel good play good that type of VI yeah okay fair enough fair enough another example is Josh Kushner so a lot of people know that Kushner because Jared Kushner was I don't even know what his role was on the Trump Administration but Josh Kushner is another guy who's really fascinating he does a he has a similar Vibe where he was 24 or 25 he started uh Thrive Capital he ra I mean he came from wealth so it's not like coming from nothing but he raised money from I think Benchmark or general General Catalyst I think in order to create this Venture fund invested in Instagram a few years later he starts Oscar which went on to become a multi-billion dollar Health Tech I think health insurance business he started um what was the other one it's not Compass it's another it's a real estate investment platform that is uh a fairly large company and then throughout this open AI drama as well as other stuff he's been in the mix and he's done a really good job of building up this reputation if you go to thrive I think it's Thrive capital.com their website it says nothing it literally just says Thrive Capital like you can't like he the guy like but here's the thing is he does zero flexing which in itself is the flex and in itself is like the reputation building you know what I mean and I and and I find it fascinating to figure out how are people shaping their image and are they being how deliberate are they being both of these guys examples I think they're very deliberate even if they even if they try to give the image of they're not trying that in itself is trying you know what I mean let me give you a different example so a different guy very successful who has reinvented himself and in my opinion this is like doing money the right way this is like what I want all my rich people to go do not all if you're if you're just wired like a psychopath you got to go creep keep Crea you're El mus you got to go keep creating the next big thing all right fair enough but here's here's something I do like so traditional money path is in our world you start a company you grind it out for seven eight years 10 years you sell it you're rich you uh take a year off you travel you uh get interested in health you go on a health kick for a little bit you um you spend time with your kids and then you're just like okay this is cool but I kind of like this in small doses all right uh I guess I'll now start investing I'm a VC I think I start the the vest appear materializes on top of your chest magically and uh you're you're like should I be on the board of this company am I Brett Taylor you uh you're on boards you're you're writing important checks into important groundbreaking companies and that's your life and then you just do that life for a while and then you you say things like my Founders or one of our Founders is doing this yeah you start using the Royal Wii as if you're involved those companies you know you're uh you're 5-year-old you're paying $882,000 a year to send her to kindergarten in uh San Francisco and you you made a donation and they there's a bench in the library with your name on it although they kind of promised that the whole Library would be named after you but it's just a bench and you're a little bit pissed off about that but you don't want to say anything let's not cause a scene um and so you you know this is your life and here's an alternative okay you are TJ Parker you know who TJ Parker is no who's this TJ Parker was the founder of pillpack and TJ Parker looked like he might be going down this path he he starts pill pack you know going to [ __ ] democratize them pills or something I don't know what the tagline was but he starts pill pack and it's some sort of like you know I don't know pharmaceutical far online pharmacy type thing sells it to Amazon for a billion dollars okay stage one complete becomes a VC immediately stage two complete but then starts doing dope [ __ ] so if you go to TJ Parker's website you can see some of the dope [ __ ] he's doing is he looks and he looks cool looks cool first of all looks more like whm Hoff than he does Jamie Diamond so you already know this guy's going into the health kick you know the right direction he's out in nature he's Barefoot sometimes like he's doing that kind of thing so check out this thing called the warehouse if you're one of these people who's into dope cars which I'm not but but uh you know you you kind of are you're into these like cool you know oldfashioned cars and stuff like that you you need a place to store it and a lot of people do the J Leno thing and they get like an elevator in their garage and they try to stack four cars in their garage eight cars in their garage just this gets tough so instead they built a beautiful Warehouse to park and store your beautiful cars and you could share it with other people but they're like cool guess what you guys will all probably get along too this is not just storage so first they were like we're not just going to store cars you might have some wine guess what 2500 wine seller temperature controlled humidity controlled beautiful wine seller here too so store your wine store your cars and come hang out come hang out we got a gigar bar we got art displays we'll watch the games together and it's a car Social Club so it's basically Soho House for dudes with a little grease on their hands and I love this idea this is a brilliant idea and the photos make it look so badass I don't even like cars and I saw these pictures and I was just like I guess like hey uh D clear my calendar I got to go learn how an axle works like I I want to be a part of this just on seeing the photos and so I think this is a brilliant idea I think this could franchise and be across the country I think you could have you know locations all all across the country for this I think guys need Community friendships mail bonding and but they don't want to you know it's like guys will start a podcast podcast instead of do therapy guys will join a get a car Hobby and drop you know $300,000 on cars and join a car club rather than you know go to go to men go to a men's group and it will function as such and so I think this is a brilliant idea that has national no wait International consequences if they want to roll it out where is this it looks like so they don't say the location exactly it's in Utah because that's where this guy is also classic move picking Utah then here's some of the other projects that are he's working on if you go to Just teacher parker.com backc Curren hyphen projects all right so here's what he's got going he's producing a documentary dope love that on cars yeah he's got a company that just makes really dope quality bags and gear for people who are like going to the outdoors and he's like look this we're going to hold the quality bar so he's got this company called lazy Sun he's got a 12 Acre Farm that he owns he's like yeah farming I do that [ __ ] too I'm a gentleman farmer and then I mean this guy's doing even better he does this he has a business like goes to Children's Hospitals and transforms them into like dope art galleries for the day so that the kids have something awesome to to see and he's like you know we we can you can heal kids through through ART you know like capture their imagination distract them from you know the the sort of the mundane like if you ever been in a hospital environment it's like one of the worst environments like yeah does not pass the vibe check and the fact that he's like oh yeah we're gonna do these popup art exhibits inside Children's Museums to shift the vibe I [ __ ] with that and so um these are this is a guy who is successful but then use the money and the time to craft a dope life around the hobbies that he loves he went The Joe Rogan path versus the Elon Musk I need to work 95 hours a week at just bigger better More Money More Fame more power more Prestige more everything um more more suffering and I just [ __ ] with the TJ Parker path more well by the way I'm not saying necessarily that I think the the Brett Taylor path is p i I just I I guess what I'm saying is I appreciate paths I appreciate people who are who who do the damn thing you know like I can get as much inspiration from an artist as I can a billionaire you know just people who just put their stake in the ground and say this is what I am and I'm doing it uh yeah how much do you think this guy so they raised $100 million they sold for a billion was he the only founder I think there was two guys um wow okay sick guy right this is amazing by the way one one of the things that both of us really like to do that I don't think we really put a name on it which is I am fascinated by and if I could say what is the number one thing I am looking for in life it's like what are you looking for you looking for a partner or a project or a a to make a book or way to get famous no no no I am searching long and hard for people who I think are playing the right game the right way so I'm interested in different blueprints of like what are people doing with their time and their talent oh Brian Johnson said I'm gonna [ __ ] donate my body to science while I'm alive and he's try to reverse age which is like just a badass science experiment mixed with a badass like Health kick and investment in himself mixed with just like you know picking a project that was uh not another business and I think that's cool but it's not for me and I think what you described you know the Brett Taylor where you you start multiple companies then you become a board member and you become this respected luminary of Silicon Valley and you're the CEO of a publicly traded company cool game definitely not for me and uh you know you see some guys who are like I'm gonna um tweet every day and I'm going to be super consistent and I'm gonna do this not for me but and I just look around and I see I'm looking for people who are playing a beautiful game and the sad thing is it's VE for me it's very hard to point to somebody and like I can't give you a I'm looking hard for this and I can't name more than like two or three people whose game I really respect I think oh they're they're doing they have a great blueprint for what they're doing in life and um I think that's the most important thing because once you have that blue BL blueprint for you for you for myself yeah like I you know oh I really like how this person has architected their life I like what they're working on they seem to be really happy they have a great mix of kind of like family and fun and Challenge and whatever else um and they're you know doing good in the world in their own way and you know like I like I want to see examples of people doing that really well so I think when you bring up Brett Taylor we bring up TJ Parker these are part of that that search that I have that Quest that I have the thing I am most interested in right now and I think that anybody once you once you get past the kind of like your needs are fulfilled stage um like you know instead of striving for [ __ ] you money you should strive for like what is the right game to be playing uh what is a great way to use this you know this thing called life and uh and get inspiration from a bunch of people then sort of craft your own version of that that's what I'm trying to do at least no and that's that's exactly the point I was trying to make which is whoever we talk about I don't I don't necessarily want to emulate that but I emulate the people who are making the life that they that they've chosen to make and I consider that to be success one thing that I've learned from hanging out with some of these people I admire is even though it looks amazing on the outside everyone still has similar issues whether it's family issues or pressure on this or that um and so I always like getting to know these people like Rob Dear Dick I I've I've loved having him and on and I've been able to talk to him once or twice afterwards it's like everyone's [ __ ] still stinks once in a while though and that always has given me a ton of confidence and actually made me happier you know what I'm saying right right right what do you want to do all right I'm gonna do a quick one so this is called the Dr Dre question and this is a question that is useful when you are hiring so uh I was watching this old ass Tim Ferris episode where he interviewed this guy that I never even heard of Cal fussman you know this guy uh is he a journalist uh he was kind of like a journalist or he's like a writer uh but basically he's like a man who very interesting life like he boxed Julio Chavez and like he did like a bunch of interesting things during his life and so anyways old episode Tim Ferris actually it's a very good episode and one of the things he talks about is um so his his things like you know the art of asking questions and uh you know one thing I like to do is study people's lives another thing is I like to I'm a collector of questions um a great question is like very valuable to me so I was interested in this episode and during it they say uh there's a part where you go okay you know you've talked to us about asking questions um uh what's you know who who have you helped you know who's come to you for help with asking questions he describes a a a set of Founders and they said um they said you know we have this problem with our company we are super passionate about our business but when we're hiring we don't know what to add we're like kind of hiring the wrong people because we just can't seem to find people that are as passionate about our business as we are and like on one hand we could say maybe just nobody's going to be as passionate about our own business as we are but we just want people at least close to it right like people just have a lot of passion we don't know how to filter for that because if you ask somebody your passion they say yes so what do we do and he goes uh he goes oh that's easy just ask them the Dr Drake question and he goes he goes here's the story he goes I was interviewing Dr Dre um when he was like a journalist and he's like I said to him what's hey Dre um doc what's the longest that you've gone what's the longest that you've gone on on a project without sleeping and he goes oh man when I'm really into something I care about I'm in the zone I don't even think about sleep I forget to sleep I'll just keep going until it's until I you know pass it could be 20 72 hours and he goes um so I thought I took that idea 72 hours he goes just ask that ask a person this what's the longest you've ever gone on a project you were passionate about without sleep and their answer will tell you a lot either they'll struggle to even come up with a number because they don't they've actually had an obsession a project they're so passionate about that they kind of became a degenerate they let other parts of their life go like sleeping and eating and talking to people and answering the phone and they just got completely lost in it um either they'll that will be unfamiliar to them or it'll be familiar to them and you'll be able to tell that right away so that's a fork on the road and he goes um and it'll tell you a lot about the person if they say you know what I get eight hours of sleep every night because that's I function best when I'm like that and I'm fully charged and you'll know okay uh you might not be the right person for this you might be right you that's what I want my CFO but it might not be who I want as my you know head of product right-hand man during you know while we're figuring out this Pro from scratch and so uh the Dr Dre question I thought is a wonderful little thing I'm stealing a question I've collected in terms of being able to find the people that have that same streak of obsession and degeneracy that is like if you have that it's a very high likelihood that we can work together or we get along what's your answer what's your answer 48 hours would be would be mine I've never done 72 not even close but 48 hours for sure multiple times and the funny thing is it's on really stupid stuff like uh I basically did that with that all-in video the other day um like I was up all night basically editing it and then I because I was like I just want to ship this I want to finish this and I also don't want to work on this for more than like I gave myself a day to do this so I'm just gonna work non-stop for 24 hours on this and I was like that day I was a bad dad I was a bad husband I was bad at Fitness I was bad at sleep I was bad at eating but I was [ __ ] amazing at that video and like that's happened to me many times in my life happened when I was like when we were doing our first startup I remember many times me and my buddy Trevor we would stay up and Trevor would keep going Trevor's answer would be more like 72 hours but like we would stay up we'd be like we would see a cool commercial and be like can we recreate that it's like I don't know I know download Adobe let's find a cracked version of Adobe on Napster and like you know download this [ __ ] and then we'd be like okay Adobe fireworks is a way that you can animate something and we would sit there and try to learn it watching tutorials and we would just try to get better at it and then like I would pass out and go to sleep on after the storytelling part was done and Trevor would stay up and he would learn like he taught himself Photoshop and after effects and all these things but he didn't teach himself in years he taught himself on like four projects that were just like these like 72-hour binges and then he just knew how to do those tools after that and like now his whole career is like that but at the time it was unnecessary at the time we weren't getting paid for it at the time the things we made weren't even that good they were still like you you know kind of janky but it doesn't matter is 72 hours three nights is that three nights I think you I would count 72 hours as you you basically uh you wake up you work you skip that first night of sleep you work through the next day you basically skip the next night or you get a couple hours the next night and you wake up and and you finish the next day that's insane I mean I've I've done uh overnight stuff a bunch of times all nighter right yeah an all nighter and then all day day that next day but like usually it's like i' I've been at the office and I'll sleep on the couch in the office for like from like 4: to 8: or something like that so it's really hard to go it's hard to do overnight and then keep going the next day that's that's challenging maybe it'll be like three hours I've done overnight stuff a bunch of time but it's hard to go more than that let's say you had like a New Year's Eve party and it was going to get a little crazy and you have this friend and you're like okay I hope this is not too crazy for my friend and if you just asked him the version of the Dr D question is it's like uh hey have you uh have you ever blacked out when you drink and if they're like no or one time it's like you should probably hang back from this party but if they're like oh like dude embarrassing number of times then I can't count the number of times what are you talking about like you know it's it happens like you know there was a phase in my life it happened a lot and now it happens less it's like okay you should come to this party you'll have a good time right like there's a version of the doct gr question for like partying there's a version of the doct Dr question for you know like for parenting there's a version of the do question like uh I know a version of the question for parenting is like what's the grossest thing your kids ever done and if they're like oh where where do I start when they lick the urinal when they uh you know at the airport decided to like roll around on the you know this is like a constant stream of like fiascos that I've oh they pooped in my bare hand uh you know because I couldn't find the diaper in time like yeah these things this is like I'm a I'm a seasoned parent I've been through the wars of parenting you know like you could tell like kind of a first- time parent versus second parent based on the number of stories they have in college when I was a degenerate my friends and I used to say what's the best way to to get through a blackout and manage it effectively practice and we would practice all the time who's the most experienced uh all right we want to do another one yeah yeah I got another one Okay so we've talked about one chart businesses before and this is the idea that like you could be the midwit in the midwit meme where you gotta explain and analyze and give you 10 reasons why this might be a good idea the pros and the cons and you're overanalyzing it or you could just be the badass and the badass the Jedi it just puts the one chart up and says this is why I'm doing what I'm doing the first example we gave of This was um um what's it called when you don't get buried you uh cremation uh cremation it was like a chart of percentage of funerals that are cre uh people being cremated choosing to be cremated and it went from 10% to over 50% and the guy sent us the the pitch deck was like yeah we made cremation easy but like this one chart is the reason for our business existence this is our business plan we are going to ride this wave you've talked about how uh Jeff Bezos did that about the internet you I'm why do you quit his job in finance to start an Internet company Because the Internet was growing 23,000 per a year or something like that he's like nothing grows that fast except for bacteria to pacher Dish so I'm going to go surf that wave yeah I mean there's the internet there's there's mobile phon you know like there's those big ones but cremation was a smaller one that wasn't as obvious and what are you saying as the other one so there's a new one chart I saw I saw yesterday that is not as strong as those but is is legit and it's the it's the growth in homeschooling and so uh we kind of knew when covid happened that there was like a bunch of you know people created like little home schools or whatever you needed to teach your kids the schools were closed what are you going to do but it's actually sustained so it's now the 2023 data is out and homeschooling has grown I think like 40 or 50% a year year-over-year for three straight years like that's pretty aggressive and like public schooling is like growing at like you know whatever no perent 3% um private schooling is like 7% and then homeschooling is 40 to 50% every year compounded for three years and like I don't know if that's going to continue or not but let's assume that that that it is or that it might be that means that a whole bunch of businesses that were like not really that viable were like to Niche are now perfectly Niche and so there's like you know this trend of um of of like micro school so out school I think is like grown like crazy yeah is is a micro School considered homeschooling so there's homeschool traditional homeschooling like uh J Jenny's at home I'm just going to teach her myself we're g to print out worksheets and she's going to do them and whatever I'm I'm the teacher then there's micro schools which was like for a variety of reasons I don't want my kid to go to school for some people that was Co for some people it's school shootings for some people it's uh they don't like the quality of the instruction for some people it's the social they're worried about like social peer pressure and like you know kids bullying and things like that whole bunch of reasons why people might want to like take take the kid out of traditional schools and so a micro school is you hire six six families get together and they basically say hey for the cost of private school we can actually just have like a literal private school we can have our own pod here like a hired teacher a Hired Gun teacher that teacher makes double what they make at a public school so like oh instead of making whatever $50,000 a year you make $100,000 a year uh so we'll get the we'll get a great teacher we'll pay them extremely well they only have six kids to worry about they can get super invest in them the teacher student ratio is going to be really really good instead of one teacher to 25 kids in a class there's GNA be one teacher to six they're going to make they're going to have friends and socialize so it's not like homeschooling like they still get the socializing aspect of it and um there's same age children they're like kind of like in a yeah it's usually maybe like a little broader range like it might be like a year and a half window or something like that two years window maybe and they'll also be kind of an indoor outdoor component so like sometimes they have a dedicated facility sometimes it's like our backyard or they rotate through the parents backyards or whatever um sometimes it's a mix of indoor and then they go for like a long walk or a hike or playground or whatever like the teacher takes them indoor and Outdoors they get a better mix than like sitting in a desk all day um and this makes all the sense of the world to me like I'm I'm actually super interested in doing this I think this is actually a pretty pretty dope idea and then there's a business called primer that uh Ryan Delk started you are you familiar with Ryan Delk and primer yeah Ryan Ryan's cool I like Ryan a lot but I his company that he started preco this was that company right it was home school I think they pivoted they started with more of that traditional homeschool like what do you do if you're if you're actually at home and then now it's pivoted in the last year to I think it's pivoted uh to M these micro schools and it's basically like an operating system it's like hey if you're a teacher push this button it's like stripe Atlas like you could spin up your micro School it'll be compliant with your State's regulations you'll be able to accept all the school's Choice vouchers so that's the other one chart in this is that the number of like I don't know this space very well so I might get this slightly wrong but apparently there's like a school's Choice angle where like as a parent you get like a $10,000 voucher and you get to go shop around and figure out what school is the most worthy of getting your tuition so this the government instead of just paying the public school pays the family the family shops around with that voucher and picks the school that's doing the best or that sells himself the best in order to send their kid there and so the schools have to kind of earn all the federal funding or state funding that they're getting from from the government makes a lot of sense so now that thing is on the rise like the number of states that do this voucher program has gone up and up and up like crazy and there's now thousands of you know whatever uh you know uh uh these vouchers that are High ticket vouchers so if you build a successful school you can attract these vouchers you can basically get a bunch of Revenue that the government has given the families to pay you and so what primer does is they're like all right uh spin up a school be compliant accept vouchers and have like your website have all that [ __ ] done for you your back end parents here's a parent portal students here's a student portal we are the operating system for micro schools I think they have like three micro schools now and they're trying to get to like six and then they're going to get to like 18 and uh you know each of these micro schools basically generates like I don't know 75k of profit for the the owner right now or could become 100K of profit for the micros School owner after you pay the teacher so let's say you you might if you're the teacher and you do this you might be able to make 75 to 100K on the teacher wage plus another 75 to 100K for your little franchise School your the little Chipotle that you built here and so I think this is kind of a cool Trend and I'm I don't know if their company's going to be the the winner or like what's the right wedge to attack here like I would invest in this yeah I was gonna ask is this the team is too legit the price is going to be too high they've already raised a bunch of money because they've been going at this for years and he's very like well connected Silicon Valley I don't even know the price but I already know it's too high for me but I think this idea is actually really great and highly investable because of where the puck is going would you s are you gonna your your kids are going to be close to school age are you gonna consider this yeah I definitely want to consider this um I want to either make my own pod or find a a a school or a pod that's around here like my daughter's about to go to to school and um or she goes to like a preschool right now a couple you know two days a week for three hours or just to like get acclimated and um you know it's kind of underwhelming when you go because you're like oh this is like you like you know you can pick up the toy be like this is from 1984 like is there new stuff anywhere here like you know she that te one teacher is supposed to manage all of them like that's tough right you know like 10 to one teacher student teacher ratio that sounds really high uh I guess I could go shop around and try to figure this out but I don't know I'm I'm willing to be sold by a service like this I I'm ready and I think a lot of people will be yeah I'm I'm will so I went to private school almost my whole life in St Louis you go to private school and private school sounds a lot fancier than I'm describing but my grade school was like $800 a year and then I think my high school when I it was like 10 grand a year nowadays I met like a lot of private high schools are like 50,000 which was crazy mine was nothing like that but what I my favorite part about it was that the teachers could do things to me that public school teachers couldn't whoa yeah sounds that sounds that sounds weird when I but when I was they would touch me in a great way meaning when I was being an [ __ ] I remember one teacher I was in the hallway and I I was being rude and he kind of pushed me against the locker and he's like what the [ __ ] is your problem and he like grabbed me by the collar and I had a little bit of fear and I remember thinking all right I if I I got to act up otherwise there's going to be consequences whereas my mother was uh was a public school teacher and she mostly worked with handicapped kids and there'd be times where like the kids would like literally [ __ ] themselves and she's like I I can't go to the bathroom with you I'm not allowed and I remember like the difference in in how much they could like care and like where that line was and it and it made a big difference to me so with the private school that was allowed or this teacher just cross a line and it happened cuz it sounds like that proba wouldn't be allowed to grab a kid by the caller shove him in the locker and be like hey kid get your [ __ ] together the way that I'm describing it's a little bit more serious than actually was but it was just like I remember I was doing something stupid in the locker in the in the hallway and and the teacher got in my face and kind of just like not like aggressively just kind of pushed me and it's like what the hell is your problem right uh like that type of thing and like there was other times where like I got in trouble at home and like I had to like I had to go to the the teacher in private school and tell them what what was up and they're like all right we'll help you out like I just I remember the line was as to what and I also by the way in high school I went to an all boy school which I freaking love all boy schools are awesome because there's like I remember being in ninth grade and like the captain of the football team could also be in a play and like I remember like when kids came out as being gay like At first you're like oh we're going to tease them then it's like h no we're not here to impress a girl like we can all be homies and buddies like there was there wasn't as much of a cool kid Club anyway I loved all boy schools um but I remember in the private school they could just do things that my public teacher mother couldn't do even though I felt it was incredibly necessary uh and this the rules are different and I really appreciate that that private school environment so we're debating at our home even though we've got plenty of time of what we're going to do with our kids I a private school or I would totally absolutely do one of these micro schools I think this is awesome the the only downside is like are you are you gonna be a weirdo you know what I mean um that is like my biggest fear which is are you going to be the are you going to be the wrong type of weird at least they're with other kids right like it might not be you know cuz I I remember a lot of the source of social anxiety when I was a kid was the fact that I mean I just felt like I was like you know have you ever watched like Finding Nemo where he's like you know he's looking around and all the other fish are swimming really fast and nowhere to go and it's like that's how I felt most of school I just felt like everybody else knew where to go knew what to say knew what to do and I was just sort of like lost I guess or and I don't think I was actually that much more lost than anybody else but I certainly felt that way and there was like because it's so big it's easy to be lost uh it's easy to be lost in the shuffle it's easy to just be quiet and you know the teachers are he's just a quiet kid that's it you know you sort of give up on them you just sort of label them that's who they are I don't have time to go rescue every quiet kid and try to get them out of their shell whereas I think if you're in a school of like six to eight kids even if you're on the cheter side I think the teacher and and and just the Dynamics would allow you to come out of your own shell a little bit more CU you could be more of a big fish in a small pond and I think that's really good when you're almost like trying to get your your straight your legs under you and trying to get your your social legs under you yeah I think for a lot of personalities that could be beneficial we you and I have a friend whose kid went to an alternative style school where there was like no homework and like no teachers they were guides and all this thing and like he was like man he's just like lacking structure so he sends him to like a a Catholic school where it's like you're there at 8 school ends at 3 you have homework and the kid needed the structure he needed the discipline and he started thriving in it and so I get nervous because a lot of people they just need to learn how to F in order to be successful in life they got to figure out how to follow rules how to work within the rules and not be free roaming all the time and they need to figure out how to master grade school so they can get into a good high school they got to master high school just so they can get into a good college and they have to do good in college just so they can get a job with a high paying starting with a high starting salary and then they're going to do that until 55 or 65 and they're going to retire and they're going to have grandkids like for a lot of people I think that that linear route of discipline is right decision and I get nervous with some of the these schools that that would happen of course you and I are always going to say our kids are going to be different or we're in a different situation and we're g to figure it out maybe that's true maybe that's not true but that's what I get nervous about some of these schools yeah yeah I think it's definitely uh but but you also wonder how much of it's self-fulfilling meaning like how much of it is nature versus nurture and and like uh if you had that environment or if you were if that was the expectation or the norm for you that you were not expected to go down that that linear path that you just described that you'd be like well I guess that's what I'm doing like you know my wife she grew up and in her family everybody did business so for her even when she had a job in her head she's like oh this is the temporary part before I have my own business and sure enough now she has her own business like you know like that happened um whereas for me I grew up every single family member Aunts Uncles cousins parents everybody it was what you describe good school get to good college good college get to a good job get a good salary get to a better salary over time work your way up become a good manager right what whatever it was I knew zero people that did their own business now I'm lucky that I got off that track and I was able to to go into the world business through other influences but it would have but that was not the default and in fact I think if I played my life out you know eight times out of 10 I would have been on the the job side just because that's all I knew that's what normal was and uh you know I think if there's any like takeaway there it's you know if you want something if you have inkling that you want something out of your life you got to go where that's normal that's why I liked moving to Silicon Valley it was very normal here for people to be starting a company with a Half Bake idea and that was what the smart capable people were doing it's not what the like you know Fringe weirdos were doing whereas everywhere else I lived anybody who's like I quit my job I'm gonna go work on this app for um checking into restaurants people would have been like H gu just weird and he's off the he's off track and so uh you know in silic and Valley if you're like hey I took this job at this you know working at JP Morgan it's like bro you better have a side hustle if you're trying to like get any respect around here like you know you're that is not what's the respected path it's a literally just moving my body moved me in the direction of who I wanted to be because I just moved my body into a place where the norm and the default and the expected was you're G to go create a company right that's what we do here um and so I kind of think it's the same thing with schooling like if you're around if you're in a school environment that expects you to be creative or dynamic or like work on projects and not just be like you know sit down and take tests like I think that that's uh it's going to be self-fulfilling in a way dude I remember being in San Francisco and I would meet people who worked at JP Morgan or just had like a normal job but they would introduce themselves as like the founder of this thing and uh like what is this thing and like oh it's just a pro you know it's just a project I'm working on but I and I used to make fun of that back then I kind of like it though I kind of like it like like their side hustle or their main their main work at their at JP Morgan no like the well well I'm getting get this uh this app off the ground but as a side hustle I work 9 to5 at JP Morgan no no they they turn into cheating husbands they're like I work at JB Morgan but it's not what it looks like okay it's this is just a it's just a thing it's temporary this is there not an emotional connection to it I swear I just had to do it you know like I just two years that's all then I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do the real thing I love that um you want to wrap up talking about poop yeah let's talk about it Thanksgiving I'm around a lot of family members a lot of 13 14 people in my house right now there's a lot of bathroom time going on um fiber is everywhere dude I think fiber supplements I think are a little opportunity so uh you know people a lot of people age 36 and up are uh are taking fiber regularly and when I look at these supplements you know Metamucil fiber like these Brands just s they literally sound like poop which maybe is intentional but I think there's an opportunity to make a a fiber supplement that is uh you know just you know what's going through that right now what what's going through that right now is creatine do you know what creatine is bro don't make me Flex of course I know what creatine is creatine's like I believe it's the most studied supplement of all time um but basically it's proven like constantly where it just makes you stronger and build more muscle mass I don't know by what percent if it's like one or two% but historically creatine was powder form and it doesn't necessarily have a a bad taste but mostly it's neutral but there's this guy it tastes fine it's mostly neutral but you still like when you drink it it's kind of chalky um but it's no big deal but um I take creatine all the time I love creatine and creatine when we were kids when we were in high school that was just like what the jock football players would muscles right it was like is this bad for you it's going to mess up your kidney and your liver or something like that I was like I guess I stay away from creating I'm not that I don't need I don't need to be a bodybuilder right like yeah and it and that's mostly nonsense creatine it's it's just like uh it's probably some health guy might yell at me for saying this but it's basically just like consuming more protein you know like it's just like it should be almost part of a of a daily routine like it's a very stable thing you're not particularly going to get sick whatever it's it's just going to make you stronger and build muscle but uh what's pack what's the what's the bormi guy's first name he's started a creatine company that they basically made it like a fln they made a Flintstone vitamin but for creatine and he shares all of his Revenue online and like six months after starting the business I think it's doing like $800,000 a month in sales and I actually really appreciate that this guy's doing this because he's taking an old supplement that is wonderful um but people are afraid of and it's not really that easy to consume so with his stuff he made it into like a a Flintstone gummy bear like style supplement where you could take because you can't really take creatine in your bathroom unless you have a cup there because you have to mix it with water he is a chewable that tastes kind of good and I think it's really amazing what he's doing with creatine so his name very fast his name is Dan McCormick I'm gonna pull up whatever his last update is so three million in alltime Revenue so basically looks like he's going to do about three million in the first year December when he started 21k January 64k and then it basically goes up 128 172 244 and then the the last two August September were 550k yeah so and what he's doing is he's taking creatine and he's kind of making it popular and and making it easier to consume there's another drug or a vitamin that I like it's called ashwagandha do you know what that is yes so ashwagandha a lot of people use it for anxiety so there's ashwagandha and then there's Cava so Cava I remember drinking it in Fiji it looks like a mud like it's like a powder and you mix it with water and in Fiji they'll sit around a fire and drink Cava and it kind of makes you a little bit high but if you take it in small doses like you can get you can buy Cava at the store and it's and it calms you and ashwaganda is another one like that and so I like these ideas of taking a fiber an ashwagandha a Cava something that has decades or centuries of like proven usage but it doesn't it's not packaged in a way that seems very approachable I think that's a very fascinating way to go about this uh people years ago did it with melatonin melatonin wasn't quite popular now it's incredibly popular it's a very accessible thing I love when people do that with certain supplements dude I have a supplement story that's going to blow your mind and I'm not going to tell you now I'm gonna tell you like a year from now because it's playing out right now uh I have a very small part in this but it is wild to see what a successful supplement company can look like and it's too good right now I can't say anything about it but can you say what the drug or what the vitamin is I'm not saying anything um that's how you know it's good because I gotta just shut up about it you're an investor in it I'm not gonna say anything a year or two from now uh I will tell the story and it's gonna be unbelievable oh all right I'm very eager I I'm very eager you know at once we had Derek from more plates more dates on and he talked about his supplement business I thought like that was it was pretty amazing um I wonder if it's Derek blink twice I I'm not saying anything I am I'm saving this from you too because I want to see your reaction when it all plays out uh I'm not going to give you any hints either before then would you um go into the supplement business uh yes I need my soundboard where's the Bezos hell yes that's that's how I feel that's how I feel about about the supplement industry um yeah so I have nothing to do with any supplement business and from an outside perspective it just seems like an overcrowded space that's really challenging it's very saturated I don't think it's very I don't think it's necessarily like um you know anybody can play but if you're good it's the right type of e-commerce business to be in um you know I'm in the wrong type of e-commerce to be in the hard slog e-commerce type of business to be in if you're good like you know it's somewhat binary I would say in the supplement side like it's uh you know the it's not easy to win but once you get it going if you have the right supplement and the right branding and the right good market and the right right advertising if you could stack those blocks together in the right formation it's a beautiful business why supplements super high margin supplements are repeat purchase consumables supplements get bought by uh you know bigger companies all the time so the exit Market is fantastic the multiples are good supplements can go into retail really well the inventory is very simple you only have like a limited number of skews that you need to deal with usually they're made in the United States so your cycle time is very low which means that you don't have a bunch of money tied up in inventory any given time you might even have negative cash conversion so there's all these benefits of the supplement category if you could be in it um it's a clear problem solution so it's easy to Market and it's expensive I probably spend uh a hundred bucks a month on on protein powders and creatines and a few other things it's it's expensive yeah for sure for hundreds probably I get a bag from Whole Foods it's like 80 bucks I uh so my my sister-in-law's in town this is just a funny story so my sister-in-law's in town I was telling her about this supplement and uh she is I I remember because at previous thanksgivings she was like telling me about uh she's like oh leaky gut oh you I was I was like I was like yeah what is that I've kind of heard that what the hell is that and she's like it's brilliant branding she's like oh my God you don't want leaky gut imagine like a leaky gut like it's just like you know like imagine your sewer has a hole in it right your sewer Lin's like you don't want that getting everywhere no and she's like it's toxic it's bad and I was like how do I know if I have it she's like you probably have it everybody's everybody has it I'm like oh my God my gut health I've just been totally neing my gut health over here what am I doing I'm sleeping on my gut health my microbiome is just a [ __ ] mess right now and I was like and so I'm and so I I was like hey are you still into leaky gut she's like I was like scale of 1 to 10 how into leaky gut are you that was last year she goes 500 I don't stop thinking about my gut and I was like so tell me and I literally recorded I have a voice memo of her describing all of the things she's like oh fiber yeah you got to have the see this fiber is bad because look it has all these extra ingredients natural flavors you don't want that you want this other one it's super clean a garden of life it's got the three different sours of fiber because then you get the blend and when you get the blend the three fibers and she's like drawing these diagrams and then she's like and then she's like yeah and like um you know you just want to have Living Water I was like whoa whoa whoa what's that what's Living Water I don't know what that is like have you heard of Living Water no and so she's describing living water and she's telling me about that and then she's telling me about this other thing and was laughing so hard and I was like you are like if I could take my Facebook pixel and I could just show my Facebook pixel your face I'd be like only advertised to this type of woman like you know rich woman who's like believes in all of these things is like the best Market she is spending got to be spending hundreds of dollars every month $500 a month on just like for her for her kids for her husband does she consume all of it and then she's like she's like yeah I she's like I wish she's like I'm not even taking all the stuff I should be taking I wish I was more on top of it but I'm so busy with life so that's why to to to supplement for it that I do my water fast and I do my 3day water fast because it's a detox and I was like you do all the things and that's really what you want is like if you're going to build a product like this you are advertising to these women in in in women across America who are like there's this demographic of women that will will buy all of these products and they will do the fast and they want to alkalize their body and I'm not even saying that this is all Bs like maybe it's all true maybe it's all false I have no idea like but they believe it's true and as an entrepreneur that's all that matters is that there are people that that are all bought in like they are bought fully into a lifestyle and in that lifestyle you could then tack on other angles so like you know who knew that water could be dead or alive I didn't that's a position that's a product positioning play right um you know who knew that you could um sell you know collagen and like all of these different angles to uh to to doing you know to improving the quality of somebody's Health in their body um and it's just can you tell a story if you could tell a story because she told me all the stories she basically played back to me you know ads Facebook ads that she's read you know and and then gone down the rabbit hole of reading about and if you could tell the right story that's fantastic like when Craig Clemens was on and he talked about probiotics and how he basically created the probiotics Revolution did you listen to that episode do you know that part no I didn't hear that part you've heard of probiotics probiotics were like a semi big deal have you ever heard of prebiotics Craig five minute abs CRA Craig Clemens taught the world about prebiotics yesterday when she was talking she was talking about prebiotics and I'm like you know my friend literally like created that word like there wasn't like maybe it existed but nobody knew about it and uh I don't know if you've seen this but Craig has this video that he created this this one ad that he he talked about on the Pod so I can share it here he created one ad called um The American Parasite have you you heard of this and like Joe Rogan tweeted it out he goes yo this video is freaking me out this is back then it's 15 years ago now the video is like hard to even find online I I found it but like there's a um this ad called Amer does look like a direct marketer video uh no this one looks a little different this looks like a TED Talk where uh you know like the have you ever seen the draw during a TED talk like there's a TED Talk voice but the hand is drawing on a whiteboard like what the guy saying it's kind of like keeps your attention and so he and Craig described this on the podcast he's like basically this went this this video went insanely viral and I've heard him share on other podcasts um so they they started with a with a long form sales letter and and they were selling these prebiotics and they did like 10K the first day they spent 10K and they they spent four or 5K they made 50k he's like holy [ __ ] they did that again did that again and they sold out within like a week so then they made a big bet they ordered they ordered a million dollars of inventory for uh for the Prebiotic because they believe believe that this thing would sell when it comes time and when they did it they relaunched it when they got inventory back in stock first day they did 500k in sales second day they did 600k in sales 1.1 million in sales in two days when this came back and he created this video sales uh this video ad it's a 30 minute basically documentary talking about how our food supply is [ __ ] up how it creates a bad you know like micro biome in your gut and how that that's like the he calls it the Great American parasite that is you know eating away you know it's it's ruining your health it's the reason you can't control your Cravings it's the reason you're gaining weight it's the reason for all your problems it's not you it's this parasite in your stomach and isn't that a convenient explanation that somebody wants to wrap their their arms around and so he took that and basically that thing was viewed like hundreds of millions of times people were sharing this like crazy this was back when there wasn't a lot of ads and so um the and people were a lot more willing to share on social media when they found an interesting video and so this thing went crazy uh to the point where he said that coke changed their formula for Diet Coke they took asame out on the because this video was causing so much like public like you know like awareness and an uproar over these like fake sugars that people were putting in things he's like and then over six months like Coke sales went down because Coke without as doesn't taste as good and then they put it back in like six to nine months later what was the name of Craigs Keybiotics was the name of his company back then oh and it how much did it make a lot of money oh my God so he kind of popularized or created the pre the Prebiotic Market in the United States that's insane yeah I'm looking at it now have you heard of um do you know ancient nutrition yeah that's the liver King guy no it's a different guy but company yeah no a different one uh ancient nutrition they've raised $100 million do so I have to imagine they're doing hundreds of millions in revenue and it started because this guy named Josh axe Dr axe is what his name was or his name is and he's got a of course it is of course his name is Dr axe it's Dr axe spelled like an Axe and he had a Blog and the majority of the blog at the time it talked about leaky gut and he would sell info products on how to fix the leaky gut and then eventually they were like all right let's actually make stuff and that's how ancient nutrition started uh and it's like a huge huge business but a lot of his whole thing was leaky gut and he helped popularize leaky gut the The Branding of leaky gut is like brilliant brilliant kind of like it's kind of like when people talk about doing a cleanse and they act like their blood is like a pipe and like doing a cleanse is like putting a pipe cleaner through it you it's like it's like I don't know if arteries work that way but image that now I automat yeah like I don't even know if that's true it probably even isn't but for some reason you've made me believe that that's how it is same with leaky gut you're like so like first of all I don't even know what a gut is is that your colon so like this organ that has poop in it is just leak leing to the rest of my body is that what you're saying of course that's a huge deal I don't want poison in my body and I I don't even know I have no idea if that's how it works if it doesn't work but they do a great job of making me believe it by because of that phrase leaky gut right right um yeah Scott Adams I forgot what he called it like he had these two words he said he said he had one that was called a linguistic kill shot and then he had another one that was about visuals um so what did he say I forgot what he called it but let's call it a visual kill shot like I think that idea of the pipe cleaner or the leaky gut these are visual kill shots it's uh words that make you see things and they're things you can't unsee once you've seen them right and it's like that's and and and you know he Scott Adams used to say Trump did this he called Jeb Bush when Jeb Bush was the front runner in the Republican debates because he's you know he's a bush and you know he's a whatever he was the governor of Florida or whatever the hell he was and there and then he goes low energy Jeb entired Jeb and basically every time you look at Jeb Bush from then on out you're like he does look [ __ ] low energy and it just like yeah sleepy Joe sleepy Joe right crooked Hillary right like she does not just like immoral Hillary or like uh you know whatever crooked it's a visual word right uh the wall it's GNA be a big beautiful wall right like he wasn't saying better border control policy he said we're gonna build a big wall beautiful wall biggest wall you've ever seen right like you have a visual of the Border being strong and protected and so like Trump was kind of a master at this [ __ ] and uh Scott Adams he's he's pretty interesting the way he um he described you know what what Trump was able to do with these visual kill shots okay well in one year we're gonna play the clip of you saying I'm not going to tell you now but we'll tell you in a year because I'm very eager now you've got me on the hook you've used you've used you've gotten me you've gotten me hooked and I'm so eager to know who it is I'm I'm eager to know everything about it um so I guess we'll end there and you got to come back and year and tell me done um all right that's the [Music] pod

today we are playing a drinking game on the podcast and we're playing never will I ever and it's a game where we're talking about all the mistakes that we made when we were selling our company and saying never will we ever make this mistake again and if you ever want to sell a company or you've sold a company if you sold a company you're going to be able to relate some of these mistakes I'm sure if you want to someday sell your company it's good to listen to so that you don't have to pay the same price that we did and make these mistakes so go ahead grab a drink we're playing never will I ever [Music] today we are talking about how to sell a company and in fact we're talking about how not to sell a company these are mistakes that we made uh selling our company so Sam sold the hustle to HubSpot and a big deal sold to a public company um I've had two exits now under my belt and I've sold one to a big company Amazon and one one to a small group of private buyers and every time you sell your company you learn a bunch of lessons but we're going to make this fun so if you've ever played the drinking game never have I ever we have a new drinking game for you MFM style right this is never will I ever and never will I ever is a game where we say never will I ever do blank again um because we made so many mistakes we made these mistakes so you don't have to we died so you don't have to here and if you listen to this you're going to be a lot smarter when it comes to selling your company Sam are you ready to play the game what are you drinking what's your drink I mean I only have a little bit left here but I got some greens the morning I'm looking a little athletic and I got some greens not sponsored but you know send me a free box yeah now save you 80 bucks a month um dude I have I have a ton of it I drink it once in a while it's really hard to stomach for me you like you could just drink that plain I love it plain and I love that it doesn't taste that great because to me I don't want my health [ __ ] tasting good right I don't like my hot people to be funny too I don't like when things that are not supposed to go together go together all right that guy Matt r that comedian no too good looking I'm not watching that special number one on Netflix no thank at all well you're pretty funny what does that make you pretty ugly as the world should be um all right what how do we want to go about this we have a bunch of points here which one you want let's start with the the most straightforward thing okay uh so never will I ever you both we both have this one ignore qsbs I'll drink to that yes now explain when you say ignore qsbs what happened here qsbs for those who don't know I didn't know about it until like a year before I sold my friend Jack Smith told me about it qsbs I'm going to try and state the law here but it says so it stands for qu qualified small business stock qsbs protects up to 10 10x of your investment from long-term capital gains taxes of $10 million or 10x your uh initial investment what that means and a lot of people only pay attention to the $10 million thing so with qsbs how long do you have to hold it your stock is five years yes so you hold a a small business stock so a privately held company that's a a C Corp and you have to hold it for 10 or five years and it has to be valued originally or the assets of the company which is the value has to be 50 million or less you hold it for 5 years and you can save1 million in capital G the first 10 million when you sell so like let's say you sell for 10 all 10 would be taxfree at a federal level and many states also honor qsbs not California but many states also do so you could walk away paying zero in taxes if you sold for $10 million which is remarkable or now here's the or part that a lot of people forget or you can save up to 10 times your investment whichever is greater the 10 times or the 10 million now what that means is let's say that theoretically you start as an LLC or you don't have a your company isn't value but let's say you start as an LLC and you convert to a C Corp and when you convert you value your company and it usually has to be done by a third party so it has to be reasonable you value your company let's say you're doing uh 15 million in Revenue let's say you're doing 20 million in revenue and you say great I think we're a $40 million company you get third party that does it so you can save 10 times $40 million in taxes $400 million that's a $400 million tax shield right there yes and I know friends that are doing this now this this this this law a lot of people don't know about it it's maybe besides real some real estate laws for tax savings in real estate it's probably the greatest thing there is it it's better better you think it's better it's better than real estate because in real estate you have let's say uh depreciation or the 1031 exchange these are great but they're deferrals whereas this is not a deferral this is simply you just have a you know you have a exclusion on 100% of your gains up to some number so it is way better than a deferral is way better than real estate I was talking to a real estate guy yesterday and I said I have the greatest tax thing that no real estate guy has what are you talking about real estate's the most tax advantage I say yes but you don't have qsbs because real estate is not eligible for qsbs there only certain types of businesses can do it but like like Sam saying you could stack it so for example what some people do they have qsbs for themselves but it's per tax return so you could do it for yourself you can create trusts for your kids and give each of them equity and then each trust gets a $10 million exclusion in addition to your own so you could have you know I was joking around with a qsbs guy and he's like yeah if you have three kids I can get you I can get you 40 million 50 million in qsbs and I was like I was like oh this kid I have you know this is next kid you I'm going to have this is this is just a walking qsbs Shield here like this is awesome and uh it used to be that it was that mean that your kid when they're but were your your kids at the age of 18 have say in control of your business with they're 18 I mean you ex exited by them by then right like but they're going to have but maybe not but they're going to have a just a small Equity say they're not going to get the majority right like you're just giving them enough so that they have a shield they have like you they have less less attx and you you while they're minors you control the state you can always you know sure I don't know I don't think what a lot of people having is like little kids that 18 years later are like succession hostile taking over like the company as they band together I don't I don't think that's the that's the thing to worry about and we'll wrap this one up by with there's a big asteris here which is this I don't like calling it a loophole because that first of all I hate that word loophole because loopholes are good loopholes are legal like when someone says a loophole I'm like okay but you're trying to spin this negative but like you're just following the law TR tie in a shoe without a loophole huh yeah yeah it's essential or people say shortcuts they're like that's that's a shortcut I'm like well I love shortcuts if I can arrive at the same destination just as safe and faster than a long cut I'm taking the shortcut uh but so this loophole there's an asteris here because I think two years ago it was it was up to vote if they were going to a it and the idea was they might make it only 50% or so they reduce it by um half uh I don't know if this is going to be in play for how much longer this is not like real estate where it's going to last forever right right yeah it it's but it's it's been out for a while um and it's it's amazing especially in the in the tech industry I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better all right so my turn never will I ever just shut down a company without trying to sell so well drink yeah have a drink for that I uh before I sold before my first exit I had built many companies many products before that and they all had reached some version of like you know an outcome some really had no no momentum some had like some momentum but not breakout and it was either wasn't worth our time or it wasn't able to get funding or whatever I specifically remember one app that we made that was if you remember bitmoji we had basically made an app that was like way better than bitmoji it just like and bitmoji was giving you an like a a personal ad little character for yourself that would be in these and then it would give you like kind of like these stickers that were in funny like positions or phrases we had made an app that was even better making the world a better place one emoji at a time exactly emojis are emojis are one of the greatest products ever right self- expression there um so you we had made an app that created a character of you um and then you could and then you could type any word you could just type hashtag whatever uh boogie down and it would make your character boogie down and we had every like whatever you could think of like you could put you could say hashtag single ladies and it would dress your character up like Beyonce right away doing the Single Ladies dance like whatever you could think of we would we had because we would just every day we would rank the top tagged term and our artists would create like hundreds of these per day so very quickly we had tens of thousands of combinations it was really fun because you could just type something and just to see does it do it or not and people did this we got half a million people to download the app in the first month they were just pounding like tons of these little stickers it didn't have great longevity but it had this like amazing novelty factor and we were trying to do it as its own messaging app which was too hard like people wanted WhatsApp they wanted Facebook Messenger they wanted all these things and I wrote this blog post called myund million dollar mistake because we took that and we said well this is not really sticky as a messenger it's not big enough where you're going to get all your friends to switch and and start texting you here people love the character they love these stickers we don't want to build a sticker company so I guess we'll just crumble it all up and just Kobe and just throw it away and um that was so dumb in retrospect what we should have done is taken that little app to all of the existing messaging companies and be like hey this feature is unbelievable building this is not easy we've already built it we've proven that people really like to do this look how many like the average person is doing 60 of these um you know just buy this and put this into your keyboard and shortly after bitmoji sold for $100 million do to Snapchat doing exactly that because they they couldn't make it as a standalone app either and um I have no idea why our Instinct was just to like just pivot just turn it off and pivot versus like take 30 days and have like five conversations even if it doesn't go through like you owe it to yourself after after you know nine months of hard work or a year of hard work uh and creativity on something so never will I ever just shut it down you said we got a 100 or sorry we got 500,000 downloads in 60 days and had a brief moment at number one on the charts before falling into mediocrity uh how much could you have sold this for easily tens of millions easily like you know you think it either wasn't GNA sell at all because there's only like eight buyers for this there was like eight me messaging app that were major at the time it was like line and kick and um you know WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger Snapchat there's you know there's eight players that like could benefit from something like this and either it just wasn't going to sell at all but like that's actually unlikely there's a price there's a kind of like a price for every buyer um the hard part would have been or team wouldn't have wanted to go with the acquisition and so we would have had to like either try to just sell the tech which is really hard or sell the whole company including the team and then disband for a year then come back together and we uh just you know we didn't but we the thing is we didn't even really get to that point like we should have gone and seen what our options were right like in in poker if you've already paid the blind well just see the Flop maybe you maybe something good will come out of it and we didn't do that did you by the way you're if you Google $100 million mistake Shan Perry there's uh you have a medium blog uh you've got a lot of good posts here so if you're listening go check it out did you not and this might bring me to my my point did you not sell because you're a main investor didn't give a [ __ ] no it it literally just didn't come up it's not like we had a conversation and one one side said yes one side said no and we debated it and then one side said no I have the voting control hell we didn't even think about it we just moved we literally had lunch and then we just moved on like it was just like it's the worst types of mistakes the worst types of mistakes are the ones where you didn't even really explore the possibilities you didn't even ask yourself what could I do here you just sort of quickly glossed over it didn't uh didn't even give it the thought to make a decision it was a non-decision decision that's like your third or fourth or fifth multi like T multi- tens of millions of dollars mistake the first one being not joining stripe as employee 30 or 50 or something like that and not selling this app and I think I think you might have a dude I'm I'm Shooter McGavin and Happy Gilmore when he says I eat pieces of [ __ ] like you for breakfast and then Happy Gilmore goes you eat pieces of [ __ ] for breakfast that's me i' I've made mistakes more expensive than your net worth it's like you've made mistakes like this it's like yeah multiple multiple um all right here I've got one never will I ever act desperate you have on here you will only have one option that is the way that not act desperate that is one way but when I was building my company I wanted an exit so badly like give me an analogy on the spot analogy you wanted an exit as bad as like a 12 like when I was 12 years 12 years old and like a cute girl like you know like complimented my braces it's like I want to close this so badly I'm emotionally invested if you don't like me no one will like me and I'm a piece of [ __ ] I was so desperate I had all of my personal uh net worth my emotional net worth tied into this exit and I acted like a little [ __ ] and one of the ways not to do this is to have multiple options that's the easiest most tactical one is to have lots of options the second one is you just don't you you basically to act like a hot girl you're like look I don't care like I'm going to be fine regardless and I remember there was one point do you track your like your finances somewhere I have like a a spreadsheet and I remember one day I just added like 10 million like you have like an other account so you can link all your accounts and I just had other and I just manually typed in $10 million and I would stare at that for like six months and it actually helped me believe that I already had it and so I was a little bit less desperate but I remember being desperate and when you are desperate you have zero power and when you have zero power that is the worst part to be in when you negotiate and the the best part when you can negotiate is to walk away and the and or to be able to walk away and to be able to walk away you typically just don't give a [ __ ] so you're just like passionate about whatever you're doing and you don't need the money or you have other options and I remember being desperate in that just like to that 12-year-old girl who was into me Aaron uh you know like they could sense it they could they could smell the the the the hormones on you like anyone could any hot girl could tell when you're being desperate they could tell what a confident man is like and I was not a confident man can you put your retainer back in please it's the same thing right yeah the um you nailed it in that last bit which is the rules the rules of a NE of negotiating when you are when you're trying to sell your company number one the most important rule is you must be okay if no deal happens meaning not just like I'll I'll be all right like you know like a funeral has happened but you the you know option one should always be we do no deal and we're totally fine I would love to keep going and whether that's true or not there is should be no grieving you convince yourself that that's true that you don't want your options to just be offer number one or offer number two because guess what offer number One's Gonna have some hair on it offer number two is gonna be a little shaky maybe fall through you're going to start to feel real desperate when offer two falls through and now it's only offer one on the table you always need the one option on the table that you can control which is I will keep running my company it will grow and just be bigger and better if I keep going and you have to convince yourself of that if you want to have a chance in these negotiations the second rule is in any negotiation the side that cares the least wins and so you have to be the one who needs the deal less than the other party and so whether that's true or not it's a mentality you must mentally need it less than the other side you must mentally care less than the other side that this deal goes through exactly as is if you could do that then you're in pretty good shape and you know which deal is the best deal the one that will actually close that's another huge learning not all deals are the same the one that will close to close a deal it's a really big deal to get an offer and go through diligence that's not nearly as big of a deal you and I have both gone through stuff where the offer was great and the the people buying were either disorganized they were [ __ ] they change their opinion something you want to do the deal that will close that is the best deal that that is one of mine as well I put uh never will I ever go with the highest offer sounds confusing like what do you mean why would you not take the highest offer you want to take the best offer not the highest offer and the best offer and the highest offer have a lot of differences the one of the differences what you just said likelihood to actually close will they do what they say they do they say they will do um I'll give you a story from the milk Road sale we had a high offer and then we had a fair offer and at first we were like hell hell yeah we got the high offer this is great but they they did a bunch of weird stuff though there was some red flags but hey D like you know like anything else you know when when something's really attractive that red flag this starts to look just like a it's like is that maroon actually maybe that's maybe that's orange you know like it's not so red you you start to overlook and talk yourself out of a bunch of things right so like what was one of those red flags can you say they had a lawyer that would jump on the call that refused to ever turn his camera on had no LinkedIn sent us a document that was like the term sheet that was like our lawyer was like there's no way a lawyer wrote this and we were like okay it's probably not good that their lawyer is not a lawyer but um we don't understand also why why they would not have a lawyer it's like it's this guy's friend he says he's a lawyer it's like so strange it's like you know they're not like scammers but is like can you just turn your camera on and uh you know like it was weird uh it was just like a little bit weird that was like one I think they sent you money didn't they then you were sent money we we went down the we took the offer and um there was a time to close but the again one of the stupid things they did they wrote the offer as when we signed the the term sheet which is not the deal is not closed you sign the term sheet uh they wired us all the money they had to wire us all the money on day one which again was like are these guys idiots why are they doing that that's not how this is supposed to go um but we were like well I guess we're getting money so like what what do you know and it was during that kind of closing period that we started to get a little sketched out and said look I don't think this is the right deal for us maybe we should just go back to options one we'll just keep running our company we don't have to do this deal so we wired back millions of dollars voluntarily because we had made the mistake of going with the highest offer first and the best offer is a combination of it's likely to close I'll tell you a funny story about that um the people involved are high quality and they're people you want to be around because it's not a uh sort of hit it and quit it you're never going to see these people again like business even if your deal is kind of like you walk away clear like I don't know the business world is actually kind of small you run into people they now own your company your brand like you don't want it in the wrong hands you'd rather do business with great people who you might do more business with in the future um which is what we ended up doing so the best offer is different now let me tell you a story about uh about um likelihood to close so we get this High offer and we're comparing the high offer with the fair offer and I call uh bology and people know bology you know he one of the smartest people on earth I call bologi I said bology what would you do if you were me and he's like well that's a higher offer um but let me ask you a question have a of course like intelligent people can get to the heart of the issue right away like he just like a metal detector just new and he goes are you negotiating these on the same time scale and I was like I don't know what that means he's like who did you talk to First and how far how long have you been talking to them and how long have you talking to the high offer I said well I've talked to the fair offer way earlier we've negotiated it renegotiated it they've done diligence and the high offer is new blah BL blah he goes okay so this is not the real offer and he's like um you need to apply a discount and I said well what do you mean and he's like well you you don't know if this deal is going to close you don't know if this number is going to stand you don't know if they're going to change their mind they say this is all fresh and a fresh deal is not the real deal and so he's like you need to just mentally apply some discount factor for if this even is going to be the final offer that gets sent to your bank account and so I was like okay so like 10% he's like tell me what you know about this person I told him everything I know he's like 50% and so we had to cut the offer by 50% mentally to to to you know compare apples to apples and that was of the best advice we got was that one piece of advice so now I always in any deal I have to ask myself what's the discount Factor here meaning How likely are they to close um have they done all their diligence yet have we already had the deal have we already negotiated this to a stalemate where kind of both sides feel like they've gone as far as they're willing to go because that's when you can reduce the discount when we were selling to HubSpot I remember the just like I said the the my contact the woman I was speaking with she sensed weakness and she sensed uh uh she sensed that I was in a tough Place emotionally and she and cuz I was constantly asking her were sobbing all right what else do you need where how do how do we move this forward yeah she could like she could she's like are are you laying down when you're talking to me like she just like sense that I was like laying on the floor and and the difference between what you did and what I did was two things one I sold to a a public company which meant basically the decision maker was not the CEO or the owner of the company it was the person who reported to the person who reported to the person who who reported to the person it was like four you know ladders down probably the decision maker the CEO was probably like they just saw it on their like board meeting every once in a while like you know quarterly and they're like okay cool whatever now can we talk about important stuff and this woman she was like look we don't care about you you know she basically said she's like our company is worth like 20 or 30 billion and this is a rounding air for us our reputation matters more than than this little deal and it would hurt it would hurt our reputation more than the than the cost of this deal in order to dick you around if we say we're going to do something we're going to do something now shut up and relax that's basically like what she was saying to me and I remember feeling that like I feel so much better and uh so I think there's a difference between selling to like like selling a small business to a soul proprietor or to a PE company or to a really large large strategic company I think the way that you deal with those sellers is different or buyers is different I'll tie that in I have never will I ever never will I ever assume the person I'm talking to is the person who's buying my company so this is when we sold to Twitch uh which is owned by Amazon I'm talking to Corp Dev as very easy to think I I'm assuming you're talking about somebody in corp Dev yeah in corp Dev she this lady was wonderful she was like my therapist for three months right and Corp Dev is very helpful they're they're the they're the router they're the project manager of any acquisition but they are not the decision maker and actually the thing you described I actually think is not that true meaning I actually do think there is a decision maker they are pretty high up it's either the CEO or it's the the VP or the SVP who runs like you know or somebody in the SE Suite who like matters to sign off on a on a transaction of of of you know a multi8 figure transaction that's not it's actually not uh it actually the decision actually does lad up but by Design these companies design it so you're never actually going to get to talk to that person because they need good cop bad cop they need the person whose job is it to move the transaction along or find out information and then that person can't actually be the one who's negotiating with you they're going to be like cool I'll go back and find out and that layer those layers of bureaucracy are actually a huge negotiating advantage that a startup typically doesn't have um unless you're working with bankers and whatnot where you where you do have an intermediary that's able to do that for you and so one of the most important things you got to figure out is who's actually buying this company it's not a company that buys a company there is a person in a company who needs something for their job and you have to figure out who is that person and what is the fire under their ass you know what is the thing that you know are they in trouble for their job and they need to do something because the competitor is getting ahead are they super strategic and they had a dinner with with somebody and they they had an epiphany and now they're they're Steve Jobs they're a Visionary and they're trying to make that Vision come true you need to fit that story like um you know you have to figure out who is that person in the company and what is the fire under their ass if you ever if you want to have a chance of being able to sell a company because you're selling to that person that champion alone not to a multi-billion dollar Corporation right and and so the buyer really matters and understanding what motivates them a lot of times the people in corp Dev they just want to keep their jobs and they want to look good and so as a seller you have to sell a company and you have to make them look great you have to make it easy for them to look wonderful you you have such different incentives they are just trying to not fumble the bag you are trying to get your first bag and you are going to behave totally differently and you're going to Value different things and if they ever said to me something like oh this is kind of a rounding error or like you know this is we're huge this is not this is not a this you know this is a small small piece of it I'd be like cool round up the price just went up 10 million then right like you know if if this money don't matter to you it matters a hell every dollar of this matters to me and so maybe we have the price wrong actually then uh let's get the price right before we we continue all right like that is um and by the way you saw this uh we just renegotiated our deal with HubSpot and like you know without going into the you know the guts everything matter everything mattered and you saw how I approached that me and you have very different approaches to negotiation what did you see or describe describe that so this is like a Midwest value thing which is if if I order a steak and you send me out a pizza I'm just going to shut up and eat it and I ain't going to complain the way that you did this steak tastes different yeah yeah I love my steak with mozzarella and uh pasta sauce this is exactly how I like it you handled it differently and I and frankly I I I that was uh one of that was a an example when I learned from you I think you said something great you said um whoever can be most uncomfortable will win and you needled these [ __ ] guys for everything and in my head I was like what why who gives a [ __ ] and you're like this word needs to be that and I'm like what are you doing and and you were like it all matters it all is really important and frankly you got your way uh at least for the big important stuff and when you got your way I got my way too to get the negotiation done both sides have to get their way but you have to figure out what really matters to them and what really matters to us and those two things are not going to line up and you need um like Sam Alman you he's he's all in the news right now and he said something great about negotiation uh he goes I am not interested in binary negotiations there's nothing interesting there where it's just a number and you want it to be lower and I want it to be higher that's just a tug that's just a tug of war that's like you know that's not interesting that's not a sport it's like slap fighting versus MMA right like the slap league is literally just one guy standing there with no defense and one guy's gonna SM slap him as hard as he can it's kind of interesting to see but like it doesn't have the same uh it's not as satisfying to to to the sophisticated Barbarian like us who likes you know UFC instead and so um the sophisticated Barbarian cares about a u a nonzero sum negotiation and so it's like how do I give them what what's that French word jqa what is that what is that all right am I saying that right there's an art there and so you have to figure out what are the things they really care about that I only kind of care about one of the things I really care about that they only kind of care about how do we all get what we want in order for this to work um but you're right that I was willing to be more uncomfortable than you or maybe most people just because I don't know this is our baby and this is like one line item for them but this is like our this is like the basis of what we do and it has potential to be like such an awesome part of our lives like uh you know I have to get this right this is my kid it's like you know my kid versus uh you know how my teach how when they go to school how a teacher is going to teach treat my kid like they care but not the same way I do about my baby right it's different there's levels to that and so uh yeah you know the the party that's willing to be more uncomfortable generally will win or the way my dad taught me was the more stubborn person wins in any negotiation uh can I tell you a dad negotiation story yeah so I worked with my dad for about um nine months I think in my life and I I I'm really happy and your dad does everything right he's like like he does projects he started as engineer lowly engineer and he has like you know he is like office space or like Dunder Mifflin or something like he was sitting in his cubicle and he kept getting patents so his wall had like 22 patents on the wall um but his salary stayed the same and he's like how come like you know this like the guy who dresses up nice he works with me for six months I get this patent he gets promoted I stay here like wait am I in the wrong job so it took him 10 years to figure that out he's like maybe I should move to the business side he works at a he works at BP for like 30 40 years and he finally like leaves and he does then he started doing more entrepreneurial things one of which was uh we both worked together in this company in Australia and and um when we were working there I got to see my dad in action and like it's so funny like you see your dad at home and Dad's at home are just like these like totally different creatures when they're like done with work for the day I had to see him like interacting with other people especially for an immigrant Dad it's like it's like oh you have this level of Polish why at home do you turn into just like a caveman um and so I got to see him just act totally differently and one of the things that happened was they uh we were negotiating with uh this other party the other party was was this slick talking Australian guy who literally looked like Leonardo DiCaprio This Guy's on like the Australian CNBC every week and he's super polished just an amazing talker and I just think oh my God my dad's I'm gonna have to get watch my dad get beat up in this negotiation this guy's like Mr Mr Charisma Mr Smooth everybody already loves him the decision maker loves him and they want one thing we want another uh my dad's you know this PO you know this Indian guy who can barely you know he forgets to add the connecting words and sentences he's just going to get walked all over this this thing and then they walk in and this guy's got like binders of like you know spreadsheets presentation like he's got everything prepared my dad has nothing doesn't even have like a pen on him and the guy that guy makes his case first he kind of passes it around he's like here's what I think we should do and I want to run the project and give me the funding and here's what we're going to do with it it's going to be great everybody's like this is super well put together thank you so much blah blah blah and um it's my dad's turn and my dad basically kind of like refuses to speak and then he starts to speak and I'm like where's The Logical argument he's not like using any logic he's just saying no I'm not doing that I want to do this and I'm not doing it if we're doing it that way and then they're like you know but Raj we have like you know this plan it makes sense look I know you're not getting the exact Equity you want you're not getting to run it but like this guy will run it but you this makes sense right and my dad's just like foot on the table he's like I'm just telling you right now it's not happening never not happening and I'm like what are you doing like you're not even backing up your words you're just saying no and you're just refusing you look like such a stubborn idiot and he just acted the fool for like an hour and uh they were like this is going nowhere and they walked out and I was like dude you blew it and he's like no that went perfectly and I was like what do you mean and he's like uh he's like oh I could never compete with that guy he's like you know super charismatic and he he has all the facts on his side I was like so what's your your plan is what he's like oh I'm just going to the most powerful word negotiation no he's like I'm just gonna say no I'm not doing it I'm not doing it that way and I'm not gonna I don't need to explain why I'm not doing it and actually I'm offended that it's going this way I'm pissed off and actually I might blow this whole thing up and uh he's like you know I only have one piece of Leverage which is that they need me to play along in whatever we're going to do here like it's gonna be hard for them to replace me in this thing so I'm just going to say no and I learned so much that day he told me he goes the more stubborn guy in the room did they come back yeah of course come back they came back and in fact the exact opposite happened by the end of the whole thing we negotiated this deal and like you know there's just kind of like okay let's take a break we'll go get the yeah yeah we what were you doing I was there I was where's the moral support and um they leave the room to take like a break or they're printing out the papers or whatever and my dad turns to the middleman guy he goes so how what do you think he goes he goes I think we're playing poker but all the chips are on your side of the table now and actually my dad made a mistake which was that he negotiated it way too hard and took all the value in the end and then they then they realized it and they were like you know what we let this stubborn idiot take the whole thing the whole enchilada like No And they went back to no and we actually ended up more like at a 50-50 deal but if if he had just given a little bit back you always want to kind of give back at the end uh where they feel like they have something to lose he took it so far he wanton them go so badly that they at the end had nothing to lose in the negoti in closing the deal they're like well what do I have to gain by closing this deal nothing it's just all all the values going to him at this point and so he had taken a little too far but I'll never forget that idea that you know the in any negotiation it is not the side that has the better argument or the more or more logic it's Whoever has more leverage number one and then within that you're that's like the the the substance and then you have the style and the style is whoever's a little more stubborn and a little more crazy a little more irrational that is uh to your advantage in a negotiation we got to have your mom and dad on the Pod I think we we've heard a lot of stories about them um all right I'll do we'll do water two more uh here's a really easy and simple one never will I ever be disorganized and I'll give you an example of that we changed payrolls like three different times it was like Gusto and then ADP and then like zenefits and then Rippling because Rippling can track your computers uh like when you give out computers or Gusto pays two days later so I can keep the cash for two it was so stupid and here's why it's so stupid when you selling a company for 30 million and 300 million it's the same thing basically as in a lot of times when you sell a business let's say I don't know what that threshold is it could be 10 or 15 million but when you sell a company for 300 million and 15 million they basically give you this Excel sheet and it has five pages and each page has literally 50 bullet points and each bullet point is a big deal for example one bullet point will be under the HR Tab and it will say show me the payroll for the last five years or show me um every contractor you've ever hired yeah add the Contracting agreement you have with every single contractor including the confidentiality it's like H we don't even have that yet like yes yeah and here's why it's a big deal when you switch Pay Here's a very specific example when you if you just use one payroll that's easy you just click export that's easy but I didn't and so I had a and then if you know if it's been three years you have to call zenefits be like I don't have access to my account anymore do you guys even have these records and I thought this was stupid and I was like I remember telling Kip the CMO of HubSpot I was like Kip I used Fiverr one time I paid $150 out of my PayPal account I even paid it personally and he's I was like why does this matter and he's like well you know I can't hire B baller 84 on Fiverr because and that goes against fiverr's terms of service and that would be like I can't I have to make sure that everything was by the book because every little thing matters and and that made a lot of sense to me but I was a fool and I was disorganized I would use PayPal for some stuff every once in a while I would just venmo someone I'd be like here's 500 bucks thanks for the freelance or I wouldn't track uh confidentiality agreements it was a [ __ ] mess I used Google drive to store some stuff Dropbox the store some it was a mess and I'm telling you when you're selling a company for what I sold it for I only had 40 employees and you can't tell anyone that you're selling the company so it was basically me and Edie this woman who worked with me and we went through all of these documents to find all of this [ __ ] and it literally took three months to find documents that's and three months working every day for 12 hours today it is so hard to get all the documents it is so challenging and you don't want to give them anything that's messy otherwise you'll look not buttoned up and if you look not buttoned up they'll say what else are you missing or like are you lying about something and you need a present things in a really nice orderly fashion and so start being organized from day one is really really important and not like being a Maverick and being like I'll just here I got 20 bucks I'll pay you for this I'll use PayPal for this uh like it's a mess well I got to drink to that because I made that same mistake no surprise I'm like the most disorganized guy on Earth and uh you know I made mistakes like I thought uh you know hey start up you guys got to move fast don't waste time incorporating and getting trademarks and um doing all that and you know that could be the difference between long-term capital Gams and short-term gains or having to you know explain why you know the IP is over here but it should be over here um or you know we made a mistake of um did you mail in your 83b uh one year I did and for one company I just didn't do it and I was like I was like oh I gotta like go to the post office and I just didn't do it now luckily that company failed and I didn't have to pay the price of that but like you know in the 83b election basically but if anybody doesn't know is like a you can basically get shares in a company and you can tell the IRS hey tax me now this year on the gain of these shares um because I'm gonna exercise them now it's like $100 I'm gonna exercise these shares now um tax me you know so it's like the original strike price was one cent and then they're valued at one and a half cents and so you're like tax me today on that gain so that I've exerise the shares at this price so that when I sell I don't have to uh pay this huge markup on the on the exercise of the and you only have like 30 or 60 days to mail it in and you basically literally have to write a letter is it 90 days you have to write a letter and you want to like postmark it and then you want to like you you write in the letter like send me a receipt of this it's like a really manual process and you're like dear IRS please send me proof that you received this and you have to store that in your records in case you all ever get audited and I think now this like I think there's some automation around this but yeah I I was messy about that uh you know I had this great meeting when I wanted to sell my company didn't know how and I went and I met with five people who had sold multiple companies and I was like okay hey I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm doing here um can I explain to you what I'm currently doing and then you tell me what I'm doing that which which parts point out the dumb Parts okay can you do that because I was like if I just ask you for your advice who knows what to say but if I draw you a picture of what I'm doing and you can point to the ugly part that'll help me and so that's I did I had uh lunch with this guy fad and uh he's the CE of this company called array now he had sold I think he sold like five companies or some [ __ ] like that and um he pointed out two mistakes that I was making number one he goes uh he's like oh wow you got like okay you have an actual offer on the table and I was like yeah dude it's been so hard such a long road you know even though it only been like 40 days when I was like dude yeah it's just been ups and downs but finally we're here and I was talking like I arrived at some destination he goes he's looked at me he's like this is not over actually you just reached the starting line now it's time to Sprint and and I've repeated that advice to so many people of now it's time to Sprint because so many times this happened let's say you're fundraising for a company and you spend you know three months try a fund raise you finally get money in the bank and you're so happy So Satisfied your whole body just wants to relax it's like oh you no welcome to the start of the race now now it's time to run you ready to run and like the work starts especially true when it comes to closing uh uh m&a it's like when you have the op what a lot of people don't realize is it it it takes from getting the offer to actually getting the money that can take six months that could take for me it took they emailed me in they emailed me in September or October I got paid in February yeah exactly three months six months is a very common and so you um yeah that's the time to spit the hardest the second thing he said was he goes um show me your data room and I was like oh uh we have a Google drive but like it's kind of messy right now and he goes um he goes you're selling your company think of it like a product on Amazon how does Amazon sell a product I'm like there's like a page and a one like a oneclick buy he goes exactly you need to turn your entire company into a giant buy button and I was like what is that he's like you need to like answer all the questions now get it all organize now put it all in place now so that when they look at this stuff they are ready to oneclick buy if the more questions they have to ask you the more you have to go dig stuff up the more half or incomplete information you have uh to give them the more reasons that this deal could fall apart turn your company into a giant buy button that's the other advice I've get given which is like what are all the the Ducks I can line up here so that this just becomes a you know easy to understand easy to consume uh you know process for them and like it was the one you know 30-day period of my life where I became Marie condo I organized the [ __ ] out of my company I took everything I was like look this need needs to be bulletproof and uh I'm so glad that I did cuz it was it was extremely necessary do you want to do one last one yeah oh by the way I have one never will I ever uh run my company like a personal piggy bank so uh I made this mistake before and I have a story of a friend of ours who uh made this mistake before so what a lot of people do when they run their company is you start to make some money and then you're like oh I have to pay taxes and then they're like [ __ ] taxes suck and you're like what can I do to like reduce my spend it all like I think smart people um smart people have like tax stuff they do so what let me let me start doing some tax stuff I like okay what's the tax stuff and they're like oh let me uh uh like we talked to a guy recently that was like oh I created my own captive insurance program and then I bought this property that we're using as like a office and I'm like I what are you doing you're trying to save like 200 Grand of taxes and what you're doing is actually you're ruining your books so like when I looked at his business the business looked like it had no profit and he's like you know so happy that he's has this like shitty margin shitty net profit margin because in that year it saved them on taxes but the reality is if you're building a company that you want to sell you need to take some short-term pain of having clean simple books that you pay you know legit taxes on in order for you to have a big exit at the end because they're going to see a track record of multiple years of solid profits that that you're going to sell in the end right like that is just generally better there's of course exceptions to both cases but like generally that is a better approach we have and if you don't want to sell there's a there is like a [ __ ] category on QuickBooks that you could put stuff into but that is not ideal if you're trying to sell yeah exactly is if you're trying to sell you want to you want to be able to show a track record of of success and uh versus like you know I had a friend who would go to the bank on December 30th and take out a bunch of cashiers checks that they were going to use to pay vendors and it's like um prepay vendors for the next year and then the next year they're like ah I want to quit this vendor but I've already prepaid them or they'll like take two of the checks and never even pay and put it back in the bank a month later hope nobody notices it's like dude just don't do this [ __ ] like don't treat your company like a personal piggy bank if you want to sell this someday because nobody wants to buy your hot mess and um I think it's very and you can't undo that you you can't really unwind that these are like it's in the it's in the history books every year that you're doing that you are kind of like making your you're adding a bunch of asteris to your own books that like you need a buyer who's willing to go and do a bunch of ADB backs and try to figure this out in order to feel confident that they should buy this business when Dave poroy sold you know he sold BARC Sports a couple times but the first time he sold it he was like I was an idiot he's like I owned a racehorse that I bought through barol Sports and so bar stool Sports owed like two racehorses uh a trailer for the racehorse uh they owned like the house I was in like he said all the stuff that the business owned and he's like we got docked so hard 000 L of Jin that we acquired like yeah that's what he said he's like he's like chin didn't want to buy like Skippy the racehorse um but the business owned it and we it was really hard you know when he first sold that business he sold the first portion of it and at the time barol was a big deal he only sold it at a $15 million valuation crazy when it was worth way more than that and it's probably because it was he was just sloppy uh a lot of it was sloppy and he was like I also like made so much profit and I didn't put any of the profit back into the company I just would buy horses and [ __ ] like that and gamble he's like we gambled like crazy because it was content um is that it I got one more never will I ever just just stay at home when there's a deal to be closed so this is the rule of just get on a plane go meet go meet people in person don't do Zoom calls or if you're doing Zoom calls add in the inperson afterwards uh the in-person meetings are so important um you know I'll I'll tell one story which was uh just a deal we closed recently uh the you one deal that we didn't close that I got on a plane for and like you know for me I my the running joke on the spot is I don't leave my house and it's true I really don't leave my house I don't like to do that I got little kids and I don't know it's for our family life it's very disruptive to travel if I go if I leave the house for like five days or whatever but I did for this one deal it didn't the deal didn't go through but I could sleep easy at night cuz I'm like I did everything like I made multiple offers on this deal I got on the plane I met them in person like you know we did everything that we could we could do we did what was in our control um with a deal that we just recently did the other party was like cool like after the initial conversation of Interest they were like cool uh would love to just next chat would love to do it in person I'm happy to fly out to you wherever you are let me know which day works I'll fly in same day fly out same day it it'll be easy um and I was like I respect this person and I trust doing business with this person because they understand this principle of like you just got to get on a plane and you got to go meet somebody and you should be willing to do that when we sold the milk Road I had a similar situation where we um remember I told you about the high offer and the fair offer we had said no to the fair offer took the high offer then regretted it so we went back to the fair offer months later and we were like uh I was like you know what I want to see what those guys are up to and see if there's a deal to be done here and uh I kind of called or emailed and it was sort of like we just had like a quick I texted I think and it was like really wasn't an opening but I was like hey I'm going to be in the city tomorrow um you know for my niece's soccer game um so I was like I'll go see my niece's soccer game but I'm gonna I'm really doing this to meet you but I made it sound to him like I was going to the soccer game and I was like uh y we love to catch up he's like yeah great let's do it and so we drive into the city um car breaks down on vaness and my car literally just shuts off in the middle of the road your car breaks down car shut uh I don't know what happened the car stopped stopped driving and I like and the momentum to let me just get it to the side of the road but I'm there with my don't you have like a brand new Escalade this is the BMW before that so um this is you know I'm with my wife my two kids are in the back in the car seats car's broken down I got this meeting in you know 10 minutes and um I'm like [ __ ] I guess I got to cancel this meeting and whatever who like who knows what if this meeting anything would have even come of it anyways but like whatever we'll wait for AAA and my wife is like no you got to go you told you've been telling me all morning how this is an important meeting like you think that you have a feeling that you could be able to to get this deal back on like you know go and um I was like I'm just not g to leave my wife and kids on vanest in San the middle of San Francisco in a broke down car and she's like just go we'll be fine I was like okay you don't have to tell me twice and so I hop out and uh I literally run I I run down vanest like you know a mile basically get to the coffee shop meet the guy deal comes back to life by the end of that coffee meeting and we ended up selling to them and and I'm like I I think I'm I'm actually like 100% sure if I hadn't gone to that coffee meeting that deals doesn't happen and um because in that meeting we were able to clear up some things that like were not as exact transactional but like you know kind of what his fears were and what our hesitations were and really kind of sus it out and get get comfortable with each other in person so yeah insane insane that that happened and uh this is like a this is like an anti-ad for BMW yeah don't trust them yeah don't trust them they'll ruin your deals um well that's sick um hopefully people dig this we did a little Q&A for this episode except on one topic I think we're going to keep doing these every other Tuesday right yeah we're trying to come up with great topics that we can kind of shoot the [ __ ] on and share maybe you know either our answers or uh stories that that we've been through so I think that's good I think people like this one but let us know let us know in the YouTube comments what you think all right well well and there and that's the pod

when we got acquired by twitch the top streamer on Twitch was this guy named ninja he got sponsored by Red Bull he was on TV all the time and then Microsoft came and paid ninja like 20 million dollar to leave twitch and go over there and we lost our biggest streamer overnight and I said well that's probably the A+ problem right now so what did I do I dropped everything I was doing and I started working on that but I wrote a memo I said hey it looks like he left here's some data analysis on how big of a problem that is here's my strategy recommendation on what we should do and I just sent it to the CE he put me in three group chats right away which were like the exact teams that were working on that and he's like hey Sean's in on this and they're like why he's supposed to be doing this other thing it's like he has good thoughts on this and so there's a way to work on the A+ problem even if you're in a big company or if you're an entrepreneur by definition you should always be working on the A+ problem it's forced

all right what's going on this is Sam we've got an awesome episode today we have Andrew Wilkinson on the Pod Andrew is one of our good buddies Andrew owns this company called tiny tiny basically started as like this agency that made a bunch of profit and he took those profit and he's bought like 18 or 20 different companies and he took tiny public I think today it's trading in the $600 million market cap so he's got like a really good perspective on what's going on in life um during this episode I think it's the the like with 20 minutes left in the episode he's actually said something that I'm I'm sitting here taking notes it's going to change my business it's about the this thing called The Profit first uh mentality and he goes in in depth on how much money he leaves in each business and how the CEOs are able to operate him it's really insightful stuff that I haven't really heard him talk about before and then also Andrew is interesting to me because Andrew is my close friend but he's very wealthy and I get to ask him all types of questions uh kind of like behind the-scenes stuff on how he spends his money he talks about how he's now a patient of PETA who's this famous doctor and how much he's spending on that and and and the outcome of that I find it very interesting he talks about shooting his shot with his hero so he's done business with guys like Bill Amman who's a you know worth 10 or2 billion is a hedge fun guy and he talks about how he met Charlie Munger who's uh Warren Buffett's partner and so there's really interesting insights on a how he lives his life but how he got in the doors that he did when he was still up and coming really fascinating so this is the episode with Andrew Wilkinson let me know what you guys think you can hit me up on Twitter the S par and let me know if you enjoyed [Music] it [Music] all right what's up we got the man Here Andrew Wilkinson fan favorite guest of the Pod um welcome Andrew how's how's it how's it going hey guys I'm good so you gave us like a list of like ideas and things that you're kind of messing with but you have this thing on here about sexy versus non-sexy things and you're like the things that everyone loves on the outside they're the hardest ways to make a living and so you you said here that I didn't know this I I or maybe I did I knew you owned a bakery is you said you own a deli and a bakery is that two separate things or is it one thing no that's combined that's one and it's a pain in the butt total pain in the ass so yeah um been thinking about this a lot lately because I think when you talk to young entrepreneurs they they always want to do something sexy and I was like that too like I was a product CEO right you think every CEO kind of has their thing and for me it was making great products so when I was running software companies and stuff I'd always be thinking oh when we release this new feature that's when everything will take off or uh you know when we get this partnership or you know whatever big announcements I think flashy but one of the things I've realized after running a company for like 20 years is it's really not the sexy stuff that pays off um you know for example like we have a bunch of companies um and you know one increased prices 30% after not increasing prices for 5 years they Mass massively grew profits right that took 10 minutes a little bit of planning um and that paid off big um you know one significantly reduced shipping cost by sizing down packaging um you know another realized hey we've got insane SEO on certain keywords and now we can drive affiliate Revenue uh you know one had a bunch of customer gift card deposits and they were like oh [ __ ] we can invest these in t bills and make 5% makes 500 Grand a year of just pure profit I just love these boring things like that and I've realized that it's kind of sad like you know I grew up being like Oh yeah I want to be the next Steve Jobs or James Dyson or something but the things I'm actually good at are these really really boring I call them like lever pulls you get in you pull a lever and revenue or earnings just grows you know by X per. this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated W I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from 3 days ago I totally missed HP spot grow better you know the good thing about that is that the older you get the more like appealing those get and so for example like this also is just in life like you know I've never seen a couch I don't like you know the older I get I'm just like yeah it'd be nice to sit right now and I feel like the same thing happens in business where I used to think I wanted to pull off some like awesome feat of like creativity and hard work and I actually very rarely want to do that there's times but most of the time I'm like oh what's the simplest thing I could do that will just make this work better and you were the king of that you you were the king of that you you owned a video streaming startup that were you were like to the moon or nowhere uh and you spent like five years or four years doing it I mean building crazy computer vision features and all this stuff even before AI became like you know really big and and the reality was like we had this other business called Birthday alarm birthday alarm was like a reminder of it's your friend's birthday today and it would send them a Cheesy e-card you know if you pay $9 a year and that business had been printing cash millions of dollars every year for like 15 plus years I think it started in 2001 and I'm this was like I was working on it like in 2016 2018 so like you know 18 years later and and um we we were like you at one point we finally got our senses and we were like why don't we make birthday alarm like a little bit better like uh it pays all the bills we could just improve it right and even then the team was like list of ideas rewrite the whole thing in the new like you know make it rewrite it in JavaScript oh it's written in this old like language because that's what was hot in in 2001 we got to rewrite the whole thing and then when we do that we'll be able to make it so much cooler we'll add these new features we'll redesign it we redesigned it our designer spent mockup after mockup on like making it cleaner and more minimalist and more cool or whatever and I tell you what after a year of doing all that [ __ ] there was really only two things that made a difference um number one we raised prices uh so you raise prices by 30% exactly what you said Andrew because the prices hadn't gone up in 15 years you just delete the zero and the $20 a month and change that to a five so it's 25 a month exactly and then the second thing was um we implemented stripe instead of the old payments platform because stripe had a feature where if somebody's credit card expires and they get a new one like an they you know their credit card company gives them a new one it would mess up your subscription and there the stripe has a feature for for 25 cents they would just update it with the new card automatically without the user having to C type anything in and that one that like one feature is like a you know seven figure feature that took honestly no work on we just check a box on on stripe to be like yeah we want that we'll pay the quarter for every time you do that and um you know we made like an extra million dollars a year of profit just off of that one thing basically and uh it was a big lesson learned of like you know the the link between effort and result is uh so much more disconnected than you think and uh the more mature you get the more you realize like you should just work backwards from what's actually going to work not like what's the cool or or difficult thing to do these these things too they're so often they one day of work right like we had a similar thing we had this um invoicing software about 10 years ago called Ballpark and um it was the first SAS uh product that we built and we realized we were doing like I think a100 million of payment volume through the credit card processing so you know I send Sam an invoice for 10 grand and he has the option to pay on credit card and we just marked it up too and I think that was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to us and I remember it was like 10 minutes for me I was like going through stripe and realized there's this setting and I checked a box and suddenly we make way more money so I think um this stuff is super powerful and I mean like just to tell to like give an example so um you know Sam mentioned so I own like a deli and a bakery and when I was a kid there was this uh Bakery down at the end of my street that I would always go to on the weekends I'd go and get a croissant and have a coffee and sit and listen to a podcast or something and I knew the owner my brother worked there um the owner would pay me like 10 bucks an hour to fix his computer and about eight years ago he comes to me and he's like hey I'm going to sell the business I want to make sure it goes into good hands will you buy it and I don't know anything about the bakery or anything but I kind of want to protect this like cool neighborhood institution and so and you want to be like a big shot you want to be like oh yeah come hang out of my place you know like would you like some of my bread yeah totally there's like there's always like a pride of ownership right like if I tell someone let's say like locally I'm like hey I own this huge social network for graphic designers dribbble they're like you know eyes glaze over they don't care but if I say oh I own otavio like the local bakery that everybody goes to with their kids they're like whoa that's so cool so there's a lot of Pride ownership but there's like 30 or 40 employees um you know we have to have meure like a baker wakes up at 2 in the morning to bake the croissants a million different things have to go right to serve a customer and have them have a good experience right and this business is like you know it goes from making money one month to losing money for six months um you know T huge swings if like one person quits it messes up everything super complicated to operate um and if we're lucky at the end of all of that we'll maybe make 150 Grand a year now on the flips side we bought a business about almost 10 years ago called weworkremotely.com and it's very simple it's a job board people pay money to post like a Blue Link kind of like uh Craigslist so you're hiring remote you post on we work remotely uh it would be like you know I'm hiring a developer for you know automatic or whatever so we were when we bought that business they were charging $1.99 and it was run by the guys from base camp and they just didn't do any marketing or promotion didn't do any SEO so we buy the business uh we pay three or four times earnings or something which was you know a fair price given what it was doing um we immediately take the price from $1.99 to 99 because that's what all the other job boards were charging and we hire an SEO consultant we started doing SEO we started doing email marketing that business went from doing about 400k of profit to I think a couple years ago it did 4 million of IA or something in that range so these in that business that had two employees and one or two part-time contractors right and literally like the entire team could go pens down for 6 months and it would still keep printing cash and so you look at it and it's like business on har hard mode versus business on easy mode but the inexperienced entrepreneur would look at the bakery and go ooh sexy right and it's like online there's bakeries too right e-commerce businesses are bakeries in my opinion how much of uh what was uh so for those who don't know Andrew he took his kind of his holding company took public I think today it's trading many hundreds of millions of dollars five or $600 million doar what were your earnings that you reported for last quarter or what's like the public uh record for your annual earnings I think it was between 30 and 40 that's like the public number I think but what's crazy is that we work remotely would have accounted for something like 10 or 15% of of you know this company worth hundreds of millions of dollars of your guys' earnings that's pretty wild well I think a lot of people forget that small things can get big right we grew that we took that business uh from 400k we basically 10x it and we we bought that business I think for about 1.5 million right so it's pretty it's pretty wild how powerful this stuff can be when you see a business where they're just not they're myopic on something they're not doing the best practices and often it's because they have other priorities I mean the base camp guys had aund million do AR SAS business the last thing they're going to be thinking about is this little pimple on their ass this you know remote job board uh so buying buying from someone like that is a great opportunity I was talking to one of your company uh CEOs last night and um they mentioned this profit first book which I think is interesting uh Sam do you know about this everyone is talking about that Andrew told me about it months ago and since then I've seen like eight or nine friends bring it up I don't know what it's about though I'll give you my take and then Andrew you you fill in the gaps because I haven't read the book but I was like can you just explain it to me in 5 seconds and then they explained it to me in 5 seconds and I was like oh got it and that makes a ton of sense so here's the the the ultra I haven't read the book version of of the book which is in a normal business you get Revenue Topline and then you start you know you get your gross profit so like a revenue minus what it took to sell it to sell those goods and then you have like all these other expenses and then what what's left is like the profit at the end so profits at the end normally and then you sort of take a distribution out of it that's probably how you ran the hustle yeah or you take no distributions because you're just paranoid um and that's how I run my e-commerce business and I think what the profit first mentality is you take the gross profit and you put that in your bank account and then as you have bills to pay you literally put it in your bank account or figuratively you literally move it you move it into a profit bank that you don't you don't see you sweep it out of the company got it you sweep it out of the company then the company gets a bill from some vendor or some software and then you have to go back and you have to now take money out of that pocket and pay it and there's something psychological about when you just accept the waterfall of expenses and you're like I guess I get what's left you sort of leave the fat in the company versus if I paid you out everything and then I said hey Sam um it's GNA be eight grand to use this software or whatever like eight grand for this I don't want to I have to take eight grand out of my pocket and pay for this you start to question a bunch of these expenses and it sort of forces you to get lean even though nothing changed except for the order of operations but does that ruin growth does that like does that ruin when you see an opportunity and you want to pounce on it like well no because you would just you would just you'd take that money and you'd invest it back into the company and first Andrew did I did I bastardize it or was that was that accurate description I think you nailed it I mean um the way to think about it is like if you want to lose weight you know there's that all these um psychological experiments where they give people food on different sizes of plates and the bigger the plate the more they eat because psychologically you know they got to get through all that food so the idea here is smaller plate so yeah you if you make a hundred bucks you you immediately take away 30 and people are just forced to eat off a smaller plate and so they eat less and they're more thoughtful about expenses but how do you do the math to figure out how much cash to leave in the bank well I think you would always say that um let's say that your business historically has run with a 30% net profit margin you would always scrape out 30% and over time if there's excess cash they're more profitable you keep increasing that threshold right because you want to be running as as um as optimal as possible one of the weirdest things I've noticed in business is that everybody all CEOs seem to go you know what 25% profit that's good let's Le you know that that's what we should manage to yeah that's how I feel I do that what I've seen is that some of our businesses historically not at all times can operate with 80 or 90% net profit margins and if we got a dreamer in there right if we got a CEO like me from 20 years ago or Sean from 20 years ago we'd be going going oh let's innovate let's do all these new things and they'd burn through all that cash so I think it's a way of creating discipline now we haven't actually implemented this I've gone to all the CEOs and asked them to read it and some of them have got excited and implemented it but um I think it's a really interesting framework especially for smaller companies our buddy uh suly does this so I was like how much working because like our Ecom bank balance is getting bigger I was like how much should I leave in there versus uh you know distribute out um and he was like I just distributed it all out and I was like all of it like what about like three months of working capital and he's like okay you can leave a month or two but he's like people act like you can't just put money back in the bank account like you can always put money back in the Banky there's no penalty for this and he's like I think you have way better discipline when there's not this huge bank balance sitting there and uh you know and I was like oh okay I guess you're right there is no like penalty or you know for just sending the money back into the bank account when it's needed but you will question is this really needed and why is this needed and what happened last month that is leading us to in Capital back in I've I've like yelled at Sam over text a few times about this many super conservative I'm really conservative I've changed though so starting January 1 uh we're making the change um where I'm taking out a lot of the money and we're actually just putting it into like T bills into a different account to figure out what do we want to do with the money um maybe we'll pay ourselves a little bit I haven't paid myself anything from Hampton at the moment but maybe we'll pay ourselves money as well but yeah I'm I'm you've convinced me that that's the right way and I'm I have to read this book what I'm still trying to figure out is how much Capital keep in the business I don't know if I want to like do so let's say your business is is spending $500,000 a month in expenses do you just leave in like one month's expense what's the equation for Chris Chris and I we used to leave two weeks expenses in the business no way really if it meant that if they don't collect their AR their accounts receivable they go off a cliff now what they don't know is they're not going to go off a cliff because tiny the bank we'll just inject more Capital we're sitting on cash and so we move it in but it creates this sense of urgency to do Collections and run the business very efficiently so that math is basically if you're doing uh uh 12.5 million in Revenue you have 10 million in profit you're only leaving something like 500 Grand in the bank yeah yeah so like basically payroll payroll plus expenses for two to four weeks Max that's wild that's stressful but I I agree that's the right way to do it not well it's not though because I mean most of the time especially in a recurring Revenue business right like we'll do this with especially with SAS businesses because it's very predictable we will say Okay um you know you always do 300K Mr so you know we're going to give you you know two weeks of cash because it's very predictable now once in a while maybe once a year they'll say hey can you inject 100K to help us make payroll or something like that or for R&D but to go back to Sean's point they have to validate the R&D whereas if the money is there they'll just take it and do the R&D are you going to do this Sean yeah I'm going to change it because I am like very guilty of this like when I heard this it was like oh I've heard a truth I can't unhear and this is for bootstrap companies specifically um because you know otherwise I I don't want to belabor the point but yeah like the it's so easy to just accept all your expenses as expenses that are necessary or required it's easy to oh what's the difference between this much net profit per month or this much I'm not taking it out anyway so I don't really feel the difference whereas if my paycheck is less I'm like where's the rest of it and then I have to go answer that question and so I think this is such a I look for forcing functions and I think this is an amazing forcing function that like initially I was ready to poo poo this book I was like what is this stupid idea and then as soon as I heard it flipped flip my opinion there's there's a really good quote on that I was talking there friend about this who runs a SAS company I won't say who but he has 65% net margins and he's been running this SAS business for 20 plus years um growing you know 20 30% bootstrapped every year just amazing amazing business and great entrepreneur and I was telling him about how we had not done this in certain businesses and how the CEOs had misallocated some of that cash and he looks at me and he just goes if you ask the dinner guests what's for dinner they will always say steak and I was like oh my God that's so true right it's like why wouldn't they you know it's not their money they you know yes don't get me wrong like a CEO is incentivized for a bonus but for a CEO's bonus they can spend $300,000 of your money and that might only be worth 10 or $20,000 bonus for them they don't care as much um you know every dollar counts when it's you and you're the owner operator I did the same thing when I sold my house I I was like okay um I forgot we were selling it for like let's say it was 2.1 and I was like I think we could get 2.2 and the agent was like I don't know maybe it's 2.1 and I was like well I I get it you want to make the sale and move on but I was like you know and I thought oh we're both aligned if if it's 2.2 he gets more and I get more and I realized well this guy gets 3% he gets an extra three grand I get an extra 97 Grand if it's 2.1 I was like this guy doesn't give a [ __ ] about that three grand um you know he's getting uh whatever you know 3% of the 2 million anyways this three grand is like not worth the time and Hassle and risk of pushing a negotiation and so I incentivized him I was like how about this let's cut a new deal and he's ready for me to like cut him down and I go no for every dollar you get me above 2.1 you're going to keep 15% of it and sure enough and I made a I also had a penalty I said and if you don't sell it for at least 2.1 you got to buy my wife this bag and I was like cuz I was like I don't want to take money out of this guy's pocket but I also want him to feel the pain so I made it a goofy gift I was like are like these like expensive slippers that like clearly are a waste of [ __ ] money and he was like and then literally we got down to it we got an offer it was around 2.12 let's say and uh I was honestly ready to take it at that point but he was like he was like it's about 2.1 I don't know like you know let's see if we can push back he's like I really don't want to buy that bag uh so he's like I'm GNA for sure get it over this he's like let me see how far I can get it and um he's like let me go push one more time and he pushed one more time we got a better deal and it was just such a simple like lesson around uh really understanding the incentives and not just like the like on paper incentives but like is this enough to move the needle for this person to behave differently or not I I think it's so crazy the more that I go through working with other people in business I realize that everything comes down to incentives and if you just think about the incentive you'll see the you know the exact behavior that they're going to have I did this the same thing when I was selling a house Chris had an interesting point he was making um stink bids on houses so if you look at like a million dollar house he would go and he'd bid 650 or 700 and he'd do that 10 or 20 times and the realtor was pushing back over and over and over again oh you know they'll never accept that there's no point because think about it the realtor got to go they got to spend 30 to 40 minutes writing out the offer send it and for them they're going there's 5% chance totally worth it for Chris but not for the realtor and they're only going to get one commission and so Chris started saying hey look for every offer you send I'm going to pay you ,000 immediately the guy's totally down to do the stink bids but before that he's going oh you're going to get a bad reputation in the market you're going to offend everyone don't do it it's so funny I don't know if this is public so Sean will have to verify because he's closer to this person but we've got buddies that if you're like I've been with them in La when we were there uh doing like an event or when they're visiting New York you'll be like hey what are you doing today like oh I'm going to go see these three apartments or these three houses that I that I'm looking at and I was like you're looking a move he's like no I just tour these constantly and I put lowball offers on all of them and every once in a while someone will will take the bait and I get a screaming deal is that right Sean is that what they do yeah that's right that's right and they just like are doing these doing this constantly and they do the exact same thing has any of those stink bids ever worked yeah I mean uh dude it's just like some people like bargain shopping at Ross try to find that Hidden Gem that's in the basket that they know is worth more some people like to go to garage sales and then if you're just a little bit richer you do the same thing on the level of houses essentially you're like oh good if I can lob all these houses you know touring hous is also pretty fun and uh yeah they've they' picked up a couple of assets that we have a mutual friend all of us and he buys companies and he was telling me what his funnel was he basically said I think they own 18 companies he said that they looked at 1,000 companies and I think they met with hundreds many many hundreds and then he said they they did Lois for like 200 of them and only 15 or 18 or something like that closed and I didn't realize Andrew how much all right when I think of like a holding company or whatever you're doing I think of it this way mostly because you give off this Vibe which I think you mean to do it on purpose but I don't think it's the reality which is like oh I just sit back and everyone does the work and maybe they're doing a lot of the work running the companies but what I've learned about buying companies and I think Sean's learning this too cuz I know he's meeting with a lot of people it is a sales job and you are hitting the phones and you are creating a funnel and that funnel still has like a 3% conversion rate so in order to buy three companies you got to talk to 100 people I didn't realize how sales oriented this whole thing was that you guys are doing well for us I wouldn't say it is I would say in the early days it was for sure but um we've realized that like cold Outreach is not the way to go like we would much rather go and have a public presence and a reputation and have people actually seek us out and say Hey I want to sell you my company I've I've I want to connect with you I don't want to be some random private Equity Firm that's like hey you know let me tell you about us and do the dog and pony show and stuff I want you're still doing marketing so instead of doing instead of doing sales you're doing marketing the funnel still exists yeah totally and and I did not realize that have you noticed that Sean while you're trying to buy stuff yeah I mean we just started this process let's say a year ago very much inspired by you Andrew of like uh hey this is a wonderful way to basically like own businesses without having to create them from scratch gives a good win to the person who's selling them and we will buy minority which I I don't know if you guys always do but like we will also buy minority of them minority stake in them um but the thing that's yeah Sam you're absolutely right it's obviously like you have to sort through so many just to find something worth buying and then even when you find something worth buying doesn't mean the deal's going to happen even when you think a deal is going to happen it doesn't mean a deal closes and so you end up with this like tiny tiny funnel and you have to be okay with hey we might do one deal this year or no deals this year it's so different than like entrepreneurship where it's all about action it's all about features it's all about you know more customers more more more more more and actually less less less is almost you know the name of the game when it comes to being very selective picking the right asset the hard part I think is a lot of people overinvestment and so tell me these three things so it'll be like okay um who runs the business right is that you do you want to stay or go and um and then what are your earnings and then after that once I have that info I say okay we would probably pay about X right and if they say ye you know let's talk then I know I should spend the time and talk but I think a lot of people will actually have three or four conversations and like slow roll and I'm like I'm like via email I want to send the first offer I want want them to say yes that's interesting and then I'll spend time on it and what I used to do is I would spend all this time getting to know people and unboxing the business only to realize that their expectations were insane and we would waste a ton of time and just like with um bidding on real estate or anything else we throw out Lois constantly like I have no qualms about that they're not binding documents uh you know we'll send someone an offer and there's something about if I if I write an email and I say hey I'll offer you $2 million for your business I don't think people take as seriously as when there's like a formal document laying it all out hey on April 30th you will get $2 million in this exact structure uh this is what we commit to people take it seriously so we we send them out all the time so I've never told this story I don't think publicly but Sean about four or six years ago the hustle was two or three years old I was down in the dumps I was feeling really bad about myself I was feeling bad about the business and I told this person that I was not feeling great and they said said you know have you thought about selling it I would really be interested in buying it and this guy um I was like H maybe he goes look let's just hang out and meet come up to uh where I am and and fly up here and I was like okay maybe and he goes yeah yeah I'm going to send the jet I'm GNA I'm going to send you a jet and I was like what do you mean a jet like I get like I'm GNA fly private like yeah I'm sending the jet so I take all these this is right when Tik Tok came out I one of the first Tik toks was me on this jet it was like I was like I can't believe this I go to the private Executive Airport my first time ever doing that I get on the plane I'm in my own jet I have got the Wall Street Journal sitting there and they offer me like champagne and all this stuff I'm like this is the craziest thing I can't believe this I was in heaven I meet with the guy and I'm wooed I'm so floored by this and I'm like days away from being like yeah I'm willing to do something then thankfully I snap out of the the the mood and I'm like it's okay I can keep going but that my friends is how I met Andrew Wilkinson in real life he was the one who sent me the jet he sent me a jet and he totally wanted and die me I was such a redneck he goes I lived in San Francisco he goes oh I'm in Vancouver I was like I got to go to New York though and I don't want to have to like I guess I'll fly to New York and then you could send the Jet and we'll just bolt right up and I was thinking Vancouver was Toronto I didn't I thought Vancouver was next to New York I didn't even know where it was he goes dude Vancouver is right by San Francisco it's only to be two or three hours but uh he flew me up there and I don't know if you owned a bakery at the time you took me to a bakery and you guys totally tried to like whine and dine me that's how I met Andrew I was like Head Over Heels just cuz he sent this jet it worked that you know that's actually the only time I've ever done that I think it full of [ __ ] it's no I'm Ser 100% I'm I'm I've picked up friends and we've done that kind of stuff before like if we're having an event we've flown people in but um I've only ever done that for you that's the one time and I think it was CU you said you're afraid of flying or there's it totally worked it totally work of fly commercial if only there was some other option the time out I was thinking about uh I was thinking a lot about newspapers and I was like oh Sam you've built like the modern version of the newspaper you've got something really incredible I think your deal with HubSpot though is better than what we would have paid we got to the numbers and we would have been cheaper than HubSpot well and it was like I think a two years difference I I I remember we I went to I even I was supposed to get married on a Friday or Saturday and you wanted to meet me on a Tuesday and I was like Sarah you think I could swing this this guy's Gonna Fly me private I got to do this you know I'll be I I'll miss maybe one of the events I have to do this and it was like uh so that was in 2020 and so we ended up selling a little bit later so it worked out for everyone but that's how I met you I will say one of the things I've learned from you Andrew is uh you are a master networker and normally networking is like this it's like this compliment you don't want to get um you know but but you're actually great at it and obviously networking is valuable people would love to have a great Network and meet cool people and have excuses to do things together and I've seen seen you kind of throw your weight around in that area and this might be like asking Michael Jordan like you know how do you shoot a jump shot or how do you jump so high you know like it's like they can't really explain it's not conscious or that they don't really know how to explain it but I've seen you do this with like you want to meet somebody who's really interesting and you'll find a good excuse to get connected with them or even how we met like you know you listen to the podcast and then you were like hey I'd love to you know meet you let's do a call and you really kind of took the time to do something that you didn't otherwise have to do um and that's how we met we had a great conversation then that led to kind of like us hanging out a little bit more and so I've seen you do this with like pretty influential people I've seen you bring people up to Canada where you're at like you know the sort of home court advantage type of thing like do you have if I was to say like you know how do you do it um and and by the way I the when I was having dinner with the CEO of one of your companies the other day they said the same thing they go nobody's better than Andrew when it comes to to building an awesome Network who did you meet by the way uh Zach he lives like oh yeah a minute away from so so what's your what's your first date routine for meeting all these people building a network well it totally depends I mean I amum so here's an example so in 2016 I was reading um a profile on Dan Gilbert Sean or Sam I think you know or both you guys know who he is he's the quick and Loans rocket mortgage guy and it was really cool it was all about how he'd taken his entire fortune and basically was trying to rebuild the city of Detroit uh and I I thought that was really cool I thought you know you see all these guys who get super rich and then they put their money into like mutual funds right I think that's incredibly boring this guy's trying to rebuild a city he's buying skyscrapers he's starting all these businesses so I just emailed him I cold emailed him at like 1 in the morning and I said hey you know here's three bullets about me and I thought about what is he interested in and so I mentioned that I own that Bakery I mentioned I'm passionate about my city I mentioned I bootstrapped my business you know tried to find a few points of similarity and said I would love to meet you um anytime anywhere you know if you're going to be in a random City in Del you know somewhere in Delaware I will fly to you just tell me when we could meet and I got an email response back like 20 minutes later saying sure and we ended up meeting up in Detroit and he was amazing we spent an afternoon together gave me a tour of the city um got to know a whole bunch of people on his team and it was awesome so I will shoot shots like that when see someone that I'm interested in but there's certain people that are like inaccessible like I wanted to meet Bill Amman i' you know been reading about him for years been falling you know watching every YouTube video listening to every interview and first I was like okay he's an investor in Chipotle um maybe we could redesign I own all these agencies maybe we could redesign the Chipotle website maybe we could do an app and so I email him and I say hey I'm a shareholder in your public company um you know I've got this amazing design agency I'd love to help in any way I can and he intros me to like one of the board members so I was like damn it you know like I just got handed off but but he he replied to the email though that was good I mean replied to the email you just yeah basically just forwarded somebody but I was like okay I know his email like there something will happen here and I just have to wait for it and then I saw this charity lunch go up and uh basically every year he auctions off a lunch and this year this was in like 2017 he was having a terrible down year he got divorced he had like the Herbal Life stuff he invested in Valiant pharmaceutical everyone was kind of like [ __ ] on him he was being very quiet and so there weren't as many bids as usual to do this and so I ended up bidding $57,000 to go have lunch with him and my bet was I had no I had no expectation there'd be any business to do because he's a hedge fund manager I'm a tech investor but um but I knew he'd be like an interesting person to meet and so I went and we ended up connecting and then at the end of the lunch he kind of pulled me aside and he's like hey I like you if you ever want to do a deal together let me know and so years later we ended up buying a business and he invested with us just like sub you a piece of paper that says do you like me back yes or no like the bo my foot twice yeah well see that's what I'm talking about that's amazing you do the same thing I with Charlie Munger and Buffett right you you did the charity lunch you bought you bought the charity lunch is that right no no so that was a friend just a that was totally random that was a my friend Andrew Marx who um he he knew Charlie personally and he said hey I'm putting together a dinner and then through that you know I started sending Charlie letters I knew that Charlie is not someone you communicate verbally with he likes he likes to talk a lot and so and uh you can't communicate with him that way you got to write him letters so Chris and I started writing him letters but um but yeah I mean I don't know I like people I'm very extroverted what are you saying in these letters I would just say like hey here before the dinner I said hey here's who we are this is the business this is what we do and he you know throughout the dinner knew who we were as a result and then we started asking for his opinions and talking about different ways we could help him with stuff um I I think like the fundamental principle is be of value to other people and then also um say yes to interesting people if someone can if someone appears to be interesting I will have lunch with them did he reply to the letters he would just call us we would we then call him and he would verbally he's he like verbally um he'll communicate to you verbally but you have to write to him if you want to remember him to remember anything that's amazing uh sounds like a book like uh like my pimpel Charlie you know you gotta like save all the letters in the back and forth totally I think uh it's great to see you know like I would say there's like two takeaways for me one is like I feel like you check your ego really well like uh you are humble about wanting to meet these people and you're about wanting to meet these people and you're not like you're not Bey you're not like above just shooting a shot and saying hey you know I think you're great here's what we do that might be relevant for you and helpful for you uh you know would love to connect I think the other thing is um you're willing to spend money you're willing to hop on the flight you're willing to buy the charity thing you're willing to to to be a part of their their program that they're launching because you know they care about that right now and uh I think people are pretty everybody sort of understands that like having a valuable network is valuable but very few people are willing to invest because it's not a clear like dollars in dollars out thing and that's one thing I've picked up from you you got to be really careful about it though because so about 12 13 years ago um I remember I when I was first starting my company I would watch TED talks back when they were like really early and I would always go oh my God I want to be in this room like who are these people it's like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates and you know all these amazing people and so um probably like 13 14 years ago I started going to Ted Global and I started at the kind of baby event the junior one uh the only one I could get into and then I slowly worked my way into going to the main event because I met Chris Anderson who ran Ted and I pitched him on doing a TED app and so I designed the TED app I used that to get into the main one and then I ended up meeting all these interesting people and so that was an example where I belonged but I was like the baby I was like the kid who's like you know people would ruffle my hair oh isn't that cute this 23-year-old with a you know cracking voice runs a company um but I kind of belong so I I think that's a great strategy sometimes but this year I went to the Oscars and I went to the Vanity Fair Afterparty and that was an example of something where I'm like I should not be here and you do not want that experience right that's not tell that story tell that story so yeah so it's really random so I was at a conference uh about a year ago and I sat across from this guy and I asked him about his startup and usually when you're at these conferences they're like oh I own a B2B software company for doing HR or something and this guy said something that really caught my attention he goes I run a startup that helps people convert money into an interesting life and I was like whoa okay what is this and so he has this company called myria m y RI and the idea is basically they Deep dive with you on um you know what do you care about what are you excited about what do you want your life to look like so they kind of like paint out a blueprint like in two years you know do you want to be um what kind of people do you want to be hanging out with uh what do you aspire to get involved with you know what are your passions what do you want to do with your money and then they help you figure that out and so I did it I signed up and they interviewed me and I said I love movies and they said well do you want to go to the Oscars and I was like I've never contemplated that but I was like you know what that sounds like a fun experience I think spending money on funny experiences like that is worth it and so we go me and my girlfriend go down they set up like a personal stylist we buy like ridiculously expensive clothes and tuxedos and you know I get like a $500 haircut like just silly silly stuff and you know it's it's kind of cool we're in um the actual Oscar event and we keep seeing famous people and it's great people watching and stuff um but after that we go to the Vanity Fair afterparty and I don't know if you guys know but Vanity Fair Afterparty is this like super exclusive event where literally everybody is famous if there's five people there four of them are b or a list celebrities and the one that you don't recognize is probably like a super famous director or producer or something so I'm standing at the bar and like to my right is John Ham chatting it up with Jeff Bezos uh you know I see this guy checking out my girlfriend and I realize it's Andrew Garfield like very weird I can hear like Seth Rogan laughing behind me Rihanna struts in like it's just pinch me like the weirdest thing in the world and then there's me and my girlfriend and over and over again every person that walks by us looks us up and down looks a bit excited looks us up and down realizes we're not famous and then immediately turns on their heel and we're just like you know this is kind of weird we don't belong here and I start making conversation with people I'm you know I'm very I start trying to chitchat with people and as soon as I said oh I'm not in the film industry I'm in tech people would just immediately glaze over and start looking over my shoulder like did not care could not care less right and you know it was I kind of gave up at a certain point I just kind of was like all right let's just people watch or whatever but I realized that I'm really used to being in rooms where like obviously I'm not famous but I have like respect like you know if I even if I'm at a dental conference I can probably chat with someone and be like oh you're the like you know you're the business guy at the dent at the dentist you know clinic or whatever we can talk business but I realized I had no shared language for these people um and it's just not fun like you want to be in a room where you actually have value and so imagine like I was a web designer and I'm like I want to be an investor I want to meet Bill Amman if I have no value to him or I'm not interesting to him I should not meet him you have to wait until you're interesting and ironically since I went to the Oscars we ended up buying letterboxed which is a social network it's like the largest social network for film Buffs now if I go back to that same party I'm sure people would be like oh cool right but it's interesting you you had a great phrase you said you said I realize that you want to earn the room that you're in and uh I thought that was like because I didn't know at first like what would the what's the takeaway of the story is it just like you know I don't know sometimes you go to these parties you feel uncomfortable but you're you're actually right about that you do want to you don't want to buy your way into a room you want to earn your way into a room and uh I do think that that's a that's a great takeaway totally listen to the uh the copy on the miria so it's mia. us it says Parker Wayne Kent Stark why should they have all the fun Mia memberships gives you and your team special powers to make your life more enjoyable and the world a better place and they say say open sesame to the world's top private clubs and make sold out disappear from your vocabulary well done this is a very well done site is this is this company going to be something legit and big I they went through white combinator it couple episodes ago too I think um I think it's a really really cool idea and I think the idea like do you ever go to a city and you're like [ __ ] you know we didn't plan like I remember me and my girlfriend went to Tokyo and we kind of went last minute and we ended up eating bad food we didn't really like see the best of the city we just hadn't planned it and so it just so wasted and it's one of those instances where I wish I had something like this it's like the key to the city where you're like hey I'm in Tokyo I want to go to all the coolest stuff you know all my tastes curate something for me or like Chris wanted to go to F1 and he doesn't know anyone at F1 he doesn't know how it works he wanted to go last minute these guys got him like I think he met Lewis Hamilton he went in the pit you know stuff like that is like pretty cool um but I yeah it would be interesting to see because they raised Venture we actually invested in their um their angel round immediately because I was like this is such a funny idea but um I don't know if it'll be Venture scale we'll see they have a competitor that I uh looked at and I was poking on the website they say you have to spend $80,000 a month in order to make it be worth it so on average a million dollars a year uh to make these yeah 25 I think it's 25 Grand and then they take a cut of everything you do so if you spend $100,000 I think they would take a 15% fee or something on that there's another service I just got invited to and my friend so he tells me about it and it's basically um last minute super highend reservations at any restaurant you want to eat at in like New York London and Miami and I'm like oh cool you should invite me and he's like no you don't get it if you don't use this invite I lose access and the guy who invited me loses access which I think is like genius so it's like forget what it's called but basically you in if I invite Shawn um you have use it within 30 days otherwise I lose my access and S if Sam invited me he loses it too there's some uh little Trend I've noticed which is people as they get more successful or notable or whatever the number of times they hear no in their life goes way down and I've actually noticed that like there's a whole business in just the business of no for people that no longer hear no and what this means is twofold one is they still run into some things that they don't know how to they they can't like they their powers are useless here it's like it's sold out what do you want me to do and so these guys with muria have created a business around we eliminate the last few NOS of your life and I've noticed other people like this kind of uh hey if you don't use this I get kicked out it's like I don't get kicked out of anything nowadays right like I'm paying the fees what why would they kick me out but there's a whole business around give people something to lose who never hear know anymore they never get rejected anymore and it's like give them some rejection give them some way that they have some some risk uh because it makes them like feel like something matters when everything is in Easy Mode for them at that so I um I I've been on the wait list to go to Peter do you guys know who Peter AA is super famous doctor um I I am I've been on the weit list there for like three years his private practice you mean private private practice which is like you know I think he only has 50 patients it's like getting it's like getting hubman or someone to be your doctor yeah it's super expensive and so I pay I pay like this absurd amount of money up front and they do this thing where they psychologically test you before they allow you to become a patient and so I go through this test and Peter calls me and he goes Andrew um there was something concerning in your uh your personality test I'm worried that you won't have good follow through will you do what I say will you execute on the plan and I'm like Peter no like you got it all wrong like I I pay attention to my diet like I track everything I wear a glucose monitor like you don't have to worry about me and he goes okay cool and so you know I've been working with them and last month I pull him aside and I'm like Peter look be honest with me did I actually have like something in my psychological test and he goes you you did I was like is that even a real test and he's like yeah that is right so I actually did flag something but I was thinking what a great strategy because I'm like the dream patient now I'm like terrified of getting booted out because of this thing he said and I think doing something like that you're right pushing someone away creates this desire to be a good customer has it been worth it his his him being your doctor well I think I think it's so it's a lot of money obviously it's hundreds of thousands of dollars um but if think about it this way if you're gaining five years of life or 10 years of life what is that worth and there's been quite a few things I have I have an amazing doctor a primary doctor that I go to um who I love and he's amazing but AA they have like a neurology a cardiologist um exercise physiologist who works with you so it's this team of people and they caught um a bunch of issues with cholesterol and other stuff that I may not have caught otherwise so I I mean I think it's worth it but for a normal person is that a good use of money no I would say that's a crazy use of money you went to your primary doctor you're like Doc I love you it's been a great 20 years yeah we have to talk I met Angelina Jolie now and uh we have a thing going too we're now in an open doctor relationship it's really yeah it's one of those things I used to think you could only have one lawyer like I had one one lawyer and then I'd feel like I was cheating on my lawyer if I used other lawyers then I realized like no you have lawyers for different things or whatever but yeah I have uh now I've got a polyamorous uh doctor relationship let's do uh you have this this idea of be the Barnacle on the whale what does that mean yeah so um if you think about one of the biggest costs in most businesses it's marketing so um you know if you think about it it's like 15 to 30% of most businesses is just getting people to know you exist and getting sales so if you can own a business that doesn't have to Market itself then you're golden you can run a super super profitable business so let's say that with marketing you run it 15% cut marketing you could run it 45 50 60% so for example um let's say that you're a fitness influencer so like think about like Derek from more plates more dates so he sells um uh supplements and energy drinks and he's got this shampoo for hair loss he's got a great business because he is free marketing he just talks about the product on his podcast his YouTube uh his Instagram and he gets free sales right so it would be an as an e-commerce business if he was paying to acquire those customers it'd be a crappy business but he's got free marketing right now the problem is most of us don't have access to that most of us are not influencers but anyone can do that in a different way by being a barnacle on a whale so here's the story of how we I kind of stumbled into this um so I was at a conference about 12 years ago um at the time I met um Harley and Toby from Shopify Shopify was this tiny little startup they were bootstrapped they were like 15 people and they said hey we really like your design work um would you design some themes for us but there's a catch this won't be client work we're not going to pay you uh we want you to list them in our Marketplace so the idea is like when people sign up for Shopify they wanted people to be able to select a theme and pay like $49 to $250 to do that I started making $5,000 a month $110,000 a month as these themes sold and I was like hey this is really cool like I'm not having to promote it I don't have to think about marketing or SEO or anything you know people they they send all the traffic to their Marketplace and so we started building more and more themes and we ended up spinning out that business but what what I didn't realize was that in the theme Marketplace there was only so many squares and it took time to build the themes and it took time for them to get approved and so I started owning more and more squares so let's say that in the early days if you were to choose a theme there's a 50% chance that it was one of ours so we had like saturation early in this Marketplace that was very small when we joined it but then as Shopify grew I mean you guys know what happened they go public they start pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into marketing I get free marketing I get to be the little Barnacle on the whale and keep growing and it got to the point where that business was big enough um that we ended up taking that public at a $260 million valuation a couple years ago so um it's an incredible strategy now I think Shopify is hard because you're late you know the the marketplace already exists it takes a lot of time to get approved you know that might not be the place to go where you might want to look is um like Discord or adapar or any kind of software ecosystem that's not super saturated if you can go be a barnacle on a whale you can make a ton of money I totally agree I have a a a business that's cooking up that's like this I I'll I'll tell you later uh offline because I can't can't announce it yet but totally agree with this strategy I think it's amazing you invested so you said it went public at 260 million how much did you invest to get there sounds like it was kind of some free labor to get the themes going but like how much Capital did it take for you to get going because you were early $20,000 maybe so that's incredible and didn't you sell you sold that business for 15 million or did you sell it for 10 and bought it back for 15 there's like a story where you sold it and then bought it back right yeah so basically started it for 20K sold it for about 7 million um to and then I ended up buying it back from the guys who bought it for2 million and then about a year later we took a public for 260 million so talk about that like did you sell it like did you regret selling it or what why sell it in the first place was that a mistake and then psychologically how'd you get yourself to buy it back for so three times as much yeah like Sam I was like in this kind of like existential crisis I was super burnt out I've been running so I I had that business I had metalab I had two SAS companies I had an e-commerce business I was running all of them kind of of running around like a chicken with my head cut off and finally I hit a wall and I was feeling really depressed talked to a friend he said hey why don't you sell one and um were you were you liquid at that point like were you financially secure no no I I was Liquid in that we had a lot of cash flow but the problem was I'd be um borrowing from Peter to pay paal right so I have at any given time I'd have a highly profitable business and then I have a startup and the startup would burn all the profits so I didn't have a nice house like you know I I was okay but I always felt like I was going to go broke and so getting that cash influx was amazing so I sell the business um suddenly I'm sitting on millions of dollars and feeling very secure and the first thing I do is I go okay now that I've got all this money I got to learn how to invest it and so I pick up a book about Warren Buffett and I start reading about this idea of competitive advantage in Moes and what a good business looks like and as I'm reading I'm going oh my God I just sold the business that has all these qu qu what the hell was I thinking uh and I was still on the board so the nice thing was I helped them choose the CEO this amazing guy named Ben Mo and I just kept watching and eventually the guys who we sold it to they were fatigued they wanted to they had they had um they had kind of transitioned to doing something different so they wanted to sell the business and so I just stepped on their foot I said hey if you guys want to sell we'll do a deal and so we did and then we did a bunch of m&a and you know pack packaged it up and took it public that's insane so the 20K you invested was the initial amount but then you bought it back for 25 and then you guys bought a bunch of other Shopify plugins and apps right yeah I think our total amount if you look at it from that perspective our total amount of investment was about 36 million so we we took it you know start started it for 20K sold it for seven bought it back for 25 did $10 million or so of m&a and then took a public and we optimized the business and GR it quite a bit over that year God that's awesome that's a that's a that's a good Insight I mean I remember seeing like the press release for Pixel Union and I remember you talking about it but I didn't know that you actually had to buy it back for more than you sold it for yeah was 5x basically it's insane um Sean where do you want to go from here let's do the the life philosophy so you said uh people always suffer in silence what does this mean yeah it's something Chris and I've noticed so we have this real culture of um autonomy at tiny so we always say that when we hire a CEO we leave them alone and there's certain people who really love that so for example often Founders who sell their company to us when a Founder sells their company to us um and keeps running it often they sold because they wanted to buy out a co-founder or they wanted to buy out their VCS and they want to operate the business profitably so they're kind of saying look I've got this great business I know what I'm doing I want a investor who's going to leave me alone I just want to buy out these guys I want to buy out a co-founder or something and so um usually those guys they just want to be left alone and we say great um talk to us if you need anything and uh you know sail off into the sunset and run your business that works fine but often when we hire a CEO they're used to having um somebody who oversees them so like a really active board or before they were in like some big Corporation and there's constantly someone checking in and so they associate check-ins with everything is okay and we don't do that we literally throw people in the pool and we say okay go and swim do whatever you need to do and um and so often and because there's so many companies there's 40 companies now in tiny there's always someone we forgot about that we're not checking in on we're not texting they've just fallen off our radar or we think they're okay and so we look at their numbers and they seem to be good we assume everything is fine and so we just say you know they're not contacting us let's leave them alone well so often we found that people will fester in silence they will actually assume that um here I am I'm doing this great job for them and they won't even do me the honor of picking up the phone or checking in or um you know whatever it is and and it's this I always I remember about 10 years ago I was complaining I was um I was hurt somebody I'd sent someone uh an emotional email and they didn't respond and my friend says do you know what hanlin's rais is and basically the idea is it's um never a tribute to malice what can otherwise be explained by ignorance or stupidity right so never assume negative intent but everybody assumes negative intent you know we all know what it's like to send an email that's really important to us and the person doesn't respond for three or four days you assume that they're going you know [ __ ] this person or I'm G to ice them out in reality they're busy they've got kids they're doing their email they're they're behind whatever it is and so I've just observed erve this fact I don't know what to do about it but people will always assume silence equals malice and then you have this other one that says people don't change so you first said people always suffer or people suffer in silence and people don't change this you're you're getting a little pessimistic on worldview but I agree with you I there's this author called uh Robert Green he's got uh you know 48 Laws of Power and he has this other book book called human nature and he's like why should you study human because very rarely do people change it's the same stuff over and over and over again and then when you look at their individual habits whatever they've done in the past they're going to just do just assume it's going to happen again and again and again in the future that's one of the best that's one of the best books I've ever read the laws of human nature by Robert Green uh I just got the audio book and I just keep listening to it every year it's amazing um I I've just seen this over and over again I find that you rarely hire someone and let's say like um you know I love to hire people based on scrappiness will they figure things out will they learn do they have high Pace I've never hired someone who doesn't have high pace and then coached them into having high Pace right people either do or they don't and the the only thing I've seen where people change is it's kind of like addiction you kind of have to hit rock bottom right so if you're kind of an [ __ ] and you talk you you interrupt people all the time and you always talk about yourself maybe you stop having any friends or you have an intervention your friends have an intervention with you maybe at that point you hit rock bottom and you go I need to change I have a problem but most people generally continue on their track that they're on um and I I don't know I I see this all the time with with um people I work with and especially people will not change their ideas so if you let's say a CEO comes to me and they say I've got I think the best way for us to grow is SEO and I say oh well let's think about that what about XYZ opportunity I think we should focus on PPC marketing or have you thought about changing the product in this way they will actually double down when I challenge their idea they will double down and they will keep they will now defend the idea and as soon as they defend the idea they will commit and cons they will be consist what is it called commitment and consistency bias right now they will double down on that so I've just realized like trying to change people's impossible and at the end of the day we're all like um people are like elephants and you're just the rider you know you just kind of go where the elephant's going to go and hope for the best you see a b guy a poor guy on the side of the street begging from CH begging for change you just say change comes from within my brother change from comes from within I uh I completely agree with people don't change I I had a thing in my life where at 22 or 24 I forget it was like oh this is rock bottom and I had like I there was like a distinct moment where I'm like I'm just going to change that trajectory just a few degrees and if I just keep going it's going to make a massive impact I I had but there's really only like I remember I think two times in my life where I'm like oh that's going to change and it's happened but then like everything else it rarely changes it's very hard to break any type of habit or human nature uh characteristic I think I would disagree with that uh the only thing I would disagree with is I would just say I would instead of the phrase being people don't change I would say assume don't change as a reminder to myself because the the problem is you're like if you assume that people are going to change because you're being hopeful and you're you're going to make a bunch of bad decisions because you're going to be baking in change when change is quite rare and so it's not that they don't change it's that you should not be assuming that they will change is the the Trap that you want to avoid it's like when you get married there's that classic saying like you know don't try and change the person that you're with um and I think it's like be pleasantly surprised like it has happened for sure but it's it's really a Fool's errand to try and go and change a person and also uh it's sort of like ads people are like oh ads ads don't work on me it's like okay everybody thinks ads don't work on them everybody thinks they're not average I think uh you know the same way it's like I think we think that other people don't change but if I if I separately had asked you you know like hey you are you the same guy you were when you know the last 20 years like no I've learned so much I've evolved I've just matured I've I've changed so much and and um but we think other people don't change and I think this I I guess I'm a I'm a little more optimistic about the change um although my sister has a funny phrase about this she goes PE people say that people don't change they do they get worse and like and I think that that's like you know more of the how to protect your downside mentality as you assume that people are not going to change or it's just going to they're going to dig in even further into their current set of patterns um but of course there's so many outliers that I think you can only make it an assumption not a rule um Andrew it was awes awesome being able to catch up with you I'm happy things are going well and you um you said a few things here like I I I hope the listener does this but I actually have a notepad here that I take down notes for like everything that we're writing this profit first thing and how much money leaving the bank I like I have a note here I'm like [ __ ] all right I actually have to go and actually do that um Moyes said something a few times ago or uh and so did Patrick Campbell we had Patrick Campbell on from profit well on and I still have his notes here and I had a meeting with my company afterwards I was like here's a Patrick Campbell set I just did a pod with them we got to do this this and this and this is another one of those episodes where you've actually given me things that I'm actually I got to go and run and like tell my company right now this everybody loves that CEO who comes in with the with a whole new life life approach every every three days because they listen to a podcast like if I was in a company I'd be like hey dude you're not allowed to listen to podcast anymore or go to these dinners because every time you come back everything's changing that is an annoying person there's a good way to deliver it though it's it's it's amazing how just a lack of awareness can change the results of a business right like as soon as I stopped I remember I used to obsessively look at my credit card statement as soon as I stopped looking because I got too busy I started spending so much on stupid SAS crap or whatever and I think just building those processes into your company can make such a big difference like it literally is those Sam you described that thing of you know if you were a plane taking off from New York you changed 3 degrees and that was the difference between ending up in Seattle versus Tiana I think that same thing is true in a company yeah and I think that this thing might change the trajectory of of a bunch of things that I'm doing um thanks for doing this and we appreciate it thanks for coming on man yeah that was awesome guys all right that's the [Music] pod

there's a study about people who are amputees and they found that after 6 months the level of Happiness went back to where they were when they had both legs that kind of happens when you make some money so for the first while I didn't have a lot of money and then all of a sudden I sold the business I walked away with about $20 million at first I bought a fancy car I think that brings close to no happiness my home that I live in in Austin I paid $900,000 for it I have a cleaning lady who comes once a week that's $120 a week I do some health stuff so I have a fancy gym and I go to fancy doctors collectively that's $1,000 a month I don't own any jewelry I'm wearing a fresh clean tea it's a $10 t-shirt I wear those constantly when I go out to eat I don't look at prices and when I go to Whole Foods I buy the fanciest stuff but the biggest change is my confidence my confidence went through the roof I'm incredibly confident in my ability to start something and to see it through to be a success I still have paranoia that I'm going to lose everything and I still have massive fears about going broke that is something that my therapist and I are working through still

uh 911 what's the St what's the state of your emergency uh hey uh the tech industry got flipped upside down over the weekend I was staring at my phone the whole time I haven't been so so uh invigorated by any story in like five years um my wife might divorce me because I haven't looked up from my phone I've just been on Twitter all weekend Sam how are you doing right now with this open AI story it's been awesome I uh you the real winner through all this is Twitter Twitter's been great for this right Twitter just thrives through all types of controversy tter aka the Silicon Valley group chat has been awesome awesome all weekend it's been [Music] awesome I thought there was a chance that you were just like out duck hunting and I would come on today and you'd be like what happened I'm a Sam Alman fan I I've Loved this guy we've talked about him for years I'm a big fan of his this is and I love drama I love Gossip I read TMZ every day and so now I've got TMZ on Twitter it's awesome of course we're talking about open Ai and Sam Alman getting fired on we're recording this Monday he was fired like Friday but there's like news happening in real time like constantly right exactly like uh just as of an hour ago there's news so I we don't know exactly where this is going to all land we're going to try to get this out as soon as we can uh we we had a whole other episode planned today we canceled it we just said Let's do let's do this right now what's our reaction what is our reaction to the open AI stuff that's going on all right Sam where do you want to I think we should take this character by character go through all the players that were involved and I think we should give them kind of a a grade and they can get you know if they get an A or an A+ that means they came out a big winner here you can get a a c you can get an F I think we should grade all the players of how this has turned out for them in the you know 48 hours so far that this happened but do you want to First give a little timeline summary recap yeah so I think you should do it cuz even been paying attention to it more closely but it all started Friday at like what 3:00 exactly Friday afternoon there's I get a text message from Ben Levy he just says wow Sam Balman what the [ __ ] holy [ __ ] what and but he doesn't say the the news yet and then I'm what and then he's like Sam Alman out but he like misspells out then he like does the Stars on out out of what where is he out of it was unfathomable that Sam Alman would get fired right like uh and the same way that you know I don't expect to wake up and see that Elon Musk has been fired from Tesla uh you don't think you don't wake up and think that Sam alman's going to get fired from open AI which is the hottest private company probably the most important startup in the world that has gone from zero to 90 billion in valuation in just a couple of years here yeah it was shocking it started because uh open AI at uh I don't even know our guy puted this in military time so what's this 248 at 248 open AI announced a leadership transition they said that Sam Alman is departing as CEO because he was not consistently candid in his Communications with the board and their CTO uh a lady named Meera she was become the intermittent uh CEO a little over an hour later Sam Alman said I loved my time at open AI it was transformative for me personally and that he's excited for what's next well let's pause there because the first phase here is wild speculation so the speculation is oh my God shock and speculation so I can't believe this happened like an April Fool's joke it must have been something bad dude you know he must be you know this was there fraud um did they unleash AGI was there a huge privacy like leak uh that is causing him to have to step down because there was a security issue that he he overlooked is this there's like this accusation from his sister about sexual assault when they were kids is it because of that and everybody assumes it's got to be the worst until 1 hour later or when is it 1 hour later yeah I think uh a couple hours later Greg who was the the chairman and was essentially his co-founder uh of open AI the the lead technical guy at the time uh or the early days sends this message to the team hi everyone super proud of what we built starting in my apartment eight years ago we've been through tough times and great times together accomplishing so much doing what should have been impossible based on today's news comma I quit wishing you all the best the eye lowercase lower and um and so then now we're we enter phase two phase two is wait Greg's on the board wait Greg is a standup guy if it was something really bad Greg would not have just quit with him there must this must not be as bad is there some kind of power play jealousy a coup that's happening here is Sam being wrong and the instantly I see the court of public opinion shift and the court of public opinion says look if Sam did something really effed up Greg would not have just followed him out the door and quit unless Greg was in on it so still a possibility but more likely it seems like Greg doesn't stand for this reasoning so maybe we don't stand for this reasoning and all of a sudden you see the Sam Army come forward people who are startups from YC when he was the president of YC saying look uh I don't know what happened here but Sam is like he went to bat for me uh so many stories came out that were all the same variety I don't know if you saw these they were all the same variety it was a startup saying we had a time when we were screwed I emailed Sam to be like hey here's what's going on blah blah blah Sam quickly replied with just something like hey make sure you you know you're communicating or like um you know just do your best there's only what you can control but behind the scenes he went to war for us we found out later that he called All of investors threatened to dangle them over the balcony if they if they screwed us and he saved our ass and didn't even mention it that he was doing that just in the background he went through and like saved us and we found out later that this was true so I don't know what what happened here but you know I ride with with Sam well an equally big deal is one time I had a customer service question and I dm'd him and he replied and he solved it for me so exactly and all a lot of it was he replied fast he replied what he didn't have to he vouched for us when he didn't have to he he he did by the way that was not a joke he reply to me like I had like a air I couldn't figure something out and I was like I'm just going to DM Sam and he replied with like this the the he he solved my problem but yeah the guy seems like a great guy and his brother comes out and says to all the people that are gleefully hating today please know you are betting against the wrong guy okay so that kind of foreshadows act two act two is the weekend so Friday you get the crazy news dump now the weekend you have news that people start even inside the company start to stand with Sam because they say if there was something bad tell us what it is you don't have to say it publicly say it internally what does it mean he wasn't candidly consistent or consistently candid with the board about what did he lie what did he lie about how bad was it uh you're taking our leader out our two leaders out now um and wait who is the board oh the board is like this combination of of of of people who have no they didn't build this they don't even own equity in this but they're deciding our future because the board is basically one legit technologist this guy Adam D'Angelo who who was the co-founder CTO of of Facebook back in the day and then he co-founded quora after that so you have Adam legitimate character in Silicon Valley and then you have a bunch of other people that nobody's ever heard of one of them is like that actor's wife she's like a you know an academic somewhere never had a job Jo Gordon Le yeah exactly you know the the guy from from inception you know like great um the guy from inception not Leonardo DiCaprio that's the first and not even him he's not the one on the board and not even him exactly so you got like you know you got her you got a couple other characters here um but nobody that is again no equity no skin in the game and uh no track record building or operating you know complex companies so that seems a bit weird they getting data and um rumors come out Sam's going to have a new company by Monday Sam and Greg are going to create an open AI competitor by Monday which is just like a pretty badass threat to throw down and so once the team starts to say they start to tweet out these Emoji hearts saying I basically I stand with with Sam I don't know all the details but if you don't come out with any details explaining why you did this I'm I'm gonna probably leave with Sam and so the board starts scrambling and they start trying to renegotiate with Sam to maybe bring him back and his conditions are like cool I'll come back y'all all got to resign CLE and clear my name uh you got to bring back Greg and uh we're going to put a put a new board together that's like the board of my choosing the board doesn't want to do all that and uh so they're kind of stalling they're going back and forth he goes back to the office with a guest pass on his badge and he says this is the last time I'll ever enter this office with guest pass and then at the last minute we hear the news the the news come out it looks like Sam's coming back and then Sunday night it hits there's a new CEO in town EMT Shear my former boss the former CEO of twitch is now suddenly these the guy for opening ey Sam is out he's in shock that that was like you know what I thought was the end and before I went to sleep thinking okay we're going to record this pod I thought that was the end emit releases an announcement on Twitter saying basically like hey hey I'm here here's my 30-day plan um I wake up this morning and there's more news 600 of the 700 employees of open AI have signed a petition saying if you don't bring Sam and Greg back and all resign we're all leaving 600 of 700 it was actually 500 as of 3:00 a.m. and then it got to 650 as of uh as of right before recording this that's basically 100 people woke up and also signed the pledge including by the way the guy who was supposedly behind the entire coup ilot the main technologist the scientist who was the on the board who who was the guy who sent Sam a Google meet link and was like Hey can you join this right quick and Sam's like sure let me just pop out let me just get my microphone and he pops on and then gets fired the whole board is sitting there and they executed his ass Ilia comes comes out and signs the pledge and says I'm sorry for what I did what and he even tweets out he goes like I want to get the band back together and make it right I'm sorry yeah I I regret what I did and you know try to write the wrong and then on top of that before before that that that thing happened sa Nadella the CEO of Microsoft comes out and says hey um we still support open AI um sure look forward to beating the new guy ett which is just a really funny way of putting it uh cuz apparently they were not consulted and only told one minute before the firing happened that or one minute before the press release went out that Sam was fired um so they were blindsided even though they put they've agreed to fund1 billion dollar into this company and own 49% of it um and then he says oh and good news Sam and Greg now work for Microsoft and this is just like the ultimate Checkmate move um because Sam I don't know if you know this but Microsoft not only do they own 49% not only do they uh provide all of the funding which open a requires to F to to exist they could pull that at any minute now uh because a lot of that funding is in uh compute credits so basic server credits um but not only that they also have the license to to all the technology they they have the model the weights the INF they have everything that they need to basically hand Sam and Greg the new the like all of the code you don't have to start from scratch here you go and so uh in the end they got everything they got everything they wanted they got the team the technology the money they got they got everything the most interesting part of all this though is the characters because this is everyone keeps saying this is succession in real life and it is it's the it's one of the greatest things that happened in Silicon Valley in the last you know 15 years it's a it's a beautiful storyline we thought Sam bankman was a was a was a gift from the gods in terms of podcasting this is actually I think more interesting it's not played out yet so the story is still G to like keep going but let's talk about the characters let's talk about Sam Alman first we talked about him well we've talked about him a ton but this guy basically his background is he's from St Louis my hometown give a shout out to St Louis then he moved to Silicon Valley to join Y combinator at the age of like 19 or 20 he started a company that had like mild success I think it raised a fair amount of money and sold for $50 million of which he walked away with $5 million at the age of like 21 and using that $5 million he parlay that into hundreds of millions by investing in things like Airbnb Dropbox things like that because he worked at White combinator eventually becomes president of white combinator at the age of 27 two two quotes from uh from Paul Graham about Tom Alin and remember Paul Graham is somebody who uh invested in Dropbox invested in Airbnb invested you know he is seen the founders he knows everybody in Silicon Valley he's met Mark Zuckerberg he's met all these guys and so for him to be be most impressed by Sam Alman means something and he says Sam Alman has it you could parachute him into an Island full of cannibals and come back five years later and he'd be the king that's the first one and then he goes the second one he goes uh I met Sam Alman many years ago when he was 19 years old he was a Stanford Dropout which by the way Harvard or Stanford Dropout is the number one resume Stan that is the number one like item if you go to Harvard to Stanford and you don't drop out you have intentionally chosen to not have the number one credential you can have which is Harvard Dropout or Stanford Dropout um so he says within meeting uh within three minutes of meeting him I remember thinking ah so this is what Bill Gates must have been like when he was 19 in three minutes I don't know what SE Alla did in three minutes but I would love I would love to know I am fascinated by people who are special the kind of the freaks I love it in sports but you can see it you could see LeBron James at age 17 was like a freak of nature yeah he had like the equivalent of a 42inch vert you know whatever he did it was like yeah it was like an eighth grader dunking there's another story that's kind of remarkable I thought this kind of tells you about this guy's character so Sam alman's gay he came out when he was like 15 or 16 I think you said something about he's from your hometown St Louis there's some story which is that he came out and not only did he just come out as a teenager which alone takes some bravery he then like hosted like a pep rally or something like that he went to John Burrows so in St Louis where I'm from every most all high schools are either Catholic or some type of Christian whatever and he came out with being gay but he like went to a or I think he created like a club some type of like gay club and at a Catholic school they're like no we're not we're not about this and so I think he led like a walk out like a school walk out that takes a lot of like leadership yeah he's very courageous guy and then but for like the last 15 years pre-open AI he was even though he was president of Y commentator he was still a little bit behind the scenes and even though that he was running this huge incubator and he's a powerful guy it still felt like well why would Paul Graham say this about this kid who still has yet it still has unfilled potential a couple years ago he starts working on open Ai and then all of a sudden we're like oh all right the guy was plotting and it's it's he's played the long game now we understand why everyone like looks up to this guy and open ey open AI has B basically taken over the tech industry and went from zero to you know one of the biggest companies in the world in what five years or something like that yeah exactly so he leaves the most prestigious job in Silicon Valley which is you know president of of YC dean of Harvard dean of our Harvard he quits suddenly because the nonprofit research organization he co-founded you know he felt like that was the right opportunity and he did that suddenly it was surprising I remember at the time I had the thought I think I've said this before here which is that uh I had the thought like if Sam Alman just quit being the president of YC to go join open AI how can I justify coming into to work tomorrow like why would I not also go to open AI whatever open AI is I knew nothing at the time but all I knew is if that one of the smartest guys in the world went and did that um maybe I should go do that too and honestly that would have been the greatest career move I ever made if I had done that because uh you know open AI quickly you know changed its structure from nonprofit to becoming you know like a capped for profit thing and uh became worth you know nearly hundred billion dollar in in a short period of time creating chat GPT the fastest growing product of all time to get to 100 million users faster than any and let's go to his two partners because when he started it there's a bunch of weird stories that I don't that aren't entirely out in the open but it seemed like there was something where Elon Musk funded the business or helped fund the business at first he invested $40 million and he also helped to recruit and uh convince a few of Sam's co-founders to join is that right that's right so basically the when people say okay great Sam's just he you drop him on an island of cannibals he comes out king okay cool but what's his skill what does he do and basically it was like on anything about strategy or ambition uh this is what Paul Graham said he said if there's if there was ever a question on strategy or ambition I default to what would Sam do and um you know this PO gram he's like 20 years older than Sam saying that so that's kind of impressive so what did he do he basically has a conversation with El musk and the two of them had shared the same belief which was that artificial intelligence was going to be a big deal that we would be able to one day realize AGI which is artificial general intelligence think about it as um you know super intelligence when when uh you know uh AI is generally smarter than than humans and kind of everything that we you know most of the things that we try to do um so the they both said that's also kind of scary because we don't know what's going to happen on the other side of AGI so we should fund research in a nonprofit that will uh study you know fund the research around this so that we could safely create AGI instead of having AGI that kills us all like the movies so what Sam did was he hosts his dinner in Palo Alta and you know he gets Elon Musk there and he gets a few other smart key people one of them was this guy Greg who was at the time the CTO of stripe which was before open AI was the most impactful big startup in the world so they gets a CTO he gets this guy Ilia who's um like the lead research uh scientist in AI at at Google essentially he's the kind of like one of the founding fathers of of of AI and deep learning um and so they get a bunch of these people around the table and they basically Reed Hoffman is there and they basically like we need to do this Elon basically agrees to fund $40 million into the nonprofit so Elon puts his money where his mouth is Sam uh you know helps recruit put the whole deal together puts bring the people together on the way home Sam's like hey Greg let me give you a ride back to San Francisco so they drive back to San Francisco and what Greg says what Sam says is the first 30 minutes it's an hourong drive from Palo Alto to San Francisco since the first 30 minutes Greg just asked me rapid fire like 150 questions then the next then at the 30 minute point he goes okay I've decided I'm going to do this I'll quit stripe and I'll join open AI um whatever this thing is that you're creating I will join it um so the next 30 minutes they started making their plan like okay what are the first things we need to which tells you something about Greg uh to do again a crazy career move like that to uh you know just have independent mindedness and conviction and something that quickly um and tells you something about Sam's persuasiveness and ability to like put this thing together then uh what Elon says that he recruited Ilia out of Google which was very very hard to do and he says it's the reason that him and Larry pagee founder of Google don't talk anymore uh you know he used to be friends with Larry he used to famously Elon didn't own a house for a period of time and he would just crash at friends houses so he would crash at Larry Page's house all the time he says that they got into arguments about Ai and that he was really worried about Ai and Larry was like Tech forward and was like no it's going to be amazing and um and then he says that you know he got pissed when Larry called him a speciesist basically like you are you're just all about humans and Elon was like what the [ __ ] else am I supposed to be about are you not that scares me even more I'm going to create open AI now to like defend against Google which owned Deep Mind the number one player at the time and so uh Elon basically poaches Elon and Sam poach Ilia out of Google which took a lot of money and a lot of persuasion I believe to get him out and that he becomes when he joins open AI the research Community who worships this guy basically followed and they got all the top researchers to join and that is the founding story of opening eye it's that's amazing right I mean that I just this is like drama movie drama [ __ ] of just that that dinner that drive home I mean this is perfect we're going to have to have Justin timberlink Star as one of these guys and so this brings us to I think the second character that we should talk about this guy Greg who I believe is the unsung hero in this whole thing because Sam Alman is kind of like the her he's the hero right he get he's the the CEO he gets backstabbed he gets wronged he's the Martyr he he he had to to suffer people come out and they're all ing Sam insuring like it's like a funeral for Sam on Twitter the other day he's like oh I remember that once Sam responded to my customer service request like oh I was on a bike once and Sam you know he he he moved over in the lane so I could go by right like everybody was just sharing their favorite Sam memory and then nobody's really talking about Greg Now Greg in my opinion shifted this whole [ __ ] thing because at first it was like damn I don't know what Sam did must have been horrible blah blah blah as soon as Greg came out and was like yo on this I quit and they're like Greg's the number two he's on the board he was the chairman of the board I think uh they're like if Greg doesn't think this was right I don't think it's right and so Greg single-handedly like shifted the perception The Narrative around this whole thing uh and the board didn't counteract that and so I think Greg was the the real hero of this and then what I did was there's some amazing blog posts that anybody who's a real nerd about this stuff if you just really love kind of like the the lore the cannon of of Silicon Valley you got to go read this Greg has blog post up on his blog about um about the early days of open Ai and um I think he blogged the early days of open AI last week no this is eight years ago this thing started a long time ago and he talks about like they didn't have an office he's like all right just come to my apartment he's like here's the four of us in our apartment he's like I didn't know anything about machine learning so I did two things number one I asked asked Ilia what is the number one textbook about machine learning I bought it and I studied it religiously he's like I read everything there was to know about deep learning and machine learning he goes and this is the former CTO of stripe he's not like a non-technical dude he's known as like this incredible one of these 10x or 100x engineers and uh he says I didn't know anything about deep learning so I just dedicated myself to go read you know page one chapter one of the book and I'm going to take notes and I'm going to ask a ton of questions he goes two while these guys were setting up their research stuff I did everything else like oh your back looks a little uncomfortable you need a pillow oh you guys thirsty I'll go get smoothies and he's doing literally all the like intern grunt work those first few months to get them set up he's like and it basically was an alternating between research would do something then research would get blocked and I would say oh What's blocking you they're like ah it's taking forever to run this training set or I have to like organize this data and then Greg would stay up all night and basically like do the engineering because people don't realize engineering and coding is very different than AI research and so he's he would do the coding that would make the researchers go faster and he built basically all of the infrastructure so that researchers could do great work and um and even with GPT like there was a story like uh you know they ran the model and the output was kind of like ah like it was so so and then Greg like locked himself in a room for two weeks and he came out and suddenly GPT worked and people were like what the hell just happened he's like out and you know I did that and so he has these great blog posts and photos of those early days that I thought was kind of amazing so Greg was born in ' 89 which puts him around 34 years old now he joined stripe in 2010 became CTO in 2013 so he was CTO of stripe when he was about 24 25 years old and then he go he left stripe to co-found open AI so he was only 26 27 when he started working on open AI it's pretty amazing these guys are are freaks unreal it's wild it's unreal and by the way what did you give we you forgot to give a grade so Sam malman he's going to win no matter what in all of this I so I think he was going to get like let's say a B+ right he was going to get a B+ why because you got fired you got backstabbed by your own your own people that not not great not a great thing to happen two they haven't said what you did but you did something right they weren't just going to fire you for nothing so like uh you did something we don't know what it is known okay I can't give you an AP for that uh it looked like he was going to get the job back which would have been great but then he didn't so ah it didn't come it didn't didn't happen in the end so even though you got some some support from your team didn't happen until the Microsoft thing happened which was literally like imagine playing a game of chess and you're like oh I think I got this guy uh you know I have a five piece to three Advantage here his Queen is out and then you look up from the board and he's holding you know a Glock to your head and that's what happened to Ilia here basically it's like he's now he's at Microsoft they have the license to all of the technology they have all the training data in the world because guess what 90% of computers are PCS that run Microsoft that run you know Windows uh he has all the funding in the world he got paid I'm sure there's you know like SAA had to bring uh Sam and Greg in before the stock market open on Monday just to kind of like not have this an issue for Microsoft uh that they got screwed here they put a bunch of money into into a into a lame duck and so he got everything he got the tech 600 of 700 people follow are saying they're going to follow him there so he got the team he got the money he got the funding and he got it all in 48 hours and they and they were basically like yeah they're going to lead a new subsidiary of Microsoft that's going to do open uh that's going to do research on AI it's like Oh you mean open AI part two so so that now he has to walk away with an A+ right like you can't you can't knock that and and he's he's got the good guy label unless they come out with some new information that that shows that he did something effed up which something has to come out there's only three options in my opinion of how the story for Sam ends option A is it's a it's an unforgivable sin I think that that is not likely but it is possible that what he's did is just well you're done option b is he goes back to open AI become CEO I think that was more likely not going to happen I I think but option C is he stays at Microsoft and I think in a decade or five years he becomes the CEO of Microsoft which is now worth5 trillion dollar or something at that point 2.7 trillion today yeah so he's he's GNA turn out okay so now this other guy Ilia he looks like a schmuck here so he's he's a loser here he looks he looks like IIA gets an F he gets an F there's a little bit of likability with him where it's like oh you're just a brilliant SCI artist turn who was who was uh you were you were manipulated in here because you're just a scientist and you don't understand human interaction we he play so we should explain one thing which is what are the possibilities of what Sam did that might put Sam in the wrong or Illy in the right so there is what you're calling the unforgivable sin which I would say by the way not a great track record of anything being unforgivable but let's say the really the bad personal stuff could be the could be one reason why in which case I would say that's a completely Fair reason to remove him if they did an investigation found out that that was true that they're in the right for removing him um that's defensible but they just haven't said anything um reason number two is uh safety concern so Ilia is famously like the reason he's doing this is literally he's worried about AGI he doesn't want the world to end and uh what initially people thought was Sam says all the right things about safety but also Sam is like a you know capitalist he's a entrepreneur he's he's he he's a he's a hard charging guy and he's running forward here and maybe they're saying slow down and he's saying no we don't need to slow down and they're saying Sam this is too risky and he's saying no no no this is not risky we got to move forward that's what it looked like the situation was and it was made Crazier by the fact that I don't know if you saw this he did an interview the day before and he said something like this he said I've been lucky to be in the room four times now the last one was just a couple weeks ago where I saw something that pushed the veil of ignorance forward and the frontier of techn technology to us and like he pushed the veil of ignorance away and the frontier of technology to us so basically he's saying like there's been like three or four mindblowing moments you know about AI I've been lucky enough to be in the room the last one happened a couple weeks ago SED till you see this it's going to stun people and so so some people are like yo did they like create the monster super intelligent like did they create AGI you know has AGI been achieved internally and he like randomly posted on Reddit not long ago AGI has been achieved internally as like a joke I guess um so some people said maybe they've stumbled into something and this guy's going too fast and it's you know like the scientists are you know around the nuclear bomb saying no no no we got to like destroy this thing or we got to like slow down this is getting too crazy that would have been the other reason which would have been again defensible especially given that open AI Charter is specifically says we're not about increasing shareholder value we are about you know safely building AGI to benefit all of humanity so that is their Charter and if they thought this guy's moving too fast putting that at risk I would say they are completely in the right to do so if they believe that to be true the bad part is again they've come out with no evidence that that that is the case they haven't explained themselves so nobody believes them that that's true uh the third reason so you know you have the really bad thing you have the safety argument and the third thing is essentially it's just a power play they're annoyed by him they don't feel like he listens they feel like he's getting all the credit or he wants Fame and Fortune and Power Play Let's Get this guy out of here and we will we get to run and own this thing and that's like a jealousy driven thing and I don't know which of those is the most true I don't know what you think but uh you know it seems like you know none of those are perfect explanations I think I I'll say what I think maybe later but I it's number three I think I think it's number three um let's talk about let's let's come back to the board but let's talk about emit she because you are one of the handful of people or you know however many people who have had a relationship with him and understand and so last night at 1:00 a.m. uh EMT basically said I've been the guy that's been picked he put out this really good tweet where he explained what he was doing the funniest part I thought was he's had the job now for 12 minutes and he did a wonderful job of saying the word r he goes our products are going to be this our team is going to do this we are going and it reminded me of that Meme where there's a guy who go he goes hey I made this and he hands it to a stick figure and the stick figure goes you made this and then the first guy leaves and the stick figure looks at the thing that and he goes I made this and it's the whole point about on the internet where where people steal stuff I actually think emt's a great guy so I'm I'm just I'm just messing around but I thought it was amazing how he's like 12 minutes later this our company's going to do this what do you think about EMT in this role um he he's been getting a lot of criticism because he previously shared online that he's like I actually think we need to slow things down and and bunch of people are like this is ridiculous don't slow down whatever but he seems like a really thoughtful great CEO am I wrong so emit uh you're right I worked with him for about two years got to sit with him you know in hundreds of meetings and see you know how he thinks and you know hang out with him have beers and just kind of talk to him he came on the podcast I talked to him for an hour there about uh AI stuff you always said he was really thoughtful he's extremely intelligent in a broad way so uh most people are not that intelligent that you meet you meet some people that are like you know oh they're like above average then you meet some people as you say the oven Burns hotter and it's just very clear like he's just got more horsepower in his head than most people I think that's great I think you know uh as much as we like to say that like hard work is what matters like yeah you know what also matters like uh intelligence is also really a really strong attribute it's like you know like yeah um you know Steph Curry's got great skills but like LeBron is 68 250 right like it you know size and speed matter I hate when people downplay intelligence and I'm like guys let's just admit some people are born smarter just like some people are 7et tall there's a reason why 20% of Americans who are 7et tall and below the age of 30 are in the NBA you you just you're better you're better at that particular thing way that height helps you with basketball intelligence helps you with running companies right like that that's a thing uh so Ean is extremely intelligent he is amongst the most intelligent people I've ever met um so that's the that's the first thing uh second thing is he's got depth and breadth so a lot of people are really really intelligent in one specific domain it seems like this guy Ilia might be one of those where he's just extremely extremely technically intelligent but it seems like in the game of you know uh soft power and politics and and uh you know uh people and and all that he you know had a pretty boneheaded way of doing this that didn't didn't work out to his own tweet I deeply regret what I did it was handled very poorly so you know I think he you know some people could really really smart in one technical domain but they're not don't have a breath of of intelligence um I would say that EMT is wide and deep so he's technically very strong he was a great engineer they built twitch one of the you know the best live streaming products and it was him and this guy Kyle Kyle went on to build self-driving cars and EMT ran twitch for like whatever 18 years or some [ __ ] like that um so you know between Justin TV and twitch and so uh he's very good technically which is important because it's a deeply technical product he you know he said to me the other thing one thing when I was talking about AI he's like he's like yeah like once you understand how Transformers work and I was like well let's stop there because I have no idea how Transformers work so like the rest of your sentence because he said it like yeah it's easy I mean just once you once you get out Transformers work it's like you know blah blah blah blah just anybody could go watch a video we've had a smart a couple smart people in this pod and I'm they triy to use analogies because I'd be like I don't understand what you're saying and they' use an analogy and I'm like can you please use use an analogy for your analogy like I think we had biology on here and he was like referring to the battle of the river of TS in World War II in order to like describe crypto and I'm like guy I don't know what the battle battle of Tam was like this doesn't make sense to me right right exactly you know I'm asking for a lunch bowl over here and you're making Gourmet like let's let's do this right what what's his soft skills like well his soft skills I I would say when I experienced him which was like you know whatever he's been he had been running the company for over a decade as CEO uh I thought he was good not great so for example I think he always knew what to do like if you caught him when he was calm he would give great advice on the people's side of how to handle something however In the Heat of the Moment he was prone to Falling it falling into like debates about semantics about words about data that would make people feel like [ __ ] and he would like win the battle and lose the war type of thing with people and so I don't think he was great with that but I also think twitch was like a bunch of very like kind of it was a community product with a bunch of very like sort of woke people at in the company that were like very touchy feel about stuff uh you know I think open AI is going to be his type of people you know like EMT was better in meetings where all the people were engineers and product product people he was worse the more that the people were you know um we got legal PR coms you know marketing you know those meetings went worse for him I thought and so I think he'll have less of that here uh but he also is like apology like he'll reference the Battle of the Bulge like he'll reference you know uh well the judicial system in Ireland back in the 1500s what they did was really interesting it's like dude why do you know this he's like well I've read up on all the Judicial Systems I was very interested in how how governing has changed over time it's like that's your casual reading he's like yeah like I just I I don't know is that not is that weird and it's like you know somebody's really good when they when they don't even realize it's weird when the thing they do is like really [ __ ] weird and so uh he's has a very very wide set of knowledge now he's getting kind of uh labeled as a uh a desel I don't know if you've seen this like a deceleration meaning like somebody wants to slow things down because as soon as he got named suit yeah kind of like a suit or like a Doomer um you know like oh this is this guy's anti- technology which is pretty silly and it's like you know if he could be technology he would you know like he he's a technologist through and through they're calling the guy who invented twitch a boomer basically yeah uh it's stupid and so um you know a friend who a mutual friend described it well they go because people dug up all his old tweets and he said if if an open if opening is at a 10 right now in terms of speed you know it should probably be at like a one or two because uh you know you just don't want this cat to get out of the bag and so um I want to read you what he uh I have the transcript of what he said on our podcast which when he came on about AI so I asked him very simply I said is AI going to kill us all and he goes maybe I I go it's interesting you say maybe it's going to kill us all cuz like you're pretty like Pro technology and everything you're an optimist and he goes well it's because I'm an optimist that I'm scared if I was pessimist if I was like oh this AI thing's overhyped is technolog is not that impressive it's just a nice little magic trick it's but it's nothing real underneath it if I was pessimistic I would be less worried I'm optimistic I am extremely impressed with how these work and I see a pathway where this is going to get better very fast and at some point it's going to be able to self-improve that's very scary CU we don't know what happens on the other side of that it's because I'm optimistic then the second thing he said was he goes here's the analogy uh you know in biology there's like there's now like ways that you can synthetically do things you can we know we can edit genes for example and we can like add an extra leg to a sheep or we can like modify a virus this was like you know Co right like you could modify a virus and make it more uh spreadable and we all saw with Co how dangerous that capability is that like this thing you know if this leaked from a lab that's really really bad like you know that that was a big mistake that technology made that like you know [ __ ] up the world for a few years and so he's like you know we have regulation I think everybody kind of agrees we should maybe not go super fast and make it easy for somebody to like print small pox in their home right like we should maybe not give that capability to everybody and maybe we should like slow down to make sure there's some oversight to we so that we don't do something really bad that like creates a super virus he's like people get that when it comes to biology they don't really get that when it comes to AI he's like with a a I uh here's the thing AI is really good at like the one thing you need in order to be really good at AI at developing AI he's like AI can code it can write code it can read everything there is to know about a subject in an afternoon become absolute World expert at it and then it can translate that into action it can it translate into writing code it could also design chips yeah it doesn't do either of those two things perfectly right now it's not it's not amazing at writing code um and it's not amazing at designing chips but it can do them it's it's within the zone of things that AI can be good at the type of things that AI can be good at which means that over time it's going to be able to write code that designs Ai and write uh you know and design chips that make AI better and once that thing can improve itself it's going to get fast it's going to get really amazing really fast faster than anyone can expect and maybe that's a good thing maybe it all works out but also maybe it doesn't and that's like he's like even if I think the probability of a really bad thing happening is low it's the consequences are so bad we're not just talking about like a virus that's kind of like screws up your computer or like gets like you know even like a pandemic that gets people sick we're talking about this could destroy like he says like we could destroy all of the value with the light cone which I don't even know what the light cone is but I don't want that um right so he's describing like even if it's low probability we should just be really really careful about that and like make sure we don't screw the whole thing up um and a friend reach out at one thing they go they go everybody saying like emt's gonna want to like slow this down and stop it he's like no no emt's smart EMT knows the the game theory of this the prisoners dilemma if you go too slow somebody else will create AGI before you because you you slow down to zero so somebody else will get there before you who may not share your moral beliefs around safety so you can't go too slow where other people get their first who don't share your your safety views but you can't go so fast that you don't actually build to safely there's a Middle Ground to seek and so um and I think that's the best description of this where people are trying to label him as one thing and knowing what I know about him that's just not true well let's go like through Rapid Fire of like some other story points we and we'll make that quick and then also we've been there of what we think will is going to happen one quick story point for you if you like we got to do final grades before we do stories final grades so the the board what do you what you graded the board oh they're [ __ ] losers so the worst they they look horrible they're going to get you got an like and it stands for [ __ ] loser yeah yeah is there an NFL they're the worst I mean it doesn't matter what the truth is it's all about perception and they look like the worst uh including uh uh Adam D'Angelo the founder of Kora right now he looks horrible uh so F they get an F do you agree yeah agreed uh EMT what do you give EMT he's uh 12 minutes onto the job here tbdc he uh he's actually actually it's actually like a d or a c at the moment he's getting dragged I think uh which is fair but no he he looks like he's a loser here because of perception right um and what about he's taking the hero's job like it's it's hard to look good regardless of how amazing he is right right uh and what about SAA Microsoft um he gets a b he looks pretty good I mean he he's he's the man I mean he's kind of made a Resurgence for Saia or for Microsoft I think that um I think there's a real world where Bing actually catches up to Google in terms of search and and uh Microsoft is going to become just an even bigger company than they they already are so yeah I mean he's A's him and Sam are the masterminds I got to give him an A+ the dude you know mobilized over the weekend and before the markets opened and could hit Microsoft stock he had basically acquired open AI for negative $100 billion he Aqua hired open AI which is incredible and so now he got open AI out of the nonprofit capped profit structure it's just super for-profit inside Microsoft he got the key Talent you know Sam Greg all of the key people 600 of the of the key people um and now they just own the whole thing instead of 49% like that's that's an A+ he crushed it on this one um he he's the man um so let's do let's do the story lines yeah here's one quick storyline have you heard of um Fairchild conductors do you know what that is I've so I've heard of it but I'm not a history guy so what's the story there's isn't there something like the the traitorous eight or something what what is that yeah so so basically there was the there was a big company called uh I think it was called Shockley conductors and they made conductors uh computer chips in the 60s in Silicon Valley people were pissed off at the guy who owned it William chaky I think his name is he was brilliant but just a pain in the ass and so these eight guys said hey you got to bail or we're bailing and the guy the CE goes see and so these eight people went and started Fairchild which was basically um the equivalent is like Nvidia but back then in 19 basically birthed Silicon Valley right that was like the that was the seed round of Silicon Valley yeah and they were F their culture was famous because they were casual so it was like where nerds could come and be casual and where like the best actually best ideas actually won and that was where the whole like culture of Sila Valley uh arguably started there and then the off offshoot of fair child conductors was basically uh IBM so IBM was founded by one of the founders of Fairchild um uh Andy Grove the guy the famous manager of I think he was the CEO of IBM he came from there U the founders of seoa capital uh Kleiner and Perkins I think might have spun out I mean like B basically it was there's just all these people but uh the story of the treacherous eight is what they're called is very similar to this story and so if you're interested in this type of uh like stuff and you and you could actually go and read that book and you could see a lot of similarities between what is going on now so this is like our version of that and so it's going to end well I think for Greg and Sam because I it ended really nicely for the the treacherous eight um so that's an interesting by the way my prediction is that they they unwind this whole thing and they revert back to open AI by the way that's my like is it hasn't happened yet but I think the final step now now that Ilia signed the pledge being like I quit and I'm also going to go work there it's like what is the point of even having the open AI entity if 600 of the people including all of the leaders are gone um I don't think they want to be inside Microsoft necessarily so I think what's to happen is I think this was the final straw and by the end of I bet by the end of day today uh they get a whoopsy daisy undo on the whole thing and uh Sam is back as CEO of open Ai and uh they just the board quits and they get a new board that's my my prediction by the way I think doesn't make I believe I believe that that prediction I think is the same I think there's long predictions here which is new startups aren't going to want to have board of directors um I actually think that's the wrong takeaway Brian hallan from HubSpot he wrote he's like no the takeaway shouldn't be not have a board the takeaway should be have a good board um and I think so but I think that potentially like the governance structure of companies might actually change significantly because people are going to be like uh they're going to they're going to have PTSD from just hearing the story and that actually is going to have Downstream effects that are quite large and and in a weird way it could even impact like the Venture Capital industry I think that is um a real possibility I totally agree and I think it's so stupid so right now there's so many startups that are reading their their governing documents about the board and thinking through do I need to change my board here's my public service announcement don't worry bro you're not open AI you're not Sam Alman and uh your board is also not these Schmucks either and nobody cares and like you know the for a startup like don't worry about your governance structure right now like you should be doing these standard vanilla things of you know put competent people there and then don't worry about it too much like you need product Market fit you don't have this problem in the same way that like when you hear what's going on with like Uber or Facebook it's like you're not Uber and Facebook you don't have the same problems that they have don't suddenly start spending your energy over there and take your eye off the actual main problem that you need product Market fit you need growth I think the the takeway here is open ai's board was stupid I that was actually a strategic mistake it seems like on Sam alman's part also I think the whole nonprofit stick that was stupid too um TBD if that if I'm going to be right on that but as of now it's look it would have been a lot simpler maybe if this is just a board or this is just a normal board where they have Equity started with a good board they started with Elon Musk and Reed Hoffman and all these like legit players on their board and then by one they all quit so basically like Elon quit cuz things weren't like they weren't listening to him and he took his ball and tried to run home uh Reed Hoffman quit because he started a competitor another guy quit because he wants to run for president another person quit it's like basically five of the original board members quit for different reasons either starting competitors or conflict of interest or uh running for president or whatever and um this is what they got left with yeah so hopefully that gets changed um what are any other takeaways I think um what were you saying about this was the best and the worst of us yeah that was kind of my big picture takeaway like I feel like this was the best of Silicon Valley and the worst of Silicon Valley all in the same weekend um you know the best I thought was things like you know what Greg did when he was like yo I'm out too I quit even though they tried to they they wanted to retain him they weren't firing him it's like yeah that's a real co-founder right that's that's a that's a ride or die sort of ducks fly together moment and I thought that was uh that was badass I thought that was the best of us and then I thought the worst of us was like this like stupid board that has no skin in the game that doesn't know how to communicate that didn't like handle this well just fumbling and bumbling and removing a Founder from their removing basically the greatest founder alive you know outside of Elon Musk from their company that they created for what seems like no reason and if there is a reason you got to like say it and even if you say it in a way that wasn't like doesn't get you sued like you know maybe that's why they're not saying anything but you have to at least tell your team you have to give more than what they did uh they handle it better than what they did um and if it was so bad then don't negotiate with him to come back right like if it was that bad then he shouldn't have 24 hours later been in discussions to come back um you know so the board I thought was you know was the worst of us I thought you know Twitter was alive and popping and it really did feel like it was the Silicon Valley group chat that was kind of the best of us and the worst worst of it was like you know it felt like Gossip Girls all weekend and um that's kind of lame and there's a bunch of you know like speculation wasted energy and you know like I saw these Twitter spaces going on for hours and hours of people just like discussing like you know it was a real housewives episode and they can't believe that Jenna said that right like it just seemed like you know it wasn't it seemed like gossip and I thought that was a waste of time you know I thought there was a whole bunch of things that were kind of like the best and the worst showed themselves in the same weekend you know maybe um you know it could be that there actually is a legitimate you know crazy safety concern concern and like this guy was going too fast and you know this Ilia guy was maybe the hero and was pumping the brakes even though it screwed up their his own economics if he really was standing for something he believed in right like it could be that it was that or it could be that it was a jealousy power play and and take him out right we don't know but I just thought there was a whole bunch of best and worse another one was like just this instant labeling like these like tribes like I don't know if you've seen this like e slac thing is that the E cell and D cell yeah basically this there's a whole bunch of people in the Twitter bio that have EAC I've been seeing this for months I have no idea I didn't even know what the hell this was but it's except you're an effective accelerationist right so it's basically like kind of a play on the effective um uh Al or whatever altruism that s bankman freed was doing that's pretty stupid I think the one is basically like pedal to the metal uh you know Tech forward progress forward technology Optimist uh and it's like that's the cool Club to be in and then anybody who's like saying hey slow down you're a Dell which is like you know um it's the dword basically it's a it's a slur it's an insult and to me this was again it's the worst of us it's the it's like people in Silicon Valley make fun of politics like oh I'm not left or right it's not that simple it's not Republican Democrat I'm not I don't fall into these stupid party you know tribes that are just blindly you know following the herd and it's like we're doing the same thing uh this eel D cell [ __ ] is the same thing as Democrat Republican R blue left right um it's a oversimplification of um a massive over oversimplification of what's going on and so I thought that was kind of the worst of us too final prediction my prediction is in the next 24 hours all this is going to be undone and things will be back to normal that's my prediction is that yours too I maybe we'll give it 48 hours but I think at this rate 24 hours when I was in second grade my class had a field trip and um they said they told the parents they said hey you need 20 bucks to come to this field trip so my mom gives me $20 in the morning and I go and I'm excited about the field trip I don't think I'd ever been on a field trip think was my first and uh they're like hey okay put your thing over here sign your give me your signed waiver and put your 20 bucks and I'm like looking around I'm like where did my 20 bucks go I was right this is my desk it's not here I'm looking under the table on the desk I check my backpack I'm like what the hell somebody took my 20 bucks I can't go on the field trip now and so I go to the teacher and I'm like Miss like uh somebody stole my $20 and she's like oh my God like stealing that's the stealing money from a kid like that's not okay and she's like are you sure I'm like yeah I was right there and so uh she turns the world upside down she starts she's like hey Blows the Whistle she's like everybody sit down who has the money and it's just silence nobody raises their hand and she's like okay we'll try this a different way I'm going to put a jar outside and we're going to walk out one by one and I want the $20 to be in the jar by the time this done no harm no foul everybody walks out everybody walks in she comes back jars empty and she's pissed now she's like okay I gave you a chance to do this clean I gave you a chance to do this publicly now we're not going on the field trip guys guess what and uh and I'm like oh my God this is like getting the field trip cancelled this is crazy not just for our class she tells the teacher next door she's like we don't earn we didn't earn this because there's been you know one of our core values has been betrayed here and where was the $20 and then I'm like I got to go to the bathroom and I get I get up I'm like Miss can I go to the bathroom she's like yeah sure I get up and I feel this like scratchy feeling in my sock oh and I'm like I reached down and I'm like [ __ ] I put I put the 20 bucks in my sock this morning that's right I just remember but here I am like a drug dealer dude what are you do here I am and now I'm like what do I do I'm like the class is going to be so mad at me if they realize this is in my sock the whole time the teacher's going to be so mad at me if she realizes that I accidentally did this I didn't mean for all this to happen and so I went to the restroom I took the 20 bucks put it in the toilet and I flushed the toilet I went back to my seat did you really did you really do that is that really how that ended no that made for better better but I did hand it to her and she laughed it off and then we went on the field trip but I thought it' be a better story the other way but that thing did happen with the sock and it wasted half of the field trip day and uh that's how I feel Ilia feels right now where he's like I did not mean for all this to happen like this got way bigger than I thought this was going to get and uh whoops can I just like give you this 20 bucks we pretend this never happened and that's what he's trying to do right now and uh you know power to him I I've been there I feel you all right well we're going to see what happens um that's the pod

like one of my one of my goals one something this is going to sound crazy and this is the perfect the perfect audience to say this but like I get so jacked up about the idea of like toppling a DCT dictatorship one day I get so excited by it and I'm like I'm not even [Music] kidding all right look at what I have on my head there we go oh look at that look at this guy Wow you went from dad to cool dad in one episode with that hat I'm hip I'm hip you had the shirt too did you buy like a full uniform or are you actually just working there now or what Jonathan got the hookup and he and he got a swag bag from them and he gave came over to my house the other day and gave it to me and have you gotten any compliments or like do um anybody under the age of like 25 recogniz you now or something a few a few a few young people one young person said called me cool guy that's all the affirmation you're looking for now as a dad get away from me cool guy hey why why you staring at me cool guy did you need something that's how it was uh you want to kick us off who do we got all right we got Patrick in the house Patrick's been on before so the OG listeners know all about Patrick Campbell PC as he's in my phone he uh created a company called profit well sold it for 200 million bucks he's got the background that we always talk about where I'm like I noticed that people who have this background tend to be winners more often than not he was a competitive debater uh some would call him a master debater he's a um he was in the the NSA the intelligence agency so he brought last time you were on you were telling us about all the crazy [ __ ] you did to gather intelligence at as uh in the startup world so like how do you learn about what your competitors are doing and whatnot and now today he's back with a bunch of ideas and um I want to know what you've been doing because you sold your company for 200 million bucks and then you had a bunch of time on your hands and that's a deadly combo uh you sent you sent us something I want to start with this uh thing you texted us about the Bezos number and I don't know too much about it so I want you to explain you go I've been I've been working on I've been searching for my Bezos number I don't even know what that means explain what is the basos number yeah totally so here here's the thing as this started from a premise so sold a company basically um working at paddle and also thinking about like what the next thing looks like and what I found in the ideation process like I haven't come up with ideas in like 10 years I've helped like companies come up with ideas but it's just one of those interesting aspects of the entrepreneurship journey and my big belief is your job as an operator is to basically know your customer and know your space better than anyone else and you need to do this before you start building because a lot of entrepreneurs fall into this trap where we're really good at willing stuff into existence because that's our job except it's relatively easy to do that today so this means that like basic ideas are cheap mostly indefensible and worse they waste a lot of our time and so the first step I come in terms of an ideation process is using this Bezos number framework and basically when Jeff Bezos started Amazon he noticed this like crazy stat you know this new thing called the internet was growing 2700 per per year um so you knows he's got to build something on it um he didn't know what it was but he was starting from the trend because when you go where the water's flowing as they say and ride a wave you don't need to be like a genius to figure out what a really cool business looks like so I have this doc um and I'm happy to share it with the audience where myself and a researcher basically call through industry reports Trend and Stat websites um and then the hack that no one really probably uses but they should use um is we use Google Scholar and other academic kind of publishing sites uh to find all these Trends because in Academia you have a lot of like undergrads and grad students basically writing a bunch of papers about here's what's going on in the space Here's all these numbers that are going up or down um and then I put this into a spreadsheet and then basically label a couple of different you know categories one in particular is like what's the doubling time of this particular Trend um as well as like how long or how fast this trend is going what the causes are what the effects are and the basic idea is then I can find like hey the world needs something in this space or the world's going in this direction and partially I can figure out like oh this is something that I could get paid for kind of in that eeky guy framework that you like Sam um I can basically take that by looking at these Trends so let's describe this sheet so basically it's like category so you got like social issues Health Care energy right so that the big categories then within each one you have a trend and so like for example a trend would be top college admissions rates are dropping so and then it says Stanford admissions went from 4.8 to 3.9 in The Last 5 Years and Harvard dropped from 6% to 4% in The Last 5 Years um so then it says Direction you know decreasing uh in five years you know what is the kind of rate that this is happening what's the doubling time so like how many years would it take for this to this trend to uh the where we're at today to double based on that rate and then here's the sources and possible causes and possible effects of it and so you have I don't know like a hundred in here basically uh let's read a couple of these out I want you to to kind of Riff on on a couple of these or you can pick maybe what what does it mean when it's in blue does that mean you like that one or something or what does that mean uh those are just some some interesting trends that we've gone deeper on basically all right let's do this random one I want you to talk about this number number of coral bleaching events I don't even know really what that means what is a coral bleaching event and why does that matter basically Coral is uh you know dying out um you know essentially when there's like stressful um conditions Coral ends up like bleaching so this particular idea like I don't know what a business could look like in here and that's not the point necessarily of like the Bezos numbers is like I'm not necessarily trying to find like one particular business I'm trying to find an overall trend right because some Downstream effects of this could be there's more money that's from the government from regulation basically going into protecting you know International or you know National Waters and there's a bunch of different things that are why is coral bleaching bad okay well let's go back to your high school biology uh class I didn't know that's what I would be teaching today but um the basic idea is like you're killing off ecosystems in the ocean right that's probably the most basic way I can say it and there's a lot of Downstream effects when an entire ecosystem basically falls apart and the coral is a major part don't act like I should know this man 90% of people 90 95% of people listening to this do not know if Coral it's beautiful coral it's alive Coral it's part of the underwater ecosystem and it's like the butterfly effect you just take away big part of the ecosystem it's going to have all these like secondary effects on the fish do you care about fish Sam or do we need to explain why fish matter I do not care about fish look you guys Sean you know about don't don't get get off your here's the point Sam Sam here's the point the point is we're looking for major Trends and those major Trend like you ran a basically a trend Service website like you understand the nature of Trends what I'm looking for in a particular idea is I'm basically looking for really really fast growing Trends in One Direction or another because that's where essentially as I was saying like the water is going to continue this Coral theme and basically if I can ride a particular wave I'm hedging essentially all these business decisions that I might be making Downstream from it got it so pick another one on this sheet Patrick that you find interesting that you you kind of have noodled on a little bit Yeah so there's I mean the obvious ones are like interest in AI these types of things but like some some less obvious ones might be around the kind of like the social issues right so right now A really sad one to kind of talk about are like school shootings right so I don't know if you've looked into this particular Market not obviously increasing or you know school shootings but like there's an entire Market that has been created around this because of the rise of that particular happening now you can get into kind of like the government dynamics of like gun control and stuff like that but like there still is the fact that schools are looking to like not only make their students feel safer but also their parents feel safer so there's things like bookcases that fly in front of you know doors there's things like clear backpacks there's an entire Market that's kind of propped up against this and when you see this particular Trend you can then think through the second and third order effects to essentially come up with is this something that hopefully you can you know obviously help the actual Trend go down but also you can make sure that you can build a good business around it I have a random question why don't they just make put a certain thing in the gun that like you know for example we have metal detectors which is like we're trying to find a gun but there might be other metal there should just be a thing in every gun that's like a detectable thing that you can now if if you're a security thing it's like oh we're always looking for this certain compound of lead because that's intentionally put chipped into every gun that's sold so that it can we can easily identify hey a gun just walked through this door uh so a metal detector is that basically what you're saying or but not metal I'm saying metal will catch all kinds of metal I'm saying they should put something that's unique in every gun in the mold of every gun so that it can be detected easier than looking for all metals and slowing everybody down for like keys in your pocket got Sean your your your California is showing coming out yeah you you I thought you were going to say something that they can remotely turn off all the guns in something happens FL the gun hey it might even be a status symol like it beeps it's like hell yeah I'm packing right who knows I'm not I'm not judging I'm just saying we're covering the environmental global warming debate and guns that's what makes my first dud I was just flying so I went through TSA like three times I went through Disneyland security i' I've just been thinking about how do we make this faster because it's a very slow process yeah yeah Imaging is actually getting really really good I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay align no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better you you have another thing on here that is interesting and I think Scott Galloway talked about it was and i' never I didn't see the stat until just now teenagers not having sex so you said that um it's doubling every 9 years it Rose from 11% to 2 1% of teens that do not have sex that that haven't had sex in the last year um that's kind of interesting I think that Japan if I mean you looked into this more than I Japan has suffered from this and isn't there like a like an idea that like in the next 10 or 20 years Japan's population is really really really going to be hurting for this lack of procreating yeah well there's there's a lot of countries where that's going to happen even China they're talking about you know a pretty big collapse um and so there's a lot of again causes for where this is at and I'm not an expert on like population design or anything like that but I do think that this is something that's really big not only amongst just teens in general but also amongst young men um who are kind of you know basically checking out of the ecosystem and this is like a pretty big problem just for the economy in general let alone like procreation and fertility and stuff like that and so this is kind of an interesting space where like yeah you have a social issue or like you know cultural issue that's kind of driving things in One Direction are there like private solutions to kind of quote unquote solve this particular problem um you know cuz at least in America we're not going to do what you know China has been rumored to be doing you know with kind of like the reverse of a two child policy like these types of things and so yeah it's just this is one of those Trends as well that's like worth going deeper and deeper on to see like what's going on not only make the world a better place but like see where business can be and this cost of cyber crime one that's one of your fastest growing ones what's that yeah so basically um the amount of damages from cyber crime so this is not only things like targeting old people you know for fraud but also this is things like um you know a DDOS attack on a particular website or for a company um basically cyber crimes exploding um and it's probably going to accelerate even further with AI Beyond this like 7x 5year magnitude that I have in the spreadsheet um and so yeah that's that's something that's really interesting because you don't really have good solutions for it um you have everything from like Aura and some of these like kind of VPN identity protection products um but on the corporate side there's been a lot of money that's sosed in there but it's I don't want to say it's obsolete but it's changed dramatically with like the birth of AI and all that kind of fud that's happening with that market there was one there's a couple on here that um we've seen people come on this podcast and talk about specific businesses they created off of these Trends so for example um you have sports betting revenue and uh it's the doubling time you have on here is less than one year so you said it was legalized in 2018 it's it's already 4.3 billion in the US right now so and that's a five year fiveyear span to get to about 5 billion in revenue on on US legal sports betting and it's still only legal in what Patrick I don't know if you know the the details but it's only legal in a couple of states right it's not like yeah it's it's it's there are more States I believe that have legal marijuana than they do of sports betting so it's but it's it's getting a little bit easier the the rumor is and again not an expert on this in particular but the rumor is is that there'll be a lot more states that come with this before the other states kind of legalize marijuana and so those are both markets that are really interesting because it you know gets into all the vice Market kind of dynamics that you see with a lot of those different of companies we the guy we sold uh the milk road to two guys one of the guys had this interesting backstory because they bought it with their own money and not they're not like a company they didn't raise money and so we were like where where are you getting the funds to make this size purchase and they were like well you know here's our backgrounds and one of the guys had a fascinating background so he was a a affiliate marketer so he basically would make like content sites for online uh poker and online poker was legal for a while then Black Friday came online poker is no longer legal in the United States so it's like business died overnight and so what every he was in a really competitive space of all night poker Affiliates because it was like a a just absolute Cash Cow to be a poker affiliate because somebody's going to immediately go deposit money and you would get your your fee for that and so when they killed it in the United States out of the 100 competitors 99 said well I guess we'll opt for international traffic now that's the only answer yeah he just took a different approach he sat there and he looked he's like well okay it's illegal right now in the States but is it going to be illegal forever probably not and he kind of waited and he's like he was just patient and he saw a little Trend pick up where the um New Jersey was rumored to be uh be the first state that was going to legalize it again or it was going to legalize uh online gambling only for if you lived in New Jersey and uh and I think the way it worked was like there was like local casinos that could have online portals to for you to gamble on and so when everybody else went International he's like I will now be the New Jersey betting affiliate and he created his website was like I don't know what it was it's was like betting in new jersey.com or something like that like very hyper targeted sounded so Niche um it sounded almost like a step down but what he realized was if one State's going to do it and then the second state started to get rumored to do it he's like oh this is a trend I just want to surf I'm going to start now and make all the content for this for the states that are rumored and I will be the best position when the time comes as this as this accelerates and so he did the New Jersey one he sells it for I think it's publicly out there it's like 42 or $46 million to a bigger Bing company and then he just he's like oh cool Minnesota's coming next he does the exact same thing and does it for Minnesota sells that one for another 40 something million and to the same company uh like within a like sort of two-year time span and then that company was smart and they they're like hey uh okay now this covers like all states you can't just do this you can't just keep flipping these to us for 50 million a pop and so he basically made like a hundred million selling the same business just looking at the data and the trend and the news and realizing okay this is going to happen it's just a matter of timing uh this this wave now and he was the only one that was really paying attention to that and it was him and one other guy and they just merged and so they became they be they then owned all the supply so they could jack up the rates as an affiliate um which normally is other problem with Affiliates they get put under pricing pressure but because him and the other guy merged they could go demand whatever rate they wanted to anybody who wanted customers because they were the only only show in town um the other one you have on here is popularity of French bulldogs so you say it's uh doubled in five years um and bu French Bulldogs are now the number one breed of an in the uh AK the American uh Kennel Club um which is like a published database basically and so our friend Ramone kind of did this with wiener dogs he was like oh like look at how popular these groups are how fast they're growing on Facebook of people who own wiener dogs and he's like what's a pro then he started brainstorming like what's a problem in the weener dog space and he found this company that was making ramps for wiener dogs to get on and off of beds and couches and because he saw the popularity of these groups and how Avid the owners were how fast those groups were growing how big they were he knew there's a market for Wier dog ramps which like if you walk into Harvard Business School and you're like here's my big idea they'd be like you're nuts uh you know you get laughed out of the room but that business was doing you know whatever 20 million a year because he was able to like correctly identify the right Trend he scaled it I think from like 300,000 a year to like 17 million a year in like 20 months or something like that yeah it was insane but this is why like again ideation is it treated a little bit more like a science than just this random like listening to podcasts YouTube videos and like having a notebook because there's a lot of these ideas that like I couldn't tell you what a good business idea is in them but if I start to think about it further and further that's where like really good ideas come from right so the French Bulldogs right like I don't know what the pain points of French Bulldogs are but similar to remot story there's like something very interesting there either directly or like sitting around that particular idea that could be really really interesting so basically we've all seen with AI people can now it's like generative AI you can create an image or create a video from just a prompt or from you could deep fake a video really easily and so uh you know crypto gets a lot of [ __ ] for having like oh there's no like use case for this even though like you know money is the main use case but they're like the blockchain one of the other use cases for blockchain and there's a really interesting company that's doing something in the space where they were like hey um crypto has this really cool thing where you have a private key you have your own address that only you you own and control and what what they normally do is they say hey sign it to do a transaction so if you want to send money you sign it with your private key that's how you authorize the transaction so these guys what they realize is hey there's now going to be so much video out there and there's going to be a big question of is this photoshopped is this deep faked is this real or is this fake and they were like people are going to need people companies they're going to need a way to authenticate or to sign a piece of content and say this was real I made this this is actually me um versus the viewer having the putting the burden on the viewer and be like can you tell if this is real or fake it's like dude I don't know it's too hard like misinformation is going to spread so now there's going to be like a watermark that basically the Creator the original owner the the person in question can use their private key to sign and say yep that was that was real that was me that was my video or that was my my writing I actually said that that's my voice I I did say those words and it will become true very soon that like if there's a piece of content that's unsigned it's be like y I don't you know I don't know what this is this is this ain't organic produce I don't know what this is this I don't know where this came from um I don't trust this and so I think that's going to be one of the the the consequence of let's say you see this rise in generative AI as a trend you say oh that's great people are going to create all kinds of content but wait that means we're not going to know what's real and what's been generated by AI we need a solution for that and I think those guys are going to do pretty well what's what's interesting about this is not just the trends but the fact that you're doing this and and I think that that's kind of breaks uh a couple rules or at least rules that people think exist and a lot of people don't know that Jeff Bezos story but basically I think he I think the exact the exact quote was pretty good it said something like uh I saw the internet was growing at 23 100% a year and I realized nothing outside of of a petri dish grows that fast and I just thought what can I sell and well let's just start with books because they're easy to ship and there's a lot of them and so I can just pack Amazon with almost every book I can find and I think people will buy that um whereas a lot of people think they have to start a company because they have like some passion about it or some Mission which I actually think your passion can develop once you start working on it and it starts succeeding um a have you thought about selling your research process because that's actually what I did with Trends and I and I made a bunch of mistakes with that I should have charged more maybe I shouldn't even have done it in the first place but um a what's your end goal with this with with like your have you thought about making my mistake well that's what I heard it could have done better I should have charged 30,000 instead of or I should have charged way differently that's where I screwed up um but have you have you thought about turning this into a business the second question what is your outcome with your second business now that you have Financial Security and uh like do you have like a legacy plan do you have a number that you're working back for back from what are you doing to to decide which one to actually go down yeah so I think that to answer the first question I I've been asked because we've talked about research stuff a lot like either through DMs or on the last pod like I think research companies they have they have a fatal flaw where where they give people a dopamine Rush of understanding something but people are pretty bad at then using that information in some particular way so like the retention ends up not being great unless you turn into like a McKenzie style like oh we trusted them to come in and do this research and kind of go from there so like even the competitive Intel stuff like I I know how to use that because I've been taught how to use it and I've like developed it people really like the dopamine of like oh I can see exactly what's going on but they don't know how to like get to the next step so if I were to do it it would be some sort of you know almost do it for you not only in terms of the research but then connecting that to some sort of outcome where they can just hook it up and then it targets their ads or something um to actually get an outcome so I can take the thought process out of the um out of my customer's you know particular um evaluation of the product I think in terms of the second question for me I'm I'm like a cliche second time founder now right so I'm basically like either I'm going to go into like cash flowing lifestyle style points type businesses or I'm going to go into like big ass you know Innovation type business and I think the basis numbers piece is really really powerful for the latter one because you know you're looking at some really big trends that probably have some social and cultural like implications but then you're also trying to build like a particularly big business which is what my intention is essentially and I've done a lot of work over the past year to kind of like come to that realization with like coaches and therapists and all that kind of fun stuff so for me what I do is I look at this and I don't know if the Bezos number piece is is is necessarily like useful to folks who aren't trying to like build big I think it's really useful for folks who want to do like quick hits but I think like the next framework that I kind of put in there around like you know taking different product ideas and then spinning them in terms of different customer bases or different like differentiators that's what most people should be doing because Innovation like a 10x better product is almost impossible in this particular environment now like 10 15 years ago you could build an Innovative 10x better product because you were the one that had the special relationship with the supplier in Yemen for the coffee or something like that or you were the one that only could build this particular feature but now everyone in their mother can spin up a website features are no longer really defensible anymore and unless you have like some sort of patentable or some sort of scientific kind of breakthrough or regulatory kind of protection um your best thing you're going to do is like a two or 3x better product and um that's why I think it's just one of those things that um you know Innovation isn't something that you should be targeting unless you're really really going big is essentially what I'm getting at why do you care about doing the cash flow thing because many of our friends Sean and I friends me and Sean's friends and you I'm sure your buddies are like this they're quite wealthy many tens of millions or hundreds of millions and they're like but I would love to have $5 million a year of income I for me and this is like very personal it's not for everybody but like I discovered in going through this like wave of like massive wealth really quickly I discovered that like like I'll give you like a little bit of an anecdote so when the money hit the bank account I felt nothing like I was like happy I was like obviously you know happy for the team but the thing that like went into the back of my head and I didn't know how to express it in this particular way was very much well if I did it it must not have been that hard which goes into like childhood it goes into a bunch of different things and so when I'm thinking about the next business I look at those two paths right like there's like more cash flowy business own your own destiny lifestyle style points these types of things and then I think that there's like spending your time going after something that's harder and harder and trying to go after Innovation right like the perfect like antithesis of how I view the world now is like Nick Huber right Nick is like why would you ever try to like innovate that's like so much harder Etc and we've had many like long night conversations about that um and for me it's like I want to go after that bigger and bigger thing and it took it took a long time to like realize that cuz I went after like oh let's do this let's do that let's do this other thing let's go after this quick Buck you bought 19 gas stations I did buy 19 gas stations but that's Jenny that's Jenny that's the wife the wife handles the real estate portfolio and it doesn't mean I'm not going to like do stuff but like my primary focus is going to be like one big thing um I don't want to be an investor I don't want to like come up with a bunch of cash flowing like Studio style businesses I I respect a hell out of all those things it's just I just found out it's not for me or at least that's that's where I got to by by the way could you tell us the gas station thing real quick would you meet Sayad and he told you about his gas station portfolio so okay here's what happened so I bought 19 gas stations um they're in North and South Carolina you bought them all at once or like one at a time like you bought a chain all in one pot so essentially there was there was a kind of a patriarch of a family who had built up a portfolio about 120 he passed away and then um basically I think it was the trust or the estate I don't know which which but he was they were selling them off in blocks right and they don't want to sell off like one at a time cuz it's 120 because the kids they had a tax bill coming up because the inheritance y y y so um this actually is is this started with Nick Huber and Mitchell um ball Bridge um of the ceg world because they started talking to me about oh there's there's some tax implications where if if your partner your wife or your husband is a real estate professional your passive losses on like real estate become active losses and they offset active gains so got a big pile of you know kind of gains from the sale of the company and then all of a sudden I can offset those with depreciation of the gas stations and I can do that with bonus depreciation in one year so just to use some round numbers like if I buy $10 million of gas stations I basically can take eight million of depreciation essentially and that can offset some of those particular gains and so in October September um Nick starts telling me about this I start talking to Mitchell trying to figure it out I start talking to tax lawyers all of a sudden we got intro to someone who saw saw this deal of these 120 Jenny has been in the real estate game for like 10 years and so it it's one of those things we were able to kind of like you know we weren't starting from zero but it was still like a big big purchase um and we closed I think like December 23rd or something like that so like right right at the particular edge of the end of the year to uh to not only get a good deal um because we had you know we looked at the real estate deal independent of the tax implications but the tax implications kind of put it over the top to be really really good and has there been like are is it just like wow this was a great asset great smooth sailing or is it like oh my God I have 19 pain in the asses now or what's the what's the situ like what's the verdict of guy who didn't own real estate in gas stations like Tech entrepreneur does this thing that has clear benefits on the tax side might have a might be a nice diversifying part of my portfolio might be good cash flow might also be a headache what's your answer now that you've come out the other side uh so they're triple net leases so that basically means we don't manage don't handle any operations anything like that um they're owned by a a big flag a big company um so they're corporate backed which may or may not mean anything depending on who you ask in the real estate world so we've had very little headaches um we also have a partner on the deal who's you know we were the money they're handling most they handled all the analysis and all that kind of fun stuff um so it's it's been pretty smooth sailing I mean there hasn't been any issues that's famous last words I think um there's a way to basically you know manage these into more Investments and things like like that those that's where it can get a little tricky but like yeah we we got at least knock on wood pretty lucky in terms of what's going on but you got to can you get can you give any numbers I mean how much income is that bringing in how much did it cost can can you give any numbers on that do you feel comfortable I can give you some numbers so um well I don't know my wife runs it so if you don't want to share the specifics on yours you could just be like you know I think about this way like uh this business is a box like a restaurant restaurant will typically cost you say half a million to open and then you're trying your goal is to n 150k a year per location you want to get to 20 that's how you get scale like it's simpler than that so it it's 30 million in gas stations um I believe I I can't remember the exact cap rate um basically what we're getting out of it but we're getting um I believe the Caps are at like five and a half um and so we're not getting like an IM like an immense amount of income from that um but we are getting income basically from it and then the leases on this particular deal made it so great is um all of the like rent increases were based off of CPI and they were they were written in like the early 2000s so basically what's happening is as you've seen all the inflation data when these rent increases go into effect the increase in rent is pretty significant um and so that's what made the deal really really good but like yeah we're we're cash flowing I don't know it's it's it's definitely over a million a year on these um I don't know the exact numbers um which I feel good about because it's one of those things where I trust my wife to figure it out and you also said that there was like you you sell the company and you're like uh you go through this wandering phase for like a year uh you said there's five phases what are the five phases of I just sold my company for a bunch of money yeah this is like the the champagne problem cycle I think and it's it it's just this crazy roller coaster and I don't know Sam Sean if you guys went through this but for me like I was pretty even keeled emotionally before the actual sale what I mean by that is like something bad would happen to the business I'd be like oh that sucks okay let's figure it out something good I'd be like oh great but we have all these other problems um when the sale goes through especially if it's like announced like everyone kind of starts treating you like a god for like a hot second and then that leavs you to go like wait am I a God right you have this little bit of this like almost this like impostor like I don't know what reverse impostor syndrome is and like I never got like I have good friends around me who are like yeah you your your [ __ ] still stinks but like it was one of those funny things where you're just like oh my God I can do anything and then like you go through the second phase which is like oh my God I fear death I'm going to screw this up I'm going to like I don't know how to Rich how does one rich correctly I'm going to lose it all and this is when you're like tax lawyers accountants other lawyers how do I evaluate how they're good or not like all these crazy thing what is a wealth manager like oh my God the wealth managers every single one of them tells you just put it in index funds and then you ask them well then what's your job and then they're like oh we just advise you and you're like okay what does that mean and they can't answer the question so do you get one do you not get one right and then um you start to get a handle on things you start to kind of like Get Your Feet Under you you buy a bunch of gas stations you do this type of a thing and then like phase three is like or like part of phase three is like I call this the delusional peak of cocaine energy and this is like you have all this energy and you're like I'm going to do everything right this is what I was getting into a Sam before it's like I'm going to hire 19 people or not 19 17 people it's 19 gas station 17 people to do research to look into things to go look at this deal to go look at that deal and just like do all of these things and I'm going to build this and I'm going to build that because you just have this all this energy and this optionality um and that leads to just a full-blown identity crisis um and so I hired a couple of shrinks um to basically help because you know it was a major change in my life and you know just kind of a major thing where like it's kind of like you know figuring out like who you are what you want which I kind of talked about a little bit before and starting to realize like oh like I don't have to do these things I can do these things what do I want to do um what does that look like and then you know then you kind of even out and you go back to the Grind so that was like my last year of just up down down even further and then kind of back up to figuring out like hey this is what I want um and kind of going from there you even did this cool study or this survey where you talked to didn't you survey a bunch of people who are wealthy and you asked them about happiness and things like that yeah this is how I cope with things research as you clearly can see so I spent 50 Grand on like a study basically running and this is one of our products at profa well was like basically running research studies um and so I spent 50 Grand basically trying to get in front of as many like Rich folks as humanly possible um and then doing a bunch of qualitative conversations with like you know you know number of billionaires a bunch of like sentim millionaires Etc and just trying to figure out like okay what what makes them happy what makes them unhappy so that I can you know kind of some of those lessons for for me personally what what were the lessons one of the biggest lessons that I think is most helpful and I don't know if everyone's going to be able to like hear it they or they'll hear it but I don't know if they'll actually like internalize it is when you look at the stack of like how money can actually bring happiness um there are some really really obvious things like um people who spend money on stuff they are happier than people who don't spend money on stuff but they're not as happy as the people who spend money on like a particular hobby or particular like narrowing of stuff so buying a Birkin bag that you guys talked about I think last episode like that brings some Joy it actually does it's not something that's like completely joyless but if you're really into F1 and you buy your own car that you go race in the track that brings you more happiness right and then one layer above that in terms of increasing even more happiness is experiences so this is something that we've all heard about like buying experience actually does bring more happiness and what was really interesting were the top two one is really really obvious so above experiences was like giving money away in like a targeted way not just like General like here you go this um organization or this nonprofit but like actually giving it to a cause that you really cared about but the top one was kind of fascinating like the things that we coded that built or brought the most happiness were what I kind of labeled Freedom inducing events or Freedom inducing items so things like a jet if you you can afford a jet and you can fly private it's not the nature of the jet it's that it brings you so much freedom and so we saw this kind of coded in all the responses and so things like I know Sam you've been a little hesitant to it things like getting a personal assistant things like getting someone to take care of stuff at the home those things actually bring a lot more happiness because unless you really really like buying the groceries or doing something like that that brings more freedom and that that actually increases happiness levels even more than all the other things that we talked about um the other big thing that was really interesting is that um the the happiness scales that you see kind of online in those studies um for both income and net worth like typically they can't they're [ __ ] I I they're limited that's what I would say um like meaning like um they basically are like oh 75,000 your happiness doesn't increase and then there was another study that found enough people you know up to about a half million where happiness increased well I took it all the way to I think it's like 3 to four million a year and the happiness just continues to increase it's not at the same rate but like more income and more net worth does bring more happiness like I'm not sure where it's going to like level off but right now in my data on net worth I have a a good enough sample that I can actually map it from zero to about 50 million um in net worth um but the one really interesting thing was no matter the net worth um particularly for the folks who had more than 5 to 10 million in net worth um no matter what it was if it was higher and some of the billionaires qualitatively this was also the case um you would see that if the net worth went up they got happier if the net worth stayed the same they were a little bit happier if the net worth went down even just like a minuscule amount that the like the the reduction in happiness was considerable and so it's one of those things where it's like when you get wealthy it's like all about protect protect protect that's you know for a lot of obvious mathematical reasons but also from a happiness perspective that's where a lot of like the anxiety was coming from from some of the the more wealthier folks um there's a couple other things oh like this was really fascinating because this was like a little more personable um of wealthy folks let's just say I think it was like folks over 5 million in net worth um but it continued the trend even higher um there were only a couple of like trends that everyone did like almost every single person not 100% but like you know let's just say 90ish percent plus um lists was a big thing like lists or like a to-do list of some sort um wealthy folks almost to a had some sort of system where every day they were like here's what I'm going to do for some it was like I got one big thing each day for others it was like some hardcore like to-do list app and all this other fun stuff that was organized but that was a really big thing um everyone's still in the game meaning still building a business still trying to build their wealth worked out or had some sort of Fitness regularly folks out of the game they started to kind of like fall off on that particular Fitness but like 90% of people like it wasn't they're all doing CrossFit or all doing anything crazy but a lot of them were doing um at least something consistently every single week um so that was really really fascinating to see as well there were a couple other things that were like pretty consistent but um those were the really really big ones that stood out that would be most helpful I think to folks I have a nerdy question about the happiness thing how do you what what is the actual like how do you know how happy somebody is how do they know how happy they are so are you just saying how happy are you did you get happier when you got more money it's like a self-reported like 1 to 10 thing or is there a better way that people ask that question yeah totally so my instinct is to like teach stats right now so I'm going to try to avoid that as much as humanly possible um but that you don't when we look at like temperature just trust me for a second like we can get very very accurate readings on like how cold it is in your apartment right now or your house right now right and we can be very very confident in that particular like measurement right now we can also get the temperature measurement by like maybe measuring the outside temperature and subtracting what we think the insulation is of your house and trying to figure out like in a backwards way that would be less accurate than like measuring the actual temperature but still more accurate than if I went and I asked you what you thought the temperature was right and there's different ways that I can ask you temperature right if I just straight up ask you what's the temperature it's like it's actually kind of a difficult question for you to answer but if I ask you do you think it's more than 68 degrees it's a little bit easier for you to answer so there's different ways to answer these questions now what that means is and the way reason I gave that little metaphor is like there's we're not looking at measuring temperature like the way that we would in a very scientific way like we just can't do that because like happiness it is relative there's a bunch of different factors but that doesn't mean we can't like measure it purely right so what I did and um I'll try to like keep this as as helpful as possible is um I looked at how the $75,000 study does and and there is a happiness kind of research center there's a number of different actually the first undergrad research I ever did was how do tax rates impact happiness um in in the economics Department in school and so there's different ways to ask it so the way that this was asked there's a number of different ways there was a scoring system there was a this happened how does that affect your happiness so there's a composite score that we kind of put together based on those different inputs to come up with essentially here's what their happiness level is comparatively and then you keep that consistent across the board um and there's ways you can adjust the model um but long story short like it's it's the way I describe temperature it's a little bit closer to like hey what do you think your temperature is so it's not dude I think that's just fascinating I think it's incredibly fascinating and I think it's amazing that you're doing this uh you I like seeing your nerd come out I I think it's this is very this is very cool yeah yeah I got really excited I felt my heart rate just go up there sorry I think Sam Sam hit the nail on the head where he's like uh these things you said are interesting but what's more interesting is that you did this and uh you know you were just describing like people spend on stuff but they're more happy if they spend on a targeted set of stuff yeah that's you spending 50 Grand on a study about wealth right that's you you don't have a model train hobby you have a research Hobby and you were like oh how do I use these funds to scratch my itch in a way that I haven't done before and I'm sure that it was like it wasn't the takeaways from the study probably it was doing the study that actually made you happier and and felt like a good use of your time um I'll also say like uh you know a lot of people listen to this podcast will probably be probably make this mistake and so I'll say it out loud cuz I made the mistake which was I thought my goal was I don't want to be rich I Want to Be Free right I think that's a common thing people say makes themselves feel feel a little bit better than I'm just chasing money say no I'm chasing freedom and it's true like it is better to Chase Freedom than than money uh but I thought you know there's a number and I remember thinking uh when I was like maybe 26 27 I was like oh you told me it was 6 million right yeah I was like $6 million that's my freedom number and I I like I was focused on six as my fre Freedom number I even had it in my passwords it would be like a six in there cuz I was like every time I log in I want to be thinking about that number and that's how I was thinking about things I passed that number and I was like well uh all right was my math wrong or is this concept of a freedom number wrong and I had a very simple realization which was that being financially free doesn't mean you have a certain amount of money in your bank account it means you are now free from money owning you and that is a decision you make and so for example the the simple test is um how much of how much of what you do is because of money and somebody who's truly absolutely Financial financially free they do not make a choice based on money so that could be they buy something and oh why' you buy why do you shop at this grocery store even it's more expensive well because I'm not making my decision based on money it could be um a job you why do you why are you working on this oh because I think it's going to have a big payoff or I think the salary the salar is you know too good toay pass up well you're making a decision based on money and the true Financial Freedom isn't on some number it's when you can get to the point where you stop making choices that are based on money which is half mindset at least 50% mindset if not 80% mindset and maybe the remainder is an actual you know uh Financial reality of how much money how much money you have in your bank account I would I would edit that very slightly and it's almost semantic I I think it's it's almost it's a a function of force rather than um choice so what I mean by that is there are a lot of people myself included who are still making decisions with money in mind right because to me there are certain goals that I have that are probably going to change as I get nearer to them not just for a number's sake like I'm not one of those people who which I I don't judge but like there are people who just want the number to continue to go up right there's other folks and I count myself as one of them is like I want ever increasing um waves of like Freedom the ability to do stuff and money unlocks that ability so I still make decisions based off of it but I don't have to right like I can rationalize as to why I don't want to so I just found that there's still a lot of people who have like there's this billionaire who I was talking to about this and we were we were basically having coffee and you know he's going through like he's he's still in the game he sounds just like us he's still like oh yeah I'm going to go do this I'm going to go do this like the stakes are different the numbers are different and some of them the moves are very different but I asked him I was like so why like you don't need to do any of this right but it seems like you don't want to do this decision but it's going to net the most money for you in this particular situation so like why do you want to do this and his answer was basically what I was just saying which is like well if I get another billion I can go do this thing and his thing was like this nonprofit thing that he kind of wanted to do and so does he actually believe that I have no idea right I can't read his mind but like for me the idea of like okay I can buy 19 gas stations i' i' like to buy a skyscraper next do I need a skyscraper no do I want a skyscraper not really but I like the idea that I can right but you realize that sounds totally ridiculous right like if I understand it sounds ridiculous right like one of my one of my goals one something this is gonna sound crazy and this is the perfect the perfect audience to say this but like I get so jacked up about the idea of like toppling a DI dictatorship one day I get so excited by it and I'm like I'm not even kidding and I'm like okay well if we if we go after Cuba it's going to cost this much because I have this idea and this idea that have you you've done research on this you have spreadsheets that 100% yeah well how much does it cost in which order of countries do you put like what's like your top three of like yeah I don't want to name I don't want to name countries quite yet because I think that that like could get me in a little bit of trouble and also like again my point is more like will I ever actually do this I have no idea but it gets me Sobe I think I think that there there are certain countries that I think are in really really Dire Straits that I think like 3 400 million you could really really make a dent and it wouldn't involve like doing anything like crazy legal or anything like that it would involve basically uh um because if you think about if you really want to nerd out on this which I don't think you want to but it's like countries breathe with their GDP right the money coming in the money going out Etc so when you look at that as like an access that you can attack um there's so much you can do um and that doesn't even get into like stuff you can do with social media with the actual like you know people we haven't even mentioned murder yet no no no yeah yeah you're the second successful entrepreneur I've met who has researched this and has serious they haven't seriously considered it because they're not there yet but they're like you know I think I could take over Bangladesh uh like like I don't want to take it over I'm not going to install myself as a leader or anything I just want to like genuinely help right like he wants to better the place like look at Cuba like Cuba you know it's one of those things where it's like it's been been problematic you know a problematic state for a long time part of that's our fault as the United States another part of that's just you know the people who um governed it but like I think it'd be really cool to like basically free Cuba people people can't even free the city of San Francisco right now like they're trying to they're trying to get the mayor you know to actually like you know enforce uh you know punishment on crimes or they tried to recall Gavin Newsome I think it is a lot tougher than you think but it's surprising how many uh you know I guess like the the game from you know sort of wealth to status to power uh you know it's it is interesting to see how many people end up in the power game um it's not a like I I want to be clear it's not a it's it's not a uh it's actually more of like a social entrepreneurship thing than it is anything yeah no that's not true dude that is not true no it is I gu I okay I've done the work I've done the introspection yeah well like like the debate you're having in your head like it's basically like if you are Mark Benny off and you create the Benny off hospital and say San Francisco what ratio is because you want the mark bending off hospital or because you want to cure cancer and I don't think it's wrong that it's higher on the I want my name on it it's not wrong if there was a pie chart right there's like the challenge of it the intellectual stimulation and the challenge that's definitely one uh there's the impact and the wanting to do good in the world that's two there's the bragging rights SL power game of like yeah I did that [ __ ] um you know like I helped do that that's what I did with my my my time my talents my my money I think there's some combination whatever the combination is I don't think it's zero on all the other things but there's a really big difference right there's a really big difference right so like I am I'm as close to nihilist as like I think one can get without being a full-blown nihilist because I just from from a just the way my brain's wired if I was like a nihilist I just would be like well I'm I don't know if I'm going to be a net positive therefore like nothing matters Etc so to me it's like you get to design the game right you get to design the game that you want and when I look at like spending money to put your name on something it does feel kind of like a waste I don't I don't like at least personally like I haven't had my name on anything I don't really get excited about that but what I do get excited about is like the challenge part and then yeah like oh I you know if I could be the person who did X like that is really really interesting right like that is interesting but it's not like a it's not it's not this like this this uh I want to name a journalist who has a very cynical view of our industry but it's not like this like you know cynical View it's not this like oh I need to you know have a dick measuring contest or something like that like that's that's not how I think about it and that's why like I think that like doing stuff in San Francisco I think some of the worst days in San Francisco are still better than some of the other stuff that's happening in the world right and so that's why like looking globally I think are really really fascinating I think after this podcast you're going to be adding a third shrink to the payroll yeah probably probably just based on this yeah yeah yeah you have two other really interesting things that you s over want to I want to hit so one is you had this remix framework that you kind of talked about earlier but I want to like double down and we should put the slide up on YouTube because it's hard to describe it's too it's too much to describe but the slide makes it really easy so you basically were like look Innovation you know maybe you're not like all Innovation nor are you Nick Huber you know Innovation is a waste of time you're kind of like your goal is to you know I don't know you you could say this but you want to take a product and you want to remix it that's one way to think about how to up with a novel business uh opportunity is to remix an existing one and you had these remixes I thought the good example was you took consumer products and you were like if you take it and you make it cheaper that's a way to differentiate um through better supply chain you could take it and you could say I'm going to align it with a celebrity that's a differentiator and you got like you have the example here of febles with Mr Beast you have um you can alignment with a lifestyle like keto or Christian or hunting and you have like Yeti Coolers here um yeah science backed you have another one that's like you align it with a uh an identity like a political party or LGBT or you have here as the example Black Rifle coffee so does this first talk about this and then is this only for Consumer products or does this work across the board in your opinion so here here's where this comes from so we had 50,000 different there are subscription companies but 50,000 companies using our financial analytics um and we were helping them with pricing their turn and and giving them this this data and they were from Ross the map B2B SAS subscription nonprofits D Toc was one of our big segments and I started to notice that like for just under 10,000 of these DDC Brands The Playbook was almost the same over and over and over again right like it wasn't like there was some innovation in creating mattresses it was literally like we will be cheaper through better supply chain and we will help the environment and maybe we donate money to people who don't have beds right like it was just over and over and over again so I wanted to create essentially a unified theory of like creating products right and so I I shared the consumer one because that's probably the easiest one to talk about but there's just there's only 10 things that these Brands differentiate on and there number of the things that you talked about and my point around Innovation is that like don't try to necessarily innovate maybe don't even try to like raise money for any of these types of like consumer ideas because all you really need to do is take a particular product and then remix it with some of these differentiators right so for example like you mentioned Black Rifle coffee that's basically aligning with an identity right so Black Rifle you know it's guns it's rightwing it's veterans it's all these other fun things well identity based products increase willingness to pay by about 20 to 40% so if I just had regular coffee and then I had regular Co or I had regular coffee that was built particularly for this like we'll just say like conservative but I don't think they necessarily claim that party all of a sudden that coffee is worth 20 to 40% because you're niching down into that particular group so I put together together these 10 things and also the the data around increased willingness to pay but for example if I was a you know particular entrepreneur who didn't necessarily like want to necessarily innovate which most people shouldn't um I might go and be like cool well I like coffee I think coffee is great I think I get really excited about that what's a what's another lifestyle right so creating woke roast right coffee for the left basically um where all of a sudden you could have coffee you know basically for that particular identity and people flock in your retention is typically much much higher when you do this as well um it's something that really works right um I had a friend a really good friend who wanted to create a business um he's involved in the LGBT community so we talked about kambucha specifically for the gay community calling it bubbles for bottoms which was kind of a fun name um and so it just one of those things where it's like creating this like product remix and you can do this in a bunch of different ways like you could be the premium version of whatever you're actually selling um you know chinola right it's watches it's notebooks Etc but they're Premium versus you know some of the other stuff that's out there you have here uh you have Health Plus lifestyle athletic greens for dogs condoms Plus organic materials week yeah organic condoms they're just goingon to sell you a package with nothing in it that's the organic condom that's basically natur all natural I didn't think of that that's good made out air I like that honestly I bet you could sell that that's liquid death right liquid death is water in a in a mean looking can I think you could probably sell uh like an all natural condom uh that's just nothing uh you could literally so let do it the natural way yeah yeah there's a way yeah you got to look at it's like sustainable right I don't know a lot about the sexual Wellness Market but it's like yeah long story short like it it doesn't have to be complicated the effort and the execution is really really hard but the ideation doesn't have to be that hard did you make this chart this is really good this is great where did this come from yeah so this is this is based on like probably collecting I don't know I don't know the number but it's hundreds of thousands of willingness to pay data points cuz we did the pricing I don't know if you guys even know that we've never talked about pricing that was like my core thing that's what I was most well known for in the SAS Community um so we did the pricing for like Blue Bottle Coffee we did lifts pricing we did a bunch other like B2B style pricing so we have a lot of data in the pricing space and when I say we did it it's like we might have done it or we might have helped them do it depends on the company if you had to summarize your learnings with pricing is there like two or three bullet points where you'd be like just do these three things and you're 90% there sort of um but with like giving you a little bit more bulleting um you should be changing something about your price every 3 months that does not mean raise your price every three months but it means like changing up your packaging going up Market down Market changing up an add-on changing up your discounting strategy it's this forgotten growth lever in most businesses you acquire customers you monetize them retain them we focus probably 60% of most budgets more so in D Toc less so in B2B on like basically acquiring customers we spend a little bit of time on retention we spend like no time on pricing so change something every three months um one of the biggest hacks that's easy to talk about on a podcast add-ons um they're the most underrated underutilized aspect of all pricing consumer B2B Enterprise um they boost lifetime value by about 20 to 50% so just to make sure this is clear like hey they bought your core product which is a fitness shirt well add a white T-shirt for $10 like stuff like that those are like add-ons hey they bought your SAS app add priority support for whatever 10% of your list price is for the the software um most companies like the most high growth companies at least in the subscription space they have 12 or more add-ons typically customer never sees them all at all 12 of them but they'll see like one or two of them and then one other really quick hack is um localization this doesn't work for every company but like internationalizing your pricing so the nordics um you know when we take into account exchange rates and stuff like that they're still willing to pay about 30% higher than the US for the exact same product um folks in like southeast Asia it's about 40% less there's a really large variance on that um but that's a really quick thing where you can boost typically your Revenue per customer by about 15 20% literally by just like changing what the pricing looks like depending on where they come in um across the world dude you're inle as [ __ ] fascinating yeah that was good uh you also said a really good thing in in the the sheet here that you didn't say which was how do you measure if your pricing changes like a good change or a bad change right how do you know um how do you know if you did it right what's the metric you choose yeah it's it's it's Revenue per customer which is going to be different for every company so in your business if you're doing pricing properly that Revenue per customer number should be going up into the right so like arpo ARA ACV however you're measuring it um that that should be going up um and now it's not going up as fast as your sales or as some of your other numbers but like you should if you're changing something about your pricing every three months you should basically be seeing that number go up I don't know it's hard to give like a benchmark because later stage it goes up slower but it should just be going up every single year if not every six months is that assuming you have free and paid as a mix because like for example if I'm at Ecom store I could quadruple my prices I would make more money per customer but I would just have less customers and less money overall if I did that right because Ecom like you know for example what we use is uh Revenue per visitor which is like uh for for if somebody hits the site how much do we make $2 off them a dollar off them for every average Customer because that takes into account conversion rate and how much they spend when they convert yeah so I would say and you can get into like cart average cart those types of things I think that as you get more sophisticated in how you think like for example like for an e-commerce world I would probably want to look at like maybe lifetime like dollars in like that average number going up because what that means theoretically is assuming revenues going up and all those numbers are great that means like I'm monetizing better right so it's not necessarily in a vacuum right like if my Revenue per customer goes up you know a THX but I don't have any other customers obviously that's not great but it's one of those things where most people again they don't like like the average like people don't it's it's kind of crazy like it takes when we looked at how often people raise their prices so you should be raising your price at least once per year um there are some top outs and there's some exceptions to this particular rule but everything about your price is basically this exchange rate on your value so like you've created this value and because you know we don't trade goat for wheat anymore you're basically saying this value is worth this much dollars right and so it's that exchange rate and there's a bunch of things that influence that like your brand um the quality of the product who which customer you're going after like some customers will value your product higher and so if your product is improving every single year your Brand's improving you should be able to demand higher prices but most people I think the average amount of time they take between pricing changes like actual price increases like three years and I've seen so many because they're because they're fearful because the CEO is fearful they're scared is that the that's is that like 80% of the issue they're just scared it's just scared yeah and and we tried to fill this Gap with our pricing product and we still do because it just gives them confidence because we're like all right here's data that says you sat in a room when you founded the company and said ah base camp does 50 bucks let's just do 50 bucks to and then you never Revisited that like for years we have this data that says you can actually charge this customer 500 this customer 100 and we're going to like roll it out in like a nice way just for new customers first and all of a sudden your conversion goes up and your Revenue per customer goes up and you're really excited um and then all of a sudden you're like confident enough to basically put that for your existing customers as well um so yeah I think that's it's just a lot of fear you get all these like I've been in so many like so many exec teams with this product where it's like the smartest people I've ever met just sitting there and like if I give them any other in their business they're like okay um I'm not an engineer but like let's figure it out what's a what's a stack what is this like they'll go like attack it you give them pricing and they're all like I don't know what do you think what do you think because it touches every area of the business and they just lack that that confidence in looking at it and so I I think like starting off with like let's introduce an add-on let's introduce some of this stuff that's typically like the gateway to oh this pricing stuff works let's you know let's Lise our prices and I have a I have an email that I've um I've basically cultivated over the past decade for like changing prices I'm happy to share it and we can put in the show notes or I'll throw it on Twitter where it's literally like just steal the template like T-Mobile used it they stole it from the website and they used it which was kind of fun to see um but it basically just goes through like how to communicate a price increase um the tldrs don't make it about you make it about them um because they don't care about your costs or whatever they care about their costs and that's the biggest mistake most people make but yeah I'll share that you're uh you're this is very insightful you're very fascinating uh you have a lot of really interesting insights and I think you approach things in a really cool way where you have a good amount of self deprecating humor but also like academic rigor you're you're a fascinating person so are we gonna is that mean we're going to do the skin to- skin bonding now or is that later lat in the podcast is that bro what I I told Sean the same thing pop the top baby come on let's go let's go cheek to I'm losing weight so I don't I don't feel uncomfortable taking my shirt off yeah you've lost 40 pounds right yeah yeah I'm down like probably about 90 total but 40 since I saw you guys um wow and as Gucci M once said money makes you handsome so like all cliche post exit Founders I have to get healthier and uh basically take it seriously what what's been the the number one driver just eating less or what uh I use my body tutor so I know you're big fan of that I don't know if Sean you're still using it um Sean you're using it yeah I went back to it and I'm having such a good time the key was doing the uh call The Daily call I do the daily call yeah basic we have to tell people it's my body tutor so basically it's like the simplest thing ever we don't get paid for this there's no I don't at least s maybe you do but I I don't get paid for this I I talk about conly they said eventually if I tweeted about it I sent a bunch of people and they're like hey we'll give you a little bit of money but I don't care if don't even mention me when you use them I don't give a [ __ ] but basically it's uh it's a 650 a month and they call you daily and it's like a five minute call and they're like why did you eat this you're too fit let the fat guys talk for a second here all right go ahead dek you Sean I didn't want say anything nobody wants to hear the shredded guy talk about this yeah I'm down to like 2% body fat I'm still experimenting with OIC it's not a big deal if you're in a spot where you feel a little shitty about yourself you're like all right I'm overweight I know this was completely in my control and you've done all the things you've uh listen to the podcast you got your Andrew huberman's got you injecting sunlight into your eyes in the morning and you you've you've tried keto you tried paleo you did all the [ __ ] right and none of it's working or it all kind of worked and actually the problem was not in the plans it was all you to begin with what my body tutor did was smart which was they realized it's not the diet that's the problem it's you sticking to the diet that's the problem as we all actually know deep down inside and so they help you with that root cause which is how do they hold you accountable and help you actually stick to the thing you actually want to know they do give you some strategy along the way they do give you some helpful um ways to think about things I I give you a very simple example Haley was like um hey when you eat um I want you to take note for a second like on a scale of 1 to five one being like I'm totally satisfied five being I'm like ravenously hungry right now where where are you when you sat down for that meal if you're eat sitting down at 5es the problem was like we spaced out these meals the wrong way or we're not getting the right meals in and you're not expected to have good willpower when you're just like completely ra ravenously hungry and so like we want to be eating at a three um we want to leave it at like you know you know we want to leave the meal also not completely stuffed you want to leave at at about a three to two or three like you want get in and just get your meal that way you're just fueling upus like you know going to this like feeding frzy so there's little mindset tips but more than anything it's you get a call in the morning and she's like so what's the plan for today eating wise you're like I don't [ __ ] know I'm just going to eat everything I see I guess oh wait no that's not the right answer hold on uh I'll eat at these times I'll eat these meals no I I think the only thing I would ask is like or um also add is it health is in your control like if you're listening to this like you know unless you have like an obvious like disability or something like that like health is very much in your control and what I love about my body tutor is it kind of cuts through the BS I ask Kaye about all these like esoteric things like hey I read about this like you know the cold plunging movement and she's just like Fitness strength training wh which country should I take over Haley Haley and I don't have that relationship but no I think it's um I I I just think it's one of those things where we're bombarded with a lot of like either quick fix or very marginal stuff like even the the you know I I'm a big humman fan uh Sam you tweeted recently you would I also would like that's you know he's he's he's a very very uh awesome guy but I think it's one of those things where a lot of that stuff like unless you have the basics in place it doesn't matter and so Haley like has kept me accountable and like no no no no we're gonna we're going to do pelaton today we're going to do this we're going to do it's not even anything she says that keeps you accountable it's just saying the [ __ ] out loud and you're like actually what the [ __ ] am I talking about never mind sorry uh apologize well for me it's been it's been like a you know probably a year-long journey and it was it started off with like you know basically just breaking all these conventions like Sean you were saying where it's like oh I can't like BS myself out of doing the right thing here because I'm gonna have to talk to Haley tomorrow about it and she's gonna not be like sympathetic she's going to be like why'd you do that and she's like you shouldn't do that and I'm like yeah I know and it's like cool let's not do it tomorrow which which is you know obviously really helpful we appreciate you coming on man you're super insightful um you're always fun to talk to uh I don't remember the last time you came but uh I feel like this time uh definitely probably kicked its ass because this was a 10 awesome that's my goal in life I'm not Jesse I'm not all these fancy people I got to bring the noise that's the goal all right go follow him on Twitter he's at pakus yeah we appreciate you that's the [Music] pod [Music]

goes and tell him to stop that was his his advice so yeah I've delivered the [Music] message all right we have um Moy Ali here you've been on the Pod before uh people know you because you created native deodorant which is sold everywhere I look in Target online in my wife's bathroom it's there everywhere so congrats you built that you bootstrapped that business yourself uh literally like off of a kitchen table to1 million exit to Proctor and Gamble you spent a couple years there you currently uh you invest in a bunch of Comm Merce things and non-commerce things you have a podcast called limited Supply which is great and then you um you also do you you and your brother are sort of like business sharks and so uh you know if I just say hey there's like a there's a hot dog stand going out of business over here you'd be like let me get my jacket let's go uh you own real estate you own a bunch of random things and so always fun to have you on man uh thanks for coming well thanks for having me super excited to be here is that the intro you want by the way or do you feel like I let I didn't do you justice in one angle uh no that sounds that sounds like uh more Justice than I deserve well you're also good at on lines uh you have a lot of like on liners you're you're very good with language you um you've said a few things you said my two favorite words in the English English language distressed asset and then one time we were talking to this person it was you and me and this person and they were explaining what they do and it was like a supplement company and how great it was going to be and how they're raising all this money and she she or them or he whatever walked out the room and you said that person's business is one Google away from me ruining it yeah you have a couple other Classics uh I read an interview with you where it where you said uh you said I forgot you phrased it you go I was put on Earth to do one thing raise earnings per share earnings per share yeah that wasn't me that said that actually it was the founder of some other company I forgot what it was and it was such a great quote I loved it so I stole that qu yeah you're like I killed him and now it's mine that's right yeah yeah the other one that I I I attribute to you I didn't I wasn't there for this story but I've told this story to like hundreds of young entrepreneurs and they get a kick out of every time which is like yeah Moyes started native deodorant it's super successful now and when he first had the idea he told people I'm going to create a natural deodorant brand they're like Moyes like do you know anything about deodorant do you wear deodorant boys what's going on what are you talking about you're going to create a deodorant company and you said um yeah I know nothing about deodorant today but in 6 months I'll know everything there is to know about deodorant and that that's right that attitude to me is like that's the core of what we do on this podcast so I don't even know if that's a real story by the way but I'm going to keep telling it that's a real story I remember it was in San Francisco I was with one of my law school classmates and it was her boyfriend of the time our husband who told me that and he's like uh you know what the hell are you doing here he worked at Pinterest and he's like what the hell are you doing starting a deodor business I've never heard anybody do something so ludicrous and I still remember the bar we were sitting at where it happened all right so let's do a little segment that I'm gonna call Story Time with Moy Ali so okay uh to the music okay so I'm gonna ask you a question I want you to give me your answer boys what is the um what what is the worst way that you've ever made money yeah uh you know this is um uh this is a great story I think we uh we don't tell enough or my brother and I don't tell enough which is when we were growing up we owned gas stations and this is really a family way we made money and not my particular way anyway we owned a bunch of gas stations and we would cash checks for people as a service so if you brought in a check uh Sean and you're like hey look this is my payroll check it's $200 for this week or $2,000 for this week we would charge you a percentage of that check and give you cash for it and we would take the check and deposit it into the bank and um by the end of our gas station careers we were doing this at massive scale like uh one of our stores would cash $250,000 wor of checks on any given Friday like a quarter million dollars of cash was going through our hands we'd have like Wells SPO coming over and giving us cash um and you know we'd be giving it like you know we have these crazy like a Bus full of Hispanic immigrants who are roofers would come to our store the door would open and like it felt like 40 immigrants just came out to cash their checks with us but a long time ago like what happened early on in our check cashing careers was this guy named FM Porter who came in with a check for his business and the check was like you know $2,000 and we charged a lot because I don't remember why we charged a lot but we gave him like $1,900 we charged 5% of the check and we were going to deposit the check and earn $2,000 um and you know traditionally what happens is if you're cashing a check this doesn't happen so much anymore but it used to happen 15 years ago you'd endorse the back of it and you'd deposit it at the bank right so endorsed the back of it we gave him the $1900 we deposited it and it bounced and we're like what the [ __ ] uh this is a ton of money for us uh you know we were poor immigrants we were working at this gas station probably in 1997 earning $40,000 a year with all five of us working at the how old were you uh I was probably like 13 at the time 12 or 13 at the time and like this was going on so there's just are you is I just imagine like 13-year-old Moyes like pacing smoking aars be like what the [ __ ] man like is that what it looked like I mean just like I I imagine you being the exact same way as you are now when you were 12 well yeah I feel like I was the same way but I didn't have as much confidence so I couldn't take the cigar I couldn't order people around but anyway the check bounced and we all freaked out and uh we tracked down this guy uh and we're like what the [ __ ] we knocked on his door I forgot what he Liv he lived in like a small house OB like you know it was just local community we knocked down his door we're like what the [ __ ] FM Porter this check just cash we're going to kill you we're going to call the cops we don't know what to do we're broke down uh give us our money and he was like relax guys there's a pro like you know the check was made out to his business instead of him and so it took like 45 days uh to figure out all the riger roll to get the check made out to him instead of to uh his business and then we cashed it and we uh deposited the money and I remember it went through the second time you know we made $100 on 45 days of you know possibly losing $2,000 and I remember it went through and I told my brother hey it went through and he's like that was the easiest $100 we've ever made and I remember it was like the worst $100 we've ever made it was just cashing checks that were going bad and constantly being afraid that they were like this this was early on in our career we weren't sure if we should do this as a service for our business it ended up being super profitable like when you cash $250,000 of checks on a Friday you're going to make $2500 to $3,500 on that just for your business on that day alone but I remember early on we were taking all these risks and we were like what just happened we think that like you know we're not going to be able to pay our rent for the apartment that my family lives in that's insane were you just going back to like math class after your shift or like how were you were you going after school what was your how did you do this oh to the gas station you mean yeah cuz you're like 13 years old yeah yeah we'd go on the weekends like uh cuz you know we like um yeah we'd go the weekends when I turned 16 I could drive and I would go you know yeah after class class or like on the weekends I wouldn't go every day uh even when I was 16 years old but I'd probably go at least one weekend or maybe both weekends of the uh uh when I started having a car certainly our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better we're in the story we're in the story uh part of the show so let me ask you one thing that I don't know is true but I want you to confirm it so right by our office the one that you and I shared there was a cafe called native coffee I think it was it was the native Cafe native juice native juice native juice it had the same color and the same logo as native deodorant did you it it was right by the B stop I believe so if I'm imagining what happened you went on you were on BART and you were just walking around s and you saw it and you go there it is that's mine now is that true true or false sub that's false not it's not false I'll tell the story we got to put the picture up because they're identical it's an identical I actually think they changed their branding in the last three years but you could still find old logos on their yel page yeah so the uh it's a little funnier like it was actually a block away from where I lived um so I'd walk by it all the time but uh you know the color I'm not sure if the color was the same I know the font was the same uh we actually didn't steal the font from them although I readily admit we did steal the font we stole the font of our website from Harry's so if you look at Harry's font it's the exact same font as ours and if you look at the colors of our site it was and I'm not sure if it still is the exact same color as the Casper hat so like you know when I was launching native it took me about you know three days to do the whole website and I was just like okay you know what I'm not going to do is hire a logo designer and spend a fortune building a logo and spending a lot of money on branding i l steal the logo that Harry's has which is just their name written out in a font I'm going to do the same thing uh I can't steal their colors as well because that would be too too blatant uh so I'm just going to steal the colors of another website which was Casper at the time because they were doing really well and so that's how the uh that's how the font and the colors came together to be what Native is today um but I I would walk by that store all the time and like believe it or not right next to Native Juco is the post office and I was packing all of the deodorants in my own apartment uh for the first six months or a year of the business and so I would walk by native Juco with these bags of like you know filled with boxes of deodorant and I'd go to the Post Office and I'd hand them to the post office and they were like is this from next door is this like the juice company you guys it says native on the packaging and I was like this is not the same native it's a different one and then what would happen is like you know two and a half years into the business native juiceco came like the woman who started that business came to her office and she's like I'm getting so many [ __ ] phone calls for your business for customer service issues where's my package all this [ __ ] people are just Googling native San Francisco we didn't have a phone number we I think Native still doesn't have a phone number posted so she would be like I'm getting 40 phone calls a day for you this has got to stop you got to figure out a way to stop this and we're like we can't we don't know what to do like you know people just Google native San Francisco and your name comes up it's not we're not saying call you and so she came in like several times and then um you know I was like I told the DOR men of the building I was like don't let her up any longer and that seem to put it into it if she has juice accept it but don't let her yeah that's right we would still order juice from her to our office all the time but I was like I'm not sure if they like this or not yeah definely Rin definitely drink a lot of her spin I have to imagine yeah that's probably true too yeah but the reality is we like um the logo didn't come from native Juco it came from Harry's she just happened to also copy the Harry's logo that's what she might have done the same thing that's right yeah yeah all right so you said you had some ideas for us um what business ideas do you have on your brain right now um okay I I thought about a lot of these ideas for a while um I think the first idea that someone should start if I if I were starting a business today and really excited about it i' would start with a stock market for all residential real estate I would say okay I'm going to start buying residential real estate and you know selling shares of that real estate that's rented out so i' buy rental homes and I would sell shares of that real estate sort of like a traditional LP would invest but I'd make a really liquid Market on my site so I'd say you know what rents have gone up you paid $110,000 you're waiting for us to sell this home it'll like you know if you buy an apartment building today if you're an LP in an apartment building you're waiting for the GP to sell the apartment building before you get you can realize all your cash back you might be getting a steady stream of income every quarter but when the GP sells the apartment building that's where you get most of your money back I just create a liquid market for all of these things and I would slowly start buying every single house in a neighborhood and I would say you can only buy and sell shares of this house on this platform uh and then what I would do is I would Empower local entrepreneurs to buy and sell houses on the platform themselves too I'd say okay you know what sea is going to buy a house he lives in this neighborhood in in California he can buy a house put it on this platform raise money and buy and sell and other people can buy and sell shares of this house through this platform and then Shawn will get reviews just like on Amazon and like if he does a really good job people will give him festar reviews because they're getting a lot of money from him if he does a really shitty job people will give him onear reviews because he's doing a really shitty job and then when you go to underwrite New Deals people will be like sea is trustworthy Shawn is not trustworthy and I think people have tried this in the past with things like realy shares and a bunch of other shitty models of this and I think they've done a terrible job in part because they're not doing a good job underwriting in part they're doing it uh they're they're betting on Commercial properties um and in part because they're not creating a liquid market for it and so I think that um when I think of like the biggest idea possible I think that this idea could realistically own you know 200 years from now this business should own the majority of real estate in the United States uh so let's break that down so you said sure the reason that the current kind of like bu a fraction of uh you know of real estate or buy shares in real estate which there's several or crowdfunding for Real Estate there's like fund rise realy shares you're saying the problems that they have is uh let's take them one by one so you said they're focused on Commercial why is residential better than commercial for this uh way easier in terms of steady income streams So like um if you build if let's say you buy a building that Starbucks is using and has a 5-year lease on when Starbucks leaves that building it's unclear who will be a good fit for that building like it's not easy to rent that thing out while if it's a house everyone in the world needs a three-bedroom two bath house uh in a neighborhood and so it's a lot easier to relet properties that are residential as opposed to commercial I invested in the company uh somewhat in the space it was called dorsy it was um it didn't work out but the guy who started it previously started stay Alfred which I don't know if you remember that one or not but basically you could it was like it was an auction website for homes and there they had two issues one it which is I'm shocked by this but people just didn't want to buy a home online it was just like a big it was a it was a big thing that they couldn't figure out how to address uh I think someone will figure it out but the second thing was negotiating the whole broker industry which like it seems like the broker industry I know there was just like a big settlement like five days ago the broker industry has like has this industry by the balls it seems uh it's really it seems really challenging yeah and it wasn't a settlement it was a jury verdict of $2 billion that went against the National Association of Realtors like yeah yeah and so like yes the I think the broker industry is broken but the the like the liquidity market for real estate investing is huge and when you think about it like you know all these retail investors are now like let me invest in a startup you know how crazy it is for for you to invest in like native when it's early on like I have no [ __ ] idea what I'm doing I don't know if I'm going to get hit by a bus tomorrow I might just be like [ __ ] it you know what like uh I'm dating this crazy girl and she wants to go to Hawaii for three months [ __ ] this this is going to be way this is going to be way more fun than running a business for the next three months so uh investing in like if you're can invest in startups what like you know you know it's way safer than investing in a startup investing in real estate down your street where you're like I know who's going to rent this house I I like you know I can monitor it I can drive bu it it's a tangible piece of property like you know if this guy doesn't pay rent somebody else will it's not going anywhere it's way safer and I think when I when I think of retail investors I think retail investors would be way more excited about investing in the local community they live in and being like yeah I own a share of this house than they do being like I invested in this Pakistani guy who really likes and he seems not to be that reliable and so you you have like uh this idea why do you think that the person who's buying these rental props properties wants to do this just because they want the liquidity so they can go buy more properties uh like what what happens here and how much of the property you think would go on the platform versus they own you know like would they like in an IPO you know they they issue 20% of their stock or whatever to the public what would you what would it be for the house yeah I think it's really the GP can be like look I want to like the guy who's sort of underwriting the deal and sponsoring the deal for better or for uh worse is could be like look I'm going to put in this house cost $200,000 I'm going to put in $50,000 in my own money or I'm going to put in $20,000 in my own money and in that same way that other like right now if you invest in a much larger if you invest in a private Equity Fund one of the common questions you'll ask is the guys who are running the private Equity Fund how much of their own money is at risk because that means that they care and believe in their private Equity Fund similarly here could be the same question how much of your wealth or or how much investment are you putting in this real estate when you uh purchase it and the reason that the sponsors would want to do this is several fold one is yeah they want to create a liquid Market they want to raise money right like they want to raise money from retail investors and it's really hard to raise money from retail investors uh two is they can buy and sell shares of later on for themselves as well they could be like you know what I bought $440,000 worth of this house 5 years later that 40,000 is worth 80,000 I want some cash off the table but I still want some liquidity I'm going to sell $40,000 of shares uh in this house and keep some uh money in invested as well so I think for the same reason that people want to invest in the stock market or uh you know sponsors uh in their own deals uh you know sponsors in this would invest as well so Moyes I'm going to pit you three other real estate ideas in Rapid succession I want you to tell me your favorite to your least favorite okay all right uh the first one is this company I didn't invest in but I reg I reget I don't know how it's doing I haven't talked to the guy in a while but I I regret not investing because I I thought it was a good idea it's called home options so what he's doing is this guy goes to uh Sam Sam owns a house he goes to Sam and says Sam I know you're not trying to sell the house right now but here's the deal um I'll give you $11,200 right now and all I ask for is that when you do decide to sell um you let me you know I own the option to be the broker on the house so like you know I'll be your agent and uh and actually what I do is I'm not myself the agent but I partner with top agents in your network and they don't know when you're going to sell your house and they don't want to keep having a knock on your door and bother you so I'll give you cash today so that they can be your bro you know and one of these top agents gets the right to be your broker 20 years from now whenever you sell and um they're just buying up options uh the the right to sell these homes because a home when you sell you know the Brokers take let's just say let's just say the sell side's going to take 3% um you know they're they're let's say the average is $15,000 or something for that for that sale they're willing to buy that option today for $1,000 and so uh that's idea number one home options going going through and buying that uh all right idea number two is y I invested in it fck the only thing that could have made me feel worse about not investing in this is that Sam invested in this is it doing well because I I every like three months I think about this business I think that's got a k I went through my email and I haven't gotten an update from them in like a while so that's not a good sign yeah which unfortunately means it's probably not or it's absolutely crushing it one of the two um you know I I used to think that's always a bad sign but then I started hanging out with moy's brother and he never he's like investor update why would I I'm going to kill it in this business why should I tell you about how it's going I need to know this yeah that's right yeah are you that way too Moy do do you like do you provide updates or one of our investors was this guy named Jeff Hollander from Seventh Generation and he's like you know what would be nice is like a monthly or quarterly investment update and I was like here's your money back I'm you know you I you and I will never chat until I call you uh and if you're not okay with that I don't ever yeah yeah I like I was like I couldn't care like I will never send you one piece of information about this business unless I want to unless I need something for you you think it's good good hygiene to like you know just kind of even for your own thoughts to be like how are we doing what's a let me take a step back here for a second and just write down kind of for my own Clarity of thought or no um I think that is good hygiene but I don't think you necessarily have to share that with other people especially with other people like you know um I think the three of us are probably investors in similar businesses and you know often times I walk around and people are like here are the numbers of this other business and I'm like you know somebody has leaked it to them and I'm I try to be really careful as an investor to never leak information because I know I would never want my information leaked but like that information gets around the street and uh I you know I've seen so many startups launch because they're like I heard this guy was doing really well so I should just do the same thing like how many competitors of athletic greens exist because everyone's like yeah we know athletic greens is doing really well what are the other two Sean all right second second idea this is your brother's idea actually I don't know if he told you this one um pipe for Real Estate so uh I think I could share this now because he he's talks about this like I don't a year ago and didn't end up doing it um pipe for Real Estate the idea here is uh you're a landlord you're gonna collect rent every month uh pipe came through and was like hey let me turn those uh monthly checks into one annual check and I'll take a 8% fee off the top so let's say you were going to get 100 Grand of rent from this property um I'll give you 92,000 today I get to keep the 100 um and you get you get 92,000 that you can go invest in your next property you or or put into tenant improvements that will let you raise rents or something like that here's cash flow today upfront so pipe for Real Estate uh real estate's a huge Market uh why why do landlords have to wait to collect the check um no more waiting is our slogan all right now idea number three final idea uh I did invest in this one so steady Capital so steady. capital is their their URL so they were like hey look everybody knows that most will most millionaires build their wealth through real estate that's that is a Time tested you know approach to wealth building um most people actually even want to they would love to own a rental property and be getting a rent check every month but most people don't know don't trust themselves to find a property you know vet it buy it manage it all of that and so they were like we'll do a Robin Hood for Real Estate type of thing where you just decide how much L you want to put into real estate you say I'm willing to put away $500 a month into real estate and they basically let you take the 500 bucks they'll put it into a real estate project that they are kind of vetting uh from like proven uh operators and then they every month they'll say hey here's an you know you got $112 of you know rental income from your property this month yeah uh or you you now own you know pieces of these six properties in six different markets and you're making $600 a month of rental income like I I put five grand into one deal and I just get this check every month now and it's actually the first real estate that I've done that I didn't own because otherwise it just stayed on my too list all right so those are the three ideas home options pipe for real estate and Robinhood for yeah the yeah steady Capital um give me rank them from your most favorite to your least favorite go ahead okay I I I wasn't like I was expecting uh home options would be number three when you told me about it but in fact it's number one uh steady capital and then Pet For Real Estate uh and I'll tell you why um pipe for Real Estate exists and it's just called a cash out refi like you know that already exists where you're like look I'm getting real you know I'm getting money from these landlord uh from these tenants and I can take cash off the uh out of the property like you know what's not going to happen for pipe for Real Estate is someone's going to come in and be like wow you're 100% levered up with this debt let me also give you more cash uh you already paying for the debt you know you're already levered uh so I think pipe for Real Estate exists uh and I think you know Mark lore started this company and he just raised $350 million did you guys read this thing uh I'm not entirely sure what it is but it appears to be like a restaurant delivery business uh where he partners with like you know F think that's right yeah yeah and um so I feel like I'm not sure if this is the case but it seems like that sort of like a a startup branding to something that kind of exists in in this space I feel like pipe for Real Estate is the same Mark bought Blue Apron oh he bought Blue Apron I knew they sold for $12 million I didn't know he was the cash behind it yeah he bought it yeah so he is I think you're you've nailed it that sounds like that's what he's doing but go ahead yeah um home options is like you know I think the hard part about home options is right now like particularly in the last week right now we don't know what real commissions are going to look like in the future and you also just don't know how long an option this is is the $1,200 in the ground today for 20 years or 30 years that's a really long period of time forance I think what he's doing is he's just reselling it right away or at least that's what I would do is I would buy the option I would bundle them up and I would go sell them to The Brokerage tomorrow you know and just say hey you you can hold these and you know I try try to get I don't know if the economics all work I don't know if the Brokers are willing to do things like that yeah but like I think that's the idea yeah I like it it's Innovative and like different and un like you know unclear what'll happen but like you could revolutionize an industry that you know has been the same for the last 150 years God damn it Sam's going to be a part of that Revolution it could also be the 6% drops down to 2% in the next you know 3 months because you the National Association of real is almost certainly bankrupt at this point what was the settlement and what's changing about this broker situation yeah wasn't a settlement it was2 billion I'm not entirely sure what what it was it was like price fixing across Realtors uh basically saying hey you can't be on MLS unless you agree to pay everyone like a 6% or 5% brokerage something to that effect I haven't gotten into the details of it but like the Judgment was $2 billion and I read this Wall Street Journal article where once the Judgment was had uh plaintiff sperms you know file lawsuits against the National Association of realizers in every single state and they're like we think that we'll get $40 billion in judgments as a result of this which will certainly bankr up that organization can you talk a little bit about this Founders card thing because I've know you've been tweeting about that for like two years now and I'm and that actually surprised me that you were interested in it you know there's I feel like there's uh there's a a a club that I'm a part of or like a Founders card sort of thing that I'm a part of that I can't talk about the the name of it because they would ask me not to but with like as a result of paying my $100 a month um and monthly uh membership fee I get a discount that's worth like you know $800 a month to myself what do you get a discount for just sta software that I'm like uh really want that I have to pay for but do you have to be a new C A lot of those cards you have to be a new customer no this one you don't yeah wow you just pay $100 a month and they're like here's discounts to like let's say mailchip and let's say Shopify and like all these other SAS platforms that an e-commerce company might want to be a part of or might want discounts too and so then you go and say great I paid $100 I get all these discounts and I'm going to go use those discounts for um for for for for my business and so you never are going to cancel that $100 a month subscription because that $100 is actually saving you $1,000 a month and um I don't understand why there aren't more of these for smaller Niche Industries and I think like e-commerce is a great one like uh you know what PNG does they go and they uh they go to like Snapchat and Pinterest and Facebook and they say look we're going to spend 50 m $250 million across our portfol folio on your platform but we need a discount because you know we're spending so much money and they get that discount they get it from Facebook for sure because I've seen it I'm pretty sure Pinterest and I'm pretty sure Snapchat but I guarantee you they get a Facebook a discount for Facebook because I've seen it I you know I saw when I was running native as a part of PNG and so I'm not sure why smaller businesses don't organize and say look we're spending this much let us also try and negotiate discounts with platforms why don't we all negotiate a discount with yappo or with Endo or with post scpt or with clavo and say look there's going to be 400 of us together a lot of us are going to use this software but we need a big discount that's a lifetime that's a like a lifetime monthly recurring discount and so sorry you have one of these this is not an idea you're saying you have one of these cards but you're saying you it's like a secret like you don't uh they don't they don't want more people to have the card or what correct they would not want me to talk about who they are but yes as a result I get discounts to software that I wouldn't get otherwise and cost me1 or $140 a month why don't they want to talk about it yeah great question I'm not entirely sure but I'm sure they would tell me not to talk about you think $100 months well like there's more a spidey some spoty s is going off here uh you know like what's going on why I mean is this a shady thing Sam this was this was your idea um like uh you not your idea originally but like Sam told I mean I don't know seven years ago when you were running the hustle you were like I'm trying to think of a new product and you had three ideas and I remember one of them was basically Trends which is the thing you ended up launching another one was uh this idea for the founders Club card or whatever which was I think you were comparing it to the AARP you're like ARP for kind of like Millennials or and I can talk about that ARP in a second but yeah that was uh the second one what was the third one you had you had one more I don't remember that third one but and I thought the card was the best idea I was like oh you should for sure do this card if I had this and in fact actually now I'm just going to do the card off of the MFM audience because I'm like this is way better and it's a win-win I might be a few months ahead of you why didn't you do that card the reason why I didn't was I couldn't find uh I couldn't figure out entirely how to differentiate from all the other offerings that already existed um it was also quite challenging to get in with some of the brands in order to negotiate bulk deals the argument being well you know these companies already spend with us why am I going to give them a discount and I couldn't come up with like the perfect rebuttal for that and that like that is where I I was trying to figure out how to make it happen and what is the rebuttal to that the ble for that is your competitors are offering it right so you basically have to go get the number two of every space and say hey we can move you some customers if you make this attractive and then you go back to number one you say hey number two is offering this and they people are moving um you should match it yeah and like new people who get get in are going to use number two instead of number one because they get the discount EX exactly exactly and we we continue to have new customers and we're just going to keep telling them go with this company because they offer you know a benefit and the reason why I was interested in it is AARP so AARP uh I actually don't know what it stands for but it's a club for people above 60 or 50 I think 50 American Association of retired persons yeah retired so I guess it's 60 um they do about1 and a half to2 billion dollar a year in sales and they have millions and millions and millions and millions of members the way they make business is uh revenue is I think they only charge about $100 a year to be a member and like most everyone when you turn 60 you get an an invitation in your mail and what you do is you get discounted health insurance and they make uh another side of their business is making money it's a basically an affiliate feed so I think they parted with United Health and they have the United Health AARP Plan which is discounted plan but also a plan specifically for whatever you know 60 plus people have uh and they are I think one of the largest lobbying groups in America it's a huge lobbying group they they they basically uh like kind of shaped the government in in some regard and so I thought that was super fascinating it's a really fascinating company that's existed for decades and isn't going to go away anytime soon and there's already other businesses doing this like think about why combinator when you get into why combinator I think they're like you get you know $250,000 of AWS credits you get a bunch of like stripe processing charges for free and like those businesses are like you're going to grow we're going to make money at the end uh but it also makes like you know when Y combinator is selling you on giving you $120,000 for 7% they're also like here are the other benefits that you get in this business right um so anyway I'm on board with this you want to do one more yeah what's the other idea you had something around Shopify for high-end or something for highend D what was that idea yeah sure um you know uh Shopify is fantastic I'm a big shareholder in Shopify I love them you know I built my career on in e-commerce uh the reality is it's wonderful for businesses going from Z to $50 million it's awful for businesses it's not awful but it's not good for businesses north of $100 million that are ready to spend a lot more on improving their conversion rate on a custom checkout page and you know the Shopify people were here they if the Shopify people were on this podcast with me they'd say that's crazy we have big businesses like figs and all birds and uh a lot of other big businesses on it but the reality is there's so many lack Like You Can't customize so much and it's so difficult particularly on the checkout page that I think there is room for somebody to come in and say I'm going to build my own shop I'm to build Shopify but for businesses doing North of100 billion and there's a lot of businesses doing north of $100 billion that have left Shopify you know Away Travel ritual Vitamins because they're like look we've outgrown this platform where did they go probably like usually a custombuilt stack sometimes with like this backbone of an old brand of an old business called spree which I think was like this open- Source e-commerce platform when you were growing your business but I don't think it's around anymore uh but I like you know they'll often go to their own custom Tech platform because they're like look we're doing enough business that this makes sense which is a pain in the ass it is a pain in the ass but like you know it's a pain in the ass is worth it when you're doing $500 million in revenue and a quarter you know quarter percentage Point bump in conversion rate on your checkout page is going to lead to an extra 1020 million in Revenue it's it's it's it's completely worth it then and um you know like shopify's one one page checkout like they launched that in the last six months that's been something that people have wanted for a really long time Shopify subscriptions has been really bad like all the subscription platforms have been really bad until more recently so I think shopi is trying to catch up on that larger uh segment but I think they've done that that's not their focus their focus is you've decided you want to start a business you go you know in the shower you come downstairs and you start a Shopify store that business is doing aund million in Revenue you know there are solutions that are competitive where more competitive than Shopify is uh and they're worth it because small changes in your website are going to be worth so much and they're harder to do in Shopify than they are to do in other brand yeah candidly like you know native was a $50 million e-commerce business built on WordPress and the reason we did WordPress was because it was cheap way cheaper and because it allowed us a lot more customization we could do post-p purchase pop-ups it at toar pop-ups at a time where we couldn't on Shopify we could do subscriptions that didn't charge us AR L to have subscriptions that you still can't do on Shopify uh you know we could have our own servers which you know you may or may not want based on Shopify we could do instantaneous page loading which you couldn't do on Shopify and so there were a lot of benefits for a business for because it was open source versus Shopify yeah you use the uh $300 a year woo Commerce which is like the steal of the century and the my of the century for WordPress it's $300 it's free it's free is it free yeah I mean I used it too I thought it yeah you know all those features that he just said were benefits uh that's not why he did it to be clear he picked it cuz he was like $33,000 for Shopify outrageous Over My Dead Body I would rather this business fail than pay you $3,000 had a business I was doing Millions a year and we used woocommerce and I remember it's owned by WordPress now I think and I remember like looking at wordpress's Revenue I'm like okay so WordPress controls a third of the internet and Shopify makes this much money and yet they're giving this to me what a bunch of idiots you guys like like you're it's a massive missed opportunity for WordPress and woocomerce is great you just need a developer sometimes to help you do some stuff but it's still way cheaper than Shopify that's right but like really it just goes to like you know we could we did a post-p purchase popup at dative which was after you clicked checkout we showed you a popup saying buy travel siiz deodorant we probably sold $700,000 of those traviz deodorant every single month uh and made you know $400,000 in net profit off those Travis siiz deodorants uh and we could only do that in WordPress we could not do that in Shopify you uh you also had something you were like I would do uh Shopify apps for India or something and I found this interesting because our Shopify app bill now granted I could go through and prune some apps that we're not using anymore that are probably still just recurringly charging me but I think we spend like 10 Grand a month on Shopify addons do you really it's insane because whatever you want to do they're like oh would you like to collect email addresses well pay me $1,500 a month like for this popup like what are you talking about and they're like well your store is big and it's like that doesn't matter this is an email popup who what do you care how many people type into the form like Google forms is free what what are you talking about and like um every little thing like we added a um postp purchase upsell and it was like $900 a month and I was like what's happening why why would would this be so expensive um all the review platforms are crazy expensive shopy apps are you know an absolute like rip off in the pricing definitely and and I think that you know if I were if I were a developer in India I'd be like I'm gonna hire a team of you guys we're going to knock off every single app and we're going to charge $20 a month and that's going to be our entire business model is $20 a month and like you know the other thing I'd say is the more apps you use the cheaper it gets so if you're using five apps instead of paying $100 you're paying $75 get the you know like there is no reason that just Doo popups should be $1,500 a month there's no reason that a post-p purchase upsell should be a percentage of Revenue and not $30 a month and uh the reality is that everyone's tiered percentages of Revenue because you can make so much money doing that and this is software that like you know could have been written within a week or a week and a half by almost anybody um and should be $30 a month I talked to a guy I tried to buy this one Shopify app that um all it did was it added a Max maximum to your cart like a feature people don't even think it's like why would I ever stop someone from buying more and it's like H let's say you're doing like a limited edition thing you don't want like the resellers to go buy all your [ __ ] and uh these guys you know for for like seven years they've been doing like two million a year with a million dollar a million and a half dollars of profit just on one Shopify app that just caps the maximum somebody could could buy of a of a unit and that that's got to be like you know that should be like two lines of code or something it's crazy uh but there are so many of these that that exist out there and people have smartly tried to roll some of these up yeah and how many of those how many of customers of that app are probably customers who don't look at their bill on every a monthly basis and they're like oh man I'm getting charged $200 a month and I never think about it yeah yeah because it's tot it's built first you never whip out your credit card you just once you connect to Shopify it's gonna pay you through Shopify and then it's buried in the billing tab under all this stuff so yeah there's definitely uh there's like low very low friction in like racking up those charges there's a massive business to be built here which is cloning the top 100 Shopify apps and just charging a flat fee like you know it might be a longer term business because you don't have a sales team and you're not going out calling everyone being like switch from you know yappo to me but it is a every single new business is going to go to you because it's way easier to use you have some controversial opinions you have a lot of them um a few of them data is overrated wealth managers are just used car salesmen you uh hate real Twitter real estate I want to hear some thoughts on on those things we'll start with um we'll start with an easy one of data being overrated what what do you mean by that um let's start with an easier one which is uh Twitter real estate mind um like uh wait say say the unpopular opinion what is it about Twitter real estate uh it's full of complete [ __ ] they're full of frauds and they're like I can't begin to tell you how many people where I like read their tweets some deals I'm in and I'm like you how is nobody calling you out on this like um you know people are like are give give the listener perspective here so you own maybe dozens or hund or hund hundreds hundreds of either single family homes or multif family homes is that right that's right yes and then I'm an investor in dozens of real estate deals through as being an LP okay so you that's your perspective that's my perspective I'm you know in LP and a lot of the people you know people would be like did you unfollow me because of my opinion out the Middle East crisis and I'm like no I unfollowed you because you're a fraud and you're pretending like you're a good real estate investor and you're a [ __ ] complete criminal and I know it because I'm an LP in your business like you know even now I can feel my blood boilet they're tweeting out tweeting out their returns they're like here are our returns and I'm like these are not returns that I've realized as an LP in your deal as an LP in your businesses and you know they have the audacity like you know I'll be like hey uh we're like you know before interest rates were going up I was like do we have floating rate mortgages what the [ __ ] is going to happen when interest rates go up and these guys are like uh it's going to be fine it's it's going to be fine and now they're like actually we need more money and like you know uh startups are one thing where you might need more Capital as a business grows because you're trying to expand for some reason or another real estate is a business where once you own the asset you should not need more cash you're not like expanding the real estate in any way you're operating an apartment building the problem is what happens is when the interest rates go up and you have more debt to pay every single month because you're on a floating rate you need more Capital to be able to pay that debt because the rents don't service it rents are going down interest rates are going up and these guys who have promised you know uh making fortunes are like are caught with their pants down and then what the which is crazy then they have the audacity to say hey actually where our returns are fantastic then they the like the other audacity that they have is they're like okay all the deals you invested in with in the last five years with us are bad because interest rates are up but now we can buy things at a lower price because prices have gone down their interest rates are up so buy with me now I'm a good now it's a good time to invest with me and I want to be like I want to [ __ ] kill you is really the answer um you know I hate that type of [ __ ] you said why isn't anyone calling these people out um yeah why aren't you calling them out would you like to name some names we got a great audience here that would love to hear the names of some of these folks yeah I don't want to name names because I want them like you know some of these people I'm friends with and I'm like I know your wives and your families and I don't want you to like suffer like I don't want to see you sort of suffering in that way you just want to kill them but like yes I do want to kill them I do think they're like I I like there are very few people I would ever invest again with in real estate Twitter the one exception to that rule I'll name the exception rather than the rule itself is Moses Kagan where I've invested in several deals with him and I'm like this guy underwrites conservatively like I underwrite um and he's like thinking about the game in a long-term way where he's like I want to manage my reputation I want people to make money I'll make money when people make money and I would invest with him again in a lot of other deals that I've done with people on real estate Twitter I'm like I would need uh you know I would have have to be a heroin addict to invest with you again you said last time you were on the podcast uh you did a pie chart um which normally people do as percentages and you did as dollars which I thought was such a boss move and really enjoyed so I want you to tell me how it's changed since then so you said at the time this was 2022 mid 2022 so it's been about a year um since then a little more than a year you said I got 10 million of in private Equity 40 to 50 million in cash which is short-term bonds I'm waiting for bond prices to come up you said then you said that was so smart then you said 2530 million in real estate um that we own and operate ourselves and then 10 million in real estate as a LP in other people's funds he said 10 million in startup Investments and 10 million in the stock market um what do you has that changed have you have you made shifts since then in how you are investing yeah sure um good question uh it hasn't changed from atically um I would say the4 to $50 million in bonds is probably somewhere at 60 to 70 today but it's still in short-term bonds which you're yielding a lot uh I'm starting to get a little bit longer as like the yield curve starts to flatten like right now if you buy a one-year Bond you'll get about 5.5% interest uh in a year if you buy a 10-year bond it's a little bit under five uh you know a year ago it was like five it was let's say 5% for a year but 4% for 10 years and now the the like the curve was inverted and now starting to flatten a little bit and as it continues to flatten I invest in longer term bonds rather than just short-term bonds uh I probably have 15 to20 million in the stock market at this point uh heavily concentrated in Facebook and uh uh and Shopify uh probably like and probably PNG you tweet out this funny thing it was uh your your IR versus uh S&P and you're like uh you quoted you quoted Legally Blonde you're like what like Stock Investing is hard it's hard yeah that's right yeah and what was what was the returns what was the comparison um yeah I was probably up 30% for the era yeah versus S&P was like three or something or or 10 12 or something like that yeah uh but I you didn't say what you owned and in my head I was like I bet that is literally just Facebook Facebook yeah yeah it's it's a lot of Facebook um Facebook and Shopify and PG you and your brother kept buying the dip like Facebook was getting crushed like uh you know yeah I don't know a year and a half ago to to like you know up until six months ago or something and um every time it went down I remember your brother and I think you also were like uh hey is everybody insane uh great I can't wait to go buy more Facebook today and the earnings and psychologically it's hard right earnings come out or or uh you know big stock move happens goes down and to be like all right woo let's go but let's buy in more Buy in more that takes a totally different mindset uh what's your what drives the conviction because it's obviously not a reaction to the you're not reacting to momentum in fact you're going you're betting against the current momentum so what made you believe that that's like a place that you wanted to be investing um I would say two things one is literally every single business I know that's a online retailer is entirely dependent on Facebook whether they realize it or not like anybody any look the best businesses in direct consumer are entirely dependent on Facebook the worst businesses are Diversified and it's that simple if you're entirely if you're like my business lives or dies by Facebook I'm like you're going to have a better outcome than if you think your business lives and dies by YouTube ads brick and more actually brick and word is an exception to that but like YouTube ads I'm Diversified with my advertising strategy I'm investing a lot in Tik Tok that means you can't get the thing that works for everybody and is the biggest advertising engine in the world to work for you you're going to miss out out a ton of opportunity um and and so I'd say that is one of them but like the reality is and this is a little bit of a longer story when the financial crisis hit my father who had been conservative his entire life he was probably like 70 years old at the time and he's like this doesn't make sense how cheap these houses are and so um he bought one house and um it was probably like a, 1500t house and he paid $150,000 for it and it just sold for like 225 uh like you know a couple months before and he's like there's a $75,000 discount after 60 days and then the 60 days later that 150 was probably worth like 75,000 and rather than get scared and be like oh [ __ ] I lost $75,000 and we don't have a lot of money at that time he's like this doesn't make any sense uh now this house over here that sold for $250 four months ago is for $75,000 and so he kept purchasing real estate and um you know there was one half duplex that he purchased for $88,000 and it generates like $1900 in rent a month today like within uh you know within a year we purchased back the entire duplex every single year and uh he never lost conviction he's like this is a deal of a lifetime and uh I've got the conviction that I'm right here and you know honestly you know people talk about my brother and I and how we've like had financial success the reality is that financial success is based on the idea that we will not need a lot of money in the future because he he started purchasing real estate and created a steady stream of income for our family that would be very hard to lose uh we had the benefit of that and sort of the solid foundation of like not worrying about money and sort of being able to take a lot of risk because we could fall back on real estate um and that gave me a lot of conviction where I'm like wow it it is possible to Buck the trend here and say you know what these people are wrong this like you know this is on sale you're selling this incredible asset and it's 50% off and I know it because I'm looking at you know 25 ad accounts on a daily basis and seeing that these people are still investing ad dollars on Facebook um so how could it be 25 how could it be 25% off how could Facebook stock be 50% off this is a buying opportunity not a selling opportunity of your uh portfolio now what percentage of it came from native uh was did Native make up the bulk of it and then it's just has grown nicely since then um I would say native is uh you know it's hard to answer that question because like n so when native sold uh let's say I I made virtually the entire amount um but that you know like that the my netw worth is significantly higher than that now but like you know it's based on like you know I wouldn't own $50 million in Bonds were it not for the hundred million I got from native sale so like yeah while the interest I don't know if the interest is a able the native or it is not presumably it is um you know certainly if I were getting a divorce and I didn't have a pre-op I'd say all of this is native money like it all came from native that's pre uh pre-marriage uh and so um you know the bulk of my uh Financial net worth as a result of selling native but at this point the cash itself from native is probably less than a majority of my not worth when you um you talk about like you know 08 your dad saw that opportunity underpriced when Facebook stock is crashing you feel like this is an underpriced asset um what do you feel like are the kind of underpriced opportunities or assets today I think San Francisco real estate and possibly office real estate in a lot of other cities but I do think that like um that like you know the the question is how do you want to get in there um and when we were when my father was buying this real estate 08 I was in a it must been like a little bit later actually must have been like 2010 I was an attorney and all these like wealth managers try and talk to attorneys and so I was like look I need a loan um for 500 my family needs a loan for $500,000 we bought a million dollar of real estate we just want 50% LTV and Wells Fargo would be like the only way we're going to give you a loan is if you give us a million dollars in cash then we'll give you a million dollar loan and I was like I don't understand if you guys know how money works but if I had a million dollars in cash I wouldn't come to you for a [ __ ] million dollar loan I wouldn't give you that um but so anyway like we were we were strapped for cash and try to deploy it and then what my father did is he dollar cost averaged into the real estate State uh and he didn't know that that's what he was doing he was just like okay we got like another you know $50,000 to spend let's go buy a house and um he would get that $50,000 for rent that he was collecting and so he just dollar cost averaged his way in and was really aggressive um I'm if if you were dollar cost averaging your way into office space I'd probably start you know in 2023 or early very early 20224 if you were like I'm trying to time the bottom which is really hard to do correctly obviously I'd probably still wait four to 5 months cuz there's probably still some uh you know some deals that have to go that have to light on fire before the rest of the world realizes okay my real estate is not worth 100 million it's actually worth 30 million today yeah I agree with the San Francisco thing what do you think what was your answer to that question I didn't have an answer but I wanted to know your opinion on like uh some of these D Toc companies that just got smashed in the stock market so like you know an all birds brand which I don't know what the market cap is it's like $50 million or something it's come down come way way way down revenues over 100 million market cap you know 50on today is 138 yeah no I think it has to go bankrupt before you can touch that and why is that they just totally mismanaged it or it's too much debt or what's the problem with that that business I I haven't looked uh probably like real estate uh is probably not good their team is too large they might have some like Financial Obligations probably to their suppliers that are really holding down their they have a lot of accounts uh payable um and you need to wipe that all out before you can get into it you know I looked at this with honest as well and I was like um I talked to some serious people and I was like Hey I want to buy I'm thinking about buying honest um and uh that business was that business had different problems that business had gross margin problems which was they if they sell a diaper for a dollar it actually cost them 7 cents and generally this industry you it actually cost you like 30 cents you should have you know 60 70% gross margins these guys had 30% gross margins so they they had a different problem but like um I I think with all birds it's a it's more severe it's uh you know know it's systemic it's a brand like you know it's a brand like it needs I think it'll have to go through bankruptcy in a little to be uh fixed do you look at things like AI do you pay attention to it or you just like I'm a merchant I used to cash checks at a gas station and I sold deodorant uh you know through Facebook ads and now you know I you know are you like real estate you know the only things I can touch and feel or do you pay attention do you get swept up at all in the kind of the crazes of the day like AI um I think I get swept up a little bit but I'm probably more cautious where I'm like I want to see how this thing makes money uh I remember our last podcast Sean you were like how much do you have in Bitcoin because that was one thing on my pie chart I did not talk about and I was like you know probably less than $500,000 and today it's you know like probably less than $200,000 um you know I like to know how I'm going to make money I guess I'm far more risk averse than most entrepreneurs um and that risk aversion means that I probably won't invest in businesses unless I have a good idea idea of like how does this business make money or who who purchases this business or how do we how do we exit this business 5 to 10 years from now I need like a realistic vision of that and if I don't have that I'm probably less inclined to get behind it and so I think that's made me shy away from Bitcoin that's made me shy away from AI probably to my own detriment are you managing everything yourself and what tools are you using is it just a a sheet just an Excel sheet yeah there's a Google sheet my brother and I share where we're like here's your investment like you know if it's a you know here's a fund here's how much we committed here's how much we've invested if it's a startup it's here's how much we put in do do you guys still have like One bank account he told me once he was like yeah it's kind of just like a family pot of money I'm like how does that work a little bit a little bit uh a little bit yes uh is the honest answer is yes still uh in in very many ways I think the answer is yes to that um when you see him buying something stupid you're like you're spending our money [ __ ] what are you doing well I knew he was going to buy you a gift one time and I was like well he's kind of buying himself a gift right you it's our money uh you you don't like you don't like wealth managers uh so do you manage everything yourself CU that's a full-time job almost that is a full-time job if you want to be good at it and if you don't get like if you don't want to be good at it it's less of a full-time job like at this point I'm I'm mostly content with if I'm not making a startup investment I'm generally going to think of the S&P 500 or a US Treasury I'm not like chasing the extra yield um where I'm like if I put a lot of effort into this instead of a US treasury maybe an Uber like uber bonds that are dated in 2025 are paying 6.2% but you have to analyze what's the tax implication of this Uber Bond versus a US Treasury to to determine net yields uh I'm not like that uh I'm just like give me the US Treasury the extra 1% yield isn't worth it I'll go make a percent elsewhere um my wealth managers I've been through a several now um I've been through Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs you know uh I like Goldman Sachs is like always consult us before you make an investment we'll just give you a real opinion and I did that for a while and I was like okay I thought you guys were just going to be like is this a good idea or a bad idea but they're always like no give us the money instead I I used to tell the story I told I I told I went to like my Goldman sachs's uh like my wealth manager's boss I had to come over to the native offices and I was like look I believe that if I told my wealth manager that Bill Gates was ready to give me a billion dollars tomorrow if I let him borrow this pen and he signed a contract to that effect and put the billion dollars in a briefcase and give me that give me the briefcase you'd say don't do that deal give us the pen instead like uh they would not they would like they would not let you loan a dollar to Bill Gates if he was going to give you a billion dollars tomorrow and he prefunding dollars they'd say give us the dollar we can do better with it U let us earn fees on your dollar don't take the billion dollars let us earn fees and I told my Goldman Sachs wealth manager's boss I was like this is how I feel in your organization it is [ __ ] horrific um and uh you know I still feel that way about them uh like you know I'm still angry at them um and then I went to this tell me how you really feel yeah yeah I I'll tell them still one of the funniest tweets I ever saw was you go oh here's a photo of every uh 3pl owner that I've ever seen and it was a picture of the hamburgler was so funny was so funny oh my God and I couldn't even imagine what you were going through that would get you to the point where you're like I'm GNA tweet this out and where's what where's a picture of the Hamburglar because that's that's how clown clownishly criminal these guys are with how they rip you off uh so so funny my last wealth manager um was like about a year and a half ago was like you should invest everything into uh bonds right now we think the FED is going to engineer soft landing and everything's going to be perfect and so you want this three you'll get a 3% yield if you invest in a 5year duration so basically that you'll get 3% a year but you have to commit to it without money being invested for five years and um so I put like uh I think it was like five or 7 million to that and uh against that strategy and then a quarter in like probably three months later I was like you know what I don't believe in this sell everything right now I'm going to take a loss I don't think we're going to engineer this soft Landing interest rates are going to go up inflation is 9% the [ __ ] are you guys thinking that we could engineer soft Landing year with with interest rates staying the same as interest rates remaining the way they are and inflation being nine [ __ ] per. you think that I should get a 3% yield and so uh we sold the $7 million I probably lost $150 or $125,000 or $150,000 in that three-month period doing this three months lost $150,000 because I bet against them and you know people started to realize interest rates would rise and uh since then I've just invested in like you know 3 months six month one-year treasuries um to take take advantage of the yth and so like you know these guy the guys who are the wealth managers their job is not to understand markets their job is is to understand um how to sell you an asset they're just car salesmen who sell like you know financial instruments rather than cars and they're like just as Sleazy and just as like slimy and just as charismatic as well and um you know I trust you know have you seen like Seinfeld where George castanza is in a car dealership and a car dealer is like walking towards him and he's like stop right there otherwise I'm going to leave that's whenever my wealth manager is like let me sell you this asset I'm like stop right there I'm going to hang up the phone if we continue this conversation vo or you know us treasuries don't try and sell me anything else I know how you guys think are you ever going to start another company again and and make that your thing you missing it yes definitely um you know I think that uh I can't turn $100 million into a billion dollars uh I can only start a business that sells for a billion dollars so I think the answer is yes in fact I'm certain hey what what happened to the guy on Twitter who said uh Hey money is not going to make you happy uh it's your friend and your family and your what did you what you say you had some tweet about this the other day that I was like you do you have a Ghost Rider who who is this this is not on brand this is not the guy who said I was put on Earth to increase earnings per share I like the old boys the guy who was like it all be true it all can be true right you could he wants to get after it you don't have to do it just to make you happy you do it just because it's exciting and I think like it all depends on the mood you're in where you're like lonely or spending a lot of time with friends and you're like wow this is great and then you you know I'll spend time with friends and this guy will be like yeah I'm making I started this director consumer business I'm doing $100 million our second year $20 million in iida and I'm like [ __ ] friendship I need to get that uh and so I think it's all like The Grass Is Always Greener um and so sometimes I'm in the like you know I had this other two where I'm like sometimes I want to be like a warrior and U make a lot of money and other times I want to be like a civilian and um just spend time with loved ones I don't have a good answer to that I see a therapist and she doesn't have a good answer to that for me either hey no there's uh what is it sun Su it's better to be a warrior in the garden as opposed to a gardener in war so uh you know you could still be this crazy person and chill every once in a while wow that is a great quote I've never heard that before that's awesome what are business ideas that you guys have what are what's a business idea that I should start you know if I want to start a business what's what you guys talk to a lot more people than I do what's a business idea I should start well my honest opinion is that you now have new advant manages and so like you could start a new business from scratch but I really do think the thing you should do is take a huge slug of capital buy something that is like you know already worth hundred million do like you could you could take something from 100 to 500 or 100 to a billion much easier than going from zero to 500 uh with like a new product in the marketplace and so I I think that's what I would that's where I would start the process of thinking thinking about I think you'd be very successful doing that or or buying like U I forget the guy's name natnat something the guy who bought uh the trading C company like like an old uh what was it called Sean yeah net Turner is that his name n Turner yeah he bought like a trading car company and he's like I'm gonna make this cool again I think you would succeed doing that but my read on you is that you are significantly more of a Creator and an artist than you want people to think and I think that you have to because I I saw how like careful you were about customer service and about the brand and even though you want to act like this tough guy like you were like I'm going to answer 200 customer service emails and I'm going to like Delight them and I remember about the website like you act like oh I just copied this I copied that there's a lot more thought and care than you than you give that Vibe out and so if if if I had to tell you what to do it would be uh start something from scratch and make it art and then also have that 50% of you that you know only cares about evid you know or whatever uh but I I my opinion is of who you are is you need to be a little bit more of artist than you have lately I couldn't agree more I appreciate that yeah I actually agree with that I I also think uh what I would not do is I would not do another DDC brand even though you know how to do it and you could do it like you know in your sleep at this point um just because you're playing the same level of the video game that you you already beat and like you know what's more valuable than the money you would make in that is like you have like certain number of years of like you're you're in like Peak mental physical like abilities right now and like use those years wisely either go do just the funnest things you can think of you know around the world and travel and do all that good stuff or if you are going to do a creative project make it one that like you know puts those to good use and to good challenge you know like if you if you came to me and you said uh like you know I'm starting another D Toc brand and it's going to be um you know not deodorant but whatever some other thing you know uh yeah I would be like okay that's cool I'm sure it's going to be successful but um I don't think that's what will make you more that's [ __ ] because native deodorant like I use the soap because like I trust the brand like he built a brand I mean it's a it's a trusted brand uh partially because I know Moyes I don't know the the owner now so I don't I don't know actually if they're sticking to what the prom you don't know Proctor well I I don't know if they're actually it's the opposite I think if they own it they're probably going to ruin it uh but like if you were to create like some type of food that is a healthy option or something baby formula that's a healthy option I actually think that that would start and look silly but it actually has massive implications and would make I don't like saying this but it could make the world even a slightly better place and you could find some fulfillment in that uh and it would look just like another Ecom brand but as long as it's not like something stupid that doesn't that doesn't matter to people like for example another all Bird's thing but something that I put in my body uh you know or something that makes my kid healthier something like that I I I think that could fulfill you I appreciate that and I appreciate that inspiration as well I think there's uh truth to both those things like I I want to build build something bit like one of the reasons that I haven't really gotten excited about anything is cuz I want something to be you know 10 times bigger than my last business and that's um you know that's hard to do and hard to be excited about and hard to say you know what I'm going to spend the next 10 years of my life building this business um and that's uh you know that's what's made me really cautious about it but in a way that I think is um you know making my mind less flexible than it was 5 years ago well you better get on it man you don't want to be a hasband or a one- hit wonder I I I I think that I think that is only it's a home run for everyone else I think it's a base hit for you um but I'm I'm like every day I'm like what's he doing what's he doing is he doing it I'll see you tweet something I'm like is that gonna be the thing is that gonna be the thing is he gonna actually call in you know you're gonna be you're GNA be like Uncle Rico bragging about how you almost took state in high school like I want you know what I mean that's right what a NE what an amazing NE well hey look that's it's not a NE I'm saying you're you know it's a compliment look it's a compliment I you're going to you're going to do great things but whether you're going to finally nut up and actually do it uh and that's what I'm eager for yeah yeah in fact my my banker from the Native sale texted me yesterday and he's like you know November 8th is the six year anniversary of the sale and so like it's been six years since I've been out uh you know sold the business and you know I think so far it's been my B Opus good you want to feel some anxiety today it's been six years you want to [ __ ] up your day here you go you know what that is he's doing a home option for investment banking he's like texting me once in a while be like hey when it's time to sell this your next business don't forget about me I'm still texting you what was the um what what's the sales now of native I bet you that's doing two or 300 million a year now right 500 this year 500 oh could have what have should have no I'm I'm joking you I would have sold probably as well I know I don't think I could have done yeah I don't think I could have done with PNG is done without that like they've made it an amazing brand they think about like um you know product development they think about shelf space they think about things in a way that's really spectacular and I'm not to say that there are things where I look at them I'm like oo I wouldn't have done that like I definitely see that once in a while but ultimately like um you know the reason that I sold what I did was I wanted to learn from people who are Masters at something about how to grow something from you know 30 to 100 or 500 and I think I learned a lot of that while I was there and so you know there people are always like do regret it I there's not a day that goes by where I go to bed and I'm like man I shouldn't have sold I'm always like that was the right decision wrap up with this one line that you told me um you you you were saying uh you telling me about the sale the sale process and they were like so how are you going to expand and you looked at them all dumbfounded I go are and you go well can you write the words native on a shampoo bottle how how about on toothpaste can you write that okay that's how you expand and that's exactly what they've done I actually don't use the deodorant but I use the soap you uh the soap is my favorite you've even had like Melissa's cupcake soap and and you have all this other soap I I I love the soap and so uh your uh the body wash is that right the body wash yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and your body wash and you um your smartass reply was their strategy and it worked so congratulations like a guy in the back just taking notes yeah he's gonna call someone hey guys can we write native on this bottle can we do that it was bananas I remember that right on uh Moyes thanks for coming on man and we appreciate you coming on thank you very much talk [Music] to

I invested in one laundr M that did $3 million a year so it's doing like 8 Grand a day yeah they do 15% margins and the way they do them is actually through the wash and fold business not the walk-in laundry business okay gotcha and so the real business where the higher level customers are and where you make more money is single mom wants to put her bag of clothes outside of her door you pick it up you wash it you drop it back off it requires cars and Logistics and some oversight it's more complex the average laundromat makes some around1 to $500,000 a year at 10 to 15% margins how many laundr mats did you buy in total I probably owned like 25 or 30 launder mats over my career of launder matting

and I'm really obsessed with these types of opportunities uh because it's easy to get press like you can see the headlines now Idiot creates water brand for dogs I can see it [Laughter] now yeah great headline formerly respected individual Greg Eisenberg yeah disgraces himself with good one [Music] yeah um all right we're live Sean what do we got what's up uh Greg is here friend of the house one of the original one of the original Friends of the house I you you said something on an earlier pod that has always stuck with me you were talking about I think names you had a you had your iPhone out and you were on the notes app and you go I just got Banger names for for businesses that don't have a business yet with them and you were just spitting off names and one of the formats was um anything with the word Bueno at the end and I can't tell you how many times I've used this when somebody's asking me about a name and they're like yeah we do um we do medical imaging scans I'm like scan Bueno and they're like what and they never pick it but godamn if it doesn't break the ice uh Greg welcome and do you still have that notes that note with all those names I've got all the names I've also got I don't know 150 startup ideas in a notes file but before I started I got to get something off my chest I gotta be real with you all right what we got producer Ari you stole my producer did we we don't know about this fil me in yes so all of a sudden you guys send me a text and you go what do you think about Ari as a producer I see you work with him with her and I go she's amazing she's the best you know there's nothing wrong nothing wrong about her and then all of a sudden I'm getting a text from AR being like dude thank you so much thank you so much I've just got the craziest job at my first million if I ever call you for a reference check just know it's Mr Steal Your Girl coming coming at you right there I thought she worked on it in the past I thought I thought that was that's what that's what I thought too I thought there was an end date it's okay is it uh it happened it happened is it okay it's not okay well uh sorry and thank you okay moving on from that one um Greg you uh people should know what you do you have late checkout which is badass you have one of the best websites um of any like I don't know company you make really amazing landing pages uh so you have late checkout which is combination Studio agency how do you describe it holding company building businesses that have audiences and communities a part of them and you are kind of becoming this like Greg the community guy I feel like that was like a phase of your life is that still the phase we're in are we are we is this a making fetch a thing or is it did it stick did the Greg the community guy happen or what what's going on with that I think so man I think so um I feel like if other people are calling you that it's it's a thing if you start calling yourself the community guy uh and you're just you know so yeah it's it's definitely working I feel like that's a mistake I've made many times trying to call myself the guy even actually uh today I was thinking about I was thinking about Gary ve I was thinking about one of my favorite YouTubers Cody Co and I was like why am I not sha P what what what is Puri doing for me I I gotta drop the rest of the last name I just need to be Shawn P and I really wrote a note to myself I said go all in on Sha PE and that's stupid no Workshop it itself you've got a weird enough first name s h a a an I think you're good you're good the only reason why Sam is saying that yeah jealous he that he's well no you know Sam he's he wants to be Sam P he wants to be Sam P come on no man I'm happy I I I I've got a two syllable first and last name I'm good I don't need a nickname when when it's that short you're good um Sean Bueno dude Greg late checkout. Studio I hate your website you're doing this it's such a designer website I can't click anything I got to like scroll around a map in order to find what you do what's going on man yeah I think listen there's two ways to create a website one is to be conversion conversion Centric right like convert as many people as possible uh the other way is you're building a brand and this is unlike any other website on the internet I think so we you you'd be surprised how many million doll deals we've been able to close cuz people like our website you've done something that um I think a lot of people were trying to do but you've done it well so we've let's talk about this kind of personal hold co uh you because you went the Venture path when I met you you were raising money from all the big name VCS you were building a social network like we were we were both playing that like it's not even a lottery ticket game the analogy I give is somebody handed us a bottle or we picked up a bottle and started running around trying to catch lightning and um and that was our like stated game plan was like ah yes I shall create the next hit social network now on demand which is not how any of them got really built in the first place um so you played the VC game you have backed off of it give us your kind of two second philosophy on how your mindset changed going from Silicon Valley venture path to what you do now there was a group of us now in our 30s who watch The Social Network that movie and we all thought that we could become Mark Zuckerberg if we're being honest with ourselves I mean I would I would have been happy with a winkl Voss too but like Yeah I wanted to be Zuck yes we saw that movie it jazzed us up there was a whole generation of us who moved to Silicon Valley to go and raise a bunch of money to build social apps and you know we tried we tried and the truth is it's it's you know I remember meeting one of the world's uh best investors and he he once told me that a third of our deals fail a third of our deals we get our money back and a third of our deals we make 1X to Google times so that got me thinking that what he's basically saying is that the best Founders in the world because he's only backing the best Founders twoth thirds of them basically the founders and their teams don't see any money from Acquisitions that means a third of companies are basically seeing any profit it's just so difficult to win in that game and yeah so that's why I've been focusing more on profitable cash filling businesses our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better are you making more money now doing the cash flow Thing versus when you sold your company AB yes absolutely yeah do you like your life better yeah and do you do you have a goal like a like cash flow goal you're like okay my goal is to get to 10 million in cash flow or whatever like is that how you're thinking about is that the game that you're currently playing no the game I'm playing is I'm playing for style points [Laughter] baby what does that even mean is there is there anything else to say no that explains everything next question what is what's the style point we were talking about when Sam was at working at HubSpot he was like I'm an artist baby I got create I think that's what Greg's talking about when he talks about style points uh the other part of style points is like the lifestyle so in silan Valley this idea of a lifestyle lifestyle business is like a um it's a backhanded compliment so it's it's a way for people in Silicon Valley to Pat you on the head and be like that's cute that's a cute business um like good for you good you that's swell um but like to me I'm like that's crazy like the point point of these business is to give myself and my team awesome Lifestyles like what else are you what are you trying to do if not that I don't I don't even understand and so I feel like one of the kind of arbitrages right now is in especially if you're from the tech industry is the whole tech industry is so brainwashed that it's all about creating multibillion dollar companies that um a lot of people who would actually be super happy if they created a lifestyle business that gave gave them $25 million a year of cash flow um won't ever go that path because it's seen as kind of this like lesser lesser thing to do it we all have friends who do that you know I I tease or we we teased them on air Andrew Wilkinson for doing for doing that um but you know what was funny is do you guys see uh chamath from Allin he uh so chth for the listener I I I I would assume he's a billionaire if he's not a billionaire many many hundreds of millions very very very wealthy uh the other day he announced that he was starting a paid newsletter and I think it was $100 a year um and what's funny is there's two things that I found to be true is I've talked to someone who says they don't want to be public and then they get on Twitter or they get on YouTube or something and they taste that do that dopamine and they go oh this is nice I'm gonna I'm gonna do this again and they love the even though like you know the people who are like oh I can't do it I don't want to do I don't want to be public ey they get the public eye and they love it the second thing I've noticed is even people who have big compan that are maybe Venture back companies and there's a very likely outcome where they're wildly wealthy even making $50,000 $100,000 a month that can be addicting I wonder what what Chamas plays with that but he has a he has a paid newsletter now well even worse he's like uh yeah and we're we're going to have it be paid and so that's really cool because the revenue from that um it makes this whole thing sustainable like we can we can use it to hire more researchers and do better research it's like hey why don't you take the 0.1% interest on your uh savings account that you have in with with JP Morgan right now and use that to pay for seven researchers it's fine actually like it it's crazy to me that like what you know people say like what's the point of money if you don't say you like what's the point of being a billionaire if you're gonna do a paid newsletter like what is what is happening right now the point is it's addicting and so my point being is where a lot of people who like would make fun of Lifestyle businesses once I mean and I was that person I was like I want to go big and then I start tasting like a monthly monthly income that's good I'm like oh this is awesome I I was texting Andrew Wilkinson making fun of him too cuz he was doing a paid Twitter subscriber thing and I was like dog you have a foundation you're talking you're signing the giving pledge um like what do you care about this like 10K a month um you know subscriber Revenue that you now have to go tap dance for to like perform and give them their value but it hits for him like there's something to it uh that for for that that's like giving him that value um I was I couldn't believe it to the point where I told him I was like the only explanation for this that makes any sense to me is you're using the Twitter paid features so that Elon is like see this guy's doing it and he puts you he starts retweeting you uh because you're promoting his thing that he's trying to make work and then you end up becoming friends with Elon Musk I said that's the only reasonable explanation for this and he denied it he Didi I I actually get Andrew doing his his premium X thing a little bit more because like he's having interaction with his fans but the chamama thing around like putting up gated content makes absolutely no sense did you have Greg did you have any other ideas or uh Niche businesses you wanted to get off your chest let's just rapid fire all right give us give us one this one's a is a happy idea so it's a crazy one but a happy one it's listen to me now athletic greens for dogs okay okay keep going go on ag1 athletic greens came out of nowhere started sponsoring all these podcasts YouTubers uh and I don't know if they're what do you think their revenue is Sam 600 million 500 million I think they kill it but I'll do the homie move and say 100 million yeah okay more than 100 million they're they're really really crushing it using that model now dogs are similar to humans in the sense that they drink water they drink tap water and the question is what if dogs drank something that was better from them better for them than plain old water okay so uh here's the Playbook you find the Andrew huberman for dogs you sponsor every Top Dog Creator in animals lovered podcast you give packets to to restaurants and and bowls that say this brand for their dogs and then you profit the name we call it the name we call it good water and our slogan we do good dogs deserve good water now we have to figure out what we can put in the water so that it actually is better than water itself but this is a good example of how do you create a category of one how do you build something where you're building something where no one else is playing and I'm really obsessed with these types of opportunities uh because it's easy to get press like you can see the headlines now Idiot creates water brand for dogs I can see it [Laughter] now gr headline formerly respected individual GRE yeah disgraces himself with good water Sean P says it's really better than water I swear is Gatorade for dogs the next great thing yeah like this is some stupid Greg we're good waterb bad idea this it sounds like something uh Misfits or what's that called what's that what's that company called that Mischief I got tell you when Craig Clemens came on the Pod one time many years ago and he was like guys uh we were like what ideas you got he's like VR for dogs and this is the guy who's made like 10 hit products so he's not like some one hit wonder he's got 10 he's had 10 great ideas and on our pod he comes on and says VR for dogs and both me and you were like we didn't know him that well to be like roast him like we just did Greg but we were like tell us more um but you know we were not in on it but then I swear every time I leave the cuz he was like look he's like I would pay any if my dog could be entertained when they're alone like or just you know I just don't want them to be bored and now I swear every time I leave the house and my dog sitting there just going to stare at a wall and I'm like bet your ass I'd strap on some a pair of pair of uh you know Oculus for dog goggles if if it actually kept my dog entertained so I think he was right on right in in spirit gr I want to talk to you about some of these ideas because you the first one you talk about Ryan holiday who's been on the pod is my buddy I'm a huge fan of and you seem like you're in a spicy mood first I'm always in a spicy mood uh I just want to put that out there um for the the record is said for the record the record is said okay uh yeah let's talk about the first idea so Ryan holiday uh incredible incredible guy like he's built such a huge brand around stoicism stoicism was basically the dead unless you know you were studying philosophy at Columbia uh these people like senica Aristotle um maybe You' see quotes here and there but it was basically dead and what he did is he introduced stoicism the Great Name by the way daily stoic to millions of genz and Millennials um so I think that there's an opportunity to do exactly what Ryan holl did uh but in the Fable space so do you remember remember asop asop fables no what is that okay so asop uh is just one of one of the most well-known uh storytellers uh of all time of humanity he of humanity he did like the tortoise and the hair uh or the the wolf and sheep's clothing so it's basically these little stories that use animals to to tell you know the moral of the story and it's got a lot of great stuff in there just like uh senica had a lot of great stuff in there so um I think that if you you know got the handle the daily fabler uh and you started telling these incredible stories and quotes from it uh you can build an audience really quickly through that um and similar to how Ryan holiday um you know Ryan holiday for those who don't know monetized via courses but he also monetized via his book but he also my favorite part of how he monetizes is he literally sells it's a coin he calls it a medallion uh so he's got this Medallion called momento Mory hey I have one okay why did you get one because he gave it to me and I thought it was awesome but I I do think it's cool I I carried it around with me for years I I thought it was cool I I forget what do moment it means uh like you're going to die or like live the day or something like that yeah basically means uh like Seize the Day right like you're going to die and if you know you're going to die and you're and you're facing mortality then it's Greek for YOLO yeah it's Greek for YOLO momento Mori is Greek for YOLO so that's a and people pay $30 for this and I'm sure that he's making millions of dollars selling coins to his audiences via Twitter Tik Tok and Instagram and YouTube it's this same model but for fables he told us this on the Pod and it blew my mind he came on and he was like yeah um I sell this coin it's like you know cost me whatever I don't know what it was but like you know let's call it a dollar just be generous assume this coin costs a dollar he partnered with this mint in the US they mint the coin he sends it and he's like yeah you know I've sold shirts before I think he worked at American Apparel he was like the head of marketing American Apparel he's like you know apparel sucks merch sucks shirts t-shirts suck because there's so many sizes and colors and whatever he's like there's one skew it's one coin there's no return I sell it in a two pack I sell it in a two pack it ships in an envelope because it's the lightest weight thing so like shipping is easy making it is easy selling it is easy because it's a it's a uh you know it's a single skew product he's like it was the low headache way to have a merch store for stoicism and I was like this guy's genius and I I remember I don't know if he told us or I was doing some math when I was thinking about I'm pretty sure he's made over $20 million just selling this coin I think on the Pod he said he sold tens of thousands of coins yeah and then if you do the math it's like whatever I think that you know 25 $20 a coin or something like that yeah I mean he told us and and and he's killing it um but what did you say here you said uh it's harder to be senica than it is sahill Bloom it's harder to be Aristotle than Alex Heros yeah so there's a bunch of Tailwinds with this business so first of all creating content is way more difficult than curating content and Distilling content and I want people to to know that because there's a ton of businesses that you can create where you don't need to come up with any original ideas you can just curate Amazing Ideas that other people will have hey you're talking to two of the guys that did that the the hustle did that milro did that exactly it's way easier to get your own podcast producer that to steal your podcast producer you know what I'm saying Al also my newsletter the five tweet Tuesday it's the highest rated newsletter I've ever made it's high open rate get the most feedback on it and it's also the easiest thing because I'm just curating five of the most interesting tweets versus try to create my own original blog post every Tuesday so yeah so yeah it is easier to be sah Bloom than Sedaka and it is easier to be Alex Orosi than uh Aristotle because they could just take other people's Concepts and curate it so this this daily fable idea has that Tailwind with it and it's got a few more Tailwinds to it one is that another one is that uh gen Z basically doesn't believe in God almost 50% of gen Z is either una affiliated with any religion or does not believe in God but they seek out uh it's just human nature to seek out uh some greater meaning and purpose in life so that's why they're filling their time with daily stoic and could fill their time with you know something like the daily Fable and this is what I call like the unbundling of religion what is this uh Pink pinks thing pinks so pinks uh someone I work with uh partner of mine Jordan he you know he's rolling around Austin and he sees this pink truck outside a house and outside this pink truck is these men you know with mustaches and mullets uh with these pink shirts tucked in you know he's thinking to himself is this a porno shoot like what is the what is going on over here and then he sees this logo pinks pinks window cleaning and he he finds out that it's a uh it's a new uh Window Cleaning Service based in Austin and it's actually a franchise business and if you go to their website thinks windows.com uh they they basically you know they've got this boring business window washing and they they they jazzed it up and they they even have like a merch store where they've apparently sold thousands and thousands of hats oh my god look I was at dinner the other night and barop is wearing this hat and look at it I go I think I even said I go what's this uh there something cool what is this I I know you're doing something cool what is this because he's part one of these guys that like he knows the Indie bands he knows the cool restaurant to eat at he knows cool and um and so he's like cuz I'm like why why else would he be wearing a window washing hat this makes no sense and he's like ah it's this brand called pinks they're really cool I'm like they're cool window washing how do you even know like compared to what like I couldn't tell you one window washing brand let alone the coolest one and he's like yeah I'm like so you bought the Hat he's like I bought the Hat style points baby and that was the that was the end of that story I went back home and I ordered a Pink's hat because I was like if it's cool then I will be the follower and and try to do it too so this is a part of a bigger Trend which is that I think this is kind of like the uh Dollar Shave Club ification of boring businesses so I think a a lot of people younger people are going to be buying some of these businesses you know Boomers are retiring you know the story there but I think what they're going to do is they're gon to make it feel like a an indie band you know you remember the dollar shaped Club video right it was funny yeah it it took something boring razor shaving Gillette and made it like super cool and fun and and that's what Pink's is is doing that's actually super smart cuz that actually kicked off like a huge wave of DDC Brands like Sam always jokes Sam what's your joke about DDC Brands how do how do you know a DDC brand when you see one well because they like uh it's always lowercase it's the same uh it's the same font it's uh they always use Millennial pink yeah exactly and so you so it kicked Dollar Shave Club kicked off this wave of DDC brands from Casper away luggage and then you know like just one after another and you know there's hundreds of them at this point um which was basically like take boring category uh do best-in-class like kind of branding around it put put a ton of money into the set or or creative effort into The Branding and then sell that kind of commodity product online and what you're saying is people are now going to do that for these these uh sweaty startup businesses so instead of doing the boring like if you go look at self storage or U-Haul like these are some of the worst looking Brands you'll ever see and maybe instead of the soft the the lowercase you know block letter font with the soft P you know the the that that Millennial pink maybe it's this like vintage retro Indie band uh look that's going to become the like the go-to thing for window washing trash Hall removal um you know HVAC all this stuff that is that what you're saying because I think that's actually kind of brilliant yeah I'm going to call my shot here and say that pinks is the beginning of this whole new generation over the next 5 to 10 years you're going to see pinks for x uh you're going to see pinks for uh Lawn Care Pest Control Car Wash catering pet grooming uh snow removal and I think it'll it doesn't necessarily need to be like Nostalgia plus design but it could also be just it's just in different interesting and unexpected so the guy it looks like the brand behind pink is called resi Brands it looks like they own three or four things they own one called garage up which is like making a garage look cool and clean then there's pinks then there's that one painter and then if you Google it you can find the guy who owns it is this guy named stepen Montgomery and he's young he's young with like sleeve tattoos he looks maybe 30 he looks like a kid uh it's pretty fascinating uh this is a really interesting find do you know what their revenue is for Ry Brands is it is it going well yeah so first of all he is young I think he graduated college like five or six years ago um resi brand started recently and within the last couple years and their painting brand that one painter is the fastest growing Painting Company in the United States so this is a model that's starting to work and if I'm like a PE fund like this is what I'm doing I'm basically acquiring boring businesses I'm hiring an agent see like laid checkout and I'm I'm building Brands not boring businesses he's like I'm joining Hampton then I check out find some Talent on Shephard exactly bada bing bada boom I'm there we uh I be I was I was uh I used to be close with Brian the guy who started 800 got junk and he was telling me all about franchises and so 1800 got Junk was its own thing he started it with just one trunk uh or one uh one truck and grew it and I think now he owns 100% of it it does like2 or $300 million in Revenue really valuable business but he was telling me that they took off when they did franchises franchises that's when they really started kicking ass but dealing and working with franchise owners he said or I don't know if he said it or a COO Cameron he was like it's very very very hard uh and I think it's sort of like the agency business where you're like oh looks so simple you just do this you do that but doing it every single day I think is a huge challenge it's almost like working in the restaurant industry you know your server won't show up because they're hung over or you got to deal with fights every once in a while I think it's I think it has a similar uh a similar type of headache you know what I mean it's probably hard to manage and and yeah I want to be clear on this pinks is actually now it started as one location in Austin and now they're you could franchise your own pinks like if you want to bring one to New York or wherever uh so they basically charge uh 2% marketing fee a 7% royalty fee and a franchise fee of at least $449,000 I think it's 49,000 to 100,000 uh and they actually share some of their revenue numbers so for their one of their Austin locations they've got seven employees they're doing 7 142,000 in revenue and they're making 36% profit on that to $268,000 so it's a pretty good business um and yeah you're right that it's a pain to to manage some of those employees but uh there's something here although I got to say the disclaimer uh we we don't know if this is a great business is not advice and also uh you know franchise uh like headquarters tend to share the numbers of like the best performing thing not like you know the average or the median um because we talked about a business that has a franchise I was like oh this is a cool idea I think this thing you know just looking at the traffic it look like it might have you know here a guess at one much it was making and then their franchise calendar got booked out like the meetings got booked out for like four months after the Pod came out so uh definitely uh can't say I I personally don't endorse this maybe Greg uh is but I personally do not this is not my first million sponsored okay so what I was gonna say on pinks is I went I didn't know anything about franchises until like any internet entrepreneur I didn't know anything about franchises until going down the Pink's rabbit hole and I I didn't realize that franchises for sure are regulated by a franchise board so that that's also just an interesting thing to know about if you want to do a franchise you have to go to these portals you have to apply there's only certain uh information that they can disclose so I found that quite interesting and then the other thing interesting thing um that got me thinking about pinks and franchises is I started thinking about like what is franchise model what does that look like for the internet so what is a franchise a franchise is basically uh a set of it's a business model and a box and a brand and a box and support in a box for an entrepreneur how could we bring that or is there an opportunity to bring that to the internet I had the same thought when you were talking earlier about your agency about how scaling agencies is hard and maybe I don't know why but franchising was on my mind and I was like I wonder why like if I was a like if I'm me and I have a big audience I have a large ability to create a brand and get customers the painful part is the operations what most people do is they partner with somebody they run the operations but they're going to run into the scaling headaches and bottlenecks along the way and I was like What if I franchised it meaning I could you could spin up you could become one of my operators or a partner in the business I'm going to hand you customers like automatically you don't have to know how to do internet marketing you don't have to build your own brand you just have to fulfill the demand that I generate and we kind of like let's just say it was uh I don't know design or web development or something I don't know I don't know what what category makes sense but like you could just have a three person team that's going to bang out high quality work and do as much work as you're able to generate but like we don't have to create a 100 person agency headquarters that's going to like have managers man managers and ensure the quality of work and then have to like increase prices because of we all these layers of management like maybe there's another way maybe there's a way to do it I don't know if that fully makes sense but it was a thought that came to mind earlier when you were talking about scaling Ines yeah maybe maybe what we're saying is the next generation of Creator Le agencies actually look more like franchises than they do what they are now right because nor normally a franchise the reason you franchise is because you can't geographically expand so like why does chipot why did chipot initially franchise out is because this concept works we can physically only launch so many locations ourselves with the capital we have and the like time we have we can't be in Alabama right now but there should be some chipotes in Alabama so they find a franchisee there with the internet you don't have the geography problem so that's why I think most internet companies never franchise however I do think that for things that are like service like um you know a service is rendered I think that's kind of similar in that you run into servicing bottle where I disagree with you on the geography thing is I think it's it's not that we don't have a geography problem on on the Internet it's just that geography is defined differently geography is defined in the real world like you know at the corner of 25th and 5th Avenue versus on the internet like you have an audience you have people coming into your store every day it's just a different definition of geography so I think that if someone could figure out and this is for the audience if someone could figure out and US honestly if we can figure out how we could take the benefits of uh a franchise model and figure out how we can uh you know the reason okay if you go to Chipotle in New York City or you go to Chipotle in San Francisco the burrito tastes the same the problem with the Creator like going back to Crea lead agencies is the the the the type of uh product is very different as those businesses are scaling uh unless the operators are you know have been doing this for many years so I think there's something here there's another version of this that is kind of on the internet uh are you guys familiar with EOS no okay so uh EOS is basically a operating system for an entrepreneur so basically we've all felt it you're a CEO you're running your business and you're making it up as you go so it's not not just like what's that analogy like oh we're building the plane as we're flying it it's like no we're literally like trying to figure out what is a like what what shape will fly while we're flying it and so um you're making up how to run your company but you don't need to there are best practices for how to run a company that will apply to like you know 80 90% of businesses and so what EOS did was this guy wrote this book I don't know the full backstory but this guy wrote a book called traction and in traction he's talking about how to run a like how he runs his business it's like oh we come up with our annual plan and we use this scorecard here's a scorecard template you can go download that for free and like it's basically it's like here's a a blueprint a model for how to run your company I've never used it I used it I know a lot of people use it and it's like you have rocks and like each person's responsible for three rocks and it's like this whole like strategic thing okay's some somewhat similar uh to it which is like a goal setting system um so e is actually like kind of a monstrous business from what I understand and the way they work is kind of through this franchise model so what they do is they have these implementers so EOS basically takes the lead and then they're like cool you're interested in implementing EOS and it's it's really expensive it's like like Sam when you did it what' you do it for Hampton or for hustle for the hustle I just read the book and then I just implemented it and I showed people how to do it I couldn't afford to do the normal thing but it's many tens of thousands of dollars for like a two work like 25 or 50k or something like that so it's a quite expensive uh for most people to like swallow that um or it's just like I don't know you have to have a lot of conviction that that's going to really help you you in order to pay this but these there are a bunch of people out there that are just simply EOS implementers they're not they're not like they're not part of the company but they are basically like these kind of freelance people that will do this I don't know the exact structure so I'm talking a little little you know off the off the top here so so I might get some things wrong here from what I understand you have traction which is the book that generates a lot of leads of people who are interested in implementing this they go to the website they say great I want to do this they book a call and then they either you sort of like you know buy the system or the system with the implementation fee or whatever and then they're paying a person who's like kind of their coach to help them implement this system and then whatever and I actually know a bunch of people that have done this I'm not you what I've noticed is it's kind of more beginning entrepreneurs it's like the best operators I know typically weren't the ones who were telling me they used EOS but that's just an observation I don't I don't know if that's if that's fair or not but it is quite heavy it's like a lot it's like a fullon system it's like a full revamp of how you what meetings do you run every week and how you do them and all this stuff I've had this craving to do a lightweight version of EOS cuz I have a system that works for me I've used it for like 15 years I've like fine-tuned it along the way and I'm like and every time I meet an entrepreneur and they have some bottleneck they're hitting I'm like okay well let's Trace down to the root cause of this like what's getting you into this pickle and usually it's that there's something in their process that's causing them to run into this issue and if you fix the process you'll fix the issue um and I don't know if it's a perfect process but like it's lightweight which I think is more for someone like me like I'm not going to go hire EOS and pay these guys you know $30,000 and spend six months revamping my company probably like I don't really want to do that but if there was a lightweight version I would do it and I think the the only thing that stops me from implementing that is I don't want to have a giant consulting company that I'm running to do that uh whereas if there was this franchise model and people could basically come train like come to my workshop seminar and do like a 4-we certification process to learn exactly how to do it and then they could go do it on their own and make their own money doing it that would be fun I I would do something like that I think that's how EOS works yeah and and I wouldn't be surprised if that thing makes like $30 million a year and like $15 million a year in profit um I the people who are into it they're obsessed with it um Greg what's this uh what's this this what's it called playing field I don't know how you found that that's fascinating because I go to the website and you can't even sign up so Nathan Barry from convert kit told me about this one um basically it's Tom Brady's manager uh he's got this newsletter it's the most expensive newsletter in the world you had my attention and now you have my interest so uh his company is called playing field and his newsletter is called the brief um it's invitation only I think there's a a maximum of about a thousand sub subscribers in order to get on the list you actually have to be an NFL owner or you have to be just like a really really badass top player um and this is like a part of a bigger Trend uh which I think is like luxury newsletters so or or even a bigger macro Chen which is you know there's all these uh Mega Ultra Luxury uh Rich experiences popping up for the top 1% be it like so house or private Disney tours or am that hotel that charges like 5K a month 5K 5K a night k a night 5K a night and you're seeing that in the market like reflected like Hermes has a bigger market cap than Nike you know so uh I think the same thing is happening with newsletters and I think there's an opportunity to uh basically do uh to what everyone is trying not to do what everyone is trying to do is build a newsletter to get to the hustle level or to get to milk Road level but what if you tried to do the complete opposite what if you created a newsletter for the top 1% that was very very Niche focused um and you just treated it like a nightclub my favorite my favorite quote is uh Andy Warhol I think he said Studio 54 is a dictatorship at the door but a democracy on the dance floor and I think there's a way to bring that student 54 mentality to building luxury newsletters in a bunch of different spaces how much do you think they charge for this I mean we got to buy an NFL team to find out so how much is how much in the Jets CA dude this this idea style points I mean wow this incredible what a what a hilarious and incredible idea that actually makes sense when you think about it there was a guy it was a big article in some uh some like you know Forbes or whatever and it was about this guy and he's got this like you know that Rya was like the dating app for like hot celebrities or whatever this guy created like the the r the Rya of like experiences or something oh I saw this is the guy who partner with Justin timberlink mirria I guess as this guy's specialty is getting like super VIP experiences that like one of a kind of experiences that you can't um you can't like you can't buy or you can't find anywhere else yeah basically Andrew wi Andrew Wilkinson told me about it if I remember correctly Andrew Wilkinson either went to the Grammys or the Oscars one of those like things he sent me this picture of him in a tuxedo at on the red carpet and I was like what the hell and he goes yeah I was part of this community or this service called I I forget what it was called but the guy started with Justin timberlink or something like that went through YC and it's about getting experiences that you can't normally get but you can buy your way into if you know the right people right right okay I'm going to read you some of the quotes from this uh this thing so here here's what it says it goes um you know somebody will call him and they'll say um like he could basically get you treated like you were an American Diplomat and like you needed to be like handled uh like he could do that for you and so he's like oh um you know you need this epic party in Mexico with private CHF just you just tell me what you need you don't have to worry about the rest it's going to happen and so what he'll do is he'll create like okay um you're not just going to the Beyonce concert you're going to get to go into the dressing room and you're going to get to hang out afterwards or she's going to call your kid on stage and get to sing with them like something that these like one of one style um style experiences so here's what it says mirror only accepts ultra high net worth uh people defined as people worth over 30 million this he says this isn't the 1% it's the 0.003% um you must be willing to spend an average of 1 million a year on lifestyle alone so um just on these experiences you're willing to spend a million bucks in order to get in um let me see if it has he's focusing on the needs of the top 10,000 people in the world and we're going to do for them what nobody else can do and so he's like he's like almost like a fixer like in uh you know uh the wolf fiction he's like he's like the wolf he's like the one you call in when you need you just need that special something yeah so that's that's for like physical experiences um but I think what you're starting to see also is this trend around uh apps and software newsletters uh as a status symbol what's another example of that Rya was a great example of that um but I think superhuman is another good example so superhuman is that email software that a lot of BCS use and it's kind of it's like 30 bucks a month or something it's kind it's kind of a flex that you you can say sent from super send from super human it's like Gmail is probably better than superhuman let's be real um but having sent from superhuman adds this like layer of oh I take my um I take my job really seriously like I'm a part of the 1% so I think there's an opportunity for people to not only create playing field for X but also super human for x and other software for X well like um the easiest one of this on the Internet Is nfts Right nfts were exactly this so um like just to your point of Hermes having a higher market cap than Nike well when you know when nfts were were out they were basically luxury art I forgot somebody said this thing uh you know art is just money you could hang on your wall I was like oh that's great uh well you know nfts were basically money you could hang on your profile and um that's why you know people would spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on an ape or a punk because it meant something and when these were happening uh my buddy Vall he told me he's like oh yeah these are velin Goods uh and I was like what's a velin good I never heard of that you guys know what this is no what's that word I don't even know what that word means Yeah so basically a VIN good is something where the demand increases as the price increases so uh most Goods they follow the the traditional Supply demand curve which is that as a price decreases the demand will increase for that item ablin good works the exact opposite way as the price decreases the demand also decreases this is why nft projects can get huge overnight because if the price runs up it puts that product in more demand but if the price starts to crash that nft value is crashing with the price the demand crashes with the with the price and so once you understand that there's a set of luxury goods like this then um it explains a whole class like you know the first time I heard about a Birkin bag I was like oh so it's got like an elevator inside what's the deal why is this so expensive why do people care it's like well they care because you can't buy it I'm like well you can't buy it why what do you mean why don't they sell it they should sell more of these and they're like no no no you you have to be you have to earn the right to buy the Birkin bag and it's like I had a cousin who flew to Paris to like go to the store to try to buy a Birkin bag and I'm like this you made a out of this and she's like yeah like I'm I've been working my way up I had to buy all these other luxury bags just to be invited to possibly buy a bur holy dude these bags are uh I'm looking at a used one on some website it's a quarter of a million and then there's other used ones for 30,000 so it's like the cheap end is $30,000 for these bags I think it's like 50k if you just buy it from the story is holy and you know and so it's it's a status symbol because even amongst luxury buyers you can't buy like you can buy all you can have all the money you want you can walk into Louis Vuitton you can buy everything you know what you can't buy a Birkin why because a Birkin is even elevated above that and I'm like wow there is no end to the status game that gets played uh when it comes to this stuff and it makes you think like you know remember when the iPhone came out and that guy made like the app that cost $1,000 and it was called the I'm rich app or something like that it was just it was like a red light or something would turn on and it that means you bought the I'm rich app for $1,000 it did nothing else besides that and it got so popular Apple then started to take it took it off the store because it was like this is not what we want but the fact that that worked tells you something about the psychology of people that they would they would do that to Signal you know their status man this is amazing I I've heard that word but I've never actually seen these bags this is wild to me um this is this is this is insane wow all right what do we want to do now we got to wrap up in a minute yeah give us one more one more Greg stripe Atlas for trademarks so we recently filed a trademark uh we bought the domain boring marketing.com and it's dope and the business started scaling and we're like oh we need a trademark uh here and I don't know if you guys have filed for trademarks but the process is insane it's it's a pain in the butt it's a pain in the butt it's actually quite expensive and you even have to finish your work on going on these like Craigs listy looking uh sites and it's pretty brutal well let's explain it what happens you typically what you do is you hire a lawyer so that's you know already start off on the wrong foot then they're like great can't just file this got to do a search first you want the light search for 300 bucks or you want the comprehensive search which might actually find the thing for $800 you're like I guess I'll do the search uh because because if you don't do the I'm like what if I don't do the search like well we could file it and you that'll cost you money but then you don't know if you get it or not I'm like cool for like how long like like a year maybe a year and a half I'm like but then I I have to operate my company right like so what happens if I don't get it like well you might need to change your company's name like all right I guess I'll do the search then they pay then you hire them for the search and then they're like great now we can file hey which class do you want to file in and you're like you're on USPTO this the Craigslist looking you're talking about and you're trying to figure out what the hell's going on and finally you file it and then nothing happens and then nothing ever happens basically like a year later you'll get a letter you got approv and then you're like was that even necessary and then you're like this is this is just a crazy process overall exactly so and then and then so it's it's it's very similar to uh what happened with strip Atlas so for those of those of people who don't know what stripe Atlas is it's 500 bucks and you can basically uh you know form a legal entity issue stock to founder is filing an 83b election which is super painful in the United States they basically took something that was really painful and expensive and made it easy and cheap and the smartest thing about that for stripe which is obviously a payments company is once you've set up all those things when you they basically send you a stripe link and stripe makes money when you sell stuff so you're all ready to go and it basically onboards you to stripe which is brilliant there's the same opportunity to do that for um trademarks so like the name I would use if I was doing this would be Mr trademark the slogan would be something like putting you out of your misery and I think that uh either something like this gets bought by a stripe so I think there's an opportunity there but I actually think that you probably would would try to hold out for something like that and allow yourself to on board to other different services and I think you can expand this Beyond just trademarks to patents as well um I have some thoughts on patents and trademarks like I don't know if patents and trademarks are just astrology for entrepreneurs um but you know because I I've I've actually I've had a I've you know I've been at companies where we've had patents for example stumble upon which was basically this uh they acquired my company and I was on the management team there I find out like one of the reasons I sold the business was because I was like these guys have the patent on like recommendation engine like which is mostly nonsense right dude it was like they were like we have the patent on this this alone is worth you know $500 a billion dollars because basically they had the patent on if you upb something or downb something and there's a recommendation engine at the core of it that is their patent AKA Tik Tok I I I think that's worked that's worked a couple times though on the internet uh I believe Reed Hoffman and Mark Marcus pink Mark or Marcus Pinkus the guy who started Zinga I think they had some I get his name wrong what's his name we're gonna go yeah Marcus p is Marcus pink whatever would be such an outrageous name I don't know he's he's an outrageous guy uh didn't he own didn't they own the patent that I believe if memory serves correct I believe they owned a p patent on the algorithm for social media and I think they sold it to Facebook or maybe even they gave it for to Facebook and exchange for shares did you guys not read that story no I don't know that story but when we bought the bio brand back we got these patents with it and they had a patent for the uh for the Whiteboard feature meaning like you could go on someone's profile page I don't know if you remember this like you could go on someone's profile page and doodle like just draw on a like a Microsoft Paint looking whiteboard there we had the patent for that and I was like cool but Facebook has that feat at the time Facebook had something called the wall that was the same thing like they had used to have that feature too and used to be able to and Myspace had graffiti and like it was the same feature and they were like yeah these don't mean anything and I was like nothing like is it patent like Ironclad they're like yeah just like not on the internet and uh that's been my experience with I don't know if that's actually true or not but it seems like trademarks kind of mean something because if you don't own your trademark and somebody does they can basically tell you you're you you can't keep operating under that name which is painful and when you sell a company they like to for you to have everything buttoned up like yes I'm Incorporated I've paid my taxes I have my trademarks I'm free and clear to be bought um but I don't think patents do anything on the internet what I understand well okay so in 20 yeah so uh Pinkus and Reed Hoffman they own this patent called the six degrees patent Facebook I believe bought it from them for $700,000 um but uh yeah it it there's an article called uh who owns Facebook's most important patent so apparently it was a thing cool Greg uh so you're going to come on next time are you gonna have goodwater decom or no you're a good you're a doio type of guy well Shan's fired sh's fired you're well you're what your agency now it's um there's two Wars happening right now and that was a hate crime you just committed calling him AIO guy all all I know is that just I'm wearing glasses and you know if that oh here we go it's uh s. just joined the chat what what's your uh where do where do people connect it's a it's a is it public school or checkout. Studio L checkout.

peptides those are getting federally banned peptides getting federally banned yeah most of the reason why peptides are getting banned is because they are hard to patent and so because of that there's conspiracy theorists like big Pharma doesn't like that so semaglutide which is OIC is a peptide but yeah I don't think that can get banned I think people will riot in the streets right now if OIC got banned

yeah you text me something you're like Sean you're you're 7even out of 10 funny you're 8 out of 10 charming and I was like this is a this is a sar compliment I think I'm getting [Music] here I'm back you know when Michael Jordan came back to the league he just faxed in a one-pager with just those words on it I'm back we have a lot in common him and I yeah unfortunately when he came back he was wearing number 45 and uh he kind of sucked that year and they got knocked out of the playoffs so I'm hoping you're coming back a little stronger us six seven black guys we have a lot in common you know what I'm saying me and me and MJ um did you miss me it felt like a long time for me I don't think it felt like a long time for you because you were pretty prolific you kind of had a couple hits I did so many podcasts in the last three weeks I definitely missed you because that was a lot of content uh I don't know why I did that I what I should have done in retrospect was say Okay Sam's out let's not force the issue when he comes back we'll come back strong instead I overcompensated when you were out and I was like no I am going to create all the content the world needs tonight and that's what I tried to do and also um we were working really hard ahead of time I mean I felt like I was recording a bunch ahead of time so you've been kind of grinding now for about 5 weeks now feels like yeah the funny thing is we thought you were going to be out this month so we have all these guest hosts planned for this month that your baby came early and so now we have like a full month of guests uh coming up now I can go away I can go away again but you did great I we'll we'll talk about some of the stuff I was doing but you were doing great so the Sarah uh Moore podcast was phenomenal that woman is a superstar you did a very good job of getting some good stuff out of her you also did a non-pod thing that I thought was some of your finest work the uh all-in podcast video or the all-in CEO application if you haven't seen it go to Shan's Twitter and you'll see it it got 1.1 million views I look this morning all right you [Applause] ready welcome welcome to my five minute job application to become CEO of the all-in podcast this is the American dream baby I have worked my ass off for years just so that one day I could get to work with such a group of successful intelligent billionaires and Jason calacanis that was very good and you did it all on your own you even edited it right yeah I didn't have an editor uh and it was one of those ideas that so okay I'll explain what it is so the all-in podcast which is a popular business podcast um is they were like oh we're hiring a CEO and it's the it's started by these four guys ver these Super Rich guys I the joke I make is the all-in Pod is billionaire talking about billionaire [ __ ] and our pod is millionaires talking about millionaire [ __ ] and so the they were like we're hiring a CEO to turn this into a real brand and whatever and so I um I was like you know be funny if I did like a joke application to this pod to to the for the job so I recorded this video problem is the video is good but uh I only wrote at the very end that this was a joke and like not meant to be taken seriously so people are texting my dad they're like hey I heard Sean's going to get the job for see you all in congratulations my dad's like what's all in what's a podcast and I'm like and you're insulting them the whole time the funny thing by the way I told him I go my dad texted me that and I go no no no it's just a joke and then he goes okay who started it he thinks like someone's like messing with me I started it but you were you were like you were ribbon on them I funny yeah it was so it's all fair because it was mostly funny stuff but you were giving them a hard time so that's pretty funny and then a couple of them replied and be like you've made it to the second round so I actually thought they handled it well did did they reach out to you at all no they handled it well uh they didn't reach out Beyond just like the public replies or whatever um and then they played it on the p on their they played the first five seconds or 10 seconds on their podcast and um unfortunately that made it even worse cuz that's that part is where it sounds like I'm serious about it and then I start roasting them but they cut off all the me roasting them and just put the part where it's hey I I'm applying for this job which is actually the best roast back that they could have done I I think our our friend messaged us and said uh one of the great things about or what did he say he said uh a really uh powerful tool is to be able to take the popular narrative and blunt force your way into the conversation and you did it perfectly you did a very good job talking about a newsjacking that I think Ryan holiday point that term or at least he popularized it which is you take the current thing but you find a way to attach yourself to it you sort of hijack the news newsjacking and uh it's not it wasn't my intent I just wanted to try something funny I so I've been I'll I'll tell you we do this podcast and I love this podcast but also I told you I'm not like I'm trying to not go start another company right which is all I've ever done for 15 16 years is go be like I'm a startup CEO I'm gonna start a company it's kind of my identity and I'm trying to shift that um and I'm having a lot of fun creating content but also it doesn't take that much time to produce this podcast like takes some time for sure but like when you're used to working I don't know 50 60 hours a week it do I couldn't put 50 60 hours a week into this and again the smart chill move would be to just take that energy and go be a better dad go do some community service and just just better myself as a whole but I'm a flawed human being and so I need to direct that 50 6 hours event energy into some creative work project um and so I was like I've been looking for way like other content I can create other content formats that are going to be fun one of them was this idea of doing like something that's a little bit funnier it's the thing I did was kind of like you ever seen Last Week Tonight or The Daily Show it's sort of like yeah I know that you've been loving Last Week Tonight I know you've been loving that style yeah so I would try to do that style um which by the way very nerve-wracking it's hard it's one thing to be doing a podcast and crack a joke in the flow of a conversation it's another to be like in this video I'm gonna be funny I'm gonna tell jokes and make you laugh and it's like wait is this like within 10 minutes I was like is this is any of this funny and I couldn't I couldn't figure it out bro I was like I was like I don't know if this is good or this is going to be a total [ __ ] lame thing to put out there and that was a nice feeling it it was good to feel the live again well here's the good news Twitter is not a very funny place so even an eight out of 10 can crush it yeah you text me something you're like Sean you're you're seven out of 10 funny you're eight out of 10 charming and I was like this is this is a sar compliment I think I'm getting here it was awesome I thought it was good our software is the worst have you heard of hub spot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better how's life as a dad so you created a baby you didn't really created you you played a small role in creating this baby um but the baby's here now life changed life the same what's the situation it changed um I think I talked to 30 friends you were one of them and I think the predominant answer was you love this is from a man you love your baby but you're not in love with your baby and I only heard about five of the 30 people say I was in love right away and the but predominantly people were saying um you know it's they're just like an alien at first and you don't really get feedback that wasn't the case with me man I I I was I was in right away I've always been what I always say with animals and children I'm softer than cream cheese I've always been soft with with those types of things and I was in right baby I I I loved it it was awesome we got a um first of all we did a C-section which is like magic um the doctor was like I'm starting now and literally I timed it four minutes later the baby was crying and out and then the doctor's like and now I'm putting your uterus back inside of you and like it's crazy man like that's a line you used to use uh right yeah yeah I was like Jake you owe me a Coke dock uh wait were you in the room you told me you were going to be in the room I was in the room and basically what they do is you know Mom is laying like One Direction and then they take the baby out and they bring her like 10 ft to the side of her and I I go and check on the baby and I was like don't look don't look don't look what was your angle like were they like but I still saw it I still saw it Sam you're like why you cleaning why you cleaning all the glasswar over there yeah I was like staring at my feet trying not to look and I I definitely looked it was pretty wild uh it was gory um another thing it it made me view women as Wizards um the fact that they could like have this being growing inside of them and then it like is out it's just like it gave me like almost a spiritual respect for my wife it was that that was pretty magical um it's almost like you view her as a partner and also as like a sex thing like you know like she SE she's sexualized to you after this I'm like you're a God like there is we you know what I mean like I can't imagine like you are not like just beautiful to me you are like this like spiritual being so like the immense amount of respect another thing that happened I remember thinking um the so the week I went in or the week we had the baby um I think the stock market was like dying or something I barely looked but I remember thinking like the volume of love that I had for this new baby was so loud that every other problem was just uh silent I just didn't care nearly as much and so that was like a pretty breathtaking thing to have did you experience that uh some of those things you just described so I would say uh the first six weeks after watching my wife uh give birth was like I was like um you know can I can I refill that for you um what do you need let's just sit down and talk about your needs for a little bit like how can I The Peasant pleb that I am compared to you just make your life 1 oun easier here and it lasted like only 6 weeks I got to say I went R back to my normal self after that but like for 6 weeks the the visceral feeling of watching that happen was uh it made me just be like okay I'm you're a miracle and I'm here to uh ease your life in any way that I can because you just did the hardest thing I've ever seen um like you know I don't know what a C-section is like but like you know my wife was doing all the and all that stuff and it's just like a primal experience no epidural all that crap and so after that I was definitely like you like you're saying just in awe and you see you know like a lot of people ask me when we got married they're like oh you're married now you know is how is life is it different with you guys I was like no we've been living together for three years like literally nothing changed and then but the time something did change was after the baby and not even because of the baby more how how I saw her just changed you know I like I saw her her perform you know an act of God and so that that was cool uh so definitely felt that didn't feel the instant attachment but um that's cool that you did did you do like skin to skin and all that was it like oh yeah is it like a pheromone thing like tell me is it like is it chemical or was it philosophical like did you did you think it or did it just like feel like where there just the the chemicals in your brain going off what was it I haven't worn a shirt in two weeks I basically just it for me it was that's not what they mean when they [Laughter] say yeah I went and bought a bunch of beers I've only been wearing beetles basically for easy access I did it just to keep the kid warm I mean I I do it just to keep her warm and it feels nice touching her skin it just like I just like touching her I just I men are a little bit different I've noticed I watch a video on Instagram it's like all I'm just like playing with her face and like just like rubbing her rubbing her cheeks and like rubbing her chest and rubbing her back I just like touching her it just makes me feel good good to touch her and uh I think it keeps her warm yeah we uh you also said something like it makes the other problems seem small uh that's definitely true right because Everything's Relative in life like you know isn't it crazy like I saw a video the other day on Tik Tok made me so sad it was this video it wasn't meant to be a sad video it was like you know these YouTubers that Vlog their life it was a guy vlogging his day except he was in Peru and they lived in a hut with like dirt floor and his two kids it was like he wakes up at 5:00 in the morning he does his morning routine which is he does push-ups he was basically doing like Andrew hubman but like you know the real [ __ ] you know like he's doing push-ups on the dirt floor he's outside in nature because his home is partially in nature and um his kids were these two small kids maybe like three and five years old and they were like just warming themselves up with like the hot water in the morning and then they were doing their school workor on the like cot that they were living on I'll play this video it like it it's sad and it's like heartwarming at the same time is a weird thing and especially you know like my daughter's the same age as the kid in the video and so like you just see the difference in quality of life and it's kind of stunning um and it's not the first time right like I lived in Indonesia my family's from India like I've seen poverty before but you every time you see it it's like you know just like re puts it back in the front of your brain rather than guy happy he was super happy and that's what I was or like he was happy he was as happy as I am and um I'm like you know this is like some obviously like college wisdom but like it really is just we acclimate to whatever our circumstances are and we have the sort of like a baseline normal but it is also uh everything is relative and so it's relative to your expectations it's relative to your neighbors and it's relative to what you know and what you felt and so for him you know whatever was happening that day would spike him up towards you know Peak Peak happiness and if something was went wrong it would go a little bit below and so like but the absolute the absolute should have been if you just look objectively if an alien was watching they would say certainly this person is at least 10 times happier on an absolute basis and it's like no not at all we're actually probably exactly the same and on an absolute basis um but one thing that does happen is if you have you know a a kid like your your quote unquote problems from before are no longer problems or like you know your kid has a runny nose and a cough and all of a sudden who cares what's happening and slack or what whatever else and I think that's one of the it's one of the many blessings that kids will give you the other which you haven't experienced yet probably is when you are talking like when a kid is little like maybe let's say a year and a half years old uh you're showing them things and you're like look like oh my God the water is dripping or like look at this I can take this eraser and I can erase the words it's gone it's magic and like in trying to make the kid like see the Magic in the everyday things like you obviously are also there for the ride and so you slow down and start to like even when you're kind of Faking It for the kid you are feeling the same wonder about all the little things that's like the other huge thing that kids I think do for you I'm excited for that another thing that I don't think people discust enough and I think it's probably because I hang out with a bunch of Peter Pans so like most of my friends are between 30 and 40 have like some type of financial success and just like go to Spain when they want are single pronounce yeah like a lot of my friends are like kind of selfish you know um not not that that's wrong but what wasn't discussed with me ahead of time was I feel like a [ __ ] man I feel so masculine having a kid like I feel like um I feel like it's the final piece of the puzzle and that I can continue putting the pieces together but I have all the pieces now I didn't realize how masculine it would make me feel I think um I read somewhere that someone defined masculinity as producing excess resources to make sure that your tribe has what they need and I was like I get it I and I I know I think the definition of masculinity is looking up and defining the word masculinity to like put put some words to this that's the most masculine thing I could think of hey I am what I am um and then uh I remember thinking how hormonal like I like I remember like uh like I two nights after or the first night home I remember I just heard someone walking outside or something just in the street and I just like bolted up and I and I and I was like ready to roll and then it's also crazy how the woman I was like and the doctor I'm like so when is she going to start making milk and like she didn't have it like two hours ago and they're like oh she's probably ready to roll like right now and I was like so you're telling me that you didn't have it and then like an hour later you do like and they're like yeah your body just knows and it was just mindboggling to me how Primal and animalistic we are yet we Tred to avoid that totally totally it's miraculous is that not crazy to you like like where I was like I was like you guys where's the threshold like does she have to like do push-ups what do we got to do to like get this flowing yeah is there a gummy we eat and they're like oh just give it a few hours so many of those like hang on hang on hang on hang on moments with the nurses and they were like yeah I was like like this happened also during the delivery I was like okay and they were like yeah you can like walk around like you you know you could deliver the baby standing up you could be on all fours you could I was like on all fours what are we talking about here they're like yeah actually it's an easier position less painful and I was like every movie or TV show there's only one position that they show they can't show they can't show but butthole on the camera so that's why well I'm in the like second phase of the like labor process and I'm having to hang on hold on no way no way moment and they're like dude it's first of all it's just not about you right now you need to learn that's actually rule one rule number two yes all of these things that you don't understand they're real and they happen yeah so that was crazy and then maybe I'll say the last thing I don't know how this has impacted your career but let's talk about money for a minute I have a feeling this is going to make me significantly better in my career because I think my hours will be more focused I also think that as she grows I'm going to want to show like uh consistency uh so like a normal 9 to-5 or um just to make an example of like look I uh I I'm here to provide I commit to what I say I I show up and and get through things um I think it's going to actually make me more successful even if I have less hours do you think that's going to be true I think it's true because you're telling yourself that yeah like uh you know my my grand theory of life is that our brain is basically a giant labeling machine and that the my view of the world is that these it's like a box is coming on the conveyor belt that's just things happening in life and then our brain puts the label on it and says this means this oh this guy Jo in front of me this means he's an [ __ ] and he cut me off off vers or like this means like something else completely I could just completely make up a different definition I could be focusing on the plants instead of that and so our brain is this labeling machine and it's that's what defines everything that happens in our life and I think that for you you're going to you're saying you know what this baby means in my life it means that now I'm going to be more mature I'm going to be wiser I'm going to be more focused I'm going to show her work ethic I'm going to want to um you know be less erratic I'm going to actually like Zen out or sort of chill out and and be a stable rock type figure so then you're going to do exactly that it's a self-fulfilling thing right like um so yeah I do think it will be that for you but I don't think it's because of the baby I think that's because you're putting a really strong empowering meaning on the baby you did this by the way we should talk about and I'm s start here about Sid your dog but I read your blog post and you said kind of a similar thing can you talk about that like you basically said like you were kind of in the F boy mode you get this dog so if you follow me on social media you know I've got this huge dog or I had this huge dog I've had him for 15 years almost and he was my best friend I love this animal and basically when he was three maybe or two years old I got a DUI and I spent 24 hours in jail and I came home and he went to the bathroom in the house and I was I was so upset I'm like oh my God this dog didn't know if I was going to come home what if I was there for 3 days this was miserable I got to get my [ __ ] together I have a responsibility and so that was a turning point was I was like I I have this responsibility I have to take care of him and it changed my life and I remember thinking like uh it felt good it felt good to care about something and some people I guess I could say this now that I have kids but people were insulted when I would say I was like yeah having a dog it's kind of like 5% of having a kid and people are like what how dare you and I'm like now that I have a kid I'm like yeah it was like 5% where like I I had a thing that I cared for it was the animal was obviously inherently probably less valuable but also uh like less work but I had this like inherent I care for you and I want to I want to make sure you have what you need and that definitely uh changed me for the better leading up to the baby being born I knew Sid was going to die soon I even wrote like a fake obituary for him before he died so I can like enjoy my last six months with him and we my wife and I were like we got to get them to we got to get them to the birth we got to do this I we need to just take this one picture and we need to just uh to complete the picture or I needed to of like going from like [ __ ] idiot [ __ ] boy to like a family man and I've got my act together I like I need you said something great you said uh dogs for guys in their early 20s are like a special thing specifically what do you mean dog in your early 20s because when men in the early 20s when you're 21 you have you're no longer a kid so you have more responsibility and you are uh you don't get a pass for doing dumb things but you're still a dumb person and oftentimes that means that you're going to grow and when you grow the friends that you have at 21 a lot of times aren't the same friends that you have at 31 but your dog in your 20s is the only one that has been there the whole time and they've been giving you loyalty and love unconditionally and so a man and the in the 20s that's a very special dog they see the transformation they see the transformation and they're the only ones I mean not all the people who you're friends with at 21 they knew College Sean and you're still friends with them maybe but they don't know what you've been doing lately and then your wife and your friends now they don't know what you were and there's really only one one thing they're there every day in your house and like you said unconditionally they don't judge you either but they it's a powerful thing the point of my blog post was like I never truly cared about like Legacy because I'm like the feeling that I'm going to have when I die is the feeling that I had before I was born which is nothing so why do I care and this dog died my my buddy Sid died and I remember thinking like I did so much to please you and that impacted me which maybe I've had a little bit of impact on some other people and it was really because of my love for you and and so it changed my perspective on Legacy and what's crazy is we were due like right about now uh November 1 and he died in October so we had him for 10 days after birth and I was like I kind of like it was a little spiritual where I'm like oh my God like the world work like how on how like whatever 15 years is however many days that is that many days plus 10 days is what I got right and so that was like a very meaningful impact for me I posted that blog post what's crazy to me is I felt like a [ __ ] sharing that because I used to make fun of people who like cared about their dogs as much and then I'm like oh I've totally become that if you ever I mean it might be too raw for you at the moment but there's a great um uh there's a guy who runs or like is a main host of Sports Center Scott Van Pelt and he did a tribute to his dog uh when his dog passed on air on Sports Center for like three minutes he just talked and uh you know definitely going to cry you know when you watch that and you know that feeling is uh I don't know anybody who has a dog that doesn't love their dog I don't know anybody who loves who loves her dog that wouldn't feel that way so you know it is completely reasonable it was the first time I've cried in probably 133 years and I was like oh my God like so it was pretty wild um but I'm happy it worked out and I have one bone to pick with you I wish you would have told me to have a kid sooner I wish you would have told me because you're you're have always been like Mr Cool Guy where you like you withhold a little bit of emotion where you don't want to express how wonderful it is and well maybe you just don't feel that way but I don't think that's true but IM like within days of having her I remember thinking there was no reason for me not to do this four years sooner because then I will have four years left because if I die at the same age I would have had four additional years I wish you would have told me to do it sooner uh I wish that that's one of my only regret and not a lot of people talk about that they always say oh wait you've got time man it's pretty awesome I wish I would have done it sooner yeah I I think uh my I I guess my personal advice would still be the same so kids are amazing awesome and so like so much fun um like you know the fun gets baked into your day you don't have to like go do anything like what you don't realize when you're in your like 20s or 30s or you're single or whatever is like to you have to basically Chase fun it's like I'm going to [ __ ] Coachella and then I'm going to this thing I'm going to go hang out over here and then we're gonna I'm going to learn this new skill and I'm going to do all these things you look at people with kids and you're like ah suckers trapped in jail with their kids and they don't realize is you basically took all of the dope Life Experiences you simplified them and you get to just have them in your house all the time and like that's actually what's happening to those people you think are trapped with their kids um but like the people in their kids you you don't want to be that obnoxious condescending person with kids it's just like like my brother-in-law said this once and he's like he's like you know the only real person that like we could talk real with each other and he's like um your life doesn't have any meaning till you have kids he's like that's just how I feel okay he's like I know I'm not supposed to say that I know that's I'm going to gay keep I'm going to gay keep from now on when people say stff like oh you don't know any better wait till you have kids you don't know he said that he said that not to me but he's like we were talking about somebody else he's like they just don't realize it and they're going to keep talking themselves into how you know blah like how their life is so awesome without kids he's like but my life he's talking for himself he's like you know I didn't have any meaning until this and now I have you know uh you know my cup is full uh the other thing I would say though is that the four years you're talking about like there it is a one-way door to use the Jeff Bezos decision-making framework once you have the kid you can't unave the kid really and So you you're going to like your freedoms have changed fundamentally from this point forward and so I think that the freedoms you have like you know that age 26 to 31 or whatever are pretty valuable you should have them while you're there um and then go walk through that oneway door and like you know now you have a different set of Joys but you do have a different set of a different degree of Freedom uh I think that's much more important and like you you know worrying about these like kind of My AG is 76 to 80 you know glad I had those four extra years I don't think you're I don't think life actually works like that I think you it's good you had the freedom to do all the things you did and become the person you became you know it it happened at the right time for you I think you settled down yeah um but it's been four years ago what were you doing you're living on Sixth Street in uh San Francisco you're stressed out I was learning the difference between meth crack and heroin and uh like the different ways that which you put it in your body walking around s you're having a dare class without the DARE officer in s San Francisco and uh you're stressed out building your company you're making $37,000 a year I don't think that was the right time to have the kid I think my advice was good to to say wait by the way I know that you well I I I understand this perspective of why people don't do it I totally get it a night nurse is a cheat code everyone keeps telling me so those who don't know a Night Nurse it's BAS basically this lady who is in this other room with the baby when the baby cries every 3 hours she goes and wakes up mom and says all right all right heer it's time to feed all right C like that's my my wife was basically a cow for three months and she's like hey uh whip the boob out you're you're good to go and I sleep in a separate room um and my sleep has been awesome women I I don't know if it's my wife but I feel like a lot of women they go through the the waking up every 3 hours and they still have a pretty good day the next day maybe they're running on adrenaline but uh for me uh I canot wake up every 3 hours and still be a functioning human being the next day you need a Night Nurse too I need a Night Nurse I want someone to swaddle me I would love to get swaddled dude I still sleep with my wife's pregnancy pillow because I'm like this is incredible this is the level of comfort that was available to me why is this only for pregnant women just as for non- pregant women my knees haven't touched in bed for like the last N9 months like dude knees should be touching when I send you that one pregnancy pillow the Swedish one somebody said this to me and I was like H Swedish pregnancy pillow who did can I just get one off Amazon and they're like brother just shut up and trust me and I did I ordered this thing it took like a week and a half to arrive and boy has it arrived in my life you know my my daughter's four now that's four years I've been sleeping with this pillow I bought two it's incredible hey I've been wearing nipple guards when I go running so like hey I'm all about all the different uh pregnancy stuff um but yeah it's been awesome um I'm going to try and not be that guy that posts all this stuff on social media but I might be you don't post your children do you well I don't I don't even use Instagram and stuff so I don't I don't really but is it a rule that you don't do it no no no I just you just have't gotten around do it I don't like to post that type of stuff uh I post like I'll tweet random thoughts or I'll do a podcast that's like what I like to put thoughts out there not necessarily like life pictures well I'm GNA try also not to be that guy but we'll see if uh we'll see if I can keep up with that all right well this is the uh the catchup episode we'll just go ahead and publish this even though it's totally different than normal episode uh it's us reconnecting rebonding um uh you know we needed a little skin to skin after was only that top bro let me put my cheek let me put my cheek to your chest man cheeks all right

I have a friend that paid $25,000 for help navigating the adoption process in Texas they paid a huge chunk of money just to help them figure out how to get higher on the list for adoption in Texas so if that exists there's got to be 32 different ways to do Consulting for adoption in this space somebody said this to me the other day she goes do you know how hard it is for a gay couple to adopt a baby and I said sure don't I have no idea how hard is it is it very hard she's like nearly impossible if anybody created a company that just helped male gay couple adopt babies usually gay male couples it's like one of the highest average household incomes and so I think if somebody just went and interviewed like 100 couples that were trying to adopt right now I bet you could find a $500 million to a billion dollar business out of 100 interviews of those couples I think like a level one business that would be probably profitable on like day 1 to 30 would be helping just on the Consulting aspect of that because you're right

all right what's up it's Sean and I'm going to start by reading you a tweet that I did a year ago it says I have a new hero and her name is Sarah Moore and the reason that Sarah Moore is my hero and somebody that you probably never heard of is because Sarah Moore was somebody who was a student in college that you know she's in her young 20s she has no money no experience uh the only thing she owned in her life was her car a Rav 4 and she hustled this crazy hustle story of how she basically decided I'm gonna buy a business even though I got nothing nothing to my name and she spends a year searching through 100,000 businesses and she finds this Niche business called eggcartons.com uh you literally this guy sells the carton that your eggs come in and she bought this million you know multi-million dollar business with all debt um so she put no money in because she didn't have any money and so and then she had grown it a bunch since then and I just said I think this is like a $2 million business that this woman bought and like wow what a hustler so I told this hustle story on the podcast and it kind of went viral it blew up nobody had ever heard about this story before she has done no interviews she has no social media she was like a ghost and I honestly I didn't even know if it was true because it's one of these stories that's too good to be true uh here's this girl who comes from absolutely nothing she talks about this in the interview like she literally had no parents she was in and out of jail as a kid like she was just trouble and then she has this turning point in her life that gave me goosebumps she ends up paying somebody to take the SAT so she gets into college she hustles her way through college uh finds a way to buy this business and it's this amazing success story and two things happened one the story kind of went viral she said that like Netflix and others reached out to her after the episode went live that people started showing up on her doorstep asking them asking her for advice on buying a business and like honestly it was kind of bad like it was too much and please don't do that again because she's like dude I'm trying to run a business I don't even know you you start telling my story and this went crazy and so a year later now she's like okay first I was kind of like wow this is crazy then I was kind of annoyed and scared like is this going to mess up my business but then as she started to see you know the upside of telling her story and she was like look I still have no social media I still do no interviews but you kind of you were very nice and you told my story I will agree to come on and do one interview and so she's like after this I'm one and done I'm going to come on and I'm going to lay it all out there I will tell you everything you want to know about buying a business how I did it what I did the good and the bad all the mistakes that I made uh I'll tell my kind of the life story part two that's the sort of you know made for TV it's it's unbelievable her life story along the way and she's like I'm doing one interview and then that's it I'm disappearing after that and she did not disappoint we just finished the recording uh it's one of my favorite episodes we've ever done she is somebody that I really admire and I don't use that term lightly like she is really a hustler super genuine and her story is um is frankly incredible like it's not often I have gooseb bumps during an episode of a podcast so enjoy this episode with Sarah [Music] Mo all right today's episode is going to be all about buying a business rather than starting a business we usually talk about ideas that you should use to start a business but as you know like U one of our best uh friends of the house Andrew Wilkinson has told us many times buying a business can be a better path but uh how the hell do you actually do it that is the question and we're going to talk to somebody who not only has done it not only has done it successfully but has really never told her story you Sarah Moore you are basically not on the internet welcome to the internet because I first heard your story and then I went Googling and I couldn't find anything you were a ghost uh intentional or unintentional very intentional I'm a very private person and I'm not a fan of public attention you kind of blew up my spot though so things have changed a bit yeah sorry about that so we a long time ago I don't know what it was hundreds of episodes ago um I came on the Pod and I said hey I got a story for you I said I would love to have this person on as a guest but you can't find them on the internet I said I think this is kind of an incredible story there's this woman who out of college um bought a most boring sounding business you could think of eggcartons.com and I called you like the queen of queen of carton or something like that and I was like she's the the queen of eggs and she buys this business that some guy had been running for like 20 years and um she's running it she's growing it and I was like the way she did it with no money down I was like her story sounds really interesting but again there's literally one like text interview of you on the whole internet so then I I did I emailed you and I said hey I'd love to have you come on I don't think I got a reply or something but then I sent you a Google doc and I said look I just have to know I got to I need answers to these questions just from my own personal curiosity I sent you a Google do I said just can you just fill this out and to my surprise you actually did and so when I came on the Pod and I told your story suddenly a bunch of people were were very interested in you giving you a lot of attention and uh correct me if I'm wrong sometimes in not the most nice nice way it wasn't all good is that right that's correct I've I've come across quite the cast of characters and why do you uh what do you think what do they say to you where where how are they finding you and what do they say to you some people beg me to talk to them for 15 minutes they'll offer someone specifically offered me $500 for five minutes of my time and it's crazy because I'm so irrelevant most days I'm out in s in Massachusetts so there's not much happening here I'm kind of under the radar so all of a sudden I've now gotten a ton of inquiries from people and a lot of people want specific information a lot of people are emailing to say hey I'm doing this exact thing how do you get financing or can I get your opinion on this business deal or I'm about to close how did you get a bank to actually do your deal without putting much or any money down right right well hopefully uh hopefully this podcast tells your story in a good way does not create even more uh people chasing you down because we're just going to tell all the answers right here so that people everybody leave Sarah alone after this yes I'm serious please do not contact my business you can email me or or really reach out to me on LinkedIn but please do not contact my business or show up there for that matter yeah yeah we've had a couple of those a few stragglers there's always a few stragglers unfortunately there's always a few stragglers uh it doesn't help that your story is kind of unique because you didn't come from money um and we're going to talk about that you didn't know how to do this it's not like you knew how to do this or you were an expert you were a total beginner when you started so that's appealing um your woman doing this I think that's more unique uh so there's like there's a whole bunch of like angles and then you did it in a kind of a niche that sounds kind of like you know like boring businesses have become sexy now and so you did it in a boring business and so I think there's a bunch of reasons people are excited but let's let's start at the start so okay let's just start with the high level what did you actually do you uh were in school and you decided I want to buy a business first tell us why did you decide that how did you even know that that was a path you could go down oh boy there's a lot of context here so But to answer your question in the simplest of of ways is I was between my first and second year business school and I was talking to somebody about what they wanted to do afterwards and they mentioned something called a search fund which is where you essentially can go out and buy some grungy business and become the CEO basically overnight without any money or experience that was very appealing to me you're like hey I fit that criteria no money no experience absolutely buiness is sign me up our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better and so you hear this idea and you're like what was your plan before that were you did you have another plan or like did this replace something or you just put it in in a vacant spot so okay we'll do a bit of Storytelling here yeah please when when I was in business school there was a guy I was working on a project with and he was incredibly responsive almost annoyingly responsive kind of one of those and I asked how are you so responsive all the time and he said Goldman and he's referring to Goldman Sachs and he said at Goldman saxs there was a rule of 15 minutes meaning you had to respond to whatever form they reached out to you in within 15 minutes 24 hours a day 7 days a week and I said okay so what if you're in the shower 15 minutes right what if you're running a marathon 15 minutes Christmas day 15 minutes and my favorite what if your wife is giving birth 15 [ __ ] minutes and I mean we laugh but my I worked my ass off to get into business to even graduate high school worked my ass off to be frank and I'm thinking you went to an Ivy League undergrad you're clearly off the chart intelligent you have this amazing network of people you come from money you have everything that I don't why would you choose to essentially sign up to be frank someone else's [ __ ] like I didn't say that to him but that was my thinking and so I had no idea what I wanted to do but up until then I was at HBS Harvard business school trying to fit in with all of these people and sort of find my footing and after that I'm thinking I don't want to be like these people I don't want to do this I don't want to be a consultant I don't want to be a banker this is so not me and if I'm going to be someone else's [ __ ] like that's just not an option for me right I'm only going to be one person's [ __ ] and that's my own yeah that's every entrepreneur ever there was a guy who um there's a guy who we went to college with he was our next door neighbor in our dorm great guy Sam soy and he went to work at UH same thing Goldman or one of these one of these Banks I don't even know what the hell that was that's just foreign world to me I don't know Sam's gone and he doesn't you know he's busy now he works 80 hours a week and he uh he read our blog we used to blog about how we were building our company and we'd be like yeah we woke up we did the we had these calls and we were pitching this guy and then we went for a hike because we lived in Boulder it's like we went for a hike in the middle of the day because that was awesome then we had an idea on the hike and we came back and did it it sounded so sexy in reality it was honestly pretty lame but you know it was like blogging was like social media it's like Instagram back then you make it look good and so Sam quits his job and he moves into our our bedroom or moves into our our living room lives on our couch and he's like I'm goingon to do this I'm like dude you were making six figures you're making zero figures here and he's like um and he he's like yeah but it's better we couldn't really understand the culture and then he sent an email and we were like hey Sam you said something in this email I've never heard before but you said hey can you get that to me ASAP or sooner and I was like what do you mean ASAP or sooner ASAP means as soon as possible and he's like a that's a banking thing it's ASAP or sooner I'm like what the [ __ ] is sooner than ASAP and I was like that's the mentality I was like I get it I get why you quit I get while you're out of there because asaper sooner is not a way to live not at all and it honestly blows my mind again given the pedigree of these people you would think you would shoot for the moon year you would want to have this freedom in your life but you're literally choosing a form of enslavement enslavement in my opinion right right right yeah anytime you know I think banking Consulting these are often brain drains the talent really talented people go there because it's sort of uh safe um and it's like a well respected path but if you think about how much how many more cool interesting things could be built or created if those same talented people went out and and and did more entrepreneurship but you know whatever to each their own so you hear that you're like all right I'm not going to do that and now you you hear this idea of buying a business okay but where do you start how do you even know how to start and we're going to go into your fullback story but like the kind of the high school how you even got to college which is a crazy story in itself we're going to get to there but first you hear this idea about buying a business okay Sarah now what what do you do great question so I to your point in the beginning I lacked the ability to evaluate businesses I had no experience doing that prior to business school I was in the steel industry and I thought if I could get a business I was pretty comfortable with the idea that I could run it probably if I tried hard enough but searching in itself I thought I need to have background in private Equity I have no idea what I'm doing and people will say you have a Harvard MBA but Harvard is very corporate they don't teach you how to look at a corporate or commercial window washing business and evaluate their financials to see if you want to buy it right they're looking at very complicated Financial models which these are not at all and so I thought I probably need to go the investor route because there are investors out there that will actually pay you to search I'm thinking that's incredible someone's going to pay me to look for this and then they're going to invest this is amazing look further into it and see that if you were to get an investor to back you they'll give you plenty of money you can live a cushy life you can do this in a fancy office you can whine and dine these sellers but you have to pay back one and and a half times that and so if they gave me to 50% increase so if they had given me 200k to search I'd have to pay back 300K so that in and of itself was absolutely ridiculous and so one of my friends actually sat me down and convinced me that if you it's similar to dating he said and if you get enough reps in you cannot not recognize a good business when you see one for whatever reason I figure I may as well just try and go out my own worst case scenario literally worst case I bring someone in Midway but why not at least give it a go on my own and see what happens right so what so what did you do you you decide to go on your own um how do you go about it what was your process okay so step one for me I'm not good with technology and I didn't have any money so Step One is I'm going to Leverage What I've got around me which is I'm now in a school with a bunch of smart people so I had one of my smart friends scrape one of the databases with all the private companies within an hour and a half of my apartment in Boston that's step one yeah you're like you're like my criteria is it's an hour and a half away tell me every private business in this area truly and the problem is with these databases people think oh you've got all this great information not really the we estimated just by looking at some financials we actually knew about that the database was accurate about 50% of the time accurate meaning the owner's name is correct the revenues correct the employee count all of those metrics because they're all self-reported right so who's actually going to give you accurate information knowing it could be public right and so we tried to pair down the list by Revenue but we did it by multiple of like 5x meaning let's say a business so for instance the business I'd worked for previously it said that business did a million dollar in Revenue the business is doing over $100 million in Revenue right it there's all this information but we tried to narrow it down somewhat anything over I think a 100,000 or I'm sorry $100 million we took off the list uh Revenue wise it was fair game yeah after that it was obvious things and when I say obvious I mean it you have to be sure so that would be a legal firm or an accounting firm or 7-Eleven other than that again fair game because my business was actually under farming so everything else you don't know it's it's self- selected the industry we kept the rest there so we were still up with a pretty massive list of companies and you told me by the way you said one of your things is like you think industry is overrated you think people over index on I'm looking in this space this is the niche this is the industry I'm looking in you don't believe in that and you didn't do that uh why do you think that's the case so initially here's why I I think that from experience initially I did what I think most people do what investors actually require you to to do you sit there and you have a thesis about the kind of industries that would be great businesses and usually those Industries have characteristics that make them stable which is what you're looking for when you're buying a business with a lot of debt and what I found is that the industries were absolutely irrelevant what matters is that you find a business that is established and has been consistently profitable for a number of years everything else garbage there are so many businesses in amazing Industries like let's talk Pest Control right great industry you've got people that have pested they're not going to say you know what not a great year for me this year I'm just going to let my house be infested like that's not really a thing right it almost gives you I think Industries a false sense of security because you think just cuz I'm in this Pest Control business I'm good when you're really not there's way more to it than that and so what I found is find a business that's established and consistently profitable for get the industry cuz people could say I'm in e-commerce right so that's that's a that's an unstable industry I worked in the steel industry you would think that's an absolute hell no business I used to work for it's a hell yeah it's great great business right but Industries would tell you otherwise gotcha so you didn't look top down at industry instead you were just like okay I have this you have this list you remove the obvious outliers businesses that are way too big for you to buy and now you have still an enormous list and here you are one person sitting on campus trying to sort through this um so what was your approach what' you do well I wasn't a oneman show here thank God or I wouldn't have made it I hired hella interns and I didn't mean for it to get as big as it did but initially I had five interns that worked for me and we actually did the industry approach we did the painstaking process of look each interned to give me 50 companies a week with they were they met my criteria these company you found email addresses for and then we contacted there were five you had five interns but you're a college student you're an intern what how did you get how does an intern have interns what what what happened here so I'm quite the pitch and truthfully here's what it is and I swear to you like I use what I learn searching every single day and my interns tell me this all the time we text each other about it all the time private Equity this is private equity and private Equity is an industry where they don't do free internships you're more of a liability waste of their time than the free internship so you're not going to get a free internship at a private Equity Firm you need to have actual skills you need to have Investment Banking skills probably before you're even at their front door and so this opportunity is hey you're going to get private Equity experience and I'm going to give you transparency into everything I'm huge on transparency so I created a conference line and I said I'm going to let every single person listen on these calls whenever they want so those were calls with all the owners Brokers accountants attorneys anyone from HBS anyone that I contacted my phone was basically tapped 247 if you're interested in finance this is very helpful actually I mean who wouldn't want to it's like you Sean sure people would would is weirdly enough want to listen in on your calls when you're talking business when you're doing business deals you would learn a lot I'm sure so that's a huge portion of it the learning Ben Graham told Warren Buffett Warren Buffett was he admired Benjamin Graham and he wanted to go work for him and he said I'll work for you for Warren Buffett says I'll work for you for free and Ben Graham goes your price is too high and um because it you're right it's the time the energy so for for for a lot of people they're not even they're going to say no to a free uh for to somebody who's willing to work for free because the time and energy it takes to train somebody and give them that access is too expensive um relative to the free labor but you smart you made it a different you were in the opposite position you're like I do need help I do need free labor and um you rebranded yourself as private equity which technically you were but absolutely private equity for sure it's like where's your office it's like it's in the cafeteria we sit at this table and that's my office um all right so works and these were other Harvard students or these are just people in the in the area No in fact I initially used the student job boards and they were actually the worst you get these cookie cutter students who think like everybody else they were basic the best interns I found came off Craigslist my one of my first interns who was with that initial batch of five he was with me from the entire duration of my search and he came off of Craigslist nice it's people that aren't just thinking like every other college student and by the way a lot of these weren't college students you told me something you were like you know initially we're going through this list of like 400,000 businesses that like you know were in the criteria and so even if you're doing 50 outreaches a day and we have 5 10 15 interns doing this the math ain't math it just doesn't work you can't get through this list so you Chang your approach what did you do absolutely so we realized our response rate is awful I no matter how customized you get you're reaching out to people most of which aren't looking to sell their business so it's a very low response rate so if it's already this bad we may as well just start and we're already filtering in the wrong way we made many mistakes the interns would have all these false positives false negatives we decide we're just going to light everybody and their mother up because if you look at email addresses they're all more or less the same you start to see a pattern if you're looking all day for an email address you see most emails are first name last initial at domain first initial last name at this it's the same for patterns so we created a big Excel file guessed the combinations and then ran them through something I think it was bulk email checker to see whether or not they were actually like real addresses and so you you get their contact info and now you're going to email all of them one generic email because you're like [ __ ] it my response R is bad anyways um if even if it gets cut in half but I can email five times more or 10 times more people oh yeah that's a good trade absolutely and what was interesting is you know we we had this huge list of people and we You' think oh well if somebody reaches back out to me how am I going to talk to them but you realize it's kind of the same conversations over and over so we would do this approach where it's like bombs away and I after we'd send out an email we'd be getting tons of phone calls from people and we had sent the emails out in such a way that it looked like it was done targeted like it looked like we specifically did our research it said hey I I'm looking for a business to buy and yours seems to perfectly fit the bill because it's within this Revenue a new Range it's been around for a really long time and it's been profitable for a number of years and the people that reached that responded and said actually no you idiot that's not true great now we know that perfect right yeah they filled out your survey essentially yeah they didn't but they didn't realize it they thought they were telling us off yeah and the best replies were the ones that were wow you really did your research here this is great they reach out to me they're telling me how much research I've done I have no idea who they are I've got the intern scrambling figuring out what area code is this who is this what could this possibly be as I'm pretending to have spent this time researching their business I have no clue right it's like being at a party and then somebody knows you but you don't remember where they're at so you have to say really generic things to uh to keep the keep it going while your brain is like searching searching like how do I know this person what is their name exactly exactly and so you uh what was your specific criteria did you have like a revenue Target or did you have like a e the Target that you were using initially I looked at businesses ideally between 4 million and 20 million in revenue and I wanted something at or above a million and a half in I okay but over time that changed again just like the industries you realize why does it need to be this way I realized so much of what I was doing was just based off of what I had heard over and over and so things got tweaked as I realized I didn't need to necessarily have that criteria I actually lowered my expect ations a lot and standards it worked out well I think and so you uh you lower you you widen your thing you're reach out to a bunch of people and one and one of them is this business uh EDG cartons uh that eggcartons.com so what stood out there and then tell the story about how you ended up buying that company okay so I send out that email which again looks like it's customized but it's not the owner sends back a very long email saying wow you really done your research I am so impressed and he starts outlining the specifics of what I said in the email you're right we have been around for a while we started in 2001 and this business has been to your point profitable ever since consistently we have an amazing reputation we have a very strong customer base and from there I said okay this has my interest because at first let me back up I'm getting this email and I'm thinking guys we're reaching out to Farms now because it looked like they were a farm Feed Store it really did and so I the first thing I always wanted to know was okay let's see the financials because if the numbers aren't there numbers meaning you have actually been as you allege consistently profitable for a number of years I'm not really interested right but they were there and so anytime you see that you know because it is a rare by the way I would say maybe 5% of the businesses we looked at were consistently profitable and established that few and so he had he met those parameters I'm immediately interested and so I started asking about the business and learning a little bit more like okay this is a commodity right and he says no it's not we actually have a lot of proprietary products we have some patents I don't sorry just explain explain what it is it's literally the carton that your eggs come in you you buy a dozen eggs they have to be packaged in something yes this guy was making the packaging he was manufacturing it or he was the middleman he was the middleman yeah I'll back up so I found out what they're basically doing is they're a Wholesale Distributor and they're buying storing and selling egg currents so I immediately think okay this is simple enough that an a person with average intelligence me can do this like I think I could sell an egg card I think I could buy one too that was essentially what it was the business of course though again there were proprietary products there were a couple things that made it much more desirable but at the end of the day we're buying and selling eight cartons right right and the website I went to it now which is like you know after you took over and it's so basic uh and we've talked about this on the thing the logo isn't even just the logo it's egg cards.com so you you have the Doom in the logo which is great and then under it attached to that in the same image is your 1 1800 number it's like you know call 188 uh 825 what whatever whatever and so this business is so simple and so old school looking but you weren't scared Away by that you actually you wanted that you didn't want some internet business you didn't want something that was like kind of new and Innovative is that right that's correct I think you have to play to your strengths here this is where you it's not so General you you can buy a business that suits your abilities mine were honestly kind of limited I'm not handy I'm not good with technology anything with engineering is over my head so I figured the simpler for me the better I didn't want to rely on anybody going in there for the first couple months to just learn the basics this was a business you could walk into and day one more or less get it and so you uh what happens you make them an offer you meet them for lunch how do you how do you actually get this deal done so for me I stopped going anywhere until we spoke about a tentative price range so I would always throw out a number very quickly cuz they were all kind of going between three to four times so I'd think okay if you're above the average business I've looked at this month you you're closer to four if you're below that you're closer to three maybe closer to two profits or Revenue Prof profits I immediately got down to that on the phone it was great you're in this range they didn't really understand terminology I wanted to keep it very simple so I'd say okay what's your income looking like what are you guys averaging each year and they'd say the numbers and so the I immediately was thinking you know this is this is worth three and a half times I always went a little bit up because I always knew there'd be more in the number to bring it down but you want to be a little optimistic but you're not ripping them off you're not being dishonest you're being in best case scenario it's probably around here right so I threw out a number and I go is your is your price anywhere within that range because a lot of people the combo ends because they think they're business is worth 10x and it's just not right so I give out the number and he goes okay yeah I think I can work somewhere within that range he had looked into selling his business previously so he was a lot more aware of what these small businesses are actually worth a lot of owners more realistic about his baby versus saying this is the best thing ever it's worth 20 times profit right the second thing for me was a sell's note that was a non-negotiable for me that because a sell's note to me was a substitute for getting equity and I didn't want to get any investors involved so the next step was okay are you willing to do a sellers note and I I phrased it a different way to make sure he understood it but he actually did and he was willing to do that and so then I said okay let's talk now just to Define num what what a seller's note is so Define what is a sell's note for anybody who doesn't know Absolutely I'll use an example let's say you're buying a house for a million dollars rather than giving the seller a million dollars up front this let's say you have a 25% sellers note you would give that seller at close $750,000 and then they would get paid the remaining $250,000 over time and whatever you define those terms at whatever interest rate you decide on and time Horizon yeah the seller becomes the bank they're sort of financing you to be able to purchase the rest of the business exactly and it was also great because the argument there is because some sellers didn't want to do it and the argument is well you're telling me how great your business is you're telling me that it's simple enough for me to operate if those things are true why would you have an issue doing a seller's note right right this thing stable right exactly and uh my friend I helped my friend just buy a business actually kind of similar to yours uh recently and he did a good thing which was in the sellers note he said look here's the purchase price here's the sellers note but if eida was to drop way below where it is today because you know I find some skeletons in the closet or this thing turns out to have been built on some quicksand then we're going to forgive the rest of that seller's note right and then he was able to structure it accordingly so so it's it's a good mechanism for for any buyer um that's doing it I I I I don't did you do that or did you just do a sellers note as is I did it as is there's something called an earnout which is similar to what you're saying and it's based on the performance of the business and you choose am I going to do it on revenue or profits for me I tried to keep this extremely simple because the devil really is in the details here and these sellers a lot of them don't even have high school degrees but they're very good at business they've been very successful so I'm trying to do a deal here where these terms are extremely straightforward and when you start doing terms like that the seller freaks out because then it's wait I may not get this money I don't even know you all of a sudden he skeptical of you so I'm not a big fan of those yeah that that was your other thing one one of your points of view was like you know industry is overrated I like that point why you know because you're really looking for just actually just this rare beautiful business that's stable and profitable um and you shouldn't like use industry filters for that necessarily um have have the thesis and walk in as this genius who has a thesis up front H you know be open-minded at at the start and then the second part is you were like I try not to use any jargon like no B even though you were at business school you weren't saying iida you would say how much money are you making or income uh you know you were not trying or even in the structure you were not trying to get super fancy in the structure because if you don't understand it they're not going to understand it essentially right yes and that's the biggest mistake too because people think well I don't have a Harvard MBA or I don't know any of this I honestly think ignorance truly is bliss here because the less you know it's kind of better CU you can keep things extremely simple for the seller and I think that breeds trust and so you uh buy this business how much cash did you put into the business to buy it you don't need to put any cash down and I didn't have to because of the sellers note so I did a 25% sellers note and a 75% bank note and the idea there was when shopping around for a bank to do the deal it was all about and it took me you know 20 plus Banks to figure this out it was all about how did they view the sellers no banks that viewed that sellers no which very few did as Equity I could I could work with the ones that didn't not so much because if they viewed it as Equity it's like well you're okay there's 25% Equity we'll loan you the other 75% exactly exactly and how' you get them to think that that was Equity because it's not it's kind of not Equity honestly I wish I could have some like really Savvy answer here but it to be frank and I'm not trying to to say this about all banks but most Bankers have no idea what they're doing or what they're talking about truly I had to learn this the hard way they think they can Finance the deal they have no idea how to finance the deal they have no idea what these structures look what the details are of these structures so a lot of it I'm sorry it's just ignorance of them and their board right said here's the purchase price and then here's how much we need from the bank and then they're like oh rest is equity um and they didn't call it Equity they knew it was debt they called it but the way they reviewed it like when they're looking at their ratios for these these Banks they have all these rules it was whatever internal rules they were using to evaluate the debt ratio and and one big thing is this the bank had priority over everyone else right so the bank was going to be paid before this sellers know and the business had many many years of a track record of profitability yes that's why that that is so important you have to have they're really banking on that business's track record and then a little bit with you it's a question of okay it's done well for 20 years what could you do to make it not do so well right right and so you um you buy this thing you told me you go the only asset I had at the time I had no money no experience no whatever I only owned my my my car I had a Rav 4 and that's literally like all I had to my name and you were able to buy a multi-million dollar business and then walk in and be the owner of it just by really hustle and a kind of a numbers game so we didn't even talk about some of the hustle of this so some of the hustle of this was scraping the database some of the hustle was getting people off Craigslist to be interns to sift through the database then it was well those interns need a place to work so you got fake IDs to get them into the library is that right like tell the fake ID story absolutely we hustled for those IDs too we hustled for those that was hard work you said you uh what was it you like went to alumni you like you're like looking at the intern and you're like all right which Alum looks like this intern and then I'll ask them for their student ID hours of that truly hours we shot to hundreds and hundreds of people hundreds and so you've got these inter then you realize hey we need to just be blasting this kind of like fake it till you make it email where it looks like we've researched them specifically and they'll sort of self- Select you end up doing this deal where you don't put any money down because you were able to shop 40 Banks or something like that to get them to to give you the financing for it a lot of this to me the story here is like um not counting yourself out because a lot of people Al somewhere along that way would have counted themselves out I don't know how to do this you know uh this is uncertain I don't have the money I don't have the experience I don't have the time they would find a way to count themselves out you didn't do that uh figure out a way to get it done so like you know don't all the rules are sort of imaginary you can you could sort of work around them and the last one is it's just a numbers game like you said it's like it's like dating we're just going to need to look at a lot of businesses we're going to need to get a bunch of interns to find the good ones we're going to look at a bunch of businesses to find the good ones we're going to talk to a bunch of banks to find the one that will do this deal is that accurate because that's what I'm hearing yes if there are two things I'm very passionate about in this world it's obviously a currens but also it's this concept of spreading the good news which is that anyone who wants to buy and I really mean anyone who wants to buy and operate a small business can do so it is not a matter of can or can't it's a matter of will or won't that's a fact because this is an industry where you can choose any type of business you want any size business you want you could be a cleaner looking to buy another really small cleaning business from a guy or gal that's looking to retire you can buy a dog Walking Company there is truly No Limit here and that's what I love about it because to me it's one of the few areas left of the American dream where you can go out and just put in a ton of effort and elbow grease and make something of your life and actually make good money without killing yourself and not having to work you know three jobs right and so you since you took over the business you don't have to share the exact numbers but let's just say if the business was making $100 before um in the years since you've bought the business what have you been able to do like how have you grown the B how much have you grown the business and how what' you do to actually grow the business because a guy had been operating for whatever 15 16 17 years something like that you come in as a beginner but you've been able to grow the business so I want to know kind of roughly like how much value were you able to create how many multiples of what you bought for and then also um what did you do what what were the new insights or techniques or or operational things that you put in place to create that value great questions here so when I first bought the business the first couple years things may have been on the decline a little bit I may have made quite a few mistakes and so it wasn't looking too too promising you're not getting invited on podcast for that story at that time Sarah you bought a business and you are driving it straight into the ground how does it feel tell us for what what's secret yeah I probably would have been fired or kicked off as CEO but what happened was so when I first bought this business I'm just going to back up really fast I really thought I'm in the egg industry so I'm looking what's the duck egg market like what's the chicken egg Market you know these things and realiz again Market's kind of BS it's all a bunch of crap these Frameworks and stuff because you don't really really know until you're in it and I realized when I got in it I'm not really in the egg industry I'm in specialty packaging and so it actually was a lot more of an opportunity than I ever realized and I wasn't some genius figuring this out I just looked at our order history we were getting orders from people that were selling crickets and du buy roaches and people that were using the egg cartons for um small parts people that were using them for bath bombs cupcakes I estimate now that 40% of our Revenue has nothing to do with eggs and so when I realized that there was a lot of potential there and I realized that our specialty was really also these proprietary products I spent most of my time focusing on that not this really amazing modern website but focusing on these products that I call really sticky kind of a silly jargon term year but these products were we're making a custom mold for a customer that they then are going to keep buying from us assuming we don't rip them off or totally botch it right and so from that and then Co coid was like cheating because we five Sixx during Co to answer your question on the numbers we really blew up so it was a combination of recognizing how big our Market really was and then recognizing that coid was an incredible opportunity for us to take all of our capabilities and run with it right I like that and when you when you talked about uh specialty packaging you you said something to me you go in that Google doc you go we're not we're not about egg cartons anything that needs sep what is it separation and prot what did you call it separation and protection prot I always say anything requiring protection and separation is fair game and I stand by that 100% it's true anything and you think about how massive that market is it's enormous right yeah you could be making bras with that definition I love it this is this could be anything this is we're talking cups we're talking what whatever you want so you um truly and so are you like reaching out by the way because like you your website is still eggcartons.com and I'm not trying to Sean Parker you like drop the eggs just carton.com that's the way to go here if you're making 40% off of non-egg stuff why don't you kind of Rebrand it so it's funny we are actually in the process of doing a little bit of that and I've continued to buy a bunch of domain names so things like machine shop trays or bath bomb cartons any variations of that I'm just buying domains left to right who knows whether they'll stick but that's that's a huge portion of it but it's very challenging to figure out how to do that without compromising other important variables other important Revenue drivers it's a lot more challenging than you'd think but we are tierpoint looking into that I'm always like stop with the eggs and everyone of the companies like we sell egg carts it's taken me years to really get people to understand this is bigger than eggs we're not abandoning the Farms we're not abandoning the chickens you guys it's just way bigger than that so like stop talking about the chickens and the Ducks and whatever the geese I'm so jealous of you cuz I feel like if I ran an egg carton company I could fulfill my dream of being Michael Scott at Thunder Mifflin and like just come into the warehouse I just imagine that this is like a Dunder Mifflin style business and you could come in and like you know um you know just have be the crazy boss every day do you when you look back now at what you did because again we talked about starting as a rookie if you could go back and I gave you an hour that you could uh spend with you know younger you either during the search process or during the early days of of the business what would what would you if I could give you that time when would you go back to what would you tell yourself as advice um with the wisdom and the the benefit of hindsight so I would actually just borrow the advice I got from my mentor but I'd actually follow it which there were two pieces it was higher and Fire fast didn't do that huge mistake and do not change anything big or really anything at all the first year both of those things cost me a lot what about that that second one tell me more about that so it's obviously a Temptation you come in you're so excited you've been searching you've been searching You' searching you finally find the thing you close the deal after painful you know you don't know it will it go through will go through it finally closes and now the keys are yours it's got to be tempting to go play with the toys um what what's the what's the wrong way to do that what's the right way to do that yeah so let's get into that actually when I come in I'm thinking okay I knew I didn't know much truly I didn't think I was going to reorganize the warehouse or start changing anything seemingly big but there were things that I thought were really simple like the phones we had hardwired phones in our office and there were cables everywhere because we've got all these offices and conference rooms I'm thinking dude this is like 20 whatever like warm lless in 2020 here what are we doing with this we should just change our phones to Vo phon so that I can see everything remotely where there's not phones ringing let's get you know into the Modern Age here seems like not a big thing no that was one of the biggest mistakes I made because you called and our phone number is actually extremely important people look at the Domain that's great but our number is used by our biggest customers by the the new customers it's everything to us and we actually have multiple phone numbers that that one800 number is forwarded to like 10 12 lines and so it's very important and Spectrum may have lost our phone lines mid porting and so our phones were down for almost a week and it was a huge deal because it was a new owner and people are thinking did they go out of business right what is going on here cuz you're not the phones are gone they're dead now and it was a huge so it's like maybe just do a first off I wouldn't do anything with the phone lines now I'm I'm to this day I will not change our phone lines because I've been so traumatized by the experience but if if you were maybe you just like change one phone line maybe two maybe not all of them but something like that that you think is small can actually be pretty big I like that and you you said like we kind of hinted at this earlier but uh I want to make this point which is I've uh you know I said one thing you didn't do is you didn't count yourself out and that's important I think one of the reasons people count themselves out almost subconsciously is that they um they don't see the themselves a certain way they've never done that their family didn't do this and so they just sort of are like I don't know I guess that's just something other people do and that's even if you hear something you're like that that sounds like a cool idea but like where where would I start I have no I have no foothold here to do that and you have a pretty unique background that I think should you know debunk that idea of of of kind of like even if you're not from that track you can sort of get on that track at any time and so uh when I first was talking to you I was like wow this is some whip smart you know Harvard per it's like basically you take the Harvard pedigree but then she added some some Street Smart some hustle and I thought that's what I thought when I met you and then you were like you said something like you're like I didn't even take the SATs and I was like wait how'd you get into Harvard Business School tell the story of your background because I think it's kind of amazing okay yeah this is a little detail here so we're going to go way back um I'm one of three and my my sisters and I would say sort of had a subpar upbringing in that we didn't really have parents and we were split up and we bounced around and living in a lot of different homes my two older sisters they made the most of it they got really into academics and sports I made the worst of it I would say and I became somebody that you would not want your kids hanging out with okay I was partying all the time I had a I would go to school so I had a truancy officer I went to jail I I was just so disrespectful to everyone and I got away with it because people felt sorry for me and the beginning of high school I was living with a woman that was an alcoholic and her favorite thing when she got drunk was to take all my items and throw them out into the front lawn and just tell me to leave and I didn't really have anywhere to go I was a kid and so there was a woman named Natalie Bracken who used to pick me up and take me to her house and she'd let me stay there until this woman inevitably you know came back to Earth and said where did you go and called the police and so it was constantly going back and forth between Natalie's the bracken's house and this other household I was being transported by the police and no one could really do anything about it nobody seemed to really care and one day just she just got so fed up and she said I'm going to adopt you obviously it was pretty informational so I'm living in her home with with her family and her daughter I was actually friends with so her husband one day kind of let me have it because I was trying to skip school like the first week living there and he sat me down and he he literally explained and it sounds it's embarrassing almost to say that he literally explained how life worked to me the basics of you don't lie you don't just skip things when you don't want to show up that's not how this isn't reality and he explained where my life was going which was basically absolutely nowhere and it was very emotional for me because up until that time a lot of people had given me lectures but it felt like it came from this place of you're bothering me or this is really inconveniencing me so can you just stop your crap where he came from this place I could tell he really cared and up until then I didn't really feel like anybody did care and so I got my [ __ ] together very quickly after that I really did I was so nervous about like being like sent back or them regretting their decision because up until that time no one and I mean no one was looking to invest in me I was like a junk bond investment wise this is not a safe investment I was not a good kid I didn't do myself any favors and so after that and getting my [ __ ] together step one was getting a job and so the first time I ever remember studying truly in my life was with Mrs Bracken when I was learning a menu to get a job at a diner and then from there I applied those new study skills I had to school Mr Breet had explained like listen you've got a 2.0 here kid you're not getting anywhere but Community College with that so you need to like G act together and so from there I got all A's because I wanted to boost my average at least to a 3.0 I'm working at this Diner and this couple would come in all the time and they never had kids and we just got not along that's the best way to explain it I never told them about my upbringing really initially I think my co-workers probably did there were days I probably weren't there and they probably could just tell and so they offered me a job at their company probably initially out of sympathy out of the kindness of their heart and I started working there and it just it just seemed to fit and so when I was working there I got weight listed from North Eastern where I ended up going to college and when I was weight listed did the owner of the so these two I'm sorry backing up this couple I had no idea they were extremely wealthy I always thought rich people were at fancy restaurants but this couple's coming in going to a diner getting cheeseburgers each week I had no idea like they're worth a lot of money and when I was weight listed Steve said you need to take yourself off of financial aid because of these schools especially a school like nor Eastern without a big endowment they're going to take that into consideration when evaluating your candidacy and I said how am I going to take myself up eight I have no money and this school is so expensive and he said we're going to pay for your school wow and so yeah I mean it's I it's very it's hard for me to not an emotional talking about because it's so between these two couples I mean they changed my entire life um they it wasn't just the money too it wasn't just the home it was these people changed the way I viewed myself they invested me when I was truly the world's worst investment I mean who takes a kid like me what I was like and say you know what I'm going to go all in on this like they put their ass out in the line for me on multiple occasions with the worst track record record you can possibly imagine like truly possibly imagine and from these two these two families I had this whole concept in my head of I just want to be that one person for one person because for me I literally begged when I was a kid sometimes for people to help me I would beg judges I would beg attorneys I would beg social workers to like put me in better circumstances or help me with X and Y nobody helped me at all they felt sorry for me but nobody took action so this concept of being that one person for one person carried over into college because I went to North Eastern to be a social worker initially and that was way too kumbi off for me as you can probably tell I'm not like that's just not me and so from there I said okay something a little bit more aggressive more me could be law I was watching CSI what I thought of law so I figur I'm going to be in Juvenile Justice I I can be I I can be the attorney I wanted to have I can be the social worker I want to have but again it was I just realized these professions were just not me so one day I called Steve the owner of this company I worked for I call him boss and I said hey boss like I don't know what I'm going to do here I'm now a junior in college and I've worked for you but that's kind of my only work experience and I have no I have no experience in anything but criminal justice now and social work and I don't want to do these professions and he said you are not an academic you're you are Geared for business It comes naturally to you and he said and you can have a way bigger impact in business than like criminal justice or social work and so I said okay well what am I going to do now though because I'm in my junior year and I don't have anything to show for this I can't just go and get a I can't just go into a business who's going to want me and he said you need to go to business school cuz he had gone I didn't even know it he had gone to Stanford Business School back in the day they went right after school but now the average age of business school candidates at least at the Ivy Leagues like Harvard is 28 and when we were talking about this I was like 21 I was about to graduate and um I said there's no way I'm going to get into a business school he didn't know I had paid my sister to take my SAT from me because I had confidence I can study hard enough but I'm not going to get caught up enough I don't even know what's on the SAT I imagine it's all the subjects but I just had no confidence in myself like when I got to college I was at a 33% reading level what does that mean I I went off campus one day and like I like it was horrible so I went off campus one day because I was convinced this is horrible I was really convinced I was mentally handicapped when I got to college because I just did not understand anything and I got this test done and they said there's really nothing nothing wrong with you're just like at a low level here and they did say my intelligence was below average at that time and so it was it was horrible because it was a factual evidence hey you're not that bright and by the way you're you're at the 33 percentile like oh that's [ __ ] great like it it basically put into P onto paper that I'm an idiot and it was heartbreaking for me but I was so embarrassed and I didn't want anyone to know and so the only thing I really knew at that point was to just try really hard and again I didn't want to disappoint like my biggest fear to this day would be to disappoint the brackens or the greens like ever and I just I figure if they've gotten me here I have to make this work and so I I studied like you wouldn't believe like nobody knows the nor Eastern University Library like I do so I studied my ass off and I my biggest fear was even getting a be can I question about that that part um I've met a couple people in my life who have had that sort of like I come to Jesus moment or that but but I call it like the conversation with yourself it's like there's a day where you have a conversation with yourself like look it's this is either going to go one of two ways either this is what it is and it'll just be what it's going to be or like I'm going to change it I and I always ask them because I I I think these Mo there's a few moments in your life where like decades are are sort of decided and it's some conversation you have with yourself this is my theory I don't know you tell me was there a conversation you had with yourself at that time to be like okay I'm just going to apply I'm going to go in bury myself in this Library until I come out with the 99% reading level or what what happened there I've never been one of those like long-term planners it was for me it's more of a day-by-day week by week thing but I did have this mentality I remember of I'm going to give this literally everything that I have everything that I have like every day I really mean that because I will I had a mentality of I will not disappoint these people I will not disappoint them so if that means I studied Round the Clock and it still wasn't good enough at least I can say I gave this literally everything and I'm sorry that was kind of my thinking that was it a lot of people think that it's you know the hardest thing is when nobody believes in you actually the most pressure is when almost nobody believes in you but a couple people do and when a couple people do it adds a whole different level of emotional pressure to the situation more so than when nobody believes in you yes it's funny I it's rare to I don't never me actually anybody that gets that but that's exactly how I felt I wanted to live I felt like what they believed in me wasn't true and so I wanted to live up to who they thought I was that who I didn't think I was that's I mean I didn't come from the situation you came from I was luckier than that uh it just to be born into the right sort of family and circumstances but um yeah the the Birch family here in San Francisco they're the ones who were that for me where you know I'm 24 years old and they they invested in me and they they sat they literally sat me down and said I think you're going to do special things they go we've met a lot of people in Sila Valley I think you're going to do special things you're going to go on to do special things we want you to do them you know we just think then they Nam me CEO of the company they like here's the keys we think you should do them here you're going to do them at some point and at that time I didn't really view myself as special in any way um it was kind of the first time that somebody had ever really said something like that but also put their money where their mouth was that wasn't maybe my parent where my parent it's like ah uh in a way you sort of take that for granted unfortunately and so I took that for granted when my parents would say oh you're so great it's like yeah just like every mom you know thinks their kids so great you know that's how I felt at the time um and hearing a total Outsider you know this billionaire say no no no I believe in you and then and then for me soul crushing the next six years I like didn't succeed but I was trying really hard but I wasn't succeeding and I remember feeling that pressure of like did I was I remember think like I wish nobody believed in me that would be easier um than somebody really believing you and you not wanting to disappoint them um that was I remember just feeling that day by day so I I definitely at least resonate with that part of your story yeah no that's that's really that's that's very real it's funny a lot of people will say oh I didn't have it as bad as you but it's all I learned a lot of the same and you adapt to what you're going through so I'm sure the feelings in a lot of ways were actually almost the same but the externals just looked a little bit differently yeah yeah your life is a movie um and my life is uh you know like you know the the normal thing but like your life is literally I told you this on the phone your life is literally the plot of the movie blinds side like you're just not this like huge football player instead you you know you're you went and bought a business instead but like same sort of idea where people you know took a took a chance on you have you uh taken that mentality of like be one person what was it be one person for one be that person for one person um be that one person for one person I love that that's kind of amaz is that from something or did you invent that it just I kept it just came to me I don't know I it was just something I thought of one day have you done that do you feel like you've been able to do that do I feel like I've been able to do that that I do actually and that's truly one of the most rewarding things about my job now and why I try and keep my circle very small I'm really big on doing what these families did for me as much as possible which is a lot of one-on-one mentorship because I can only do so much on a mass scale but one onone I can really bring people to the next level what ever that level is and I'm huge on and I have no tolerance for people's self-doubting I'll say nope you can do it like do it again we're doing this again and I will sit there and everyone of the business I used to say I will come any day any time I will sit with you for as long as it takes if you try and you're honest with me I'm not going to give up on you and I I really mean that if somebody tries and they're honest with me I'm not giving up on them right when you were talking I was getting Goosebumps uh on my arm here because I I mean I love love the story but also um I think that coming on a podcast like this and telling your story is going to do that for someone somewhere that you don't even know it's a different way of doing it but like somebody out there is going to hear this or they're going to forward it to somebody who said and say listen I don't even know if you know what the podcast app is but you need to hear this because you know something in there is going to resonate with somebody and so uh that's why I was getting Goosebumps because there's a way to kind of like the egg carton story and buying a business is cool that was kind of the bait uh but the the real kind of like the real story here is is kind of just the the mentality and also um uh those families that did that for you you know I think that's uh it's not as flashy as you know creating a foundation and giving away a billion dollars or whatever but it is it is a version of like you know philanthropy or or sort of giving back or cont contributing that is uh you know can change change somebody's life in a in a huge way versus a lot of people's life lives in a small way right and I think that's what's way more important to me and seeing it helps me a lot it keeps me motivated cuz unfortunately the farther removed you get from it the harder it is to remember what did you have to do when you kind of rewired yourself like what was the uh when you did try to that's a big shift right you basically changed all your habits maybe not overnight but like you changed all the [ __ ] you were doing that was getting you the bad results into things that started to get you good results um was it like what what was what was that like how did you do that I wish it was deep and I had like steps for you but it was a it was a lot of fear I was really scared of being anything like what I was I was scared of what I would be in the future it's kind of like a drug addict that nearly dies from an overdose and they are just scared straight I was kind of scared straight and so I also honestly lost interest in a lot of things I used to be interested in I used to get into fights I used to gossip I used to there was this golf course I used to get drunk pass out on the golf course wake up to the sprinklers no joke and I was disgusted by it afterwards thinking about it like who is that I don't even want to be around that it was like the idea of the taste or the smell bothering somebody it was like that but from there it was hard because I didn't know I didn't have any of the tools like I never I did not read a single book in high school not one book right you um I have a couple of docs here I want to share one is uh because I think it's cool to see the actual screenshots you you shared with me because uh the funny thing is when you told the story The when when we told the story the first time on the podcast there was two reactions one is wow that's an incredible story because here's what I tweeted out so I said I have a new hero and and her name is Sarah Moore at under 30 years old she had no money no experience and the biggest asset was her car a RAF 4 she spent one year hunting through like 100,000 businesses to find one to buy and she bought a I guessed at the time but I didn't know if this was true she bought a you multi-million dollar business called eggcartons.com with all debt no no cash down and so I told that story and I told on the podcast and basically the two reactions were wow that's incredible so awesome you know you go girl and on the other side it was um calling [ __ ] no way and people were like that's that's not you know you can't buy it all debt nobody could sift through 100,000 businesses um How do you go to Harvard and not have anything not have any money and honestly I started to when I saw those tweets I was like damn that never occurred to me actually like yeah you're right she was saying she kind of came from nothing and blah blah blah but she's at Harvard Business School like and I was like am I getting [ __ ] daros right now is this Elizabeth Holmes and I'm just getting duped um and so so that happened and then we have this researcher the researcher uh you you text us the other day you were like hey somebody's like contacting a bunch of my old interns and it was like our researcher fact checking just to make sure we don't look like idiots that like we're putting somebody on who did this actually happen um but I think that's kind of a cool thing that your story was literally too good to be true that people just started calling [ __ ] and I remember you didn't have any social media so there was no way for you to explain or tell your side the story and then I think your sister like created a Twitter account or something it started like that day she was like tweeting like no I'm in the car with her right now yeah we grew up broke and like we didn't have a family and like all this stuff and I was like wow I don't know what's happening right now but this is fascinating do you remember that that is so yes it started blowing up on Twitter and everyone my company was talking about it and my interns were talking about and they're like Sarah you need to go out there and defend yourself like we're going to defend you and I was worried about I know the internet can be vicious and I was worried about anybody getting any of that like you know pointed at them and then I started worrying about my company so my sister got on there and she was we're very protective of each other she was she created a Twitter just to go on there and defend me is this the SAT sister or the other sister this is the SAT this is the bright well they're both exceptionally bright but she's actually the director of HR for ABAC cromi and Fitch like corporate level so she goes so we're uh husband now but fiance the time goes you need to delete this Jane like you're something to lose yeah it's a lose situation like you guys are idiots why are you trying to defend yourself amongst like people online we're like it's getting out of hand so we had no I just that was my concern that people were going to think this was fake and this was somehow going to snowball in a negative Direction and all I cared about was preserve the business like don't [ __ ] with a cart.com don't let this random dude on the internet blow this whole blow your spot up all right so then you shared with us a bunch of the things so you shared with us the Craigs we'll put this on on YouTube so people can actually see the the Craigslist post but you wrote um Kenston green what's Kenston green that's what you named your thing I Mentor recommended to make the name of the company a name that would have a story to it and so I deliberately said I wanted to say I'm from Cleveland and I worked in the steel business I want to say I'm a bluecollar gal like you and so Kenston was the name of my high school in Cleveland I'd say and green was the name of the family IID worked for in the steel industry right so when they would ask immediately what's I don't no one wants an intro right hey I'm they don't care but when they'd say what's Kenston green it was my way of giving an intro without giving an intro that's amazing also it sounds kind of powerful and old money sounding I didn't mean for that but yeah no it works uh so you wrote It's a small unorthodox private Equity Firm accurate unorthodox for sure very unod probably very private just me um he said unlike a traditional private Equity Firm we will acquire just one business and the principal will operate upon acquisition all right no lies are told and said you will be working for an eccentric unpretentious Harvard MBA all right I like it and exposed to live deals interactions with Brokers accountants and attorneys and due diligence and negoti negotiations of various sorts every day see that's awesome you're you're saying like the value you're going to get out of this unique experience um we're looking for interns to help manage our multi-stage high volume funnel high in all caps um in the most efficient way possible it includes blah blah blah blah blah and you said you know I like this work will not include Financial modeling sophisticated analyses or anything that you or anyone else thinks is a waste of time tell me about that because that is beautiful love that in a in a job post I hate wasting people's time one of my biggest pet peeves are these jobs people have to sit there until 5 6 whatever o'clock and rub their fingers to leave it's like when your work is done just leave and don't pretend to be busy don't pretend like you're not on your cell phone so I'm not going to ask them do to do anything that's not going to be important very important right and they're not doing some this isn't Harvard we're not going to be doing these crazy Financial analyses it's really simple it can be done on the back of a piece of paper yeah cuz most of the time when you call these businesses you're like so what's your profit for the year and they're like I think it's like 1.4 no let me 1.6 I don't have my numbers in front of me and they're like and you look it's like actually you made 900k last year and they're like yeah I don't know what I gotta ask my guy about that um it's not like you're doing you know the diligence it's like they don't know their business it's not like they're hiding something from you they don't know it themselves this so so common um all right so then you said a bunch of other things looking for somebody hungry hungry comfortable with chaos um then here's compensation because some people were also like oh unpaid interns that's crazy and it's like dude I don't have any money and like this is these are willing and able people choosing to do this because they see some value in it for them you said this is an unpaid internship if you're looking for a glamorous internship in a formal prestigious work environment this job is not for you we are operating out of an unassuming spot in a library I will provide letters of recommendations as well as introductions to anyone in consulting firms Banks or private Equity firms should you perform well um should you perform well good good qualifier I will also help you with recruiting interviewing and grad school prep if you want me to wonderful this is wonderful this is so good I love seeing this um I also have here an email you sent um I think you were maybe sending this to a broker um but just very clear and direct to the point you were like hey my name is SAR Moore I'm a recent business school grad living in Boston I want to buy a small business that meets this criteria 100% of the business is for sale the iida or seller seller earnings are 1 to two million it's been profitable the last three years and seller financing is available um I have preference of B I have a preference for B2B service but this is not a requirement I'm able to finance acis below 25 million please let me know if you have any listings like very direct clear and were things like like how did you increase your luck so like how did you put things out there to increase the amount of good things that would come inbound to you let's go there actually I I have something for you guys I put to the side here okay so people talk all the time about this industry and being a woman and they think that it's a disadvantage well that's matter of perspective I deliberately wanted to leverage my gender and so part of that was within the broker Community it's all men usually so I'm 5'9 and I would go to only free broker events but I would go to them in 5in heels so I'm walking around as this 6'2 Amazon and always wear like a ridiculous outfit too like a loud color so when I'd call the Brokers I'd say cuz they never remembered they'd say who are you again I'd say I'm that extremely tall chick that introduced myself to you looking for a business there wasn't a single person that didn't remember that's for the Brokers but then I'm very active so I'd be going around Boston on these blue bikes which are free of course and I would be running or doing whatever and I wore this sweatshirt a version of this too like every day I want to buy your business and then the back was my number I it was an interesting experience with this yeah everywhere anything to get yourself it was anything free where I can I wanted the world to know I am looking to buy a business and I'm serious did you um get any good inbound from this was that like did somebody call you being like hey I just saw you ride by me on a bike um I think I caught this number correct I'd like to sell you my business it's funny I I didn't think it was working but you'd be amazed at what comes out of the woodwork um there's actually somebody that came over and said you know what my my dad asked me about whether or not this was actually a legitimate business like are you actually looking to buy something and that worked out and then I faxed everybody that was one of the interns idea to send out Mass faxes and part of the faxing campaign was just putting anything that will get their attention so part of it I did put my picture on there and I'd say we want to buy your business and I I told you this to this day I I have people that recognize me from those faxes people in the mill that I work in said wait a second I was wondering why you look so familiar did you try and buy my business like people on my street to this day in downtown Boston will say you're that girl that was wearing that sweatshirt or you're that girl that was faxing me all the time that's what I wanted unfortunately I I I a lot of those um replies came back after I bought a business but I was just that was what I was really hoping for somebody see it and know I was serious well that's brilliant because you're looking for these kind of uh long-standing sort of boring B2B service businesses they have fax machines nothing interesting is coming through the fax machine so it's a completely untapped unsaturated Channel you're like and I'm going to turn my disadvantages into advantages okay people say the disadvantage to be a woman you're not going to be taken seriously blah blah blah you're not going to be included in whatever well I'm also going to stand out if I'm the minority right like I'm going to be different than everybody else and I'm going to use the sort of psychology to my favor here and I love that you did that and are not like shy about that because I think a lot of people are very shy about things like this and um I love that you did that you faxing a picture is to me like it's in the all time hustle moves and I'll also say it doesn't matter if some of this stuff works because one life motto do it for the story I think that's that's a that's already just like a winning thing to do is just do things for the story and two is there's something that comes with the mentality of nothing is off limits I will do anything I am all [ __ ] in and it's a signal to yourself it's a signal to your interns and your team it's a signal to everybody in the world that I am all [ __ ] in and no idea is off limits no idea is too dumb no idea is too too out there too too um you know too loud no no we are everything's on the table as as a thing that we might do and I think that is the value of some of these things whether it's the lead that actually brings in the business or not is kind of secondary and I love that you did that anything Sean truly I was Shameless if I had anything I could throw out there I was throwing it out there whatever stuck I was okay with hey I'm Sarah Sarah Moore 5 foot n brunette if that's your thing I would love to buy your Pest Control business truly whatever it takes and if I could find out maybe the profits of your business I'd be happy to join you for a coffee uh let's let's do this um that's so so funny yeah and if you could leave uh any listeners to this with one I don't know message or takeaway what's what's your kind of what's your message what's your what's the last thing you want to sort of leave in people's minds here so my biggest value is freedom this country was not founded on equality despite how things seem now with the culture it was founded on freedom and part of freedom is using everything at your disposal so gender sex age whatever makes you you you can use any of those things to literally pull yourself up by your bootstraps and make your life what you want it this industry I can promise you is one of those Industries you don't have to have Harvard MBA what made me successful at this I really think was largely my upbringing those things weren't taught to me at Harvard to get a business the things I do day-to-day were not taught to me at Harvard they were taught at the cliche School of Hard Knox so if you want to be free pursue this route freedom is not free it's going to cost you time it's going to cost you like a lot of effort but I can promise you that anyone that wants to do this can do this if they really put their all into it and normally I say at the end uh how should people follow you or reach you but you don't really have social media and I think we may not want people to be reaching you after this um so like what's your message is leave me the [ __ ] alone is it stay away do you want to be contacted from this what what would you like my biggest thing I I've said what I want is for anyone who wants to pursue this career path I want everyone to have a fair opportunity to do so which is why I'm talking about it I'm going to give people within a Q&A type format detailed information to answer all the questions I get but we have truly experienced this crazy amount of volume on my in my inbox on my LinkedIn of messages like thousands and it really breaks my heart not being able to get back to all of them so I'm doing a mass reply that's that's the idea here we're going to give you as much information as we possibly can but please understand that I cannot respond to all these inquiries like I have a full-time job like I own other companies too we're very busy so the biggest thing is please do not contact our business please do not show up at the business we're going to create a Google doc something for you guys to fill out if you want information we'll send it to you but I I just can't get back to everybody like I'm not used to this I went I'm like a nobody so I'm not used to all this attention all these in Mount inquiries I can't I can't respond to them all I'd love to I really would but I can't so we're going to put a form in the description here that'll be like people can fill that in you'll send them a blast and amazing if there are people who fill out that form uh I might cherry pick a couple of people and be like hey if you're serious about this like I'll help you do it like I I don't I'm I'm taking a break from running companies uh you know we sold our last company last year I don't want to start a new company right now but I do want to do fun fun projects and one of the fun things is helping people buy business businesses that's one of the things that is actually pretty pretty dope because you learn about all these Niche businesses you get like the free MBA right yeah so so I think it's a good time you learn so much searching when I hear about people failing at this it's like you really can't fail unless you get investors of course but you really can't I I mean the amount we still laugh at some of the businesses out there and you view the world differently you view like I think of the freeway now and the the lines on the freeway and the signs on the freeway somebody made all of that right like these Christians come in like wow God made this and I'm thinking that and all these businesses made like all this stuff that we're looking at in using it's kind of wild right you're like no that's Trent in Cincinnati he does that what do you mean he has a name all right uh Sarah thanks so much for coming on I really appreciate it and uh really inspired by your story so thank you for coming and telling it thank you for having me I appreciate it [Music]

all right I'm not jealous of many people on Earth but I think I'm jealous of Craig Clemens because not only has he built a successful billion dooll company with no outside investors but he has made hit after hit after hit and I asked him to come on the podcast he thought it was just going to be a normal episode but then when we started talking I realized that I wanted him to give me a master class and when he's giving it to me he's giving it to you which is to teach us the seven ways that he as a marketer has sold over a billion dollars of products online he calls these the seven human hijacks and he goes through example after example of how great products and things that we take for granted like brushing your teeth or how people eat bacon for breakfast those weren't things people did back in the day it was guys like him marketers that Ed specific tactics in order to make those a thing and if you're an entrepreneur who's uh you know wants to be successful you need to be good at marketing you got to be able to sell your product and is very rare to be able to sit with somebody like Craig who's actually one of the best to ever do it and ask him how did you do it I I feel lucky he's doing this he doesn't have to tell us these secrets like you know I think he's at that sweet spot where he's been running his company for 15 years he's been doing this for a long time he's s you know the company's super successful I don't feel like he has to like guard those Secrets anymore so I told him to give them to us and I don't know about you but I've had professors in school I've took marketing classes but those were not people who have actually been in the game done it people have actually created category sold hundreds of millions of dollars of single products that a year ago nobody had ever heard of and so Craig tells the story of how others did it and at the end he tells a story about how he helped create the probiotics category if you ever had probiotics you can thank Craig because he was the one who created uh that category and made it mainstream so enjoy this marketing master class on the seven human hijacks how marketers have hijacked your brain with Craig Clem what's up dude you uh I have this Theory now of guests who come on the podcast the more their video setup looks like they were either taking hostage or are like you know in some Motel somewhere uh the better the guest is we had bolog on and he was like white wall nothing in the room and he was just like you know at the time he didn't have his like video setup like you know he was not on his home video setup and like the higher your IQ the worse your video setup and the opposite is true unfortunately for me which is the more HD and beautiful your video setup the less interesting things you usually have to say yes yes and the cool thing is you're like the real life madman you you you're an ad guy and a copywriter who translated those skills into a billion dollars of sales which is why when you were coming on this time we started talking and we kind of realized that you have a master class in you so normally we hang out we just shoot the [ __ ] about business ideas but occasionally we just drop a knowledge bomb and the knowledge bomb is what we call a master class which is just let somebody do their thing for 30 minutes and the cool thing about this is you said you had given a talk internally to your your team to your company to pump them up and it sounded so dope that I just said can you just please do that on the Pod and you you agreed and so my friend the floor is going to be yours I'm here when you need me I might chime in here and there but I'm really going to let you cook during this and uh let Craig Clemens do this master class so take it away so Sean did you brush your teeth this morning did you take an elevator or are you wearing sneaks right now any any yes one of three ain't bad one of three ain't bad bad okay well marketers created all of that marketers created so much of our daily behavior that uh people that I tell these stories to don't even want to accept it and you know it's it's okay though I mean that's that's uh that's the case for everyone you're not alone so do you know who this guy is on the left here I do not but he looks very sophisticated who is that this is a this is a smart [ __ ] this is Sigman Freud oh and this gentleman on the right do you know who that is I'm guessing you don't I do not okay well this guy has changed your life this guy is a man named Edward bernes he's often called the father of public relations and he is actually Sigman Freud's nephew so I don't know uh what exactly kind of kind of shirt you're wearing over there Sean or if you uh put some some style into it but this guy has his his hands and so much stuff that he he literally created consumerism so quick example before bernes people would buy clothes you know unless you were in like the the upper classes people would buy clothes to go to work um he's the one who got together with a bunch of other people and they're like wait a second these work clothes people aren't buying enough of them if people use clothing for expression then people would buy more clothes and he got the expression uh vibe to go all the way down the line from anyone who could afford clothing to be buying more clothing and then buying more things when they came into season and this and that now it's people who don't have the means that buy buy buy more clothing they they can afford right well let me just get into some of the the examples here and then you'll see that this guy was operating on a level that uh is is unfathomable so in this presentation I'm going to sh with you what I've discovered studying and creating marketing campaigns that have caused World change and I call them the seven human hijacks because when you use these seven things you are hijacking the lyic system of the brain and a human cannot help themselves but to pay attention and either respond or at least Lo L what you're going to do or say into their brain and maybe they respond the next time but these seven hijacks I'm going to share each of them after I share these marketing campaigns and you're going to see how they repeat and not every campaign uses all seven but um you'll see that some of them are extremely powerful and then when you put them all together that's when you can really do this type of thing yourself so if you're watching this right now and you're excited about you possibly changing the world forever this is the recipe let's go our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better okay one of the most interesting marketing campaigns of all time was created by a guy named Claude Hopkins so Claude Hopkins was approached by a a toothpaste company called pepsin and they said Claude we want to sell more of our toothpaste and he looked at the lay of the land and he realized there was a problem he said to pepson he said Look only 5% of people brush their teeth on a daily basis so why are you even in this business that not a lot of uh people are taking part do you believe that Sean 1920s 95% of the women that you kiss are going to have terrible breath no one brushed their teeth back then and so Claude tells the the founders of pepid and he's like look if you guys really want to sell some toothpaste you're going to have to get people brushing their teeth and so he created this masterful ad campaign that built Pepsi it into the the dominating toothpaste brand for for decades and this is the ad the ad says the film that discolors the whitest teeth and then he has you do a demonstration so do this with me Sean take the tip of your tongue put it over the the the fronts put it over those gold fronts you got under there okay do you feel that film there on your teeth yeah I kind of do kind of do so the ad goes on to say that brushing with pepsodent is going to remove that film and behind that film is a movie star smile and it's so genius right because everybody wants that movie star Smile everybody has that film whether you just brushed your teeth five minutes ago or not then you feel that you're like oh shoot I got this film you know and then it talks about how pepid it is the way to get rid of that film so the result of this ad within a decade 85% of Americans didn't brush their teeth on a daily basis and pepid is still around today um they ran this ad campaign for I don't know 50 years something like that um and I'll tell you something interesting is is about 10 years in there was other companies trying to compete with pepan and they were using a similar ad campaign you know it's very common to Steel an ad campaign but they couldn't get the repeat orders and they did a a focus group and they found out that people love Pepsi because it had this like minty flavor that made their mouth tingle after they brushed with it and then the toothpaste companies the other ones started knocking that off and when people felt the tingle then they would stick with other companies otherwise they'd try the other when they would feel wouldn't feel the tingle and they'd be like oh it's not actually working you know so they'd go right back to pepsin it so they they owned it for like 10 years and then it got actually competitive because then people were not only stealing their ads they were stealing uh you know their their secret of the tingle so one of the the human hijacks that Claude Hopkins used one he sold the dream of the movie star smile and you're going to see this theme reoccurring throughout this presentation uh second he created a powerful demonstration that anyone could do and that's just rubbing your tongue over the the front of your teeth and then the next thing he did is he made it about them he made it about the potential user and this is a a big thing that uh a lot of companies mess up is they just talk about their own product and you know why they're so excited about it but they don't talk about why it's going to be exciting for the user and Claude did a really great job of that sharing how it's going to give them that movie star smile so that's that's like the there's this diagram that I love that's like um I call it the Mario marketing I don't know who originally created this I saw it from that company buffer but I I don't know if they created it originally but it's little Mario um you know Mario when he's small then it's the fireflower and then when Mario gets the fireflower he's able to shoot Fireballs out of you know out of his hands he's running around he's huge he can shoot fireballs and basically it says uh don't sell this the fireflower which is your product sell this which is the customer going from little Mario to being big Mario who can shoot Fireballs right and it's like that's what you want to sell is how the user will be more badass rather than all the features and uh facets about your product yes exactly so think about benefits what's the benefit what's in it for them you know these people are busy right now Sean I think people see something like 4,000 ads a day and they did a study and it showed that the human brain has the um uh same int span as a goldfish is like less than you know uh uh the ability of a goldfish to pay attention so how do you grab their attention well you have to talk about something that's exciting to them something that keeps them up at night or something that they you know have a deep dream hope and desire for so I want to get back to that demonstration though where did Claud get the idea for this demonstration so 1854 there's a guy named Otis and Otis gets into the elevator business and he didn't invent the elevator but he came up with a a breaking system for the elevator so back then people were afraid to use elevators because every once in a while just like today you hear about a car accident you'd hear about an elevator accident where you know people get on and the elevator falls down right so Otis creates his great braking system first year out he only sells three elevators the next year out he sells Seven elevators like no one cares you know he doesn't doesn't uh have the ability to get the word out and then he meets this guy named PT Barnum and so everyone probably now knows uh PT Barnum one of the the greatest uh marketing and showmen of all time and PT baram says this is what we're going to do we're going to go to the Crystal Palace in New York City which was this big exhibition Hall and we're going to do a grand demonstration so Otis gets up there on this Elevator Shaft and he has his assistant get up there with an axe and so he's standing on it the the elevator goes up the shaft just like it normally would in a building and he's like cut the cord Jimmy he goes boom but he cuts the first cord the elevator drops like just a little bit and then there's one more cord hanging and everyone's looking out they're like oh [ __ ] what's he gonna do you know this is the cord and then puts actually the second cord and the El only two feet and stops he's like all safe here gentlemen all safe those are like like famous words that were published in the newspaper all safe here and it showed that Otis had invented a breaking system for elevators that worked so over the next decade he sold 2,000 elevators he got all the greatest commissions he did the the eiel tower the Empire State Building and even today if you look at your elevator I've found about half of the elev I get into have this little Otis logo is still crushing all my zippers all my zippers say YKK and all my elevators say Otis that's all those are the only two things I know yeah so uh so that's the power of a great demonstration so what did what did Otis do the the powerful demonstration stands in people's minds and he also made it an event you know so what's greater about an event well one people are going to show up and two it's going to get covered by the newspaper but if you think about it on on a more Primal level have you ever heard the phrase Sean nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd no but I like that one of my favorite favorite sayings and it it just shows that humans cannot resist an event you know if you're walking down the street and then you see like a big crowd of people and something's going on over there and there's a band or whatever it's like you got to see what what's going on it's just just natural and so if you make your advertising an event then people cannot not pay attention to it and then he also showed unquestionable proof using that demonstration and putting his own body on the elevator he didn't use a dummy he didn't use a monkey himself was on that elevator while his assistant was was cutting the cords and so that's the type of unquestionable proof that lead people to go ahead and take take a uh Act to buy without questioning it and of course he made it about them he didn't get up there and show his fancy breaking system or how it worked you know he addressed the fear in everyone's mind that was about the safety of of getting on an elevator and he did it with the powerful demonstration so let show you uh let me show you something hold on all right do you know this brand mini Katana have you seen them Craig I have not all right so I about to uh YouTube don't be alarmed this is inside here is a giant sword and um this company so this brand they sell these it's called mini Katana but it's actually humongous so they sell these swords now the problem with selling swords is that Google and Facebook don't let you do it you can't advertise weapons so how does an e-commerce brand work when you can't advertise weapons well what they did was they started they hired like 20 YouTubers and ticktockers and they would have them do what you just described the powerful demonstration so they would take this they would take this sword and they would instead of saying you know why you need a sword because most people don't need a sword let's be honest uh instead of talking about how long it is or how sharp it is or whatever they would show that the sword could cut through a bullet that was fired at them so this video starts with a guy's holding the sword and there's a bullet aimed at him and he's going to try to split it in half and uh then when he does it it's a powerful presentation about like how badass these swords are and they all of their marketing they'll take a steak you just see a steak plop down on a cutting board and then a giant sword cutting through it which is completely unnecessary but it is a powerful demonstration um and you know I I remember seeing those TED Talks where guys take a glass and they you know it's like here's dirty water would you drink this water it's like no way and then they put it into their filter and like their bottle filter and then they start to drink it I don't know who this was Bill Gates or something chugs in the water first right for for real yeah exactly they make it disgusting and then the whole crowd is gasping and like they could tell you how the filter works or they could show you that they're willing to drink the water through this filter that was like disgusting water and I still remember that was like 20 years ago I still remember that video because it's just you're right it hijacked my brain yeah the The Knife Company they're genius any knife infomercial will do this where they'll be taking a knife and cutting a penny you know or like effortlessly slicing tomatoes through the air and you know who was uh the king of this was Dr Oz Dr Oz what did he do every episode of The Dr Oz Show is a marketing master class he advertised oh [ __ ] I'm sleeping on Dr Oz yeah he advertised these nutrients and I don't know if he had some type of deal with manufacturers or something like that but he would advertise like um like Resveratrol or like um Garcinia camboia berries which were like weight loss but he wouldn't ever advertise a specific brand he would just talk about Garcinia camboia if you look one of the reasons it's hard to advertise supplements online is because Dr Oz would go and talk about Garcinia camboia or whatever Barry and then all these scammers would create websites uh selling Garcinia camboia on auto ship that you could never get out of you know you'd sign up website some would disappear but that thing would be docking your credit card for years later you know whatever so Dr o one of the ones I remember is he'd go on there and he'd say this is your body and these balloons on it and then You' have like a mannequin with with balloons on it these balloons are the fat cells oh wow Ginia camboia is a miracle berry that works for any body type and then he take out a Pinn he'd be like this is the berry pop pop that's what Garcinia camboia does to the fat cells in your body and C man like a billion dollars of Garcinia Cambodia we stole over the next few months mostly to these scammy Auto billing marketers it was it was wild and he did this with like five different berries over time and eventually he got pulled into Congress to testify and all this [ __ ] and like way lose he rolled with it cuz he was getting all these allegations that he was starting on one episode he goes uh he gets a camera crew behind him and he goes down to one of the companies that's selling the Garcinia camboia and he knocks in the door he's got the camera behind him the founder comes out he's like hey I didn't give you permission to use my name and likeness to sell your garc camboia and like your autoing customers and this and that you know and he was like pretending that he was the the good guy but I don't know man I don't know if like India was lining his pockets or something before it happened but like this was so many berries and for so many years uh it it it's crazy man it was like billions of dollars a fraud happened because of because of his show you know you know what I love about this is um a lot of the audience who listens to this and a lot of the people I know who are uh entrepreneurial or technical type engineering type people often so um rational and logical and like sort of analytical about the way that they want to about the way they see the world and so the idea that hey we're going to do this event with the the axe swinging at the the Rope or you know we're going to blow up these balloons and they'll be like well that's not what the fat cell looks like that's way too big that's not to scale um you know like you have to almost you have to use the other part of your brain if you're going to do this you have to make something powerful visual dramatic and those are not skills that typically your kind of um operational or technical person is used to flexing and so what I love about this is these examples that give you inspiration to be able to like go use that other part of your brain you know if you look at these we got the hijacks up here right from Otis Elevator all of these apply to what I just said about dog draw the event is that it's a TV show you know so that makes an event already the demonstration the unquestionable proof is him he's a doctor saying that this is going to work for you and then making it about them he said this is the miracle weight loss cure for all body types like those are almost his exact words and by the way you know who else does this amazingly well Elon Elon who's the you know the scientist the hardcore engineer you know what he's brilliant at just yesterday the news was um there's the they're getting they're hyping cybertruck right now and you do did you see that news that came out which was that they unloaded a full magazine of some assault rifle at the door and so there's a bunch of holes in the door or like you could see where the bullet hit the door but didn't go through and so he's driving that car around and leaked that kind of the Tweet rumor that hey they tested it this way and he did this at their onstage event too but it it [ __ ] up like he tried to take a sledgehammer and show how indestructible this was he swung the sledgehammer and then they like broke through the window and he's like oh [ __ ] that wasn't supposed to happen like this is supposed to be bulletproof but um he was trying to do that he was trying to you know PT Barnum uh you know their cyber truck which is which is really really cool to see yeah you know what was another incredible success that I think was complete [ __ ] was the the Power Balance bracelet do you remember those it was like dude I was thinking about when you did the the tongue on the teeth that's the first thing I thought of where people used to say hey hold out your arms yeah and now watch how EAS I go on one foot watch how easily I could tip you over then you put this bracelet on it's just magic angle which way you press on the arm yeah recently and he was doing that with me and I was like oh God am I getting schemed by this this chiropractor but yeah I think Power Balance actually got popped for that as they they deserved um but that was that was a a very effective technique even though it was you know unethical in that case yeah okay let's get into some uh so those those are last two are for good right we want people to brush their teeth we want elevators to be safe uh now let's talk about some evil campaigns all right so okay 1930s all the the men had come back from the war you know and they gave them free cigarettes so like so many men were hooked on smoking that there was no room for growth so the cigarette company has come to Eddie BR a Lucky Strike in particular is who who came to him and they're like hey we need more customers he's like well you already got all the men but at that time Sean it was illegal for a woman to smoke in public it was literally [ __ ] illegal and there was like cafes in New York City where you know there's there's stories of of like High Society women getting asked to leave and then women that could afford it would have like special smoking rooms in their homes that would you know that that really liked it because they weren't allowed to do it in public oh and I should add something too women didn't really want to smoke uh Mo for the most part you know they they weren't really pushing back against it yes it was illegal but it was also considered a ladylike it was a it was a man thing you know so he says to Lucky Strike he's like look you know you got to you got to get the women smoking so what was going on at the time was the women's Rights Movement you know so women were out in the streets marching about you know wanting the right to vote and and Bern is capitalized on that so the big social event of the day kind of like the Oscars of today was the Easter Parade which would go down Fifth Avenue and all the reporters would be standing on the sidelines and so bernes organized a float and he called up all of the the socialites and debutants like the Paris Hill and Kim Kardashians of the day and he got them all to go on this float and they're cruising down Fifth Avenue the parades happening you know when they get to the corner where all the reporters were the women do uh go into their stocking they pull out cigarettes put them in their mouths and light them up so imagine you know Paris and uh Chloe and all the Kardashians and even all the Jenners on one float they all just start blazing up right and the repor like what is going on here this is this is obscene you know women aren't supposed to do this bernes and his crew went around to the reporters and they said oh no no no they're not smoking they are declaring their rights with these torches of Freedom oh wow and so the newspapers ran with that they're like you know uh women uh present torches of freedom to show that they are equal with men and they can smoke too and so turned it into a movement and if you think about smoking to this day if you think about a women uh a woman who smokes um I think about bit older than you Sean but I think of like Kate Moss and like the you know sexy model smoking now it might be considered gross for a woman to smoke again you know anyone to smoke I don't really know what the kids these days are thinking but yeah we you know you think like some like badass badass woman and you remember that old movies with Audrey heurn you know that famous scene I think it's breakfast at Tiffy where she's puffing that long cigarette you know so yeah completely change the world there that's amazing I had never heard that story um uh but I love that that's like a combination of you got the event you have kind of newsjacking which was jumping on uh to an existing Trend but then also um the the just the copyrighting of the the words there of you know these aren't cigarettes these are torches of Freedom that's really really powerful yeah the plants if you like that plant strategy Ryan Holliday wrote a great book called trust me I'm lying and he talks about all these phrases that he planted in the the heads of these reporters when he was promoting things like uh Tucker Max books and and you know wild stuff back there so there's a new lesson in here uh new hijack so to speak and that is help them Rebel or feel Superior so people have this tendency in them they want to go against the grain they want to show that they are not one of the sheep you know they want to show that they are not going to bow down to the the mainstream pressure or Society standards things like that you know and this is a really powerful concept that you're going to see appear throughout uh some of the the other demonstrations here but that's that's what ber has allowed them to do is is Rebel and and maybe even feel superior to the rest because they're they're leading the charge right okay keep going by the way I'm loving this so keep going all right so berne's had a problem Lucky Strike uh did this big campaign to get women to start smoking and they did start smoking but they didn't smoke Lucky Strikes because if you remember boop boop boop see the Lucky Strike package there Sean what color is the main color it's Green Well green was a very undesirable color back in those days it was considered an ugly color and so Bernay got all these women smoking but lucky is like what the [ __ ] bernes they're not smoking Lucky Strikes so he has to come up with something new so he goes back to his his debutants and and socialites and as they say here women of prominence and they create the first ever Gala green ball at the Waldorf Hotel in New York City and the magazine started following around the Kardashians of the day to see what type of outfits they were going to wear that were styled in green and women started bringing green Decor into their homes and it just became a a big thing and the gala happens and the women are photographed and their exotic green outfits and it it became the most fashionable color within one year going from the the ugliest color the most fashionable color and Lucky Strike without even trying became the number one selling brand Sig regets for women because they subconsciously wanted that green box holy [ __ ] wow is one of the hijacks by the way using people of prominence or you didn't you don't include that in the in the hijacks unquestionable proof that falls under unquestionable proof it's a great question but yes when we humans see someone as they just said in the New York Times article someone of prominence doing something we automatically assume it's been we automatically assume it's okay and we automatically have something in us that makes us want to do that maybe it's from when we were all in trib and you know if the chief is doing something then you do it too who knows but that's that's unquestionable proof you know so uh you know he made an event where this unquestionable proof happened and also there was this force that that they wanted to rebel against you know these celebrities are like oh I'm cool enough where I can wear green and it'll look good you know you know I heard this other other thing Sean today so how old are you are you public with your age yeah yeah I'm 35 35 okay I'm 44 so when you think of emojis what do you think about when I think of emojis yeah like who do you think uses emojis I would have said like teenagers teens and tweens uh but I think but then I see people in India like my auntie my aunts and and my aunts are crazy about about emojis yes I would have thought the same so my my buddy is a a dad the two teenagers he said they will not use emojis because they think emojis are something adults use they do not want to be associated with the adults so kids these days they don't use emojis they'll just use like different text characters and things like that so you've probably seen these little like one to two or sorry two to three character terms that they use like tbh or like you know it stands for to be honest or F FR which means like for real you know they use those type of things to separate themselves from the adults you know people want to push back it's a it's a natural human instinct yeah when um when Snapchat came out was getting really popular one of the things that uh I remember in Silicon Valley all the like product genius blogger guys were like yeah you know what what snapshat should do is make it easier to use because look at this like uh at the time like you know to use those face filters you had to like there was no button on the screen you had to just hold down on your face for 3 seconds like a magic trick like like a secret door that you didn't know that nobody else knew about um or even just in signing up there was like all these like funky ways to do it and um and then the people I think one of the guys at Snapchat came out was like look it's intentional we want you know you know you baby proof medicine we're we're Boomer proofing this app like the way that this is going to become really popular amongst young people is that we don't make it easy for older people to get in and figure out how this whole thing works and we want to make it easy for one friend to tell another the secret on how to do something so that they feel like they're in on it with with them and it's like a word of mouth virality of how do you do that exactly it's like once your parents and your grandma got on Facebook it wasn't cool anymore you know right and then everyone went to Instagram and now you know Uncle Bob's on Instagram and it's just like L you know so every go Tik Tok right and we'll see if something comes next you know I think the the moms are well moms are definitely a big group on Tik Tok now um I don't know if like I don't know are you on Tik Tok I'm I'm not I I have like a I got to admit I I love Tik Tok even though you know it's my lucky strike I know I know I probably shouldn't be be smoking that Tik Tok every night but I do well you know Tik Tok is crack it is digital crack very well-designed digital crack so don't blame yourself people say that but like when I think when they say that they mean avoid it and I'm like wait cracks like isn't crack supposed to be like the greatest experience when people do it and then I open up Tik Tok and I start swiping yeah well you know actually speaking of drugs funny enough there's another Rebellion I'm seeing in in my Community against alcohol right now and and I remember in my 20s that it was all about the alcohol you know if you didn't show up uh if you should up a party empty-handed you know it's like not cool I've gone to parties now with a bottle and they'd be like oh this is a non-alcoholic party can you go put that back in your car it's like push back you know um how figure out some Camy yeah exactly okay last campaign I'm going to share with you about uh Eddie Bern's is the Great American breakfast so early in the you know 19th century uh 20th century breakfast was like some coffee and and maybe a roll or some oatmeal or something like that right no one actually had like a actual hearty breakfast and Beachnut bacon comes to bir and they're like hey we want to sell more bacon he's like well people are eating bacon usually for dinner sometimes for lunch there's another meal here we can take advantage of so bernes goes to uh his his OnStaff doctor or actually no it was it was a it was Beach that's OnStaff doctor and he says hey Doc would you agree that a hearty breakfast containing bacon would be the best way to start your day and the doctor is like oh of course I agree with you do you think some of your doctor friends would agree so he has him write 5,000 letters to doctors Across the Nation saying hey I think bacen is the healthiest breakfast and people should be eating a heartier breakfast do you agree 4,500 doctors wrote back and they're like yes I agree that makes perfect sense they didn't turn this into an ad campaign but what they did do is they shared that result with all of the newspapers and so newspapers started publishing headlines doctors agree a hearty breakfast containing bacon is the best way to store energy to last throughout your workday and but that's how people started eating eating bacon for breakfast and you know all the all the bacon companies started going crazy because it became a breakfast thing wow so what are we doing here there we're selling the dream you know of of a breakfast that's going to give you more energy to get throughout your day you know so that's making it about them as well the unquestionable proof 45 100 doctors can't be wrong right and then there's even a little bit of a um feeling Superior here because if your buddy is over there eating a roll you're like hey Sean got something to tell you about that roll man it's not as hearty is this your bacon right so it Taps into all these these same psychological hijacks you keep seeing them over and over Okay so let's take a step back now uh a couple decades to the 19 1910s orange juice now I grew up in the ' 80s and my mom had us drink orange juice every day for vitamin C was this a thing Sean when when you were a kid totally totally orange juice is when I was a kid orange juice is good for you it's vitamin C which is you know good for your immunity this is what I was told and uh drank a lot of sugar because of that yeah so orange juice actually has a same amount of sugar as a Coca-Cola so orange juice you know it's it's glucose or something I don't know it's a different kind of sugar but it ain't good for you so this was all the the result of a a marketing man named Albert Lasker who was probably the uh the man responsible for more consumer change um in the early 1900s than anyone Claud Hopkins pepson Claude actually worked with Albert he was his top copywriter and prior to Claude coming on board Albert was contacted by the California growers association they're like Al Albert we got so many oranges here in California we them to cut down trees because they overproduce and then we need to get rid of them and it brings the bugs and all that stuff you know how can we sell more oranges and I looked at the L of land and all these orange growers were competing against each other trying to say like we have the best orange we have the best orange or whatever he goes okay first of all you guys are all teaming up and so he teamed them all up together and he put them under one brand name and he called it Sunkissed which I think is a pretty genius name yes and then as he's he's meeting with him he notices that what the The Growers would do for their kids as a as a as a special treat is they'd take that orange and they they'd squeeze it into a cup and they'd give their kids little little shots of the juice he's like ah wait a second how many oranges did it take to make that juice and they're like oh you know three or four or whatever so we thought what if if we could make that mainstream because the juice tasted really good and so he had a uh engineer invented this device that you could you know cheap plastic device that you can put an orange on and then he created this campaign talking about how oranges have all these vitamins in them and you know will help you get more of your nutrients from food tying orange juice to meals so you think about oh well I want to get the nutrients in this food so I want to drink orange juice with it and then you have this campaign where you buy box oranges and you send in your your proof of purchase and they send you this juicer thing so it was like you get something for free and created orange juice and so what is he doing he's selling the dream of getting the more nutrients from your food the uh um unquestionable proof you know if you if you go and actually read that ad there was like you know doctors recommend and and things like that um he made it about them because it's showing them that they can get some benefit here and then here's a new hijack that's appearing for the first time um actually maybe I mean I guess it would apply to toothpaste but uh Change Daily Behavior if you can change someone's daily Behavior you can create something big so two modern examples of this Bulletproof Coffee are you familiar with Bulletproof Coffee uh I'm just familiar with it from the surface level but yeah tell me tell me about you know what do you know what it is it's like the butter coffee or the oil coffee MCT oil coffee is that what it is so you walk into any Starbucks in the country They don't serve Bulletproof Coffee but they know what it is everyone knows what it is and the genius that that Dave asey had was he changed the behavior of these of of people that were already doing something he kind of like like intercepted their coffee it's an additive to your coffee rather than a new new Behavior so so now he's he's changing the existing Behavior yes changing the existing behavior and so there's a there's a book called The Miracle morning and it talk uh talks about the power of journaling every day so you buy this book called The Miracle morning and then you do this specific journal every day right long after you read the book and I met the author of that Hal Elrod and he told me something that that stuck with me I thought was fascinating he said when was the last time you recommended a book and I was like well I was just read this book on gangas Khan you know I've been telling all my friends about it or whatever he's like when were you telling them about it I was like well I was telling them about it when I was reading it he said okay well most people recommend books during the the time they're reading that book and then they go and they read the next book right now I'm reading elon's biography it's great that's why I just told you about that Sean I'm literally in the middle of it you know I can tell you what book I read last month or last year people talk about the things they're doing now so if you change their daily Behavior like Hal did with getting people to journal in the morning they they talk about it all the time so that book has sold hundreds of thousands of copies or maybe even Millions by now um because this is 10 years ago he told me this because people are doing this Behavior every day and so they're talking about it every day like oh what' you do today I just did my morning uh Miracle journaling like oh what's that you know so long after the book is through so if you change daily Behavior it has a a viral effect that is Untouchable by anything else love that okay so let's get to some more modern examples the 1970s Sean do you know who this guy is um no some some Runner I don't know who it is okay so this this guy's before our time but uh gentleman's name Steve Prefontaine and Prefontaine was uh best comparison I can think of is like the Michael Phelps of his time you know no one was really thinking about swimming until Michael Phelps came around who was such a dominant athlete from the USA you know so everyone wanted to get behind him so Prefontaine was that guy for running and Prefontaine had all these great quotes like Mohamad Al Ali he's like you know yeah someone can beat me but if you're going to beat me you g to have to bleed you know and he's like if you don't run until you until you feel like you're going to you're going to die you're not honoring your gift you know so he had all these great quotes he was a great media figure he won every college record from like 500 meter up to 2,000 meter Prefontaine was the man and Nike was just coming up that actually just started like making their going from being at a distributor making their own shoe and fortunately Prefontaine was in Oregon so were they and they got him to to wear their shoes and it was a a big thing because the unquestionable proof now you've got pre Fontaine the top runner in the country wearing Nike shoes um tragically Prefontaine passed in a car accident before he could go and and honor his Olympic Glory but before he did that he really put Nike on the map because you know running was his thing running what's the one accessory that you need shoes and so this was such a big deal um that it actually Chang the entire industry so so prior to Prefontaine Prefontaine was around in like the 70s right um if you read Phil Knight's book he talks about if you went jogging in like the 40s 50s or 60s people were like throwing bottles at you from your car because they're just like mad they're like what is this idiot doing you know he's in the road or whatever and it was just like really hated upon and pre Fontaine comes along and running actually comes cool again and so Nike got to ride that that tailwind and then what also happened is is back then the people were wearing shoes that were like uh you know kind of like the loafer or work shoe or or whatever like pretty basic shoes and people wanted to rebel against that rebel against the shoes that their dad was wearing and so they started wearing these athletic shoes these running shoes as a part of their daily attire to make a statement that like I'm rebelling and I'm superior and it changed the entire shoe market now athletic shoes are probably the best selling shoe and only a tiny percent of them are warn for athletic activities and then it all started in the in the 70s with with pre Fontaine and then of course Nike had the amazing campaign with Jordan which was more unquestionable proof you know making them feel super because they got the best basketball shoe and sell the dream that they're going to be able to fly Like Mike so that was a a world changing campaign that not a lot of people think about when they put on their kicks every morning you know you know one of those that's I feel like is happening right now in a small way um so you remember like I don't know 10 years ago or something like that those Vibram Five Finger shoes were like getting popular do you remember those yeah so like you would see one and you'd be like what is this person wearing a foot glove like what is this thing and then they would immediately go into the spiel about why this is better for you and like how they do whatever and I think this is like I I've seen this a lot now there's um a popular YouTuber or or Instagram guy called knees over toes guy and he's basically like it's like a rebellion he's like have any of you ever been told when you're working out like don't let your knee go over your toe when you're squatting because it's bad form he's like [ __ ] like um I had all these knee surgeries nobody could tell me how to fix it I fixed it myself because I started training that way specifically so it's like a rebellion against the fitness industry then he's like a rebellion against Nike cuz now Nike's the big bad like the incumbent and so he's like uh Nike shoes are like wearing high heels um you you know you shouldn't have uh these like huge heeled shoes you should have low Drop flat shoes basically and so he came out with his own shoe but also there's just like a bunch of these Brands now that are kind of like uh flat more like you're walking barefoot uh barefoot shoes like you're walking on on the ground and it's funny that like now Nike is the big kind of status quo that they want to rebel against and point out why why you shouldn't be wearing Nike shoes because of this other reason do 5,000 doctors agree that the Nike uh you know cushion is actually bad for you so yeah so uh you know big one was uh MacBook launched this ad that was called 1984 and it aired during the Super Bowl and it it uh was a big Rebellion against IBM everyone was using these ibms and MacBook came out and they're like we're the new thing you know and I think I got the idea from this Volkswagen ad right here so Volkswagen when they came out I think it was uh in the 60s all those cars were huge you know you think of like the 60 uh7 Chevys you know these huge cars that you couldn't get into a parking spot and had all this extra stuff on them that you didn't need they came out with this think small campaign that absolutely crushed it and it was like the the Hipster statement at the time was to to drive a VW bug you know and made it one of the bestselling cars um there's another ad that just came out from someone who's a master of this that's Trump so this is another video that that I would suggest you play if you can because it's really fascinating and they show Hillary talking about how the Trump people ha have to be deprogrammed have you seen this ad it just came out like two days ago no I haven't seen it so what what is it with Trump taking a commanding lead and bomic hurting American families genius Hillary Clinton has come up with a way for Biden to win there needs to be of formal deprogramming of the cult members formal deprogramming of the cult members deprogram deprogramming mult members a brilliant plan and here's what that would look like heay attention Joe Biden will defeat him is the answer this did not happen Biden has done an amazing job amazing job but there's one small problem the basket of deplorables deplorables Deora deplorables working Americans aren't idiots and they know who's on their side to American workers watching their take home pay shrink and watching inflation destroy their family and their lives to all of you I have your back I'm Donald J Trump and I approve this message wow that's so well done I mean love him or hate him that the man is a master marketer and he just rallies his base to to rebel against uh you know the the in um incumbents what's the word the the elites the kind of the status quo yeah do you think uh like in this case do you think Trump has input on any of that or this is just they hire some Ad Agency that does these things like is he the master marketer or he's hiring Master marketers I mean he he he makes the sound bites you know that sound bite I think was live from a speech that they plugged it at least it looks like it was and you know a lot of times these speech writers they think about that so there's a famous uh um speech Bama did yes we can do you remember that speech yep yep of course that was a huge one when when the speech writer first presented Obama with yes we can Obama didn't like it he didn't want to give that speech he thought it was too basic he's like I don't want to repeat the same thing over and over you know the the audience deserves something more intelligent and they had to convinced him to do this yes we can speech and present it as a rally cry and finally like okay fine you know it goes out and gives a speech and that's sound bite man I think it was uh will I am turn that into that music video that went crazy you know right it's just uh a really powerful sound bite and and I find that the best politicians end up speaking in sound bites makes Trump so effective at what he's doing the Blogger Scott Adams if anybody wants to kind go deeper on this the Blogger Scott Adams who created Dilbert he when Trump was running in 2016 and nobody thought he would win Scott Adams was one of the first people I saw that came out and was like of not only can he win he will win in a landslide which is what exact which is what happened and he explained he goes Trump has verbal kill shots um you know he has these phrases that he'll say about opponents where he'll be like um low energy Jeb Bush and then you can never look at Jeb again and see anything but low energy and Jeb's so offended by it that he feeds the energy into that uh like you know he starts to be flustered by it and then he starts to try to up his energy and then Trump Pat him on the head be like well at least you're trying now Jeb yeah that's good you're trying to pick up your energy I like that and he would just destroy candidates with like you know crooked Hillary um you know and he would just just brand people in a one shot kill with with with these phrases and even the one you that video you just showed that kind of I have your back like you know he he's very very good at just repeating simple messages and and branding himself one way and and positioning himself against the others the other way all right so the 80s here's a a Force for good so did you know uh Sean the phrase uh have one for the road do you know where that came from no but now that I think about it kind of a [ __ ] up phrase huh so I would think that the the worst use of that phrase would be go and have one and then go drive but it actually meant take a beer in your car and drink it while driving away from uh wherever you're going right so drunk driving was out of control and a c uh uh campaign was created friends don't let friends drive drunk and it had three things to do drive your friend home have your friend sleep over or call a cab you know and this cut drunk driving in half it it it was something like a 40 to 50% uh drunk driving decrease when this started going around that's like U Craig if I say the phrase this is your brain on drugs what do you think of yeah you think of that fried egg a powerful demonstration right an egg hitting a frying pan sizzling like and that was how long ago that was like it had to been I was a kid like I was that was 20 plus years ago and it still has hijacked my brain where if I if I see an egg I think about drugs or if I hear this is your brain on drugs I hear the egg right like uh that that is so powerful how that worked these powerful demonstrations are Unforgettable you'll never look at a sword and not think about the sword slicing through the bullet yeah there's something about it that that really sticks in in the human mind maybe it's a way we are taught how to learn you know uh I have a I have a daughter now and she's learning physics not the way I think of physics and it's not something I thought but you know you have kids too you see how they learn the way blocks fit together and gravity and all of this you know it teaches you a lot about how the human brain learns and if you think about what these demonstrations are they're they're really physics demonstrations so it's like that's how we've been learning since age zero you know and and right we need that foundational physics to survive and you really notice it in babies like they need to know that if they're crawling and there's something here that it's going to hurt if they hit it like it's so basic but the kids don't know that they actually have to learn that you know and you think about I I always always like why don't we remember anything before we're 5 years old and I think it's because the brain is optimizing to learn physics I think the physics are just so important you just like we don't need memory right now physics are like fundamentals man if you don't know physics you're gonna [ __ ] die like just you know walking down the street right right so it's all physics I think these are like new physics lessons that that we find really fascinating um you know what else people are really interested in is these uh they call them ASMR videos oh% soothing things that are happening we did this as an ad for my Ecom brand so I was watching Tik toks and there's these Tik toks that are these soothing ASMR things the ones that uh I was watching were like a bottle there there's a bottle filled with Sands or Mar sand or marble marbles so I think it Marbles and it would they would roll the glass bottle down a set of cement stairs so you hear like the clink rolling like a glass bottle rolling sound then you hear the clink as it hits the stair and then by the second or third stair it cracks and then you hear marbles bouncing like in synchronicity like down the stairs and for some reason these view these videos always have like 10 million 10 million views on them just because they're like oddly satisfying to watch and people just love that combination of the visual plus the sound and so we took that and we remixed that with our product basically we we we integrated it in with our product so that the video starts with that rolling thing and then we just sort of hijack the video and show our product upon the smash and way more people watch that than if we just start with our product even though it's a complete bait and switch that's interesting yeah I mean if you go up to someone on the street and be like hey do you love physics do you want to study Physics like no but that's actually not the truth humans love physics we all love physics we're obsessed with physics and it starts at a zero so interesting so yeah so this this uh add to prevent drunk driving did the you know all these these same things and it worked so okay so here's a a modern story so 2010 when we were were starting golden hippo my brother comes to me and he says hey have you you heard of probiotics and and I hadn't and I was like what are those and he he says well you know you got all these bacteria in you and I was like okay what do you mean he's like you know your microbiome I'm like what's that you know he goes on to tell me that you know you you take these probiotics which are good beneficial bacteria supposed to do something right so I take them and I started having a lot more regular poops I don't know who what I was eating before but they started working and I was like why why is this affecting me I'm a pretty healthy guy I'm in pretty good shape um this is this is actually helping me out and I started looking into it and I realized that all of these Foods I was eating that I thought were healthy because they said uh low fat or whatever on them had sugars or artificial sweeteners or things like that pumped into them from the food companies and they were on the name on the labels under different names so you don't know what they are you know like super Gros or um right you know agave nectar things like that you know like you you and it could say zero sugars on the label but the ingredients have these substitutes yeah yeah but it's got Agave it's got corn syrup it's got like you know natural fruit juices you know all those things are are sugars and so I started digging into this and there was some shady stuff man there was some some experiments done where like like you know the suar companies would would pay a farmer to uh uh you know food is very expensive for livestock and and Farmers always dreamed that they could give their livestock sugar instead of food and they they'd be able to use that as a nutrient so they could stop this big food expense and like they do that they try it and the cows would all die you know and then they try to okay well let's take the food and let's add sugar and see what happens and then the cows would still die you and then they they bury the studies right and the the artificial sweder things were even worse so there was a company uh GD surl that invented uh artificial sweetener called aspartame it's now known as neutr site what a lot of people don't know is when they he came up with this artificial sweetener they knew it'd be a billion dollar product um because the sweetener Market had already been built out they started testing it on lab animals and that lab animals were growing tumors and the scientists got popped for the first time ever that um the government filed criminal charges against a company for falsifying studies because the scientists were cutting the tumors out of the animals and sewing them back up and saying oh no tumors here and they got caught doing that wow and so I found out about all this and I was just like completely mystified and so I wrote this presentation about this and I talked about probiotics and how a way to combat the artificial sweeteners and sugars that are being pumped into your foods that it'd be impossible for you to uh discover them all you know is to add good bacteria because those um you know the bad bacteria growth that that happens because of all this consumption that makes the bad bacteria get really frothy um need to be offset by good bacteria and so I put this video together and it went absolutely bananas so uh it was seen by probably uh you know 100 million people it's hard to track uh but um the last we checked there was over 100 million and this is in a period of about four months Joe Rogan tweeted it out and someone wrote they're like Hey Joe do you realize this is a actually an advertisement for a probiotic and he wrote back oh yeah you know I didn't see that till the end I tweeted out before I I got to the end of the video but you should go watch it or something like that you know um and it it created the biggest uh probiotic brand in the world at the time and it was because of this Ed educational component showing people that the your food supply is messed up and you have something called a microbiome that's getting affected by your food supply and one way to Aid that is with with probiotics and so if you look at the Google transl we didn't have in the 20s you know I'm sure if we could do this for Google for the 20s and look at like you know uh cigarettes right you see like the big spike after the the uh Easter Day Parade right um or VW Bug you'd see the big spike uh after the uh the think small campaign well we have this now so if you look at probiotics you know probiotics were gaining some steam here and here's where um our ad comes online is uh Keybiotics was our brand so look at the general Spike and probiotics okay so what what happened there well you can see basically the day we get kicked off of Google and it goes down and uh you see the trend line line goes down too um but then you see it it it goes back up again and you know this is what we launched our next probiotic brand perfect biotics uh you know did did okay it wasn't the the huge Banger of success that that Keybiotics was but fear not met a guy named Dr gundry in 2016 we launched the brand with him and look at look at these Spike wies look at the probiotic Spike lines compared with with the term gundry and the reason syn gundry and some days is when the the campaigns would be running really strong you know the the videoos running running a lot that's where the the searches would go crazy and that was because Dr gundry is out there with with our educational presentations talking about the microbiome and talking about probiotics and prebiotics and really just educating the world on this stuff and you know we didn't bring probiotics to America or or anything like that uh but I like to think we were probably a company that taught more people than anyone about the microbiome and now you know the probiotic Trends uh you know keeps keeps going and I think it just keeps going uh up and to the right if you if you find the the current data you know and by now the uh Market has changed you know I talked about uh I did a Twitter thread a ways back I talked about the three stages of a product market so there's Clueless which is when you need to create uh the the the marketing wave because your your Market knows nothing about the the product right so back then when I started no one knew anything about probiotics so if I just said like hey here's probiotics try them out no one would have cared but I started with something they did care about was was like hey is your digestion messed up are you having irregularity at the bathroom well here's the reason why and then the next stage of the market is um is curious where someone's probably heard the term probiotics and and you can jump R and so while my ads in 2013 2014 were starting with Digestive Health I had an ad in 2018 I believe it was and the headline was doctor says throw your probiotics in the trash and enough people knew about probiotics by then they were like oh that's wait wait I heard these are good for you you know right and then you click on it and it goes on to talk about how most probiotics don't have enough strains of Po see and also you know prebiotics are important and this and that you know so that's just knowing the market where it was and and where you need to jump in and then the next level the uh Market is is saturation and that's kind of where the probiotics Market is now I'm not launching new probiotics uh you know every time I go to conference someone comes up to me they're like hey I'm launching a probiotic I me good luck you know it's it's pretty commoditized by now but there's still some that have have broken through with with strong campaigns amazing and so see these are the seven High Jacks I'll read them out here so number one make it about them so that's make it about the customer and the benefits that they're going to get number two make it an event that's the um you know nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd um then number three is a powerful demonstration so that's the PT Barum that's the elevator uh with the axe that's the sword cutting through the bullet um that's the drinking dirty water um show unquestionable proof so that's using experts like doctors or uh influencers Plus um you know like you said he was willing to be in the elevator while the thing was cut you know that's a demonstration of proof five change a daily behavior and I think this was change an existing daily behavior um is that right or is it change any daily Behavior I mean it could it could be either you know okay so and so this is like bulletproof getting you to add something into your coffee something you already doing or like breakfast uh having a hearty breakfast as the start of your day versus you know just a c coffee in in a in a bread roll yeah so he hijacked Dave hijacked the daily behavior and what we did with probiotics is we change the daily Behavior we uh encourage them to take something every day so then six is sell the dream that's the the movie star smile that's underneath that film if only you would start brushing your teeth or this is uh Craig pooping regularly because he now takes uh you know probiotics prebiotics that's the dream and then number seven is help them um uh be a rebel or feel Superior and so that's you know be able to to stick a middle finger to the man whoever the man is whether it's Nike or it's uh you know women not having equal rights or whatever um give them the tools and the badge to to feel like they're Superior and uh in a rebellion a part of a rebellion that's right amazing well said well said you're you're uh good student yeah well this is I mean the stuff that's in here is um I guess like this is rare in two ways number one I took marketing classes in college and I had marketing professors none of my marketing professors had ever done what you did they never created a category they never did a billion dollars in sales they never sat there and crafted um you know even this presentation when we talked three days ago it was going to be like marketing throughout the decades no and you were like no that's not going to be the title I got to think of something good you come back with seven seven human hijacks how marketers have hijacked your brain and I'm like oh God just seeing you go from two days ago with no title or a shitty working title to like a really strong title is seeing somebody in action or hearing you what you did with the the probiotics market so number one the opportunity to have a teacher who's actually a master of the game is so rare so obviously I'm sitting up in my seat I'm paying attention number two any one of these like I'm thinking as you were talking my brain was like having almost a hard time listening cuz I'm firing ideas for any of my companies on like oh a powerful demonstration how could we show this in a way that's exaggerated and would would would almost be kind of shocking or add some drama to what we're doing versus just saying the feature or saying it's good like now how could we like do do a powerful demonstration that would give people unquestionable proof right so I couldn't even like stop my brain from moving while I'm doing this now that's I don't know that's the entrepreneur in me but I think there's a lot of people who are listening that are like that that like if you paid attention to this even one of these hijacks could like literally like change the trajectory of your company so anyways I appreciate you putting this together this is kind of a this is amazing to me um I don't know how other people going to feel about this but like as as the only student in the room right now I was uh you know I'm pumped about this this is this is great well I I appreciate the kind words and you know if they as they say if you can change the life of just one person right then your job is complete so I'll take it all right well you did it this has been a master class uh for sure so thanks for thanks everyone for watching that's the pod [Music] h

all right today I'm going to answer the question that I get the most often which is that if I was starting over again from scratch and I had no money in my bank account I didn't have any special skills or network or people that or audience to to use how would I do it how would I make myself successful how would I make my first million if I was starting over from scratch again I'm 25 years old and it's 2024 what would I do today and um I'm G to answer this question I will give you an answer to this question I'm worked up as you can see because I got an answer to this question [Music] I want to give you an observation about this question because the question is actually I think we would all agree it's a money question it's a success question how would you make it that's really what people want to know but they always add this if you were 21 years old again if you were 25 years old again they add this age component to it which is sort of funny cuz um I don't care if you're 21 you're 31 you're 41 if you're broke you're broke if if you're not successful you're not successful it doesn't matter what age you are it is your day one you can't go back in time so really it doesn't matter what what how old you are you know the the reason I think people say if you were 21 again or 25 again is because they're like if if all the possibilities were on the table if if you had all the Hope in the world again at that age and the reality is one thing you should take away from this is should always have that 21y old mindset you should always have the belief that the my whole world is in front of me that my best days are ahead of me that anything is possible and that I can reinvent myself right now um I could today on the spot reinvent myself and to decide I'm a different guy now I do a different thing I do things a different way that old guy he's gone he's the old me and so I think the first thing to do is to Free Yourself of the time constraint uh the age constraint which only adds pressure and doubt and anxiety to the equation which none of that helps you be successful I remember when I was 29 years old and I had this like ex existential crisis cuz I was like Oh I thought I was going to be Forbes 30 under 30 and I thought I'd be you know have a million dollars in my bank account by now and I didn't have any of those things and then I was like all right well guess that didn't happen moving on and I just continued on and by 30 all of a sudden I sold my company and had a whole bunch of breakthroughs and a big part of that was just getting the weight off my shoulders of feeling like I'm behind or playing catchup instead I wanted to be playing offense and so my question my answer to this question is comes from a place of offense so let's take the age out let's think of it like it's karate or white belt again if we started as a white belt and we want to make our way up to a black belt in the game of success what would we do so let's break this down into smaller chunks um I the best metaphor I have or our best framework I've heard for my career was that everybody goes through three phases in their career and the three phases are number one learn earn and Legacy so this learn earn Legacy framework that your career will go into those chapter the beginning of your career is generally the learn period is when you got internships or you're just starting your first business you're making a bunch of mistakes um or you go work at a bigger company just to see what it's like and you're getting you know you're getting your experience that's the learn phase of your career what's most important in the learn phase of your career is what you optimize for so one job offers you an extra $15,000 the other job offers you $155,000 less which job should you take most people take the one that pays them the extra 15K a year which is like 9k after taxes or something like that and and even though the other job would have been a far better learning experience for them that they were going to get way more hands-on experience working with way smarter people on more interesting projects which in the long run would have paid off in a much bigger way so why is it important to know you're in the learn phase because you know what to prioritize your key kpi is how much learning per month am I doing how much am I growing per month as a person I'm building me as a product right now that's the learn phase earn phase is now I've bu built myself as a product I have the skills I know what to do I understand the market and I can actually go and I can reap what I've seed so I can actually extract some value now I have cash in the bank which lets me get to the ultimate point of Financial Freedom where your money works for money and you work for you that's where your Investments generate enough income you don't need to be doing any job so that way you can just work on whatever you're most interested in whatever you're passionate about whatever you love and so the earn phase comes next and then there's a legacy phase which is where you see a lot of people get to when they you know they want to go to Mars and then they want to uh you know buy this newspaper company to keep you know or start a foundation or go back and teach at their college or whatever it is legacy is how you give back it's how you remembered for doing something that's beyond yourself contributing and I think this framework is a good framework for a career and I think I think it is the Natural Evolution of a successful career that's the first first thing I would keep in mind so those first 10 years and I say 10 years 10 years sounds like a long time but um you know what's the phrase like we overestimate what we can do in a year and we underestimate what we can do in 10 so true um the first 10 years you are in the learn phase you are actually just uh dabbling so we are told that we should um stick to it be determined do blah blah blah that's the wrong advice uh it's the same bad advice that gets you when you're 18 19 years old to declare your major um I even love that they call it declare like I'm going to be like yeah you know chemistry right like you know what are we do based on what based on what experience I'm a bio and chemistry major I knew nothing about any of those I didn't even know what jobs they create but at 18 years old I'm supposed to declare my major or fall behind silly and so we don't want to fall into the silly traps and pressures that people pigeon hole you into so what are you going to do for your for your major what are you going to do for your career um what you know what what field are you in the answer is I'm dating around right just like we date before we get married you want to do the same thing with your career so you're going to be dabbling so you should be expecting to I don't know every 18 months turn over and reinvent yourself and hop into a new situation to keep challenging yourself and what you're trying to do is not you're not trying to change you're using change to find the thing that you are uniquely capable of and that's the next key lesson I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better so the second thing I would do if I was starting over again is I would realize that I'm in the learn phase I would start dabbling and I would be trying to identify my Edge this really breaks up into two categories the first Edge is one that everybody who's not successful yet has which is you're small and you're helpless and what that means is that people will help you like I can't tell you how many meetings I got with amazing people how many opportunities I got how many times I got to Shadow somebody or ride along with somebody because I just told him like Hey I think what you do is amazing and I don't know the first thing about it um I I don't know how I can help you I want to help you someday but at least I can help you because hey it always feels good to give back right to help somebody out I'm giving you that opportunity can I just can I just figure learn this with you will you will you show me how this works and um being small and helpless is a absolute Edge that most people who are unsuccessful try to hide they're embarrassed that they're not successful they're embarrassed that they're starting at the beginning and because of that they throw away one of their best edges which is that people want to help people who are at the who are beginners and so um Embrace that you're a beginner that is part of your Edge the next thing is you got time you're not busy so for me there are so many opportunities I don't do because I have a $5,000 an hour time budget so if something's going to cost me an hour it needs to be worth at least $5,000 but when I was younger I would have done I did Psych studies I would go take a pill or go you know try to read from this card for $7 an hour right my hourly rate was much lower back then and so I was was willing to do a whole bunch of things that other people wouldn't do because I'm not busy my calendar is clear that's a huge Advantage you have that's another part of your Edge Another Part Of Your Edge you have nothing to lose and by the way a lot of this is mindset because the actions you take are Downstream of your mindset right like the actions you take which is what people want they want the answer what I'm giving you is a way for you to always get the answer so you don't need to watch a video like this you can be the guy who makes videos like this and how do you do that you figure out the mind first so that then the actions come quite naturally so let me finish the mindset section then I'll tell you the actions so the mindset the next part of the mindset that matters is you have nothing to lose so just like you're small and you're helpless just like you got a clear calendar and nothing to do you also got nothing to lose you're already lost you got nothing you're starting at rock bottom but that's a pretty solid foundation and what you want to do with that Foundation is take more risks than somebody who has something to lose for me now if I go do something I have my reputation people can see me fail I have to do some things of a certain caliber and that means me I might be overlooking some Hidden Gem type of opportunities um you know I don't go to conferences I don't go to certain meetings but you should if you're in that Boat Boat where you have nothing to lose because you got everything to gain um the last thing is you now need to find your personal Edge so those first ones are the the common edges of losers right the losers Edge and losers have those edges and you should embrace the losers Edge because the losers Edge is what helps you become a winner now you need to find your personal Edge your personal Edge is going to be the thing that comes naturally to you it comes easy to you maybe you're funny maybe you don't mind grinding things out when everybody else gets fatigued maybe you're maybe you have an eye you have really good taste and and you know even though you're not a great designer or product Builder today you can identify great design and product building and understand it and taste is a it could be part of your personal Edge my friend Chris Williamson told me this today on a call he goes um yeah you're like a bear riding a unicycle I go what he goes um you know a bear that's cool but not all together that special a unicycle that's cool but not not not that special AAR writing a unicycle that's [ __ ] amazing and so AAR writing a unicycle is a way to think about finding that unique combination of things that makes you you so for some people it might be that they are a really talented programmer but they also love to study anatomy or biology and they should actually go into that field the crossover of computer science and biology for some people it's that they're just really good with they're a really good people person and that's cool but now how do you pair that with um you know you're you're willing to work twice as hard as the average person or you love sports or whatever it is you try to find an overlap of two or three things that are true about you that create a unique combination for me for example I'm a successful business guy but I'm not the most successful business guy right there's people who are worth hundreds of million dollars I'm not um but I'm more successful than 98% of people on the business side but then I'm also kind of entertaining and funny I'm good at talking and there's a lot of better talkers than me but they're not that successful on business side there's a lot of Better Business people than me but they're kind of boring when they talk and so my overlap is some combination of I love you know creating content I love being curious about things and turning into content I'm good at talking and I'm successful that became my first million a podcast that really nobody else could host it was unique to me it was my bear on my unicycle and um I only found that when I started following my personal Edge and so you want to find your personal Edge and if you don't have one today don't worry that's okay you're again you're a blank slate ask your friends what are some things about me that are true where am I more above normal people or more than normal people when it comes to some area of my life maybe other people can see it for you or maybe you say look it's my opportunity to develop that I'm going to become a great writer by practicing I'm going to become a great salesperson by practicing and that'll be one of my things so you want to create your personal Edge all right so you've decided you're in the learn phase you're dabbling you're discovering your personal Edge all right that all comes together and what happens the scoreboard still says zero because the scoreboard is this lagging indicator of how many companies you've sold how many millions of dollars you have in the bank um but you are building up you are not actually at zero you have made a ton of progress but there's still one more unlock that you have to do and that's picking the right project so what projects would I pick if I were in this category there's a a general question I'll I'll I'll give you some like common questions fork in the roads that people come to so a fork in the road I often get is should I start my own company or should I um should I join an existing company and get experience that way and smart people will tell you both things right generally people just say the thing that they did and they say that's the best way to do things um so you know I think the real takeaway is that either way works which one should you choose well again when you're optimizing for learning there's a really specific thing you're actually trying to do you are trying to get around the smartest and most ambitious people you can doing the that also want to do the thing that you want to do it doesn't matter if that's you're a musician and you want to uh then you should be hanging out with other musicians that are trying to make it um I have friends that are big ticktockers or viners or YouTubers they all moved to LA they all moved into houses together or on the same street as each other and they hung out with other people who were super driven at the same thing that they wanted to do it's why I moved to Silicon Valley and that's one thing I would do again I would pick up and move to a place where I could find other people that are just like me chasing the same dream as me because that is contagious and you'll be sharing information so you won't just be learning your lessons you'll be learning from the other people around you and that it will become normal to see people succeed at doing this it's very um underrated how important that is to see other people just like you that you know are not so much more special than you succeeding at the thing you want to do it's what will keep you going even when times get tough and so that's the first thing you're trying to do you're actually trying to pick either the company or the job that is going to get you around the smartest most ambitious people that want to do the same thing as you want to do for me that was starting a startup and moving to Silicon Valley for you that might be joining whatever this generation's Google is um you know and and getting around really smart people that have all flocked to this thing right like open AI or one of the one of these companies where a it's a talent magnet for young ambitious um motivated people the next thing you need to do you got to pick the opportunity whether it's a job or your company or starting a company that will let you do actual work versus being an observer On The Fringe so unfortunately for most people they go take a job at some prestigious company and they think ah I'm getting the experience because of course working at Facebook in 2024 is like you know that's I'm getting experience but their employee number 42,000 Sitting On The Fringe not even knowing what's actually going on inside Facebook not getting any access to the real problems and so whichever path you choose for me I chose the path of starting a company and that's the one I would do again but if you choose even if you choose joining a company here's your criteria you have to be working on the A+ problem every company has the A+ problem at any given time sometimes the A+ problem is we're getting sued and we need to deal with this sometimes the a problem a problem is our growth stopped and we have no idea why and we got to get this thing back growing again sometimes it's we're growing so fast we can't even keep up with operations hey can somebody go move to Atlanta and spin up our Atlanta office cuz we need uh we need more people in Atlanta right like I know people that were early at Uber this was what was going on Uber was working they couldn't even keep up with demand and people who made millions of dollars and became really smart at Uber were people who were like yeah I'll go move to Kansas City I'll I'll boot up Kansas City as a market and they're like do you have any experience with Kansas City they're like hell no couldn't even find it on a map didn't matter they were willing to go work on the A+ problem I'll give you a personal example when I when we got acquired by twitch um they were like your job is they bought our orts platform and they were like you're now the director of Esports Sports okay cool supposed to work on this orts thing and my friend said something to me that my co-founder Fon he said something to me that stuck with me he goes he was he was looking at the overall company dashboard and he's like they're making some I can't say the number it's not I'm not allowed to but some huge number starts with a b and ends with a illion um in revenue and so they were like he was like don't you think that when we're here you know I don't know how long we're going to be here our vesting date is is a year from now like don't you think we should work on something that at least moves the needle 5% like the way he said it was wouldn't you feel like a [ __ ] if we worked here for a year and we didn't even make a 5% swing in the company and I was like I would feel like a [ __ ] if that happened you know I don't now that you say that I can't go back to just working he's like do you think the thing we're doing right now can swing it by 5 per. I was like hell no you know like this is that that's not what this is going to do this is going to do these other things but it's not going to do that and so we basically went on strike from day one and we were like we're just not going to do work until we figure out what is the A+ problem what is the thing that actually matters in this company and we're just not going to busy ourselves until we find that and luckily had a big company knows nobody knows what the hell you're doing anyway so the first two weeks I was just walking around asking people questions trying to figure out what actually matters here and I found a project that was like actually a big project and we pitched it to the CEO and we're like hey this is a big problem do you have anyone who's solving this and he's like no it's like cool I'm free he's like you're free I thought you're supposed to be working on the thing I'm like nah but this is bigger right and he's like yeah it is bigger and so we he created a special team and we ran it to do that thing and we actually made a big impact um this happened again I remember when I was at twitch and the top streamer on Twitch was this guy named ninja he got sponsored by Red Bull and he was like the star he was on TV all the time and fortnite was in it tday and ninja was the guy and then Microsoft came and paid ninja like $20 million to leave twitch and go over there and we lost our our biggest streamer overnight it's like if you know the warriors uh you know if somebody came and took Steph Curry off the Warriors just paid him and he left it's like oh [ __ ] and it was an oh [ __ ] moment I said well that's probably the A+ problem right now so what did I do I dropped everything I was doing and I started working on that nobody had told me even what to work on but I wrote a memo I said hey it looks like he left here's some data analysis on how big of a problem that is or how little of a problem that is here's my strategy recommendation on what we should do and I just send it to the CEO right when in doubt put a letter in the CEO's mailbox and he's like this is great here joining he put me in three group chats right away which were like the team the ex teams that were working on that and he's like hey you know Sean's in on this and they're like why he doesn't he's supposed to be doing this other thing it's like he has good he has good thoughts on this and so there's a way to work on the A+ problem even if you're in a big company or if you're an entrepreneur by definition you should always be working on the A+ problem it's forced and so I learned that skill because I first started my own companies and I knew you just got to always be working on the one big thing what's the one A+ problem right now so that's the second principle you have to do during this early phase so what would I actually do I would be be whether I start my own company or Join one I would be finding a way to work on the A+ problem at all times the last one is I'm creating luck I'm creating a landing area for luck and I want Lady Luck to come when she's flying by to see the surface area on my back and say that looks like a good spot to set up camp for the night and how do you do that well I heard this great thing I've said it a couple times in the podcast but you know what great things are worth repeating there are four levels of luck you got to be aware of them and then actually manufacture them so luck is not something that happens to you it is something that you can create and increase the odds of happening in your life the first level of luck is just blind luck that's the one where you didn't do [ __ ] you just got struck by lightning all right fair enough nothing really really you could do for that first level of luck except for appreciate it when it does happen sometimes things truly do fall in your lap but that's rare second level of luck is you're taking a bunch of action you're just doing a bunch of [ __ ] and then good things happen to you and this is fortune favors the bold and so you should be looking at how do I I just do more things show up to more events uh make some introductions for people uh you know just publish an analysis of something on the Internet and maybe somebody smart will read it and think hey this guy's awesome I would love to meet him you know these are the things you do to create luck content is an amazing way to create luck so if I was 25 again I would be creating content in not because I think I could create a big audience in fact I almost think that would be a disservice if everybody's now listening to some 23-year-old 25-year-old who's got no experience no track record of success like I'm not trying to present myself as a thought leader what I would be trying to do is publishing my thoughts which puts pressure on me to have good thoughts and go learn some [ __ ] in order to hopefully have a small group of people who are interesting think that I'm interesting and that increases my surface area for Lu so I'd be creating content on a regular basis publishing my thoughts I think um when my intern came on here the episode called you know my intern uh my 18-year-old intern became a millionaire one of the reasons why why is because he said that he either he wrote it or his friend wrote an analysis about a stock why the stock was good and like of course you're 18 years old what do you really know about stocks but it forced him to think why this could be a good buy and he published it and then someone interesting followed him because of that and that became a lunch and then that guy became his investor and like all this series of events played out because he was putting his thoughts out there on the internet and I think that's just like a core thing I would be doing on a regular basis but not to become popular and not to I always say you don't want to be well- known you want to be known well so I would not be trying to be popular and get the biggest audience possible I would be trying to put my original thoughts and most unique analysis out there so that the right people find me the people that I want to be known well by because that's how new opportunities are going to happen Okay so let's say I've gone down this path for me that would be I would start a company well what company it'd be any company where I feel like there's a um you you know a problem and a solution fit for me now that would be a service company I didn't do this at the time but with the benefit of hindsight I would say cool I would do some basic envelope math I would say well I want to have can I have 10 customers paying me $10,000 a month 10 customers now $10,000 might sound crazy but like for a business business to spend $10,000 on things uh but I would say that would be my Benchmark 10 customers paying me $10,000 a month that's $100,000 a month of income which is [ __ ] baller if you missed that part so if you're doing 100K a month you're doing 1.2 a year you're doing the work mostly so it's you know 90% profit margin you hire one or two schleps to work with you and now you know you're 85% profit margin you're making a million dollars a year profit that would be my goal of what I'm trying to get to now what type of service would I would I do well I would work backwards from what's a service that I think I could pull off that um doesn't I would not limit myself to my skills so what I would do is I would go on upwork or I would go on Fiverr or I would go I would look at other agencies that are already existing I'll try to figure out what is a agency or Consulting service that people are willing to pay 10K a month for on a retainer like on a recurring basis that either I could do myself or I could hire people overseas um to do them right like I'm an investor in Shephard you can go on Shephard you can say hey uh I want web developers in ladam that I pay a th000 you know I pay a th000 to $2,000 a month and then you could create a web development agency then you could go and you know what I would do is I would go and I would email everybody every real estate agent in my city very easy contact information to F I would say hey um I was on your website it doesn't look great but um you know hey look at this example website this other guy his website's awesome um I make awesome websites like that if you ever want to want a website like I'm happy to to do it for you or hey uh you know that's probably a lower ticket item that's probably like you know $500 a month and I'll do that for you and you get way more people to do it or you go to a senior living facility and you say hey guy who runs a senior living a nursing home uh you know if you've ever met people who run nursing homes they're not the best at marketing they're usually like older people who are in the hospitality business maybe the real estate business and you'd say hey um I'd love to sit down with you because I think I can help you fill your occupancy in your senior living facility because I know that's in occupancy is directly translates to cha-ching in their ears and so occupancy rate goes up means more beds booked means more money for them and I would say if I could bring you one new occupant per month um what would you be willing to pay me they say well well we make $6,000 a month off each person so I would pay you their first month rent i' pay you six grand for every person you could bring in you say fantastic so I just got to get you two people a month and I'm making 10 over 10 grand a month off this one facility and then I would figure out how to create content or do cold calling or do lead gen or throw events or go to the hospitals and partner with people and figure out hey hospital when you kick people out when they're still old and sick but you don't keep them anymore where do they go and they're like oh we just all send them to this one facility and I'm and I would say hey how can I get you to send me those leads because um we have a great facility to take care of those people and so I would I would go find an industry that needs help getting customers and I would help them get customers either through their website through their Facebook ad they're marketing whatever and I don't need to be an expert because you know what's it to to a blind man the one man is king that's what I would go look for I would go look for the blind man I would go look for someone who's running a senior living facility is probably terrible at marketing probably doesn't know how to run a Google ad and so if I just sit here for eight hours on YouTube I'm pretty sure I can become the smartest Google ad person in their life and that's what I would do and so I would try to figure out a way to do this product productized agency and try to get to that 100K a month uh bar and I'd be okay at the first month getting to 1,000 a month 4,000 a month 10,000 a month uh but slowly but surely be be trying to build up to that to that level and the math I said earlier about 10 customers paying you 10K it doesn't matter whether it's 10 paying 10 or it's 20 paying five or it's 30 paying three I could do this all day by the way um you are just trying to do math to get figure out how do you get to $100,000 uh dollars a month oh okay I need to be able to service let's say 25 customers do I think I can find 25 humans on Earth that are willing to pay me 4 grand month to help them get more customers yes right like that's what I would do um and then by the way I would take that agency and as soon as I get it to 100K a month I would go try to sell it because I'm doing let's say 800 to 900k a year profit and I would go try to sell that for four times profit and I'd have $4 million that's what I would try to do um all right so now let's pretend I'm somewhere in the middle of that process and I get a little bit of money here's a common mistake people make get a little bit of money you get 10 20 grand you've been listening to podcasts from Schmucks like me and you're like oh I think I should be investing um Angel Investing S&P 500 Bond what's a bond and you start trying to come up with some like Financial strategy complete waste of time um you don't want to be making 8% on $80,000 a year it honestly doesn't matter if your goals are to be a multi-millionaire successful person who's going to do big things in their life of course if to you $8,000 is like the jackpot then do that but most people listen to this podcast that is titled my first million are not going to be happy at that level they're trying to be in you know the seven figure eight figure nine figure club and so how do you get there you get there by not wasting time and energy on the wrong things the wrong thing would be you have a very small principal amount of money and you're going try to earn a you're going try to beat the market and earn a 12% or 15% annual return on $42,000 it just simply doesn't matter so the advice the good advice you'll hear here about this is well um you should invest in yourself and so most people hear that they're like yeah you're right I should invest in myself and then they're like where do I put the money where the [ __ ] does the money go how do you invest in yourself what do you do um most have no idea what you actually do and so here's what to me investing in yourself means let's break it into three categories category one buying back your time so the first investment you want to make in yourself is to get your creative energy back so when you're doing life you're unfortunately forced to do a bunch of Life [ __ ] and life [ __ ] sucks away your creative forces uh life [ __ ] is running an errand doing a return having to go um you know take the bus to the airport because you can't afford an Uber ride whatever so the very first thing you're going to do is you're going to identify any area of your life where you are leaking Creative Energy spending time on something that you a don't enjoy and B doesn't make you money you're going to buy that back so you're going to be a 24y old with a housekeeper and people people are going to think you're spoiled you're going to be the 27-year-old who doesn't return the blender that doesn't work because it's not worth your time to go to the store and drop it off um you are going to buy back your time you're going to hire an assistant overseas for $800 a month using Shephard promo code Sean in order to um buy back your time and not have to deal with tedious back and forths of scheduling or whatever it is um if you're doing a product eyes service you're going to hire a designer so that you don't have to do the design work anymore so you're going to buy back your time that's category one of how you actually literally invest in yourself um category two how do you invest in yourself you invest in the knowledge as Ty Lopez likes to say and the knowledge is of course books you give yourself an unlimited book budget but you go beyond that you're going to buy your way into a um you know any conference or group or member members Club where you know that people who are where you want to be hang out and you're going to get around them more often because proximity Is Power and the more time you spend around people who are the way you want to be the more you will automatically through osmosis become like them um the third one is so you you've bought back your time you've bought your way in to being around proximity around other people that you want sometimes that's moving to a better location it's conferences it's membership clubs it's masterminds whatever three is invest in yourself uh by leaving money on the table oh [ __ ] what is he talking about that sounds smart that's some that's some Uno reverse card [ __ ] right what how do you invest in yourself by leaving money on the table you invest in yourself by saying no to clients that are going to waste your time you invest in yourself by taking a lower paying job with a badass person right let's say I take 25k less to go work for a badass person which by the way I did um I took a multi-million dollar pay cut in our acquisition because in one I was going to get to work with the CEO and in the other I was going to be three layer below the CEO and so I just decided I'd rather be around smarter people um and you know optimize for that and so I believe that what you should do is you should take pay cuts to put yourself in great opportunities around amazing people or working with amazing people um maybe you take a little less Equity maybe you take a little bit less salary uh in order to be with the right people and so that's that's the last way you invest in yourself because you say yeah I left that 25k on the table but I also invested that in being in a better opportunity for myself which is going to lead to good things down the road all right let's move to the next next questions we got a couple left here so this idea of do I try to make a bunch of money first or do I do something Mission oriented um which is the Justin May's quote um first get your nut then do something Noble um I believe this is true this is the life version of put your oxygen mask on you before you put it on your kids like like you see here on an airplane so I think there is a certain threshold of success which is youve built skills you know how to build [ __ ] you know how to sell it right you know how to figure out a product and you know how to Market it so you got to build that core skill set it doesn't really matter whether you're selling you know um you know these cans or you're selling uh lifechanging you know Pharmaceuticals it's kind of the same thing you need to build a core skill set first don't don't worry about the product in that meantime the second thing is going to be um you need enough money enough Runway to chase a noble Mission so like if you go try to chase a noble Mission but you don't know where the rent comes from every month um you were going to lower your odds of success pretty dramatically just because you didn't give yourself enough Runway to go do something bold and audacious and ambitious of course don't fall into the Trap of perpetually waiting the next year maybe next year I'll have enough time money experience to go do the thing I really want to do I believe you should always go do the thing you really want to do I don't think the thing you really want to do has to be a noble world changing Mission um especially at the beginning and so I wouldn't put that pressure on myself so to summarize my answer on what I would do if I was young broke starting from scratch again in 2024 I would break my career up into three phases the learn earn Legacy I would um spend my learn phase dabbling trying to find the thing that I really love to do that I am uniquely good at so it's that zone of Genius the thing the market wants that you're good at that you enjoy doing uh the bear on the unicycle and you you try to find that thing I would take advantages of my edges I would identify my Edge and I would take advantage of the edges of losers um during that time I would optimize around getting around the smartest and most ambitious people I can find I would do the actual work the A+ problem I would create luck I would not worry about investing I would only invest in myself along the way and that is as I get a phone call that is my answer of what I would do if I was starting over from [Music] scratch um yeah so I guess I just start a marketing agency
