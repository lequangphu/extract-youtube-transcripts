all right look Sean here I don't want to toot my own horn but beep beep this is this is a this is an interview that somebody else did with me uh David Pell who you might know online as the writing guy he uh invited me out to San Francisco and we did an interview for his podcast called how I write and my episode is doing so well so well it is I have this little Chrome extension this thing is doing 11x 11x means it is 11 times higher performing than his normal video something good is in this video that it's doing 11x on YouTube and it's all about storytelling it's all about writing uh it's stuff that a lot of people ask me about but I'd never have taken that time to sit down and talk about it well David got me to sit down and tell you everything that I know about this stuff um I hope you like it I was a little sick during the interview but it was my Michael Jordan Flu Game I came I came prepared and I brought the heat um I'm really hyping this up and it's because I'm excited about it I'm really proud of this interview it's doing really well a lot of people are messaging about it so we want he asked David hey can we run this on our feed um you know we took the took the episode from him we're going to run it on our feed it's basically an interview where he's the interviewer and I'm the guest talking about storytelling and writing so if you like those two things you're going to like this episode all right enjoy this episode with me and [Music] Dav story is a 5-second moment of change whoa what do that mean you want to work backwards from the em the only things people will share is things that are LOL WTF OMG all here now the broadcast so like what should I do next time I sit down to write the real great writers I believe are great at framing their ideas oh interesting so Mr Beast Steve Bartlett Dave Chappelle Huss minhaj those are the people I try to learn from you know I could teach a 30second master class it's just this Shan Pur is one of those guys that I really wanted to learn from I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to tell better stories by listening to good storytellers but Sean has really deconstructed the storytelling process and you hear people saying all the time oh storytelling is really important you should get really good at it but there's not a lot of people who come in with concrete clear Frameworks like he does so this is a masterclass on storytelling come on in it's time to roll I said this to you when we first show cans but this podcast was probably the biggest increase in terms of how much I've admired a guest and how much that's grown through the prep process and so I just want to compliment you on that and in particular there's a lot of things that you do really well in your writing that I'm not good at and this is one of those episodes where I just have a bunch of questions and I'm here to make my writing way better and the place I want to start is storytelling I have no Frameworks for think about storytelling before you do storytelling can I give you a compliment on your compliment yeah so great compliment first of all very specific uh but the second is actually it's a writing tip which is I didn't the thing you said where you're like you know I started kind of going down your rabbit hole and my like whatever respect for your whatever you said like my uh whatever your score went up a lot during that process uh I learned this from these two guys Dylan and Henry they're young guys they were like 21 when I met him and they were recording these videos I was like how many views do these get and they were like oh nobody watches these and I'm like but you guys are like really trying like is it like someday somebody will watch these he's like yeah specifically we're creating a binge bank and I was like what's a binge bank and he goes it's when you basically stack material so that like even though each one of these if we just looked at the view counts it'd be kind of discouraging like H not that many people read this or watched this um but they were like we started to think about it differently instead we said all right each one's not getting that many views but I'm creating a bank where if somebody ever said I'm curious about this guy I want to learn more what is this guy all about that in the next hour you would walk out with like my reputation would be way higher with you right like you would feel like you know me you would like me you would respect me and it changed the way I thought about that and so then I because I used to not I used to like be like very um result driven it's like ah if it's not immediately paying off it's hard for me to get excited about it but when I thought of the binge bank I just thought oh I need to create this library that if anybody like if David is going to do research he's going to spend an hour or two hours going like down the rabbit hole I need to leave a little breadcrumb trail that by the end he's like I love this guy I'm all about this guy guess where I ended up guess what like the final thing was which was like the shebang of all right I totally old blog post that I probably forgot about as my guest it's like that 40 page PDF with all your main principles that was like the pool I swam in for the longest and I ended up there yeah who knows but like that's the you leave that trail you could proba I should probably do it better but like this idea of create a binge bank I think is so much more valuable than a resume or portfolio it's like people will come knocking they will get curious about you and like give them away to uh to just binge your content like it's a Netflix show and by after two hours they should feel like you're the man that's that's a goal I think people should have so what do you do to do that intentionally well the first thing is like you don't get discouraged by like how small your thing is today that was like the first part which is if you create something and the feedback loop is not quite there you're either going to just willower your way to keep going you're going to be a very wise person and say results take time I'm neither of those things bad at willpower and not that wise right like I I kind of know that's the answer but it's so it's a way to trick yourself and um the way to trick yourself is to say oh yeah this one thing it doesn't have to like go viral for this to be successful this is for my binge bank I know the idea of a [ __ ] b is important I want to have that as an asset that's there for me so what are the 10 things that somebody should go cons asse and I started paying attention to that and and started putting that together one of the things that you are very good at is that I feel like you're just good at learning skills putting names to them and this is a good time to dive into the storytelling so I guess that you had this whole day you're like oh I'm going to go check out Aaron Torin and he always comes back to like this one core principle tell me about what you've learned from storytelling and then maybe even like the meta of how you learned new skills the story tell thing is cool cuz you know I think everybody intuitively know storytelling is a pretty dope ability and I look for this mismatch between things that have a lot of value but you're not taught or even better it sounds kind of lame to say you're working on it like if I find that I'm like oh this is a good one uh another example of that to me is uh enthusiasm anybody who's been around somebody who's like got high energy enthusiasm you like that person that's inherently like a it's a very likable trait of course there's over-the-top obnoxious version but it generally you want to air on the side of have energy have enthusiasm those are people you want to do projects with work with be involved with but nobody will ever be like yeah I'm practicing my enthusiasm right like I'm practicing this um that sentence doesn't even compute so if there's a thing that has value that other people don't practice or try at uh and even better it's like almost taboo or lame to say you do it I've found that those skills are actually like premium skills to me cuz you almost like differentiate yourself in the marketplace store storytelling is another one of those joke telling is another one of those like if you're like um I am working on like getting funnier they're like are you trying to be a comedian no like you like funny people though right like of course everybody does whether it's relationships work content creation whatever you're doing if you're humor level if you're more humorous people will like it better nobody practices so it's like what do you expect just you know to magically happen like we kind of know everything comes pra everything is Downstream of practice so storytelling is one of those skills where I knew that I loved it whenever I met somebody who's a great Storyteller I wanted to get better at it so then who's the best in the world of this right that's the next question one of the people that came to mind when I Googled around was Ain sorin and uh he's written you know famous TV shows I even West Wing news room The Social Network movie it's great for writing dialogue and in these interviews he says this thing he's like they're like What's the key storytelling like can you teach a like a three-hour Master Class he's like I could teach a 30 second master class like like it's just this it's intention and obstacle and he said it even better he goes I worship at the altar of intention and obstacle and I was like I don't even know what the hell he's talking about but the way this guy's serious about it tells me like I need to go dig in what is he talking about so what does this mean intention and obstacle is just at any given moment the the hero of the story whether it's you or someone you're talking about has to have a very clear intention what do they want and under that is like why do they want it how bad do they want it what happens if they don't get it right that's like goes into intention and then obstacle like who's in the way right so you know Harry Potter wants to live what's in his way Voldemort trying to kill him the most powerful wizard of all time is trying to kill him right intention and obstacle and basically if you watch if you read any story or you watch any movie you should be able to pause at any moment and just point at the screen and just say what's what do they want right now and what's in their way and if you ever go like five minutes without that being clear people will lose their attention will Drift Away and so um once I realized that I made that the central premise of any story and what I realized was that this was a incredibly powerful tool it is the fundamental like building block of Storytelling and um the more interesting thing which we could talk about is it doesn't have to be life or death all right everyone really quick if you've heard this podcast before you know that Sean and I think that the most important skill set you need in business is copywriting and so what we did was we went through all of the podcasts that we've done it's like 500 of them and we found all the best copyrighting tips our resources our Frameworks our templates we aggregated all of them into one simple document so you can skim it all and get everything that we've ever talked about with copyrighting it's in the link below it's awesome check it out so most people think of it when like the example I even gave was Harry Potter trying to live and E most evil War are trying to kill him okay cool but you can shrink that down and actually you get bonus points when you can do intention obstacle on a lower Stakes moment so I wanted a croissant and all the places were closed but I need my croissant you need your croissant and the but the audience has to believe that you truly needed it and you got to tell them be like you got to make them believe that you really wanted it ideally because you actually did right you know you don't have to fabricate the story it should be real I'll give you an example I was at a um like executive offsite uh my company I just got acquired I got put on the exact team of this now like 2000 person company and I don't I feel a little bit out of place like I've never worked in a company bigger than too many people and I wanted to use storytelling to kind of like as a crutch as that's one of my tools in my toolkit how could I use this to better myself all right so um we're supposed to go around the circle and like say what's been going on uh or like what's something what's this what's something recently that happened that you want to share with the group some BS like uh Icebreaker and every single person just did it in a work context oh we're working on this thing but then this person on my team has did this problem or quit or whatever oh we're working on this thing but then legal said this it's kind of like boring boring boring and uh I was like yeah recently uh had a big moment big day and uh okay pause right get people curious I said um I just moved out of the house I was young right so I was like I just moved out of the house I'm living in my own place I've been living there for a year now but I've never invited my mom over and my mom's in badging why don't you invite me over what she doesn't know is I'd never invite her over because I don't want to I don't know how to host she was always the host if someone came over I don't know how to do adult things so people are kind of laughing right cuz I'm but I'm like I was like I had been trying to get her to like treat me like an adult but the reality was I'm like I'm not I'm actually still a little little boy right and so I'm telling the story about how my mom comes over and I decide to cook I decide to cook brussels sprouts the most Adult food there is problem is don't know how to cook brussels sprouts something I'm doing it blah blah blah and I tell the story of cooking the Brussels sprouts and I just kid you not everybody's like everybody's entertained they listen to it during the break everybody made a point to come up and be like dude that bruss story was hilarious um that was so that was so funny like what was that and what even just happened they kind of couldn't even explain it and for me it was just another example of using storytelling even on low stakes moments actually builds likability and um fandom more so than the dramatic I was skiing and there was an avalanche that's cool but it's unrelatable and actually there's something fundamentally unlikable about it and I want write uh usually if I want to write something it's because I'm trying to whatever I'm trying to have fun but I'm also trying to build an audience of people who like me or are fans of me or get customers who want to you know buy my product or whatever I try to use likeability for that it was interesting I was at a sort of a very fancy dinner like multi-billionaires house and it was one of those dinners where everyone is like you know people had flown in for the dinner and there's like an Olympian who's sitting across the table who was was like a big fan of growing up and and we're all going around doing introductions and it's my time to do the introduction so I'm nervous I really want to impress everybody like one of my childhood Heroes 00 2 o' right and uh I you know sort of pp myself up and I talk about hey this is what I do for a living and I'm like I crushed it you know man everyone love this and we're we're hanging out after after dinner I'm back in my apartment My Buddy goes yo you did the worst job ever like that was a horrible intro it's like what are you talking about every word to the Bone like have my on liners like ready to go crushed it he's like no you were just trying to sound impressive in a moment like that you tell a funny story or you make a joke and you lighten the mood you did exactly the wrong thing right yeah that's uh first of all great friend to say that great friend can we call that out and you're you're absolutely right uh I learned this from hust minage the comedian cuz I was going to go on stage I was like hey dude like you do this for a living I don't know do this stuff and he goes you want to um he goes comedy is a low status gang so he goes you know you're going to be up on stage and you're nervous so your natural tendency is going to be to Puff your chest out to kind of project this false bravado but he's like um actually what you want to do is build connection with people and you build connection with people through um vulnerability through uh low low stakes uh through um low status specifically he starts his comedy special I went and wrote it out to try to like understand what he does his last comedy special he starts out he's sitting on a stool he's talking about how intention him and his wife been trying to get pregnant um and they haven't been able to and they went to a doctor and he's like the worst news ever it was my fault my balls don't work basically right like is there a lower status thing as a guy than to be like I you know my junk doesn't doesn't perform also just the way like that that word choice is inherently funny exactly and so you know he's obviously a master at this and trying to trying to learn from people who are like I'm in business I don't try to learn how to be a better Storyteller or better writer from business people why would I do that I would try to learn from the people who their thing is storytelling or writing or entertainment because they're going to be the best at this you know Aon sorin comedians those are the people I try to learn from and so uh I think that was one principle that sounds like you you learned the lesson the hard way too how is storytelling different for you in writing versus speaking it's not that different um in general one of my biggest writing rules is write like you talk um most people have this false uh thing we do I think it's from school like School kind of teaches you like they're like read Shakespeare write these essays you know I need six pages uh six pages minimum you know double spaced you know all this stuff use a big vocabulary all the things that don't work in the real world you learn in school I think what school teaches you is basically just pretend like uh Hey be something you're totally not that's what good writing is in the real world I don't think that's true I think you know good writing is simple good writing is easy to read good writing is entertaining to read good writing has a voice um it's not just like this you know archaic sounding thing um so anyways I you know one of the principles is write like you talk so if I'm going to write a story I will actually say it first and then I'll just write down what I said that's like a starting point for me because for most people myself included if you sit down the like blank page you know of death is like the most intimidating thing it's very hard to even get started but if you are stuck and you just say okay so what is the story like forget the words what are you trying to say I'm trying to tell the story about the one time with the spouts and blah blah blah um cool what makes it interesting all right great um where did it start what's the start of the story well start is when I blah blah blah and what's the end well the end was when this happened all right cool sounds like you got a beginning middle end you know what happened and you roughly hit the outline cool maybe now start writing and so uh WR like you talk is an important principle and the other thing is there are nuances that are different so for example in writing I'll use a ton of like parentheses because you can't do that in uh you kind of you can break the fourth wall basically when when you write but when you talk it would be like me saying um so we were going this way you know we we always take that route right it's like a that's a parenthesis is when you're talking when you're writing it's actually much easier to do um but when you're talking you can use pauses and a dramatic pause how do you do a dramatic pause in writing it's kind of hard to do you have to like use like line breaks or do da D DT whatever right like you got to try that so you some tools are a little bit different but I would say 80 to 90% of it is the same to me have you learned anything about the pacing of a story like the how you drag it out or compress it like does that change for different platforms how do you think about that definitely um you know I think another misconception is shorter the better like you know too long is too boring and actually um you know anything could be any length it just say you can only be as long as it is interesting listen general rule it can only be as long as it is interesting if you can go this long you know a long you know blog post but it's interesting the whole way fantastic that's the right length however you should always try to understand like what is your level of credibility or Buy in with the audience so here in a podcast you can kind of Riff in a podcast you can be like dude what we could talk about something we said in the lobby or be like oh you just had Sam Alman on does he have a bodyguard like we could just not talk about writing for five minutes totally fine however if it's cold traffic on the internet you better have like an amazing headline and a first line that's going to hook people and be right about the match what the headline was because you don't you don't have that reputation with them so if you know your audience's level of buyin with you you can kind of um dance around subjects versus be very direct and immediate and trying to provide value right away um to hook people right away so you know Tik Tok is a platform where you're swiping like and if it's not interesting in the first like9 seconds you're gone so on Tik Tok you see people right away try to say a thing on podcast you'll see people shoot the [ __ ] um and build you know there's a chemistry thing because people aren't going to swipe away from the podcast in in the first 30 seconds it's not usually how people consume podcasts and so you got to know your medium and you got to know your audience what's the level of buying you have how do you think about the hooks for a story like one of the things I've noticed with Comedians and really studied is how fast they're able to build context they can do it in like six to eight words where some people just go on and on and on and on and on it drones and that hook of how you bring people into the story is super important I agree um however I so what is a hook so a hook is basic it's the first thing you're going to say trying to hook their attention great I think actually right now for for the type of person who's going to listen to this you probably have studied a little bit of copyrighting maybe or you kind of pay attention to what like oh this person's blowing up on Twitter what do they do oh there would like you know they write their threads and the first line of their thread is like here's the unbelievable story about how this you know Chinese immigrant took a simple thimble and turned it into $10 billion whatever some like unbelievable sounding of that you're like oh you have to pick it's like maximum clickbait right I actually think that hooks somewhat overrated underrated is frames so what's a frame so a frame is you take an idea and an idea can be this big or it could be this big depending on the frame so I can be like um you know uh what's I don't have a good example top my head but we'll do one that we just talked about that hust the comedy thing right I told a little story about what he's doing in um in his line so I could just say here's what he did at the start of his thing I could say here's what you can learn about public speaking from one of the greatest public speakers in the world H Min right so I could take the same content where I'm going to talk about starting with a low status thing but I can put it in the frame of this is not just for comedians this is actually when you're at a dinner party and you're supposed to make an intro and you don't know what the hell to say um this is how to not make an ass out of yourself you Chang the frame right and so I think that more important than a hook which is just like a grab you by the throat aention Grabber is think about how you're going to frame your ideas hooks are about the words you're going to write frames are about the idea and how you're going to make that idea relevant and how you're going to connect two ideas that seem unrelated to be related the real great writers I believe are great at framing their ideas more so than like just coming up with that perfect oneline hook thing that's GNA like you know just kind of trick the person into clicking yeah let's get super concrete here so you wrote a super viral thread on clubhouse and this was the standard way to do a frame so it says one parentheses Clubhouse existential threat number one time devalue ratio Le let's brainstorm and you're like jargon fancy words like that wasn't me wri that was somebody else exactly yeah I don't like it it like it brainstorm like no storyline and then it didn't do that well and you come in you're like so dot dot dot everyone seems to think Clubhouse is the next big thing but I think it's going to fail here's how I think it all goes down yes why did you choose that so that if you compare the two and like on your YouTube you should put these like side by side so people could see it the other one was written by this guy Chris who created an app that was kind of like Clubhouse went super viral was called secret back in the day I don't know if you remember this it's called secer it's super viral they raised like hundred million the founder like sold some secondary bought a Ferrari like it was like the hit product for like a very short am of time and then it died so if anyone has The credibility to say why Clubhouse might fail that guy was actually the guy the problem was he was extremely dry told no story and just said and use like very like you know 12th grade reading level jargon like Clubhouse is existential threat the the time to Value ratio like immediately felt like homework whereas my thing was everybody thinks X but I think Y and more the most important part was here's how I think it's going to go down not here's why I'm right so here's how it's going to go down is basically like gossip it's story um here's why is logic and rationale so that's kind of why I wrote it that way was and then the rest of the thread the reason this thread got like 20 million people to read it was because I I wrote it almost like a screenplay I was like I didn't say here's the five problems with Clubhouse I wrote you're the founder of Clubhouse first of all [ __ ] yeah you know you're winning everybody is talking about your app your app is cool you know Kanye's in your DMs VCS are throwing money at you and I set it up right like you that's the setup that's you right now and already you know if you're reading that this is not how most business Tech Twitter writing goes most business Tech Twitter writing goes is it it's an intelligence contest and I was telling a story and um and so you know that's why I think it worked I think if I had written it with the you know me trying to be the the 9,000 IQ guy in the room it would not have worked so when you see people say that I'm writing now and I'm like all right I'm not going to do intelligence contest I'm going to try to do exactly what Aon sorin said there's intention and there's obstacle I'm going to frame what I'm saying in terms of story I'm going to focus on the frame and say that my writing still is just like yo this is lame what do you think is going on there that makes it feel dry or like it lacks a sense of momentum well in the same way that comedy is great but not every line should be a joke uh storytelling is great and not every piece of content needs a story um so I think one challenge is like I wrote that one as a story it did great that doesn't mean everything I write online is like this screenplay story type of thing that worked in that situation it's not going to work in every situation so you got to know like the tools and when to use them Hammer is not good if you're just trying to open a door sometimes a key is what you need and so that's the first thing don't just force it in the second thing is like you probably need reps like I don't know I've done this a lot of times that wasn't the first story I've ever written so if you're like cool I'm going to get better at storytelling be prepared like tell a 100 stories starting with maximum cringe and get to nut cringe right like but it's going to take a 100 expect that it's going to take a 100 stabs at this and specifically in 100 intelligent reps so it's like do it and then the next one you have to be like what could I do better oh my Hook was a little weak there or oh you know it droned on too long or I don't really have a point maybe this shouldn't have been a story maybe it should have been something else and so 100 reps where each one you try to say what's one thing I can do better than the last time just one thing that's it and then you just keep going and if you could do a 100 of those then I bet your stories will work it's not going to be it's not going to feel forced because you'll learn the skill through those 100 reps this is the Mr Beast ISM of uh he's like everybody asked me like how do you do YouTube good he I tell them all the same exact thing make 100 videos and every video make one make do something better better than you did before any anything doesn't even matter what it is one thing better than before do 100 then come back and talk to me and he's like two things happen first of all Nobody Does it they all wanted just like some answer they had no no intention of actually going and doing the work and then of the few people who actually do the work they never need to talk to me again by the 100th one they figured it out they're doing great you know like they never come back for advice that's why it's the perfect advice to give someone cuz it's true and it saves both of us the hassle uh you know if you actually followed it yeah what did you learn from story Worthy storyworthy is a amazing book by this like teacher guy who's like this 20 time storytelling champion of the moth storytelling I didn't I didn't even know what this thing was but whatever if you're the champion of something I paid a little bit of attention he's got this book and in the book it's basically how to tell better stories I would say you know probably worth reading the book he's got one thing that I really took which was Stakes so he's like um every great story needs Stakes meaning if the story is intention and obstacle but if you don't make it clear what's at stake for the for the person if they don't get it um then the story is not going to have very not be very compelling so you know when you tell a story let's say it's the and it doesn't have to be high stakes like it doesn't he's actually very again the other thing he says is like don't tell like it calls it like vacation RS so it's like don't just tell a story but there great night you had the party cuz like nobody cares nobody wants to hear about your vacation nobody wants to hear about your cool College party you went to like just fundamentally those are bad Stories the second thing is like a great story is not just I was swimming in the ocean and a shark bit me and I survived like it doesn't need to be extreme and again it's actually almost better if it's not um but you still need Stakes so how do you have Stakes even if it's not a shark biting you off and his his answer was um the stakes come from the emotion so as long as you believe that that other person was going to feel a certain way then the story has Stakes so for example if I'm trying to impress my mom doing the brussel sprouts embarrassment is what's on the line right like I'm going to be embarrassed and my ego is going to take a hit so as long as you believe that that's true for me the story will be entertaining um when it's prop when I actually tell it when it's actually delivered um the other one he says is he goes what is a story story is a 5-second moment of change whoa what is happening a 5 Second so he's like you know uh everything that you tell in the story comes to this one moment this 5 Seconds where the character is transformed you know just I use movies cuz it's easier that most people don't have like a big Archive of writing in their head but like we've all watched the same shows and movies every romcom is like some version of the following uh the guy's a player and he's never going to settle down that's the start of the movie or she's a high powerered lawyer who's doing great in her career but never made enough time for love that's always the start of the story there's only two romcom right like she was in love they thought she thought they would get happily married he broke her heart start of the romcom so well guess what the ending of the romcom is going to be always the exact opposite of that if she was the high powerered lawyer who never made time for love she's now going to be in love and she's going to actually quit her job as a lawyer and be like open up a bakery right like that's how the movie is going to end or if he didn't want to settle down and he was a player by the end he's going to be chasing her and he's going to like propose to her right he's going to want to settle down so spoiler for all romcoms ever and um it's actually all movies ever die hard Jurassic Park you could do the same exercise watch the opening one minute the end is going to be that character the opposite of his current lifestyle or belief system or habits um you know Scrooge hates Christmas he loves Christmas or whatever it's all every movie every story is the same so the heart of the story is the 5-second moment when they actually made the transformation when they switched and it's usually when they lost it all when they had the Heartbreak when they hit rock bottom when they had no choice but to be brave because they were finally cornered like whatever it is right uh you know in Batman when it's like he's in the cave and he's got to get out and nobody's ever made it out I don't know if you remember this part of the Dark Knight or or one of one of the Batman movies and uh the mentor was like only one person's ever got out he's like how did he do it um he's like he didn't use the rope they like May basically he jumped with no safety net and so the 5-second moment of change is the character climbs up the thing takes off the Rope if he doesn't make this jump he's going to die but actually because he was going because of that makes the leap and actually makes it that's the transformation moment everything is based all stories if you don't know what's the 5sec moment of change for the for the main character you don't really have a great story how does this apply or not apply to like the story of a company like if I'm trying to tell the story of for a passage or you know you think of all these companies oh we started in a garage we have no money this what we believe right you have Airbnb you have like the Obama O's and then you have Brian chesky who's like going to the houses and he's like taking photos with his own camera he's like and the hustle it's like these Founders really believed so how does how do we take these ideas and apply it to what we're building the origin story of all silly valy companies is is similar so let's take Airbnb for example what was the you know moment of change uh the moment of change the origin story of Airbnb is we were um broke jokes who had right the beginning of the romcom we were broke jokes not only did we not have a successful company we didn't even have an idea so like we were the worst situation for an entrepreneur no money no team no idea no respect no reputation no nothing right even worse wrong founding DNA we were all designers and the narrative was you got to be an engineer to build a you got to be a developer to build a a te tech company and so um well the moment of change was basically they I think they had no money um like they didn't have enough money to pay rent or something like that so the the moment of change was basically one of them had a crazy idea to be like hey what if we rent out our space here for this there's a design conference in town what if it create a like a bed and breakfast for people who are coming because all the hotels are sold out bed and breakfast we don't have a we don't have a hotel and they're like well we could just put an air mattress here and they laughed and they were like whatever and then three people came stayed paid the money and had a great time and they're like holy [ __ ] this might be a thing and then there's several holy [ __ ] moments right there's like we ran out of money again so we did the Obama O's serial thing we uh they tell the story about when they were getting knocked off by a big um by the Samir Brothers of Rocket internet they were cloning their company and going to kill them and he tells that story it's like we you know fa this life or death death moment and then we had to make a decision and we changed we went from being scared to being like all right we're going to compete with these guys we're going to beat them um and that's the moment that's that's what the each of those micro stories is about the way I've learned this is you have uh it's called Signature stories so your signature stories are the like the four or five stories that if I only could tell you these four or five you would know everything there is to know really about me so for example your Origins story like for you with write of Passage what's the origin story like I'm assuming you didn't just create this cuz life was good you already were good at everything and uh and you know there must have been some moment where you were like I got to do something here will you help me improve my origin yeah give me what it is right now all right so I worked this job at this New York advertising agency and I was super intimidated by my boss he's like 6'4 you know big beard he's just not like super welcoming guy super talented super talented and I wasn't doing super well my job and he sort of calls me into his office and I was working on a pitch deck for cardi I was trying to be all impressive and stuff like that and I wrote in the pitch deck that the idea that we have was going to be epic and he was like yo that is not a good word to be using you're not he said something to the effect of you're not in college anymore we don't write like that here and then through writing that sentence he then started saying hey you really need to improve your writing you're just not a good writer and I was like well you know I tried learning to write in school I don't even like writing my whole job is writing and I got to get good at this so that was in like November then we go through December I get a raise I'm like oh my goodness this going to be great life's going well then January 5th 7 months out of college I get laid off and of course in my head I'm like I got laid off cuz I'm not a good writer uhoh I got to learn this craft but I don't even like writing but then I'm seeing all these people who are good at writing and they're just making moves on the internet and stuff so I spend years two three years and I'm learning how to ride I start building an audience and during that time people reach out to me they're like hey you're pretty good at this can you start teaching me how to do it and I'm like wait I learned all these things on my own I had to figure these things out out of desperation for how to learn how to write then that led into write a passage and that's how the company got started okay great so let's Workshop that cool all right so um let's go back to the origin let's do so there's a beginning middle and end beginning you're start of your romcom you're working in a job you're not you said you're not doing so well your boss kind of embarrassed is you uh and you end up getting laid off act one of of the movie uh I think to make that part just to make that part better so I think you have the element there act three is I you know so we know act one is going to be don't like my job and my job doesn't like me even worse my job doesn't like me right uh second part is I'm not doing so well and I'm kind of embarrassed and I'm kind of intimidated by my boss great super relatable super likable all that um you have a moment where you got specifically embarrassed around the epic thing calling you like a college kid or whatever you're like okay hopelessness um max pay got laid off cool and I'm sure you had some feelings about that act three is now I get paid millions of dollars to teach people writing and I'm doing a podcast interviewing my writing Heroes and they're like dude you're awesome I'm a big fan okay great so we have the element of an amazing Story how do we actually make it better yeah so the first part is your act one you didn't focus on the pain enough the atttention and the obstacle and the feelings you had at that time so for example you said I wasn't doing tooo good at the time and then you're like but then I got promoted or raise so I don't know what that is right uh you know you might as well leave the promotion raise out doesn't really add to the story it's sort of confusing conflicting messages right never let the truth get in the way of a great story let's start with that so why did you not think you were doing well the company was constantly trying to figure out what do we do with this person I I I can't believe this happened but he literally brought me into his office and he goes I need you to stop thinking like Jeff Bezos and I was like can you explain he's like do your job you are a sales guy focus on that I don't want you focus on the the future of media and where that's going and so there's just a lot of tension there and he and I never really got along that well right so yeah I think you want to F I bet you if you zoomed in go back to the memory bank and you remember like any moments where you felt the opposite of how you're going to feel at the end at the end you feel really proud and you've accomplished and you've overcome but at the beginning you probably felt embarrassed you know uh somewhat uh insecure uh whatever so for example if you were like I um yeah I remember there was this new guy that just got hired and I was training I was like trying to like welcome him and train him a little bit and then he got promoted before I did I was like I'm doing something wrong or you know at my performance review I remember there's a category for pros and he had like three words and then cons or whatever like needs needs Improvement was huge right a little anecdote like that I think will like make that more real of uh what was the moments where you said where if you said I wasn't doing so well that it really hit home for you um you know something like that let me just wrap everything we've spoken about into what I'm gathering is it's the romcom I got my beginning I got my end I want a perfect yin-yang between them okay then what I want is I want to build up to those 5 Seconds of change so I want one emotion lead up to that change that is the moment of of of tension where something pivots then I get to the end there is the opposite and then what I want to do is intention and outcome obstacle intention and obstacle thank you so my intention is I want to be good I want to be good at my job I want to be valued I want to be respected actually I could even bring it into like I want to be a worthy human being and I'm in my first job and I'm like dude you have no skills so I have that and I'm like my job is about being a writer and my boss thinks that I'm not very good so now of my obstacle so that's sort of what I'm getting from you right yes exactly you you nailed it um now let's go to the 5-second cuz what you said was basically some version of you're like the beginning was pretty good and the ending was pretty good uh the middle you were like so then I got laid off and so then I started thinking about well I want to improve my writing sounds like an arbitrary Epiphany maybe there was a mentor that told you something or maybe you read something online that inspired you or maybe you had a long talk with yourself on a long walk one night and you were like you know what screw this right probably a moment when you decided actually I'm going to get good at this that's usually a very important part of every story was like what triggered the turnaround um so you want to know that and then you want to explain that part um and then you basically were like and then I got better and then everything was great it's like whoa what you fast forwarded the Montage too fast like what triggered the turnaround and then what did you actually go do um not like in a long specific but like what's the first thing you started to do to get momentum and then what was like maybe some resistance you felt that you overcame because like you know the Pixar rules for storytelling I if you seen this 22 Yeah the most important one I don't know what the 22s say but I remember one which was um something like the hero doesn't have to win um the audience loves the hero because of the way they try and that was really important to me I was like oh that's right every Underdog Story is lovable because of how hard they try and if somebody just try something and immediately it works that's not a very good story and you're not very like you don't feel good for them so you got to say what you tried what resistance you felt and then how you overcame that resistance it doesn't have to be a long thing but you want to make it feel real uh and the last thing I'm I'm kind of emphasizing to you that I think anybody can do in their storytelling is um you're not saying what happened you're zooming into moments to explain how you felt with ideally some relatable visual or audio like moment so it's like I remember he said this to me and I'll never forget these three words he said you know like whatever some some sentence or I remember looking around and you know there was nobody else there like to Tony Robbins I'm a big Tony Robbins fan he does an amazing job telling his story and he's like I remember sitting in my apartment I looked in the bathroom and I was doing I had because I used to do dishes in the bathtub because my my dishwasher didn't work so I'd soap up the bathtub and he's all he's trying to say is I'm a loser I was a loser now I'm super successful why because I'm Tony Robins and I figured it out and you can too but but first he has to convince you that he used to be a loser otherwise the whole Tony Robins stick doesn't work so he's like how do I convince somebody I'm a loser I could say that I wasn't doing too well or I could say that I used to have to wash my dishes in a bathtub because that paints a picture of a loser he's like I remember I was s then he says I was s in my apartment and I didn't have any furniture because I didn't have any money so I just had this one chair like I didn't have a sofa I had a hard chair that I used to sit on he's like it was just a chair he's like and I remember uh the a song was playing that was like there's some song where he's like I don't have a friend or something like that it's only me in my chair and he's like dude that's me it's just me in the stupid chair and he's like so I went for a run he's like even though I hadn't run in years I was overweight I went for a run and even when my lungs were burning I was like no you you may be a loser at all things in life but you're not going to lose this run and he tells the story and it's kind of inspiring when you're hearing this and he's just zoomed into one moment that's visual that's audio that's a feeling and he's convinced you of that before state so that the after has some impact the two things that I'm getting there there is first you can tell a story a story is not a record of what happened absolutely it is not you saying this happened this happened this happened this happened it is almost this it's a transformation it's a oh interesting the story is just a change the world was one way and then it was another way I was one way and then I was another way my company was failing and then it was succeeding all the story is is just change you only want to include the what happened so much as it explains how that change came to be um yeah it's not as just a timeline of events and then you're also really queuing into emotion yeah how H that's what like people respond to you know um like in my writing course I used to teach um I used to teach this one thing that I was like you know you want to work backwards from the from the emotion I learned this from uh a guy who used to be my my I don't know intern or something like that I we hired him when he was 20 years old Steve Bartley today a lot of people know St Bartlett he's got a big podcast called di CEO he's built a company he's done a bunch of he's on Dragons Den like he's a famous guy now I met Steve when I was 20 or when he was 20 I was 25 maybe and uh he flew from the UK he lived in our office like slept in our office and he wanted to work with us and we worked together for I don't know what nine months or a year or something like that um and Steve was awesome in a bunch of ways he was obviously just like a 21-year-old in a bunch of other ways but the aw awesome thing I remember was he was like he told me something he goes I just think about what is Jenny in her bedroom going to think when she sees this like who's Jenny who's Jenny what what are you talking about he's like oh like if we're making a piece of content that's going to go on social media social media is Jenny in her bed laying down just scrolling just swiping and she's like basically this has to make Jenny and Jenny like stop think something and share this with their friends otherwise it's going nowhere there was no point in writing this thing or doing this thing cuz it created no reaction from the person they're just going to keep swiping the world is full of infinite content we only stop at things that we have some reaction to and um so I stored that away and then I heard the same idea from another person this is how you know a good good idea the BuzzFeed guy goes everything we do at BuzzFeed is about Debbie at her desk I'm like Jenny in her bedroom Debbie at her desk it's going on here see he goes he goes the most powerful Network in the world is the board at work Network he goes all my BuzzFeed was like growing like crazy at the time he's like BuzzFeed basically Taps into if someone's bored at work and they just want to like you know have a distraction for five minutes we want to make a piece of content that will distract them and get them to forward it to a bunch of other people who are also bored at work right and that's the whole network is the board atwork Network all right second time I heard the idea then I heard the idea third time this gu Chris Quigley he ran a advertising agency that would make videos go viral and at the time I was like going viral is like a lottery ticket like how do you do a viral video I don't know it's just like something amazing must happen so I go what's your hit rate on virality like one out of 100 two out of 100 he goes no like eight out of 10 I go eight out of 10 and he's like yeah look he showed me their their views I was like how do you do this he's like well you know over time the more viral videos you make you have like a base of an audience but he's like that just gets you like some people will see it but how viral it goes is how much they share it he goes so what we do is we work backwards from an emotion he goes the only things people will share is things that are L WTF OMG aww like all the acronyms for all the emotions so like oh my god wow like ha right like if it doesn't do that nobody will share it so he goes we first start with this is the desired reaction we have then we'll write a script or write a write a a blog post or whatever and then we'll go check do we think that's going to create this reaction to somebody no all right let's Juice It Up how do we make it more funny how do we make it more outraging how do we make it more endearing and heartwarming like whatever those are and uh so once I heard that three times I was like okay I get it I need to create a reac reaction out of the average person just in their bedroom at their desk and I need to start with the emotion my target emotion and then work backwards from that write the thing that will create that emotion yeah it's funny because when you write you're like okay I'm publishing this on the internet bunch of people are going to read it you know get a big audience and so you think of hey there's all these people but actually you're just writing to Debbie in her bedroom or Sally at her desk you know and people consume your content alone and when you're writing you are writing to one person in one place at one moment in time and you have to remember that because the nature of the connection that you're trying to make is different and to double down on that idea in a lot of our media environment especially with a platform like Twitter when you scroll Twitter like you're on the throne you're on the bus you're waiting in line you're you know your friends 7 minutes late you're like come on where the heck are you you I'm trying to reservations coming up and you're just sort of browsing browsing browsing and your brain's only like halfway on and if you can really first understand your own State when you're in that environment and then write to the person who's in that state now you have a very keen sense of who is this person and you're writing for one person even though if you're looking you're seeing hey 119,000 Impressions those are not 119,000 people at once like a football game they're 119,000 in individual people at 119,000 individual instances in time and if you think like that you communicate very differently yes perfectly said you're writing to one person at One Moment In Time that's I think a very good point and the other uh thing that this reminded me of is do you know this person Miss Excel have you seen this PR yeah yeah so she um for anyone who doesn't know she's basically like an Excel influencer for lack of a better word um she basically teaches people Excel trick tricks but the reason she got popular she went on Tik Tok she started dancing while like putting an Excel trick on the screen or a tip on the screen um weird combo but it works I was reading some interview with her and they were like how do you create your content like what's what's your process and I was like I'm curious what her process is and she goes uh I don't she's like it's kind of weird she's like um most people if you say what's the process and they're like consistency like wake up at a certain time start right away you got to write every day you got to post at a certain time you got do all these things she's like I don't do any of that she goes I literally first like just Chang my own energy she's like I work she's like I'm kind of wo wo W that way but like I basically get myself into a peak State of Mind like I get myself into a certain mood and a c certain State of Mind where I feel magnetic I feel charismatic I feel energetic I feel she's like it's like an like a it's literally like a science called energetics she's like I work on my energy and two things happen one ideas start coming to me much faster than if I sat down and said what are some ideas I need to post some content today and so she's like I just work with something I say I let ideas come to me an idea will hit and as soon as it hits she's like I run to my phone hit record and I just do it she because I believe all content is just energy transferred through the phone it's my energy shifting to you my emotion that I'm how I feel about this if I feel excited about this Insight that I have or excited about this this tip that I have I want to get you excited about that tip too and the best way to do that is for me to be there first and I think this is a very underrated thing for writers because most writers they're not performers all performers know this no athlete goes on the field without being warmed up and being hyped up no stage performer goes on stage just kind of cold and low energy but almost every writer starts cold and low energy and just sits there somewhat miserably and um and there's even some weird Glory from like this like I don't know this like pain that martyr ship of like how you need to be as a writer I think that's all stupid um I think it's very similar to performing any way I think you should get yourself into a great state of mind and then have that energy and then sit down and write and let it flow and let that energy rip through you so that the the other person who reads it is going to feel the same excitement you have about the Insight or feel the same excitement you have about this plan or whatever it is um you know you want that to come with it and a lot of times when people write they have this idea they're away from the computer like they're at the bar with their friends they're on a walk with somebody else they're Thanksgiving dinner they're like man you know auntie auntie Diana she has no idea what's going on that woman was crazy and you're so annoyed at like 11:00 p.m. at Thanksgiving and then you try to write like 3 days later and the problem is they're not capturing the energy that Miss Excel is capturing before she does the videos and people end up writing in such a sober state that their writing ends up being boring and sterile 100% the thing I said at the beginning of this podcast where was like I look for things that I think are important that other people don't practice Overlook or be too embarrassed to say they're working on this is an exact example of them of one of those nobody wants to work on their like State their energy they don't want you know Miss Excel does she's like I'm going to make myself magnetic before I make content well I like that that's pretty cool I don't I don't know what that means if that sounds provocative right like okay that's better than whatever the hell I'm feeling uh when I sit down to write okay that's a new standard for me I'm going to do that and so um I think most people would probably in their heart believe that this is true that if you kind of got your energy right before you did the thing it probably turn out better nobody's going to do it which is the best part it's the Arbitrage it's how a less talented person like me can do really well wait all do here it's now the broadcast so like what so what should I do next time I sit down to write how does this actually work when I get to dance do some jumping jacks like what do I actually exactly that's exactly right so State change is three things number one radical change in your physiology so you can Sprint you can do push-ups You Can Dance you can um do 20 air squats you can dump your face in cold water whatever it is you will it's the fastest way to change how you feel is a radical change in your physiology it's the first thing um so do that that's that's the very first thing um I have a friend who's a professional poker player he does the same thing he goes during poker players are like notoriously degenerates like you're literally sitting there in a casino which is like the worst air pumped in environment there's no windows and you're around other degenerates all day people are smoking it's bad um he's like a monk and he during a tournament in the breaks he goes in the parking lot and he does win Sprints he's not doing it to be a better Runner he's not doing it to increase his V2 Max he's doing it because he wants to make a better decision when he gets back to the table he knows he makes better decisions when he changes a state and um that's part of his Edge why he's been a European like you know poker champion and uh tour Champion you know several years so first thing is a change in your your um your state the second thing is a change in your focus so what are you even focused on um where like you the way I imagine is I have this laser beam of focus I don't know if this is true but what I've convinced myself which is if I just turn my attention to this I will crush this this will be amazing if I if I put 100% of my focus on this podcast right now oh this podcast didn't stand a chance and the only limit to me is is where I'm pointing the beam and if I'm trying to point it in five different places or whatever that's going to be a problem this also works with like if you have to write something and there's a deadline if your focus is on the deadline it's the wrong place to focus right if your focus is on you know um your uh how hard it is for you to do something if you're focus on how hard it is it's not a good place to focus like you need to focus on the thing you want um so you know don't focus on the wall where you're like trying not to crash like turn right B focus on where you're turning and then the last one is basically your story so what's the story you tell yourself um we all have some story that we tell ourselves and if you improve the story you will change the state of mind that you have so if I go into the sto if I go into this podcast right now in my story is um I'm just I'm doing a f to David I'm just doing this oh man like you know I had to drive an hour to come here and you know this means I'm not going to be able to do this thing and whatever that's the wrong story obviously I'm not going to perform very well I'm not going to be in a peak State whereas if my story was there was going to be someone who listens to this one person one person who's listening to this podcast and they're going to hear one thing that I say one story and they're going to be like wow I can't unhear that that was amazing and that person was going to go on do amazing things and they're going to write me a letter one they and be like dude that podcast you did changed my life I'm going to approach this podcast differently right I the different words will come out of my mouth if my story about what's happening is different so similarly if you want to basically change your state physiology first Focus Second Story third nice one of the moments I had around story that I thought was really revealing was I I work with a coach and we were talking about my writing and I was in a slump I was down and what's a writing slump what does that mean I just wasn't vibing I wasn't feeling it and I just wasn't proud of the stuff that I was doing and I couldn't get inspired and uh he said what is it that you want and I said well you know I I used to write these these pieces these long form pieces that I was really proud of you know what I want I want to be a creative Force I want to be a creative Force that's what I'm going for and I sit down to write I'm like I want to be a creative Force that's what I'm all about and he's like hold on hold on hold on stop stop the train you said you used to be a good writer and you would get in a great flow what did you do back then that you don't do now I was like huh actually pretty simple I find an idea that was interesting I would try to figure out that idea for myself and then I'd figure out for myself and I'd say well then I got to share this with other people and i' just do that over and over and over again and I never stopped that's all I did and that's all I focused on he's like hold on what you're saying is now you're focused on being a creative Force that's your story that's not working for you let's get back to finding an interesting idea not judging the interestingness figuring it out for yourself and then sharing it with others ever since that no more slop right all that was was a change in my story yes amazing uh that's amazing and I think you know the other part of what you said there which is letting curiosity be the the guide the driver um sounds very simple but all great ideas are actually quite simple it's the beauty of them you know there's a I think there's a profound um benefit of revisiting simple ideas and then saying am I doing those um I don't look for for new ideas as much as I look for ideas I've already heard that I haven't fully actualized yet and you know that's one um you've read like Paul gram WR this essay um great work I assuming you've read that one yeah I recently I read it two nights ago so good for the first time he wrote it like a year ago and it was like 13,000 words so I was like I'm not doing that like it's too long well when the student is ready the teacher appears so I'm ready to I'm thinking about what what do I want to work on right now how do I want to do this and I went back to that and in that he he has this great line he goes if I had to boil down all great work into one one word it would be curiosity and he says another thing which is curiosity drives in a level of excitement he goes and excitement excitement is really a great indicator he goes excitement is the engine and the rudder of the boat it's the engine and that excitement is motivating it's it's a driver to get you to go do things but it's also the rudder it also can point you in the right direction if you don't know which path to choose just choose the one that's most exciting just go keep following that and that will lead you to the right place it's excitement is the engine and the rudder um I think is a really powerful idea and every time I've drifted away from that like you did like I start with that good things happen and then I'm like o now ambition is the driver or um doing something that sounds cool or important or money is the driver and then like all the bad things happen and I'm like [ __ ] uh why aren't these working and it's like well because you stopped doing the working formula which was leading to all these great things um because you thought you need needed to like you know you thought you need to do something different and so many people are like oh I hate writing and most of the time it's that they associate writing with doing things that they don't want to do and then when they think about well it's time to write they subconsciously don't allow them to write about the thing that they're the most curious about or excited to write about because in school that's not what you get to do yeah no one's excited about the average school paper maybe one or two things but people just aren't trained to think like that one of the things that I need to reconcile with you and try to sort of figure out because got two Sean ideas and we need to figure out how they sort of come together is this line that you have if you're in your head you're dead love that line so good at the same time you are always deconstructing things you have you find something that you like and you're like hold on what's going on here let me try to break it down okay I'm actually going to go check out this book go talk to this expert try to figure out what's going on so how is it that you are deconstructing thinking being fairly analytical but at the same time not getting in your head those things feel like Polar Opposites to me yeah two things one I read something yesterday uh this like mini book online that was called I think it's called like a technique for a technique for coming up with new ideas it's like some old book um and in it it said this thing he goes the uh the most valuable traits you can have sound like opposites when you know if you pair them together so he goes you know uh imagine an entrepreneur who is both Visionary and detail oriented that's a that's a Steve Jobs for example like Steve Jobs is famous for being a Visionary he he doesn't ask the consumer what they want they just want Faster Horses he you know they want a car actually right that's how he invents you know the iPhone and figures out what to do but he's insanely detail oriented where he's like what is the inside of the box look like and they're like dude Steve nobody's going to look at this he's like I'm going to look at this I will know what's inside the box it needs to be beautiful at that level of detail pixel level detail um same thing for all things right uh I consider myself a creative person I'm also highly analytical with data sounds like opposites um and so there are many things where the exact opposite if paired together creates a like 1 plus 1 equals 3 type of reaction and um they're often presented as false choices you're either this type of person or you're this type of person screw that be the type person you want which sometimes means having both gears and knowing when to go into which gear when do I need to be uh creative when do I need to be analytical when do I need to be hard charging entrepreneur when do I need to be silly playful dad you know paint my nails whatever right like I have to have these gears to have the life I want similarly you want to be in your head at the times it makes sense to be in your head the brain is a valuable tool it just cannot be the master so the you you know I need to be in my head when it's about maybe it's uh analysis maybe it's oh I'm feeling fear I need to actually use logic and ask to myself is this fear even true and what's the probability of that and if that happened how would I handle it I guess I would just do this I guess it's not so scary after all so usually um if the problem is emotion you can solve it with emotion if the problem is logic you can solve it with logic and so I try to use them at the right times the if you're in your head you're dead is basically a has more of a life philosophy than it is a work philosophy which is people who kind of go around life not feeling a whole lot and not being present in the moment they're in their head about stuff uh they're missing life um and that's that's a problem you know more so than than a writing tactic have you ever seen that advice from Ray Bradbury where he says don't think you ever seen this so I heard that what you said here and it immediately reminded me he says I have a sign and my typewriter it says don't sink and I'm like okay that's interesting he's like I'm trying to surprise myself at the keyboard and the only way to surprise myself is once I'm in my head I can't do that and I think that a lot of writing a first draft is like this you're you're trying to get outside of that part of your brain that judges that condemns that says no no no it's not good enough and just put stuff onto the page and you know that you're doing it well when what you're doing is like whoa where did that come from where did that come from where did that come from and then the question is how do you engineer yourself to do that like for me if I'm sitting and typing can't do it like my ideas that for me is where I do editing the thing that was gamechanging for me was voice transcription getting really good because now I can stand and talk talk and walk go outside walk and talk just blab blah blah blah blab half of Austin definitely thinks I'm some sort of like crazy psychopath kind of guy but you know what it's made my writing better and a bunch of people I work with they're like how do you just bang out first draft so fast I'm like cuz I don't sit and type like everybody else does I just go for a walk yeah I think that's a that's a great point I think you need to to figure out a way to engineer that for yourself so you can consistently have it um I think everybody's got a different version of of how to do it what you said reminded me of something though you go um you're talking about ra BR don't think uh I think this is a a very useful troubleshooting tool so when you're stuck there's many ways to get unstuck and one way to get unstuck like I said radical change in something physical you do I me that's a good tactic music is a good way to get unstuck too um but in general a philosophy for how to get unstuck is you're if you're stuck in the specifics go General meaning if you're stuck in the logistics of the how something is going to happen it's not quite adding up what you got to do is not just keep trying to do this you can just zoom right out go super General all right super general what am I trying to do here I'm trying to do this super General um if I had all the superpowers in the world well how would I do this right super General is just like um you know uh who's somebody who's done this before or super General okay I don't know exactly what type of thing I want to write what inspires me right the way to get out of these sometimes is to go General to go uh and so even if like don't think it's hard because very hard to turn off the brain but it's not so hard to redirect the brain and so redirecting it I think is is a useful tool you can redirect it towards I'm going to go rock climb I'm go exercise that'll take my brain off of it it can also be I'm stuck in the muck here and I need to just zoom out and that's it or if I'm stuck in the general so for example sometimes I'm stuck in the general of like what do I want to be in life and like you know what what do I want to do and who am I and all this stuff um specific what's the like what's the best idea you heard in the last two days what like if you were going to write about that what would it be or like what's the most interesting phone call i' I've had um you know then you go specific because you're stuck in the general so it's a very useful thing to do is just like to get unstuck know if you're stuck in the specifics go General if you're stuck in the general go specific and you you'll redirect the brain I want to switch over to talk about voice you're really good at putting your voice onto the page and you do something very specific that I'm not sure how consciously you do this but you're so good at getting inside the head of a reader to understand all right how are they feeling about this in the moment and basically you said earlier breaking the fourth wall and then by doing that building trust and connection and then it creates this friendly casualness as if we're having a conversation that my goodness that is levels away from most from what most writers are able to do have you ever read the Boron letters years ago okay so this is uh mustre yeah uh copyrighting copyrighting I'm surprised you don't have them like printed out of your pocket they're that good so the Boron letters are this amazing thing by this uh like kind of renowned copywriter Gary Halpert I think uh writing to his son and he's in jail so the writer is now in jail he's writing to his son uh Bond I think um is his name and so it's like a series of 23 letters and um I put they're hard to find too it's really annoying they're hard there's like one blog I put it I hosted them on my blog now um because I was like this is crazy that so valuable and so hard to find so anyways um he posted he wrote these letters and he just wrote it again to one person he's like I'm Runing to my son but obviously these were kind of like general principles of life and copyrighting and marketing and he's teaching he's trying to teach him everything he knows uh but the but because of the way he wrote it with such a casual like like warm relationship like he's not even just writing to one person he's writing to his son and because he's writing to his son he's like and this dear bond is where things get interesting where he's like you're probably wondering dad why do you say this we're going to get to that but first a little detour and he just started writing so differently that I was like oo I like this style this is just like has a swag to it that uh that is just like appealing to me um so I started stealing that basically I was like oh I'm going to write like that I'm going to write like I'm writing to one person and that one person is like my little young grasshopper it's like this is my kid or it's my my little cousin or it's me when I was younger it's like uh I know what you're thinking blah blah blah but Mama Mia you're wrong right and I'll just like try to like try to just make it fun and interesting as if it's written to one one one person that has like a warm relationship somebody that's kind of like I want to be the Sensei and they that's how I write in in where it's like a master teacher relationship and other times it's the opposite it's um I'm the beginner and I know that other people are more more knowledgeable about this and I'll be like and I just will be open about that I'll be like so being the idiot that I am I'm going to I decided I was going to do these three things I knew there's probably a better way to do this you probably know four four better ways yourself you're probably staring at this right now wondering how could this guy be so dumb well the answer is blah blah blah right and I'll I'll try to say it like that cuz I'm just trying to make it where I'm trying to imagine what is the reader thinking at this what would I think if I was them and then I try to address that in the moment because it's very frustrating to me when like imagine if you ask somebody this question you're like how did you do it and they're like I just did this and you're listen to a podcast and then that podcast host doesn't ask them like wait wait wait what do you mean it just worked like how or what do you mean he gave you a million dollars why did he give you a million dollars right like it's the most frustrating experience in the world when that doesn't get addressed so in writing I try to do that too like I try to just call out the thing I would be wondering about or I would be skeptical of or I would be excited about in that moment I just try to include it in the the dialogue one of the things that we talk about all the time in read a passage one of my core principles is imitate then innovate and it's exactly what you did there so I asked you a question and you said okay have you ever heard of this thing well Gary Halbert does this very well and then what you did was you deconstructed exactly how he does it and then you said you found a general principle of his work so you said he's not just writing for one person he's writing to his son and then the implications of that are this this this and this and the road map that you took to give me that answer I think is very revealing of how you think about writing where you start somewhere you deconstruct and then you say how does that show up in my own world and then you try to build up a generalizable principle that then you can use for your toolkit whenever you're typing yourself yes that's exactly right uh I think that is a great thing for anybody to try to do if you want to get better at something that's a that's the way yeah by the way I randomly just thought of the best example of framing from way earlier while you were talking which is kind of how the brain works the brain relaxes and then something comes to it um have you seen the Dave Chappelle thing called Unforgiven have you seen this on YouTube no all right so do you remember a while back uh Dave Chappelle was in a feud with um I think it was Netflix and he was like um the Chappelle show was put on Netflix and he wasn't getting any royalties so like it's his name it's his face it's all his life's work and not only was he not getting paid for it he had had a big falling out with the creators of the Chappelle show where like he ended up quitting right when they they the story what the time was they offered him $50 million he said no and he went to Africa and became a crackhead instead that was like the rumor like Dave shelle's a crackhead now and he's in Africa and it was like and he later he was like no I just said no why did I have to be a crackhead in Africa I went home like what are you talking about so anyways here's the objective his objective was he wanted people to boycott the show how do you get people to boycott the show you gotta if you want to drive people to take action you got to be smart with how you're going to uh like how are you going to persuade them through the written word or in his case he wrote it first and then he performed it on stage and what he did was instead of talking about Netflix or talking about his show or saying go boycot my show please he started in a he reframed the problem in a totally different way that I thought was brilliant he just changed the frame completely so he tells the story he goes um I remember I was 14 years old first time I did ever did comedy I was 14 years old I go to this comedy club and I tell this joke and he's like I'm he's I'm admit it I was good right away comedy came naturally to me I'm not one of those people who's like it took me a decade he's like honestly I was good and I was 14 15 or 15 years old I think and he's like I was underage but but I was good and he's like I came backstage and there's a guy who's been doing this for 20 years and they were like Hey kid you did pretty good man that that was good and he's like one guy came to was like hey man I like that joke I have this big audition coming up for this TV show or something like for this other thing you mind if I use that joke and he's like even as a kid I'm 15 this guy's you know bigger older I looked up to this guy he's like I um I didn't want to do it cuz I was like my joke's all I got I got no money all I have is a comedian is my jokes he's like but you know this guy was kind of asking I felt uncomfortable he said he just needed it for this audition so I was like all right man like sure you can use the joke for the audition guy's like all right cool he's like several months later I go to the club I'm about to perform that guy's before me he tells my joke and the joke kills he's like I was pissed and he's like I didn't know what to do he's like afterwards I went up to the guy again I'm a 15-year-old kid I'm like he basically is framing it as I'm this powerless kid and this guy's taking advantage of me and he goes I told him I was like hey man you said you were just going to use it for that thing like I I don't want that I want my joke back and um I think maybe he had give him 100 bucks or something like that and uh and the guy's like the guy kind of roughed him up he grabbed him and he was like I was just asking to be nice you know I could just take it and he's like I was scared I didn't know what to do I let that guy take my joke okay so that's he's I'm gon tell you another story he tells a story about later on he's in New York and he's uh he's like I got a date with this Jamaican girl he's like fine girl yeah banging I couldn't wait to go on this date but I didn't have any money I'm I'm still a struggling comedian but now I'm older I'm 22 24 or something like that he's like and I walk around New York and I see these guys doing like that three card money where they like you know that game and I'm watching it and guy puts down 100 bucks moves the thing around I know it's over here he guesses the wrong one he loses he shows it's over there next guy goes same thing puts down 20 bucks uh I know it's over there he picks over here he loses I'm like God I could do this so I step up I put all 100 bucks down he like I'm going to double this that I'll take them take my girl out tonight I know the ball's over here I say that one Ball's over there he's like what the hell just happened he's like I was pissed I lost 100 bucks I have this date tonight it's like so I stuck around and I watched and I realized those tourists they didn't leave they were still here and they did it again he's like oh they hustled me like those guys are in on it together they pretended not to know it was and I was the mark who came up and said oh I figured this out they got me and then somebody else uh came up and they were about to make the same mistake and I told him don't do it they're all in on it and the guy goes oh okay and he leaves he's like the guy RS him up again and he goes hey man uh he goes I don't care what you think he's like never get between a man and his next meal he's like you just took money out of my pocket this is my job this is my livelihood and taking away a man's livelihood is the equivalent of killing him he tells him that okay cool then he finally gets to the Netflix story and he basically weaves together the parts from before he's like they didn't ask me if they could put it on Netflix they didn't ask me to basically like they didn't ask for anything they just took my name took my face took all my content they just took it he's like and then the second thing was that the people would say well you signed the contract Dave he's like I was a 21-year-old kid I hired lawyers to read these contracts uh they told me think I said this hey you can use this forever in perpetuity in all parts of the universe and they're like it's standard Dave don't worry about it this is standard Hollywood stuff don't don't worry about it so he's like so I signed it later on I realized those guys all go out to dinner every week the lawyers on my side their side they're all in on it this is just like the three card money that's how Hollywood is I was the mark so yeah I signed it but whatever and he got the whole audience on his side by like making this argument by using these two stories I think it is the most brilliant like example of of PR or like a written story that I have ever seen the way by the end of that thing you're like I will delete Netflix if they don't take the show off and it's exactly what happened people saw that that video on YouTube it went super viral because it was so well done um people boycot in Netflix they took it off uh and they Netflix said we don't have to do this day but we voluntarily will do this like we were also moved by your story uh we're not going to put putell up there unless you say we can do it even though contractually we have the rights to do whatever we want we're going to honor the non-contract here I thought that was the power of like you know reframing not like oh I'm getting screwed I want money to like a more Universal you know you're getting picked on by the man you're getting screwed by people who are all in on it and I thought that was absolutely brilliant that's yes you should go watch this thing it's amazing yeah I want to talk about distribution so one of the things that we're working on at R A Passage is what I want to figure out is I want to figure out how to take anybody people who don't write all the time don't really have an audience they've just published something really good like say that you are an absolute expert in like the distribution of San Pino Waters from like the little town in Italy how they where they package it you know what's the story of the label all that sort of stuff and you are like this is how the sparkling water boom came and I'm going to tell the story of how it begins in a little town in Italy with San pelo water okay you have this expert he she never written online they write something it's awesome and I want to help them distribute it they come to me they say what do I do how should I talk them through that I think distribution is built over time I don't think that's something you can do from day one right like uh it's kind of back to that 100 videos thing uh from earlier if you're going to write online there is sort of a um Beach head moment you have to create you have to create a trusted audience over time and you have to know that the distribution is earned why distribution is so valuable because it's hard to replicate so for example my buddy Jason used to say this thing he goes oh I have the one two three rule of interestingness what does that mean he goes tell me one one thing that's interesting right you tell me one thing that's interesting about San pelo I'll say that's interesting tell me two things that's interesting I'll be like those were interesting that's two interesting things you tell me three interesting things I'll say you're interesting and this is just like a general philosophy I think you should have with writing is like you don't deserve that like trusted follow or relationship until you've and three is a small number really on the internet might be like 20 things like you might have to tell somebody 20 interesting things before they're like this guy is interesting I can't wait to get his next one and you just have to build that up like you have to build you have to consistently be telling somebody something interesting um multiple times for you to earn that that you know Channel between them where they're now going to be receiving your content or they'll be willing to vouch for you and spread you to another person not just on the merits of the one thing but because you are interesting and you consistently share interesting things and then when groups of people think you're interesting it's even more powerful right because then another person comes in and just says oh everybody thinks this guy's interesting cool I'll follow right like which is why the more Twitter followers you get the more you're going to get right uh and it's actually not a bug people get mad about that like the rich get richer um it's not a bad thing it's actually a useful mental shortcut the people who have earned to follow are probably likely worth following with some exceptions but it is a useful hack versus I have to individually vet every account to figure out who I want to follow that's the slow way like I'm going to follow the people that other people follow that is it sounds just like oh you're just being a it's part of the herd mentality or group think or whatever but there's a reason it exists there's like a evolutionary advantage to doing it too which saves you a lot of time of having to individually vet every person so I would say to that person who wants that distribution it's cool that's one interesting thing let's do 20 and you know start with your friends start with your friends and family start with some group chats start with some you know maybe you have to push the wheel a little bit you know send it to some people who might find that interesting that you know of with a personalized message of why you think they might find that interesting yeah you're going to have to do some of that hustle at the beginning to get to get the word out but you should also not like have some expectations that just because you said one interesting thing it it deserves to be you know spread everywhere this is not really how it works right on Twitter itself you have built huge audience without writing that many things and you've had a few things that just absolutely cranked what do you think that you understand about that platform and communicating there that other people are missing well I'll say this I think it what I did worked on Twitter so basically I I remember I was at 20,000 followers which is a lot in general but I was like I want to get to 100 now I'm at 4 400 so like oh I way overshot that goal um 400,000 followers but it most i' I say the generic best practice is be consistent and uh Define what your Niche is and then talk about stuff in that Niche I don't really do that so I would say I defy that but I don't think that's what helped I think I almost won in spite of doing that I think if I had been more consistent and I had defined my Niche I would be at a million followers instead of 400,000 so let me put that out there even though I didn't follow the best practices I don't think the right takeaway is those are the wrong I think the right takeaway is it would have been even bigger had I followed those the one thing I did get right was I knew when everybody's attention was on a certain subject I had an interesting take it's not my writing so much as it is the thinking like I'm sure I haven't listened to all your interviews but I am sure one of the most common themes is that great writing is just great thinking clear writing is just clear thinking writing helps you think better and think better thinking helps you write better there are so so tightly intertwined that the unhelpful but true advice is I think I had an interesting thought to say and I said it at the right time when people were paying attention to that subject and then thirdly I wrote it in an interesting way that helped the spread of it I wrote some threat about the metaverse that went super viral and I don't think it's because of how I wrote it I think it's because the thought in it was genuinely a good thought uh like I remember at the time Facebook had just rebranded to meta and Zuck went on on l x Freedman podcast I was like yeah I read this really interesting thing on Twitter blah BL blah it's like he wasn't saying it because my Pros was great or my grammar was great or my hook was he read it because he thought the core idea underlying idea was unique and interesting um and I think that's more what to strive for is like you're building up these two skill sets having unique and interesting things to say being good at packaging ideas two distinct skill sets you can't do only one and not the other or it'll reveal itself to be pretty sh if you just have interesting things to say and crappy packaging you'll get very far if you have great packaging but mundane things to say people get very fatigued of it it doesn't really work one of the ways that I like to judge a writer is like if I like as a measure when I read their stuff is like how good is this person at building a connection with their readers so some writers like let's take chat GPT chat GPT is like a zero right can be super informative right it's you learn a lot but you're not actually building any sort of emotional connection same thing with Wikipedia right and then there's other people like you I think this is something that you're very intentional about and I think that for the average word that you have there is like a real connection that is built I think that you're really focused on that because of your goals as a Creator and how do you go about doing that writing so that it's not going to be just this one and done but so there's actually going to be like a glue of like Sean like I like this guy want to consume his stuff and actually I want to consum stuff every single day when you say connection do what do you mean by that you mean trust do you mean likeability what do you mean I think what I mean is an indispensability from that Creator so I did the lamest thing ever once I hired a consultant who was an expert at personal branding guy five grand that that feels like almost feels like you're not even being serious such framed it as the lamest thing ever I'm aware how lame it was and it's not like I was like oh I want to change my image whatever but I was like well truth be told if I am a creator that means I am kind of a individual brand okay so what and this person worked with all these people so I was like all right let's do this it goes back to the theme of what is something that is super important that people something that's valuable that other people either Overlook or actually would be embarrassed to do totally and your boys out embarassed so I'll do it so I hire this guy and um I sit out and we talk and I'm like okay I learned a bunch of things from them one of the things he taught me with you guys people will follow you to the ends of the Earth if you are giving them a feeling that they can't get anywhere else more consistently than anybody else is going to give it to them so what does that mean he basically was like think of yourself as a little Shopify store and you're only skew you're a little you're a merchant got him your your Merchant your your only skew is basically one how somebody feels after they consume your content so for example um I used to love Ted Ted back in the TED Talks I remember TED talks like Ted Talks used to be the [ __ ] now were so good people make fun of them or whatever 2014 2012 2014 t with the [ __ ] and um or even before that I was in college but they were cool so why do I like a TED Talk even the sound the music of the the whoosh out of a talk or the intro s the sound and the way that it looked it was like this like training like pav pavian training of like you're going to hear one really cool idea in 18 minutes and you're going to walk away feeling inspired inspired about the world in some way inspired to either go do something inspired that the world is improving in some way inspired to make a change whatever and Ted is a merchant of inspiration and so I thought about that I was like oh yeah that's right I I list said comedy podcast why because I get this feeling that I'm hanging out with my like my friends my funny friends but like they're not my friends they're just comedians that hang out but that's why I think comedy podcasts are so popular because they can consistently give somebody the feeling of camaraderie [ __ ] with your boys without you ever having to like actually be funny have funny friends and go hang out right and so like you're getting that without the cost amazing and um so anyways but this is why like you know we got acquired by twitch people watch Twitch people watch other people play video games because you get the feeling of playing a video game without having to actually sit down and buy a system buy the game get good at the game and play the game you get the same Rush watching this guy try to win just by watching it's it's kind of amazing so once I realize that I was like oh okay this guy's right you know what I got to do is pick what feeling I want people to have and then I got to deliver all I got to focus on is delivering that to them more consistently than anybody else is gonna give it to them if I do that all my personal brand dreams will come true um you know so that was the the big takeaway that was the lesson I had there so when you say it seems like you're intentional about it that's what it that's the underlying thing that it is is picking up front what am I trying to deliver what's the what's that feeling and then consistently be like all right how could I do that what's a story I could tell what's a framework I could give them what's a nugget I could give them that would that would do that for them it seems like I want to talk about editing and it seems like your thing is that you're really good at writing for straps and actually you're not like a you don't seem like somebody who's like a eighth revision I'm going to put this away for you know six years kind of guy with editing you seem like you're pretty off the cuff you're sort of like Miss Excel what does thing want to the emotion I want to have I would guess then you sit down you write it then you go away for a few hours you know maybe going to walk come back look at it ship it off right so for you let's bring together emotion editing how do you edit for the sort of emotion that you're talking about there um okay first thing I learned was from Sam par he has his principal I think he came on your show too uh which is the walkway uh so you f you you do the shitty draft you dump it and I kind of knew editing was important and the mistake I used to make is I'd edit right away that's terrible idea don't do that so you first do your research and your thinking you dump your you do a quick brain dump and you got to walk away so you you read it well the last thing I do I read what I wrote and then I'm going to like forget about it so I then will go do stuff so I will go out I'll go play with my kids I'll go for a walk and I'm not trying to think about it at all I know I'll come back to that later and I know it sucks today I'm going to go I'm going to edit it later and make it great I'm certain of that but I don't consciously think about it and then I come back to it usually let's say 4 hours 6 hours 8 hours 24 hours later and I'll read the thing and immediately I'll be like oh this bad bad change this oh why don't I talk about this instead or I wanted it to have this takeaway I don't think it has that right now all right where would I punch that up like I wouldn't have wrote this if I didn't think it had the potential to give you that cuz I was very intenal up front thinking this will do it it's not coming through where uh and the analogy I'll use is like imagine our Rivers flowing so um there's a useful analogy because I think a lot of people are like there's nothing there and I'm going to make it happen another story you can tell yourself is it's a river the water wants to flow my ideas are excellent people are going to love this they want to consume this and my ideas are worth consuming but there's some rocks in the river that are blocking the flow what are the Rocks all I got to do if I just simply remove those the water will flow nice it was a more empowering thing for me versus like I got to make this good it's bad I got to create good it's like no I kind of assume if I got to the point of writing something it's got to be like there's something good in it I just got to remove the suck out of it right uh I think Pixar uses that that analogy too they say uh all movies we make start with start with suck and our only job is to just remove the suck with every draft so they do another revision say what sucks about it now well it sucks that the main character is not that likable because blah blah blah so then they remove that suck and they come back again that's kind of the same mindset so I'll just look at it after after I come back and I'll say is this doing what I wanted do I think this is dope does this do what I want it to do and if not what are the Rocks I can remove what's the suck I can remove from this this part's boring this intro is doesn't really hint what's GNA what's to come this ending is just kind of like so yeah that's it that's the idea I don't have a good ending okay so then I'll just find that area and I'll just try to fix that cool how about with humor what have you learned about writing with humor are you formulaic about that have you studied it that's where I'm looking now like I'm starting to to pay attention um what I've learned so far I'll tell you what I've learned so far as like a white belt in the humor game is just uh you know you don't want it to be humor is the sauce it's not the entree so some people are writing something to be funny like it's this is meant to make you laugh usually that's not me usually it's I'm trying to get a point across but I'm going to make you laugh along the way which will make this more enjoyable for you to consume so it's the sauce on the on the meal but it's not the meat it's not the protein of the of the of the thing which is good depressurizes it it's like oh do apply a little bit here um that's the first part second part is all humor is just surprise so um every joke is a setup and a punch line but the punch line if you see the punch line coming it's not very funny so humorous surprise means I have to set it up in a way where you don't anticipate this is what I'm going to say and the contrast of what you thought I was going to say and what I actually said is what makes you laugh so you just kind of have to look for those moments where there's a bit of an expect you set up an expectation and then you subvert the expectation Jerry Seinfeld article in the New York Times here's how he starts it knew this was going to come in come in clutch and it just came in handy he goes when I got my first apartment in Manhattan in the hot summer of 1976 there was no pooper scooper law and the streets were covered in dog crap I signed the rental agreement stepped outside and my car had been towed despite this I still thought this is the greatest place I've ever been in my life you know exactly sets it up pooper scooper funny work and what's going on there and I think that maybe we can go into funny words cuz it is interesting how certain words have a much higher propensity to be funny than other ones right if he had said there was no law around cleaning up your dogs extren that that now is very pooper scooper is like ji old funny right exactly and then he goes and goes sort of takes her to this other time period you're thinking about poop but then he goes my car had been towed and you're like oh my goodness this sounds terrible and then you said surprise which is why I thought about that he goes despite this I still thought this is the greatest place I've ever been in my life and this is in like this Ode to New York City Theo Von is super um that's exactly who I was thinking about he's super popular right now and he's been great I've followed him since like the real world days basically Road Rules days and so he's if you just listen to him talk like his brain just does something different he's his brain is like almost wired different that was my initial story but I was like I bet you could practice Theo Ving a little bit as because like what Theo does if you've never seen him this not going to make any sense but if you've seen him this will make all the sense of the world which is that the Yon will basically improvise he has no idea what he's going to say but he improvises he uses random language or he'll make up a story that makes that is totally not true but it's kind of believable and he keeps us you know a dead pen face when he's doing it um you can kind of practice that and so yeah I think you know practicing is is obviously the best way to do it well that's a big one let's follow this madeup language coming up with words things that other people hadn't thought of and how do you go about doing that like it's a fun little thing to play around with one of the things that I did is I like the thinking through the ju toos so I wrote a piece about how I fell in love with the Bible and I was like it needs some little bit of humor in it because it's you know it's the Bible right it's it's it's this it activates a part of your brain where you're like okay this is your exactly right Bible should actually just say that should be the whole thing exactly so it activates that I was like I need that's funny so I was like okay what is the emotional state that somebody's in and I was like working on it I was like serious you know you think of almost like this fancy library and then I'm like I would do my Bible studies at a schotsky parking lot in a strip ball in the Hill Country and now you just get this jux position I'm not sure it was like that funny but I think that it adds so much life to the piece and I always try to think of like if I'm trying to be funny or create suspense what is the emotional state that the reader in for most of this piece and then let me just like what you're saying like bring a little bit of Tabasco sauce of the opposite yes yes that's exactly right and I I think you know an exercise you can do is um so like a theovon exercise is basically he takes a thing so let's say it's uh the Bible so it's the Bible but what a theovon humor like kind of Lane he does is he'll he'll call the Bible something else that's kind of funny like he'll be like uh you know he'd be like man that Jesus's binder and he'll be like it's it's the Bible but now he call it's Jesus mind then he'll do another one and he'll be like he's like that old you know like the old Himalayan diary and it's like what what are you saying like he just keeps coming up with different ways to say the Bible or he'll just be like you know that that big brown Behavior book and like he'll just keep going and like I've never done this before but like that you could try that so you could just take anything and be like I'm going to come with six like I'm just going to keep going and it's so hard to do like just now when I was doing it I don't know I was like why the hell are you trying to do this live on a podcast but that's how you get better right so you know doing that is it trains your brain in a very different way of thinking than we are used to and that pays off because again common traits uncommonly together is very very valuable you don't need to be the funniest nor do you need to be the smartest if you're pretty smart and you're kind of funny you're like the best you know so that's that's my whole strategy was basically to do that was like I know I'm not funny enough to be a comedian but I'm funnier than the average smart guy and I'm smarter than the average guy so it's like pretty smart kind of funny that's a good combo well it's funny because uh I went to you know I was at church last weekend and I was with a friend and basically we after the service she was like man you know that was a that was a really good sermon and I was like well what do you like about about the pastor and she was like H you know he does a really good job of talking about very serious sort of like weighty things but then layering in tons of humor right so like he was talking about he was talking about you know you could have said good people go to the light and they're focused on moral values and integrity and bad people move to the darkness and they run away from you know righteousness and stuff and you're like okay that's not right and he goes at any moment you can either be a cockroach or a moth right and I grew up in South Carolina and you know you go into the pantry sometimes and there's some cockroaches on the ground and like you want to step on those things but those things fly and they go all over the place and like they'll start eating your Ritz crackers I swear those cockroaches are so big they can practically pick up the babies and they'll take them to cockroach land or wherever right and cockroaches they run away from the light right and then you have your moths and the moths they go to the light and then he like weaves these cockro and the moths throughout the entire sermon so you're getting this like chuckle but then through the chuckle it's like creating this Avenue for like extreme depth and somehow it's in the juxtoposition of those two things that the surmon ends up really hitting and the humor like lowers your defenses on like needing to be a super you know perfect person and all that and it's like okay we can have some fun here but then the fun actually allows us to then get to the depth and that's framing right he framed it differently same principle framed differently all more accessible uh more fun more more entertaining more memorable and memorability is is massively underrated uh you know what's the point of having the good ideas if nobody remembers them right like you know part of your job a responsibility if you actually have something worth worth remembering is to take the time and effort to package it in a way that is going to be catchy and memorable um my buddy Trevor who was my roommate in college he um he made his whole career doing one thing he basically reads what white papers which are like scientific journals they're the most like boring like read the abstract read the whole study whatever people it's crazy the scientist spend their whole life working on this day and then they package it in the dullest format possible again with pride because that's like a you that's high status High status for them it's like it's so boring that only another person who's dedicated their life to this would possibly read this which means that none of the insights get taken to the real world until you know somebody comes and builds that bridge so he built that bridge he's he would go learn something he'd read this and he'd go talk to the scientists like some you know somebody's been doing this for 50 years and you know the number of people who follow them and listen to them is like you know 35 and then my buddy started writing a Blog and newsletter that eventually YouTube and he built like a 100,000 person email list about a really like dry subject which is like uh you know uh growth mindset uh which is like how it applies into classrooms and stuff like that and so he the way he did it was the same type of frame he's like imagine two tigers one tiger grew up in the zoo um and you know a tiger that grows up in the zoo you know and he does it he'll teach this to like third graders or he'll teach it to the New York Yankees uh you know CEOs of companies or you know kids basically he does the same speech to both of them because it's so easy to easy to understand so memorable he's like T tiger that grows up in the in the zoo has their life been easy or hard pretty easy right do they fight for their food or is it given to them it's given to them okay cool uh jungle tiger jungle Tiger's life hard right lots of adversity they have to fight for their own food they know how to survive blah blah blah if you take a um Jungle tiger and you put it in the zoo what happens they like they'll get bored it's like if you take a zoo tiger you put it in the jungle what happens like it's dead like it doesn't know how to survive and he's basically like you want to be a jungle tiger right like and how do you do that well you have to get out of your comfort zone the zoo where everything is easy and handed to you and so when you reach those moments where you're out of your comfort zone say to yourself like this is my jungle tiger I got to Jungle tiger this right now because I have to go I have to put myself out of my comfort zone to do this he gave them a language to remember a whole set of principles that were all previously packaged in very boring scientific terms you know one of the things that I'm noticing from from you like I always think okay I'm doing these interviews like how is my writing process going to change and one of the biggest things I picked up is I don't need to learn from writers at all what I'm going to do is I'm going to go study Comedians and I'm going to be more deliberate about finding communicators who I really like and then trying to say what are they doing and then bring that into my writing and then also I think that you really see a fluidity between mediums that talking writing humor storytelling these things can all sort of play together and they're sort of like paint colors where yeah you can have you know you have the white paint the black paint the blue paint the green paint but then you can also have like a you begin to mix them together and then you can get all these different colors and that maybe we shouldn't be thinking about writing as like all these separate Lanes actually for a lot of the different skills that you want to learn to make yourself a better writer don't even study writers the best people for that might be in a totally far off field yeah yeah you you nailed it uh good job you synthesized it very very well I I do think it's a good strategy um to basically pick and choose from adjacent Fields because you're going to do something different than other than you will only looking in your own lane it becomes very uh it's why everything becomes the same because we all look at the same things we all study the same things and so like you know I was hanging out with Mr Beast and he said the same thing I was like what YouTube channels do you like he's like I don't really watch YouTube that much anymore like you're the number one YouTuber in the world you like live and breathe YouTube he's like yeah my channel but then I was like so where do you learn from he's like well right now we think that one thing we're weak at is character development so we study shows TV shows and movies that are good at character development or uh whatever and then he's like trying to steal from other areas than he's like everybody else if you're just on YouTube looking at other YouTube you'll just become lost in a just sea of sameness and um I I think that's a a useful tip for people to to take on I want to end here if you know you built a newsletter called milk Road and you had to train another writer to write your voice and you believe that learning to write is actually teachable so when you're teaching other people to write what were some of the things that you focused on uh yeah so we Tau uh the teaching was important because I didn't want that we had to send the email out every morning at like 6: a.m. I was like I'm not doing that like I'm not good with consistency anyways I don't wake up that early uh I know that no matter how fun this is that I will hate doing by like day 30 so from day one I was like I'm not going to write this but it's going to be in my voice and style how do you do that hired a guy who's never written before and I sat him down and I was like um first my business partner I was like you write this and I was the editor I was I was his editor for 30 days and I said cool now you're the editor now you got to hire a writer we hired a guy i' never written before um in any professional capacity or even blogged I don't I don't think he had a Blog either uh but I told him and basically what we did was we took off one thing that helped as the newsletter was a consistent format so it wasn't like 10 different formats it was one format and I broke down why we write it the way we write it line by line our opening line at milk Road was always like good morning this is the milk Road the you know and we would say what we do and then we would say in a funny and then we would would add a we' tag it with a joke so we would say we are the number one source for figure out what happened in crypto yesterday um think of us like um think of us like a toaster strudel a fresh tasty sweet for you in uh treat for you in the mornings and then parentheses we tag the joke again and we would just be like what the f happened to toast of strugles anyways kids these days they're missing out right and it's like we would tag we we' always tag the joke and we'd be like we are uh GM we're the we're the milk road we are we give you exactly everything you need to know about crypto in the morning and nothing nothing that you don't need to know um and then we would say we would tag him i' be like um I would say something like we're uh reading this newsletter is is the second best feeling in the world the first best of course is when you're in a car you roll down the window and you start doing that cool dolphin thing with your hands right like some relatable funny thing that's just like put you in a good mood and we were like can we get them can we get you to smile and can we get you to be like I like I love these guys can we give you a reason to open this that's not based on the Bitcoin price was another way of thinking about it and so we that so I started training I was like the first line this is what we do here's why we're doing it and here's 10 examples of doing it good and then he was like cool got it I can I can pattern match to that the other thing that we did was he was um he was doing the school thing where he's like he thought he had to be a different guy like oh maybe I need to be a really sophisticated do sophisticated analysis or I need to do kind of like people think think when they write they need to do something outside of themselves yeah the whole point of writing is to take you and just push it out and so don't try to create this fake thing that you think other people might want just take you and push it out and so for example he would talk about subjects and the writing was fine but the subject was boring so I was like dude why'd you pick this he's like I don't know I felt like you know it was in the news people needed to know about I was like do you care about this no not really and I was like would you have ever like texted me or slack slack message me or send me a voice note being like dude did you hear about this this thing's awesome or this is crazy did you hear about this this is really interesting he's like no I would never say that I'm like cool why are we telling why are we telling 200,000 people about this if you wouldn't tell me and so what I made him do I was like every morning I want you to send a voice note send a voice M and just tell me the news before you write anything just be like oh yeah everybody on Twitter's freaking out because they're worried about this uh thing that happened or um price is up today because of because there's rumors about this right now and what that means is that if that happened then this would happen so he would just say it to me and it was it was such a good filter because he could stop himself if he was going to tell me something that was boring he would catch himself like I would never say this to somebody it's boring to me and it'll be boring to you so it filtered out the subject beautifully so like those are the two big things was showing him what we do in like giving him a sample and then saying here's what good looks like here's 10 more examples of good um and then secondly installing that one step of like don't do that imp Foster thing where you start talking about [ __ ] that you're not even that interested in cuz guess what nobody else is interested in it like and the filter for that was send me a voice mem if it's not interesting in the voice memory it's definitely not going to be interesting in long text why do you think that dolphin thing is so funny is hilarious relatable and like you know it's it's not even as funny it's just like funny that we put again it's unexpected like why are you writing this um you know everybody says we're the best we said we're the second best thing in the world so immediately like what's first best first best and then I can't say a serious thing I have to say an unserious thing so I'm like the first best thing is this feeling because we all know this feeling is great like you know that feeling it's an amazing feeling and so um we just knew like okay things like that are surprising likable funny you can do them in one line so it's not like you have to like set up a long story or joke it was very useful very efficient as a like mechanism there sweet that was good fun thanks man yeah absolutely thanks for having me [Music] a [Music]

there's two different currencies that I think about constantly one is platforms what are the top 25 platforms that have people's attention doing what do they care about from snap to Pinterest to LinkedIn to YouTube even within themselves YouTube shorts differently than YouTube how did their algorithms work what are their features doing and I think about them on a day-to-day basis and then I think about culture what is the slang what is the things of interest the people of interest and then it becomes a framework of like what's overpriced and underpriced execution so for example Super Bowl is the most underpriced media in the world Verizon paid Beyonce to be in that commercial if they paid her $500,000 they stole her if they paid 40 million I think they overpaid for her that is basically how my brain works and how I think about communication and marketing and brand building and perception changing and just the whole world

in 2007 my net worth at that time was 84 million and Warren had been running these charity lunch auctions where once a year you could bid on eBay to have lunch with Warren Buffett and the money would go to the Glide Foundation which was feating the homeless in San Francisco so I thought about it okay 84 million what's an appropriate tuition bill I said 2 million is good Warren's agenda when he has these lunches is really different his agenda is he wants the people who won that lunch to feel like they got a great bargain he would take lemon questions and turn them into lemonade so he's always exactly what does in the bushire meetings is he's a great teacher and so he was trying to give as much value as he could in that lunch and like he told us when we met him he said look I got nothing going on all afternoon right so when you guys are sick and tired of me you just let me know and I'll leave we kept asking him questions for 3 hours and then we were exhausted and so we said BN we just don't have anything else to ask you

all right we got Gary Vee in the house everybody knows Gary Vee cuz he's all over Twitter and Instagram and Linkedin and he's invested in Twitter and slack and Facebook before they ipoed Gary's fun we brought him on and our goal was let's ask him a bunch of questions that we're genuinely curious about like which of those Investments actually paid off the most and it was a very very surprising number I thought and we asked him about the mindset and what he noticed hanging out with people like Zuck or Logan Paul or different different characters like that so enjoy this episode with Gary ve it's a good one [Music] Gary what's going on man how are you I think Sean saw something recently that you had posted that I thought everyone knew about you Sean what was that thing the report card most podcast start with an intro we start with a little ball busting so I have here Gary's High School report card which you tweeted out to be fair so I'm not I'm not putting anything out there you didn't already do but I thought this is kind of amazing so you tweeted out a picture of your high school report card I'm just going to read off a few uh few of your achievements Gary got a a c in Ceramics a D in English an F in German uh PE you got an A that's the only a you have on this report card I think uh algebra D this one's kind of amazing speech which like you are known for speech you got a D driver Zed D Gary you were uh what a turnaround what a turnaround what's your reaction when you see this that um a lot of data in the world is dirty it's fake data and um I think school grades are just not a tremendous indicator of what's going to happen the speech one is crazy the the report card I I tweeted out was the recap of all four years of high school the so little fun facts to build on top of what you just said I got an F in all four marking periods of German one freshman year I retook it sophomore year I got a D in the first marking period and then proceeded to get all FS failed language my freshman in sophomore year and the state of New Jersey in 1994 if you did not pass two years of language you could not graduate high school so I walked into junior year high school and took Spanish one with all these ninth graders as a junior and I had the pressure on and luckily I got Mrs Senora Kennedy saw something in me and forced me through the system otherwise it was over for me um but yeah I mean speech one really stands out to your point Shan right like to think that I got a D in speech which was give a speech in class right um which I did well it's just that I you know I told my M my mom and I talked about this this weekend I literally did not open a book in four years of high school and did zero homework like you know they would have everyone who's listening went through school I think like they would assign a book report and like it's not that I did it poorly it's that I didn't do it just like did never I literally in four years of high school did zero homework zero like I something happened where I just knew that you know at that point High School I was already working my dad's liquor store and selling a lot of baseball cards at shows and just kind of and it was look this is pre- interet the world was different I grew up in an immigrant family we lived in like we just moved to like rural New Jersey when I tell you lived in our own little four five person cocoon my family we really did it was very very very in hindsight deeply immigrant you know what I mean like we didn't have like America like my parents didn't have American parent friends like my mom wasn't friends with any of my high school friends parents like my mom asked me about what I'm doing for college February of my senior year I was like Mom it's over I'm not going to college she lost her mind and forced me to like go I got like a postcard in the mail from Mount Ida College filled it out and that's literally how I went to college like so you know I think if I was growing up today my intuition is that it would have been okay for me not to go to college and it would have just all been handled differently and honestly I think my teachers would have said to me like I have a bright future instead of saying what they did back then which was you're a loser you're going to be a garbage man that was the big thing Sean Sam in the 90s your teachers would tell you you're going to be a garbage man which I think is really crazy because actually it's a very good living with a high PA has a high paac meal our friend just started a garbage business and he's doing like 300 Grand a year of of income J jokes on you Miss Kennedy yeah um one of the things we do is always just what are you excited about like what products are you seeing what people are you seeing what cool stories are you seeing that are kind of that you're genuinely excited about have you guys seen break the web no what's that dude they got a great tagline so it's uh breakthe web.co the internet's official scoreboard this app's got my attention trending topics on Twitter was so big for me back in the day when it was desktop only break the web is an app like it's just what's trending right now and it's seems like the underlining Tech is pretty damn strong like you know how everybody loves to throw around AI or this and that and you're like if you're smart you're like this is just a collection of apis or anything like this one's a little bit better and like I don't know I've put on my home screen which is not something I've done in a long time why why do I like it well yeah I mean like I'm looking at it now you just showed it to me it was a all of new stuff I don't really pay attention to I don't like your yours I saw the word Gaza Trump and like five other words where they're important but like I don't I'm not going to like read like news first of all great observation brother for me as well like honestly something that's on my mind is everyone needs to consume less news because all it does is push fear and negativity and like it's just so scary like how [ __ ] up that is so it's funny same brother I don't really click into that stuff so right now it's brand new and when I met with the founders I only met with them for like 10 or 15 minutes I asked them real quick I'm like can we get this categorized out they're like yeah that's on the road map like I just want po I need pop culture and consumer Trends so like to me um I'm like when I look at Madonna fan I'm like what is that you know Madonna mistakenly scolded a and again right now what they're what what's interesting though is a it's a great indication of where we are in society like back to when tw Twitter trending topics it was less political and and it was really valuable like the reason I like it or the potential of it and obviously we're in a election season so now this will get eaten up to your point Sam on this stuff but it is an indication of the pulse like I'm always looking for what's the indication of the pulse of what people give a [ __ ] about dude so these guys so it looks like it only has 90 reviews oddly both of these guys used to work at a Bakery the CEO worked at Pete's Coffee the other guy used to work at Specialties Cafe and Bakery so they're both uh lovers of baked goods then they decided to launch this it's it's three years old though but it's not popular yet what so what what's your prediction this thing is gonna be huge there's no prediction back to shooting the [ __ ] to your point Sean I'm not overly like oh break the web's going to be the best the concept of dat so I have a new book coming out soon uh this year right I finally feel like I've synthesized what I actually do like long form Twitter I think literally have a meeting today where I'm going to post my 100 most successful YouTube videos on Twitter here over the course of the next couple months try to stagger it a little bit because just very clear that Twitter is is gonna push it right I I don't know if that's gonna work I think they're I AG I agree they're pushing it but I just don't find myself using it that way yeah that's a great call Sam like what I know is that I'm I never have an interest in guessing if something's going to work I have an interest in executing on anything that might work and then dealing with the ramifications of the UPS why guess when you can test for cheaper than it almost cost to guess right like it's not expensive to take your best YouTube videos and re have somebody repost that's a easy way to learn uh because you know you talk about day trading attention but all trading is mispriced assets that's right and and I would and I would argue that attention is the most mispriced asset right now that most impacts everyone all right everyone really quick if you've heard this podcast for you know that sea and I think that the most important skill set you need in business is copyrighting and so what we did was we went through all of the podcasts that we've done it's like 500 of them and we found all the best copywriting tips our resources our Frameworks our templates we aggregated all of them into one simple document so you can skim it all and get everything that we've ever talked about with copyrighting it's in the link below it's awesome check it out so why is why is that there is nobody that will ever listen to this that doesn't need attention as a currency to achieve what's in their stomach whether they want to raise money for their PTA be president of the United States get more listeners through their podcast sell their sneakers they the only asset class that I think is universal is attention even a parent trying to home parent to children need their kids to listen to them to be able to get the message across the currency of listening is or consuming is is profound and we're living through the mass fragmentation of that right if you think about let's use parenting was a lot easier to get your kids to listen when in 1954 80% of fam sat down and had dinner together and for like an hour and a half and you did it right and like so those parents were able to message in a very interesting way uh whereas now they still can we have technology you can s a text or a Sal and Sean clip to your kids to get them to think of something but there's also so much Supply and right with the demand side being the same there's only so many hours in the day now the human brain I think has capacity to keep a lot more information than we think nonetheless um for me more Nally as someone who it loves business and loves you know to think about it you know it doesn't matter what you're selling and it doesn't even matter what you're saying until you first get their attention and then everything is about what you're saying right what what's interesting to me is I think of it the acronym I use internally at vayer X Vayner media is uh pack platforms and culture right and so break the web plays in culture right like there's two different currencies that I think about constantly or two different Frameworks one is platforms what is what are the top 25 platforms that have people's attention doing what do they care about from snap to Pinterest to LinkedIn to YouTube even within themselves YouTube shorts differently than YouTube this Collective of like 15 20 places right that really have quote the attention what are they up to how did their algorithms work what are their features doing and I think about them on a day-to-day basis right and then and then I think about culture like what is the slang what is what is the things of interest the people of Interest right um and and then it becomes a framework of like what's overpriced and underpriced execution so for example I think Super Bowl is the most underpriced media in the world it's very hard to get 130 million people to watch 30 seconds of a video and actually want to and pay attention to it right so that 78 million Vig I think is great the problem is the creative is the variable of success right so the media might be a great deal but if your 30 second video is forgettable or stinks or you overpaid for making it right Verizon paid Beyonce to be in that commercial if they paid her $500,000 I think they stole her if they paid $40 million I think they overpaid for her I don't know what the number is my guess is it's somewhere in between but that is basically how my brain works and how I think about communication and marketing and brand building and perception changing and just the whole world it's how I think about the world have you guys SE let me tell let me ask if you guys have seen this in terms of cool [ __ ] so uh perplexity is awesome um but they have this new thing I didn't see them talk about it a lot it's called perplexity AI SLP podcast they've come out with a daily podcast that's five to 10 minutes long that's written by perplexity and it has beautiful background music and they've got this British guy have you ever seen those like planet Earth videos where it's like now we see the mother cheetah go after yeah they've got this voice that sounds exactly like him reading like the script and it sounds awesome the voice is powered by this thing called uh 11 Labs dude I went to 11 Labs Sean I uploaded a ton of our voice and I was like [ __ ] it let's just see if I can make a podcast it's way it's like it's the best thing I've ever heard have you guys seen them come out with this podcast and SE Sam speak Hindi 11 Labs made a clip they just translated the podcast Auto auto dubbed it using AI into Hindi and it's phenomenal by the way it's something we've been working on for about a year like um I think next year is the full year where like every single thing I do every video every language like we're there dude I I haven't seen Sam I haven't seen the podcast but I just took no like I can't wait to listen to it like it's so good and they've not made a big this has not been like a big hoop love they hav done I I randomly came across it I was listening to it I'm like I'm going toist listen to this every day this is great it's David atoro telling me about like the news it sounds awesome uh which Lang which language you going to do should we do Hindi is that the one I'm doing everything like yeah if you're gonna do one you might as well do all yeah just like I just think that I also think like the everyone's going to go after the big like for example I get excited about Portuguese I'm like [ __ ] it everyone's GNA go to Mandarin and Hindi and like the big number you know I'm like I'm just GNA own Portugal and Brazil like you know but but that's tongue and cheek I think the reality is over the next three years all of it's going to go down and cost so much that it won't even like the the US in seven years are gonna laugh that we ever had it just in one language if they won't even understand they like dude have you ever seen that talk that this guy Alex Schultz gave about Facebook's growth he was the he was the top Facebook growth guy like early on he when they created the growth team it was him chamat and uh the guy I think Javier who now runs it and he's like he put a chart up and it was a it was a weissy weissy talk and he puts a chart up on the screen there's a bunch of dotts he's like you know all these dots are feature releases and you can see one dot where everything starts growing right after that he goes anyone want to take with take a guess what that that dot is people in the audience like photos photo tagging um it's uh when you release mobile with you know what is it we don't know and he's like language translation local language translation he goes the biggest growth driver in Facebook's growth Bar None was when we when we localized the service which he's like was not easy they actually I don't know if you know this Facebook had to do like a Wikipedia thing because there was you know there's 186 countries that they had to deal with and so they were like we need users to basically retranslate the site for their local region and they incentivized people to do that and that's how they Mass translated overnight no other social network did this and it took off so that was the first time I heard about this the second was when we did um our our basketball camp with Mr Beast uh which Gary I invited you to you got to come next time um Mr Beast basically we host a basketball camp at his house and he did this presentation he's like he's like here's one thing I'm doing that nobody else is really doing which is every video I do I now created channels in Portuguese and everywhere else he told me Jimmy told me that whole thing several years ago like such a good bet but by tell me about this basketball camp because I'm playing basketball tomorrow at 6 am like this is how much I love it I'm 48 like you'll fit right in that we got there's plenty of wheelchairs and ice and bags of ice dude it's Hil but I'm 90s Nicks fan so no easy layups is that is that politically correct in this basketball camp yeah yeah you you can hack your hack your heart away it's it's all good we um actually I wonder if you do anything like this so um we do this thing where it's called Camp MFM was my first million MFM so we um we were like we like the idea of getting together like you know when you go to a conference you end up having a good time if you go speak somewhere you end up having a good time but there's kind of this dread in my stomach of like [ __ ] yet another conference like I just don't want to do the boring I just I guess have a resistance of doing the same thing everyone else is doing in general and so we were like how do we get the benefits of going in networking without ever calling it networking or a conference or anything else and so we created basically an adult summer camp it was like What If for a weekend we just rented a house and in this case we actually just stay at Mr BEAST's house now because he ended up wanting to come and so we we go to his house and then we bring in a trainer from the NBA he treats us like we're you know washed up NBA players basically puts us through their program and we just play ball all day when is it one just happened but it was big it was like the founder of Airbnb Mr Beast all these guys Joe's the best Joe I have an email from Joe that says Gary we're fans we want you to look at our company and it was Joe a bedandbreakfast.com and I never saw it you know or maybe I did and just like but I look at that email I haven't own a separate laptop and I look at it what once in a while just to like I love it I like this is actually a fun segue back to chopping it up if it was just us three and everyone's this where we're going where do you guys sit on losing so we just talked about basketball so I just think about me going to this basketball thing and like my favorite thing in basketball in pickup is to lose the first game it is my favorite and I talked about this on Steve barlett's podcast I got a billion [ __ ] emails about this there's something that just like the blood in my head like everything transforms in my chemicals and then everything in life like everything stops and the only thing that matters to me in the world is that we have to win game two that's so funny he said that when we did the camp the same thing happened uh the very first game I'm trying to be the host of the event so I'm like okay yeah yeah you guys play I'll sit out first no problem we get in I'm like I'm passing the ball I'm like oh that's Joe gbia let me not let him drive I'm not going to try to hurt the founder of Airbnb Mr Beast oh that was cool man you know I see someone taking a video I'm like that's cool that's gonna be a cool clip that's gonna go viral then I'm like wait [ __ ] that I'm in the clip he's scoring on me and I was like he's no longer Mr Beast that's Jimmy and that's Joe and now we're competing to win and then the whole event got a lot more fun when it equalized correct everybody all the job titles dropped and it's basically who's here to win who's here to play and uh that's when it got real it's why I love entrepreneurship where I was where I'm going with this is that email like excites me you know like I'm like yeah eat it Gary like dude that one would have been a bigger one for you than uh Uber too no it wouldn't have maybe but no because I was the they both probably believe it or not this is how much startups were back then they both would have been priced between four and 8 million that's crazy right I know bro I got into tumblr's B round B series B not Angel not seed not series a I got into Tumblr series B this is actually it right here this my Twitter Tumblr Facebook stock I got into tumblr's series B at a 14 million doll valuation that's that's like you know precede now that was literally 2007 or eight right we're only talking 16 years ago so like you guys are young dudes so think 16 years ahead how old will you be in 16 years Sean dude I don't even want to know 52 50 I don't know what how old am I right honestly no [ __ ] I don't know if you guys hang out with like 60 70 80 year old business people like I do a lot of that because it's the best I mean to me the two extremes are the best right hang out with the 17year olds that are like [ __ ] listening right now [ __ ] on all of us saying these [ __ ] wait till they see what I'm going to do and then 73 year olds who are like just like the amount of 60 of 60 forget I think is like literally children 70 and 80 70 and 80 to me just it's stunning to me how many 73 75 77 year old businessmen and women I know that go at it because they love it it's still what they do and it gets me excited because at 48 it's like man I'm still like I'm in halftime right like I'm in you know I get excited about that ask you about that so I think you and I kind of have similarish backgrounds where it was like raised around like like kind of a rough crowd every once in a while yes and still kind of have a little bit of that where like I enjoy like doing like hood rat [ __ ] every once in a while same and uh Gary Sam's nickname on the Pod is hose water because he's just no water fountains baby just drinking straight out the hose he's Sam hose water par dude I loved man hose water was the it's the best dude Sumer hose water out of the hose literally from 1982 to 198 dude I I I I peed in the backyard more than I pee in the toilet yeah they used to call me look M no hands like every day uh so listen I had a question so you uh so look we kind we're all three probably a little bit similar where it's like we kind of like did a bunch of Scrappy stuff and now Gary you're older and a little and further along in your career in terms of success than we are but we've both both done some interesting or we've all done interesting things where we're able to hang out with some of these guys who are like legitimate millionaires I'm I'm sure you're I don't know if you are or not but you're in you're in that ballpark and I see with Michael Ruben and whatever you you know you hang out with some of the the shot colors of the world what do you think is the difference between the store owner who's doing like you know a retail guy doing half a million or a million dollars a year uh the $10 million doll a year business the hundred million doll net worth person and the billion dollar net worth person do they all have similarish mindsets just maybe luck or industry they picked a right a different industry yeah two things it's it's 12:34 I still don't know why 1111 has everyone's attention and 1234 doesn't the 1234 is just so cool should we make a wish real quick I I don't make a wish but we should start a trend and try to make 1234 matter for entrepreneurs um uh that's a really [ __ ] fun question Sam my brain as you were asking it goes focused on one two three four yeah I just have to look over and see it CAU my I always thought about 12:34 I've always thought it was interesting that has no pop culture relevance um I believe the first thing that goes through my mind on this question is risk tolerance and fear right so way I just had an idea 12:34 I got I get it I I want I gotta use it 1234 should be where you shoot your shot I love that when you see 1234 that's when you got to send that text you got to send the Tweet you got to send the email right there that that's that's the idea for 1234 we can make this a thing can you get somebody to register like 12 3 4.org like I feel like you know um I don't want these Hustler kids like the 13-year-old me would listen to this and immediately register 1234 UHC um uh I think it's fear I think I think about my dad a lot my dad I think it's how people view their ability to go backwards so I think there's something very scary about my chemicals and Sam I always felt this in you as well it's funny that you brought it up I don't know if you I don't know you well enough to know this and I'm not even sure you're going to believe me when I say it but I do think you have a good shot of understanding what I'm about to say my favorite Rocky is Rocky 6 when he goes back to Philly with nothing yeah Sean there's something so weird in me and it's almost like am I sandbagging myself like I be I'm going to be very vulnerable here like I don't view it as like I'm cool I actually view it as I'm potentially flawed right like there's something in me that romanticizes being okay with it all falling down I'm back in like queens in a you know $400 a month apartment the entire internet is like see he was [ __ ] overrated I told you know all the people that love me all the friends they have that don't love me are like see your [ __ ] guy was a loser he [ __ ] it up he sucks that I don't know why I like that but I believe Sam to answer your question it's something to do with that chemical I believe the people that I think you brought up some good stuff I think a lot about if my dad had a supermarket instead of a liquor store I would have taken that to way bigger Heights because liquor was you couldn't ship it and you know like that's like the L component yeah there's a ton of serendipity like honestly I think a lot about if my dad didn't want me to work in his store I would have went to because I fell in love with tech I might have went to California who the [ __ ] knows what have I created in 95 670 like could have had one of those Mark cubin moments I think about that or you know like I think when you can sell when you can for all the everyone who's listening and if you have kids like this if you can sell you're in the game right like if you can sell you're you'll never be like zero right and so what do you got here is 1234.com available no dude 1234 is owned by like a telecom yeah that's what I figured that's impos I like the one like the 137 yeah do that um are you kidding me dude I love that that was so I'm so pumped about this bro the funny thing by the way Ben my guy he he texted us a screenshot of GoDaddy one it's 234. org 15,000 he just said pull the trigger question mark no no don't don't don't pull that one we're actually it's a good one I never think you should overpay for names because I think names are made dude I agree I agree right Sam but do you know who disagrees [ __ ] dares dares at U I know dud I've been with them multiple times so daresh uh founded HubSpot which bought my company and I've gotten close with him he's like he's like dude I bought chat.com or yeah chat.com today I'm like why he goes because it was available I was like what are you gonna do with it he's like I'm not sure but I'm GNA figure something out but I paid eight figures for it yeah look he's smart he knows like that you know look as long as do I mean to me the scary thing for let me let me take a step back not go too fast he's smart enough to know is he could probably flip that because it's a very very very big deal on the flip side there is a little concern for me of what happens when this no longer becomes the remote control of our society right like I'm very fascinated by 20 years from now talking about 16 years ago on Tumblr 16 years from now if you told me that 16 years from now we live in a predominant VR world I would be like maybe like I can see that possibility right you could see that it's pushing in a direction I don't think it's going to end up being these Apple Pro go you know Google Glass snap the Facebook thing Quest my intuition is that it's going to have to be much more lightweight but I never underestimate the human being I'm positive somebody's going to make the contact lenses that work like this and then We're Off to the Races because now back to the way I think about day trading attention this no longer houses the attention now it's housed here whoever controls that Paradigm wins big and then all of a sudden does dot even matter in that is that how the uiux works because do didn't matter at all in 1990 dude that's how I feel about SEO businesses right now with exact if it's chat GPT and and Google's just trying to give you the answer that's why bner media never did search when I started the company 14 years ago everyone's like what the [ __ ] why don't you do search and I was like first of all I thought if I built a very big company I'd be able to m&a search if I wanted to add it right it was already established I grew up on search the decade the 15 years before and so here's a good one for the kids if you're building towards the future if you're capable remember that you can always buy the current and that's how I thought about search I was going to master social in 09 and I felt like Socia was going to eat up search anyway and I think it's starting to happen now like search is in a weird spot like Google's in a weird spot like in it's in a great spot in some ways but yeah I think I think search is definitely a different world like if your business I actually spoke to somebody Thursday um who uh is really getting hurt because he was one-dimensional on search and I I you know that's such a fear of mine that if you sell your stuff via email via your podcast via social media content via search you must develop into a Swiss army knife because if you're just a fork if you're just onedimensional you're gonna get caught hey Gary let me ask you about that you were saying a second ago you're like I'm not afraid to go back yes um do you so like the way that I run my personal finances is I've got like uh my safety net so I've got this like account that has enough money that I'm good forever and and so that's in Vanguard and bonds and was like I've never touched that and then anything anything above that amount I I'll bet it and I'll like start new [ __ ] so you're talking about like you don't mind going back but but it sounds like that's not exactly how you'd run your your finances so do you have like a safety nut and then anything above that you're like dude bet it bet it bet it or do you just use profits from vayer to to make these bets how do you how does that work yes um I have I'm going to be I'm comfortably transparent my I'm very fortunate so my zero is a million dollars but that's it that's it Sam wait so you only keep a million in your like liquid portfolio that's your safety net no no no I have I have other things like I have money and all sorts of places but I have this one place that has $1 million and literally everything else is in play wow now Sean I want to paint a very clear picture here because I don't want to create hyperbole I haven't bet everything on everything but if I ever feel the way I felt about Facebook in 2007 when I put I $236,000 in savings I put 200,000 into Facebook right if that ever happens again like I'm willing to bet very large because that feeling similar to the feeling I felt about the internet when I saw it in 95 similar to the feeling that I felt about friender myspace that little like oh the internet's changing I look for those moments um and you know again I'm willing to go big but to your point Sam like it's not like I'll go to z00 you know a million dollars is a lot a lot of money and especially if you're capable if you're capable like I don't know like I feel very reputation yeah correct I also think about faceof like where you change like I I have like these very like deep Sean it goes back to like wanting to win the basketball game like I think it's more I think the worst thing for my love of Entrepreneurship that's happened is what Sam just said I no longer can do it without anyone knowing yeah it's a whole different game it was so fun when people didn't know what you're saying reminds me of uh well two things I think it's super interesting that your answer to what's the difference you've seen in the mindset the psychology was who's willing to go backwards and almost what you said was you almost kind of crave there's like a romantic idea about going back which I like a lot I resonate with that a lot it's almost like there's TV shows I wish I could go watch again for the first time in the same way like there's no greater feeling than going from not making it to making it once you've made it and you try to make more it doesn't have the same thrill Adventure satisfaction self-respect you know you you have to almost go into different games like I I worry about that like I don't let me phrase I don't worry about it but I I sense that there's a day where I actually I talk a lot about never retiring and dying at my desk and then there's an equal part of me that realizes that I'm very wired in a way where I just might make wake up at 79 and be like you know what like I'm done I'm just GNA focus on my grandchild's like like I just I don't know I have like I think we're all very like I think we underestimate how long life is you know I think we underestimate our capacity to make hard decisions to different directions that we can't see along the way then there's back to luck and you know I mean look we lived through a lot of prosperity the everyone the three of us have gotten very fortunate where we lived during what era right like there's a lot going on in the world like you know there was people in the Roaring 20s talking [ __ ] like this over dinner and then you know a very challenging 30 years punched them in the face right right and all seems so great in 1927 America was on its way it's gonna be awesome and then you know a massive World War and the atomic bomb and Korea and Vietnam and social unrest and so you know all these things are like fun to think about it's it's like fun to like romanticize about the future um but I I will say this I'm actually going to ask you guys this what do you think your personal relationship is with gratitude versus taking for granted I I changed on that once I actually sold my company and was financially free and then like two weeks after the sale of the company the CEO got into a life-threatening accident and I was like oh that could have ruined my deal and like like every like this all could have been ruined and then I like hit like some threshold I'm like dude I did not work any harder than anyone else who else like who have done similar things but failed this is 100% luck and I'm so grateful that I like it just has worked in my way in many ways I feel like I I am the luckiest guy around and it just seems like I'm so gracious for the luck that I have that's it's kind it's changed to mors tour I've just been gifted this and I I'm so lucky and I'm thankful good for you Sim where you at with it I have a different so to me I'm like all right I think people make a mistake they're grateful in the macro so if you say to somebody you're like what are you grateful for almost everybody uh my family my health Y and and it to me this is the I'm not saying they're wrong obviously those are great things but it's sort of like when a company says our values are integrity and Excellence it's true but not useful it it basically has leaves no register and so I try my focus is is how do you be grateful in the micro meaning can I be if if I'm in an elevator can I find something in that moment can I get a rep a practice rep of gratitude in that because that actually shifts me when I can take a breath be grateful for the fresh air I can look at something my kid is doing and how silly they are and but and just in that moment find something and if I could do that you know 10 15 times a day that is you know uh like the antidote you know yeah I think that's how micro and macro and micro work together I really do think of it as being alive like just thank you for that I'm not that I didn't die last night right like I and I to your point I think when your macro is that I think you're actually I think I love what you said you're just talking about applying yeah that's how I apply it exactly that's my that's my relationship with it yeah that's right but like if you're getting to that place that's how I live I'm like like literally like it's like a nice sunny day in New York today and I'm just just like yeah that's awesome you know like like just choosing positivity like I think people have been so sucked into like focusing on what they don't have or what what's not going well Naval has an amazing definition of Happiness by the way I don't know if you've ever heard this he goes happiness is what you feel when you don't feel like anything's missing in your life right people think happiness is something you got to achieve something you got to go create something you got to get it's like you know you think you need to accumulate things to have happiness and he's like actually it's just when you're not focused on what's missing well that's right I think I think Simplicity is just so [ __ ] [ __ ] man it's so right know your your your life is not simplistic uh I mean I don't I don't know what your personal life is like I don't know if you have multiple homes and what you own but your professional life is not simplistic I'll tell you why it's simplistic I I'm not attached to my professional success or who I am I'm like in a very weird place with my winning and losing and my Gary ve of it all like I it I care so much but it's a game my professional life is a game right I don't want to be un happy like I fight for happiness too much and I think it is in the Simplicity you're right the day-to-day is chaotic there's meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting right um but I like it I like juggling 17 balls and I'm not upset about the 13 that fell on the ground and broke and more importantly I'm not worried about the people who are watching me juggle boo when the ball breaks that I think is massive yeah but when Theo Von makes fun of you it's pretty hilarious that is like the ultimate like because I love Theo like like to me back to like where we came from Sam I'm like my God like I've gotten to a place where someone as epic as Theo Von or any other comedi Tim Dylan like I love these guys I'm always fascinated when people struggle with a comedian razing like I think it's like you've that's like such flattery yeah that was awesome it was awesome I saw that I was like oh the guy I look up to he's uh he's crossed over to mainstream it's awesome um Sean what what were we gonna say well I want to ask two questions one uh you showed those stock certificates on the wall speaking of winning uh I saw okay you invested in Twitter and 09 slack preo I think the liquid Death guy used to work with you work for you yeah literally worked at Vayner media the day before he started liquid death Facebook preo I'm curious what was what investment was the best investment for you what paid off and terms of you've made a bunch of bets right and that those are the winners Facebook I haven't sold one share yet oh [ __ ] that's insane but that goes back that go insanely good yeah that that goes back to jockey over horse I tell all my friends like who get into investing I'm like man they're like what have you learned I'm like what I've learned is when I only invested in the person when I'm when I I've hit this new state where like I'm really trying to be obsessed with the person and the idea and if either one isn't like an A+ then I'm like H right you said and or or and right and the horse that's right but if I or it fully person not idea what year did you do that did did you do that deal Facebook like thought 2007 oh my God so I mean I don't even know what that you'd be up 400 times I don't know I mean a lot a lot 100x at least uh I want to get your rapid uh rapid take because I know you've uh one of the things we do on this pod is we kind of um we love anecdotes and also little little insights on people that we think are wired in an interesting way maybe not even the way we want to be wired right like elon's really interesting we don't think he's perfect we think there's a bunch of things he does that are cringe we think there's a bunch of things he does that are epic so I'm curious you've bumped into or have studied or have an opinion on any of these people so I want to go rapid fire see if you have something give us give us like so yeah so is this from outside observation or if I M them inside observation either one or if you have nothing you can say pass I don't have anything on there all right so first one I want to do is Zuck you've talked about Facebook and the jockey give me Zach dude I think he's uncomfortably underrated like he's the only person that I met back in 07 like in this era now I think it's getting more obvious but he understood attention he literally tried to buy Twitter he bought Instagram he bought WhatsApp he tried to buy snap he just understood attention was the only asset and and he's so nice he's a nice kid like like he's just a very simple nice I'm I'm happy with the way things are going for him a little bit right now like people can see how like doofy he is like you see him like in the corner of the UFC thing you're like this is just a nerdy kid who's like you know what I mean like and he doesn't give a [ __ ] now people will think it's because he's got a but like it it's just he's just like a dentist son from Cadet like he's just a [ __ ] nerd with no bad intent who [ __ ] spent his childhood coding which put him in a position right he put in the hours I'm I'm a fan man I think he's a I think he's a very good operator and the reason I've never sold a share of Facebook is I've been committed for a long time in this in my own mind which was I'll never sell until he's gone Logan Paul so do you know that Logan Paul was starting to emerge very little on vine when Vayner media for Virgin Mobile did a campaign called finding the next you guys kind of discovered him right like when he was I think he had like 15 or 18,000 followers at the time it was crazy and full by the way full disclosure Jerome jar who was one of the 10 most followed people on line who was my partner Jerome and I launched the first influencer agency called grape story back in 13 he was the one who said you know he he let me pick from three people I think all three of them got big uh but um I think Logan is uh you know he grew up in the Limelight right you think about like what happened in Japan or all this stuff like it's tough these kids are you think about child stars when we grew up we all knew that like child stars would be [ __ ] up right and now I think like everyone's going through that the Limelight is hard so I I think Logan is well- intended uh I think he um he's very entrepreneurial like very entrepreneurial and I you know I I I've always thought of him as like a Marky Mark or or a fresh prince or the rock meaning I always watched him from afar and as I got to know him a little bit I was like okay this kid is Logan Paul today just like Marky Mark was Marky Mark before he was Mark Wahlberg just like the Fresh Prince aella you know what Will Smith was before he was Will Smith I've always thought that Logan would cross over and he has obviously with WWE in a of ways and I think that will continue like if you told me Lo Logan is like an action star and is like at they like the way John Cena was at the Academy Awards last night like is Logan doing that in 15 years I'm like that makes sense to me that's how he's wired Sam you know he's only 28 he's he's only 28 years old the dude basically like when he was 14 or whatever like won he won in the social media game now he and then think about the pivots right both him and Jake but the think about the pivots now he's got impulsiv he's got the podcast where he's super chill it's the opposite of crazy Vine prankster guy he pivoted to like he's the guy asking questions he's inquisitive he's curious he's got like you know the popular podcast goes WWE becomes the champion in WWE creates Prime which is gonna make him a billionaire by the time he's 28 29 years old now because Prime is probably gonna be worth tens of billions if you know they did I think two billion in sales last year I'm I'm in this world like Prime is definitely like a two depending on the time they decide to trade it it's two three four five six seven billion that high seven I talked to Mr Beast and he was like 20 billion is where Prime is going like that would be very very I mean that's like look I never underestimate Jimmy's foresight because he's great I've known them a long time but just being in m&a at cpg levels my intuition is that they won't be patient enough to get to that big of a number right like well the beauty is they're not operating the other guys are they the other guys operating yeah they're pretty young too though yeah and more importantly [ __ ] like I said [ __ ] changes like everything's ha haa until it's actually in front of you it's all kicks and giggles and we're going to 20 until you fly to Atlanta and Coca-Cola actually offers you 5.9 and you've got to sit there as KSI and Logan and those guys and say okay if we say yes because you know what they're gonna say you guys are like this so you're gonna really understand what I'm about to say you know what they're gonna say they're gonna say huh we could do this right now and then in 24 months start a new thing you a shampoo or a deodorant and sell it to dub like so I I think it's um it'll be interesting to see how long they hold their breath and don't forget one bad year you guys know this how businesses work one bad year takes a lot of Leverage off the table in a negotiation and so you know they'll be thoughtful about that because no matter what you are once you saturate distribution don't forget they're selling on something that's more like Supreme right they're selling on cool cool yeah right kids are buying it literally to drink it for the status symbol like a fashion brand and that can only last so long Z karichi were only cool for so long those [ __ ] that's the point the we me and you have no [ __ ] reference was for all the Jersey Boys that grew up in the late 80s early 90s people will go it they were the hottest jeans pants if you didn't wear your C cabari you were nothing and I didn't have them by the way I was in life but they were [ __ ] in compared Prime to jeno jeans uh what were you gonna say Sean well I asked you a bunch of names that are you know basically names that people know I'm curious who do you think is dope who are you learning from and who are you kind of admir who do you admire who do you learn from who are you inspired by because okay A lot of people are inspired by Gary Vee um who is Gary V inspired by that's a great question I'm a little weird on this one but I'm glad I brought up uh break the web I'm like inspired by the collective more than an individual the field yeah I love the field brother I I I just like I spend almost all of my time on the collective so I don't even have the allocation of time I also am very inspired by the following person show me the person that's currently living through massive adversity like somebody's list I'll tell you somebody who's 10 times more inspiring to me than I think I am or deserve to be to others show me the kid that's listening right now whose father passed away from a stroke he's 16 he's got three younger siblings and his mom has to now work two jobs and he's holding it down for the fam right he's literally a sophomore in high school and he's basically the father figured out for three siblings he had to quit the [ __ ] football team because he's also like like I I'm the son of two parents who lost a parent before they were 15 and it and back to gratitude I think I got really [ __ ] up by being scared that my parents were going to die my whole childhood but it kind of converted into this gratitude framework that's insane it makes me Unstoppable you know and so yeah for me it's less Bezos or Elon or you know you know Oprah or anything it's it's much more like someone none of us know that is really in it that Bodega owner energy that that stuff I grew up with and I [ __ ] with it but that person I think has it lucky back to earlier our Simplicity like owning your own little business living within your means like like that's [ __ ] kind of chill could be really epic it doesn't put you on like this podcast but it's like a great life in a lot of ways and I see it a lot I lived it what building my dad's business from 22 to 34 I not that person the one that's like back to your point saying the the spin of the wheel really created real adversity I'll say it again and not a peep of complaining there's a very small group of kids that get that and they just convert into leader instead of woe is me or rebelling I admire that level of tenacity and grit and accountability and [ __ ] like [ __ ] it like this is I got this is this is it's on me I got to put this [ __ ] on my shoulders I'm going to do this for my three siblings like I admire the [ __ ] out of that kid I had a I wrote down a quote uh when I was doing the research for this that I think is is exactly what you're talking about you go forget Rags to Riches some people are just rags to rags just so that their kids have a shot at rags to riches and I respect the [ __ ] out of that I love that quote thank you for finding that I really man I'm really affected by that like Sam really hit it on the head like I hate the word luck because I think that people weaponize it against people that have worked really hard but I but I believe in Serendipity and luck quite a bit because it's just the way like I was born in the Soviet Union like I got lucky to get out of there when I did if I didn't I would have come to this country in 1991 when it fell I would have been 16117 I'd sound like Ivan Drago on these podcasts I like it would have been all different and you know I just I I I I just really do admire people who I really do think entitlement and lack of accountability has become a disease in First World countries in 2024 and I just really admire people who play the other way we appreciate you doing this man you got day trading attention coming out I think on May 21 right that sounds right you're the man we appreciate you H hanging out yeah thanks for coming on man I got to jump this board meeting I appreciate it all right take care see you love you guys good luck [Music]

all right this is a guest master class with our buddy Andrew Wilkinson we're inviting him on because if your world class is something I want to learn from you in fact I had emailed Andrew a while back being like hey I have this company it's working we had scaled into the tens of millions in Revenue but I just didn't want to run it anymore I was tired I wasn't the right guy for it I was half in half out and I was just fantasizing about selling it or the day where I wouldn't be running it anymore and he's like dude you need to hire a CEO and to me that always felt like something that's easier said than done hire a CEO just find somebody to take over my baby but he's done it this guy's got 40 companies he's got a CEO that runs you know CEOs that run them he doesn't have to run any of them day-to-day the portfolio is worth $500 million so if there's anybody to learn from it's Andrew on this and so he comes in and he shares uh how are he interviews them what are the questions that he asks who is he looking for um how does he structure the compensation so he's very transparent about you know how he structures it how much is base comp how much is variable how to make sure everybody's aligned uh what to do after you hire them and so we go into step by step how to hire a great CEO for your business this is not for a beginner if you don't even have a business You' never done this this not for you this is for people who actually have a business and they're scaling it up and maybe it's year five it's year seven and you're s starting to realize you don't want to do this for another five to 10 years and this that's when you have to have this conversation to figure out how you can hire a great CEO to scale your business it worked for me it's work for Andrew I hope it works for you so enjoy this guest master class with Andrew r [Music] okay we asked Andrew Wilkinson to come on and do one specific thing which is teach us how to hire CEOs he owns Andrew you own what 40 companies now the total portfolio is worth almost $500 million and yet you're a pretty chill guy whenever I text you you answer you're always having fun you're not stressed out overloaded overworked like every other CEO I know who's a have one company but you have 40 and so I think the way you've been able to do that is by hiring great CEOs for all your companies and it's actually worked me and Sam want to learn this from you so you're here today to teach us that how did you even realize that you needed to hire CEOs yeah so I would say um it's not that it's less it's not less stressful it's just different right so I just have different problems so someone running a company might be uh you know putting out a fire that's that's burning that day I put out fires that burn over the course of a month or two and they're bigger fires and then someone else might spend a lot of time dealing with company politics I end up dealing with um you know CEO comp packages so I want to say to begin with you know this is not necessarily A Greener pasture it's just a different pasture um and I think it you you really only want to oversee CEOs if that's your skill set if you're drawn to um being super super high level and hands-off which some people let's be real they're not they're they're like they want to be jro from Juro Dreams of Sushi they don't want to be the guy who starts Chipotle they want to be on the line they want to be making food uh And So It ultimately comes down to your personality and for me my personality has always been I'm incredibly lazy so from the time that my mom told me to wash the dishes I was Furious I was always trying to find ways to you know pay my brothers to do it find uh you know systems to wash the dishes more so I had to do less work and so I always joke that I'm Teflon for tasks and if you start delegating in your company which most great entrepreneurs do you ultimately reach this point where uh you ask yourself well is there anything else I can delegate and that final level of Delegation that final level of abstraction that's hiring a CEO that's hiring one to hire 10 they go and they run the entire company and you just talk to them quarterly sometimes annually and there's some CEOs I have that I haven't even talked to in two or three years you have something between 30 or 40 companies do you have 30 or 40 CEOs reporting to you no the way that we do it now so it's crazy at first it was like five companies so I had five direct reports uh that are CEOs no big deal and then over time as we've scaled up we've had to form operating groups and so we have these operating groups and they have their own CEOs who report into us so for example all of our Digital Services businesses are run by a guy named prep I meet with prip kind of bi-weekly monthly whenever I need to uh and he oversees a group of like six companies even if you're not going to end up with that kind of portfolio 40 company structure I've had this with you which is I think a more common problem I remember emailing you saying hey I have this G business it's working so I can't there's no there's no reason to shut it down however I don't want to keep working on it I liked it at the beginning I don't love it now I want to go on and do new things how do I do this do I have to sell this like should I just sell the company do I can I hire zoo and if so where the heck am I going to find somebody who I could trust to do this so even on a one company level I think that's where most Founders are going to be that uh you know Step One is abstract yourself out of a single company so let's let's start with that you you said something you're like it's pretty common everyone loves their business in year one I forgot what's your exact quote so yeah every time I talk to a young founder they're like I'm going to run this till the day I die doesn't matter what the business is they think they're going to be you know there like Mark Zuckerberg for 20 30 years and then you talk to them in years seven or eight and almost all of them are just like how do I escape this hellish waking nightmare like want to be I'm gonna run this till I'm 28 till the day I'm 28 totally so and it's really interesting because um people generally think about it in a very binary way they're like okay there's two doors door one keep running my company door two sell get rich and live on M Island right uh but there's actually a door three and door three is hiring a CEO right so you're you're in a marathon and you can either ditch the marathon or keep running it well it turns out that you can actually incentivize someone else to keep running the marathon on your behalf and I mean this just goes back to what I was talking about before right so there's there's all these different levels of Delegation and we all understand at least if you're a good entrepreneur that if you don't like accounting you just hire an accountant well if you don't like running your company door three is you just hire a CEO so you know my my story on this is I started metalab which is a design agency uh about 20 years ago I feel very old to say that but about 20 years ago um and I ran it for as CEO for almost 10 years and I had a great exec team like I was able to delegate quite a bit of it I was running other companies at the same time but ultimately the buck stopped with me and for the first three to five years it was really exciting like I was learning new skills all the time I was scrappily like you know sending the invoices and negotiating deals with clients and I was flying all over the world and it was all new and and exciting but you know at a certain point you know after like year eight year nine I didn't want to fly to San Francisco anymore I didn't want to have to like shake hands and kiss babies and do that and I remember Chris my now business partner and at the time CFO would come to me and be like dude you got to fly to San Francisco every time you go down down there you Clos like a million dollars of new projects but I didn't really want to do it because a I was exhausted it wasn't new anymore I didn't want to travel it didn't suit My Lifestyle but also I was already rich I was already making enough money and so the business was kind of starting to Plateau because I wasn't willing to go that extra mile I was just saying you know what we'll just do whatever comes in I'll do a San Francisco trip once a quarter and we'll close what we close because I don't want to do that well the beautiful thing was there were young Scrappy people who to them the idea of flying to San Francisco and taking a client out for a steak dinner was a dream come true they'd never done that before and so for me I was looking at it and going okay um running a five person agency versus a 50 person agency it's a very different job and it was a job that I sucked at you know I really to this day love running five person companies I love running you know I can get to about 15 people comfortably um but I I wasn't enjoying it when we were 50 people and I read every book about management I did courses and I just kind of Whi myself why am I not a great manager why can I not be like Peter Ducker reincarnate and so I would always just fantasize about selling and I I kept trying to sell the business and then we'd be like right at the last month and then the uh the buyer would change the terms or something would go wrong in the business and so so I was kind of starting to lose it I didn't want to be running my company I wanted out but I I I couldn't sell it and so around that time I ended up reading a book about Warren Buffett and I found out about door 3 and here we are I started hiring CEOs I made a ton of mistakes which I'll talk about but it's it's enabled me to create tiny which I never would have done before I'd probably still be either miserably running my business or I would have sold for you know a much smaller amount of money and we'll get into like the actual tactics really quick though the green pasture thing youing it's always Grass Is Always Green on the other side and like you and I joke where you're like uh well I don't want to say what you said but you'll just like be teasing about uh running a small company and how that could be way more fun and being the CEO of a small company uh for a long period of Time Versus trying to like go big what's the grasses Always Greener for you all right everyone really quick if you've heard this podcast before you know that Sean and I think that the most important skill set you need in business is copyrighting and so what we did was we went through all of the podcasts that we've done it's like 500 of them and we found all the best copyrighting tips our resources our Frameworks our templates we aggregated all of them into one simple document so you can skim it all and get everything that we've ever talked about with copyrighting it's in the link below it's awesome check it out well I mean I think um I there's a great Bob Seager quote um which is I wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then right so for me I I think think about it like this I might have given this example before but imagine if you love chopping wood right you just do it because it's fun you're in your backyard chopping wood and then your neighbor pokes his head over the fence and says hey dude can I get a qut of wood I'll pay you for it and you realize oh my God this is a business I've taken my passion and I've created a business and now I'm selling wood door Todo I'm working with my five best friends it's a blast right I'm suddenly making money I can afford to go to the bar life is good and then you Flash Forward 20 years and you wake up and you're a lumber magnate you own five Sawmills and all you do every day is you sit in a little air conditioned box looking down at the the floor you have all these robots working for you and all these hundreds of employees and most of your time is spent doing doing Excel right I think that is the sadness of building a large business and delegating your hands are not on the tools anymore and so for me what's been sad about building the machine is I've built the machine that's freed me to do what I want but the irony is I end up doing things I don't want as a result because ultimately I was a designer I loved putting on headphones and being in Photoshop and designing websites and writing and so for me it's been searching where do I get the flow state that I used to get running a five person compan let's let's roleplay it here so I have a company I want to hire Ace I I've realized I can do this third door and I'm like you know what that's the right move I should hire a CEO but where the heck am I going to find a CEO that I could trust that's going to not only not ruin it but actually you know hopefully grow the business in some way what's the what's step one so step one you have to really assess is your business big enough right is this the right thing is this the right time so ultimately you want to ask does your business have product Market fit and can it actually afford a CEO right is this uh is this a corner store like where it's kind of an owner operator kind of business where you just kind of have to run it and if you leave all the profit gets eaten up by somebody else or is this something that's really scalable so I generally as a rule of thumb will say you probably shouldn't hire a CEO until your business is doing $300,000 or so of profit and if it is that means that you can swap yourself out and you can afford to hire someone a reasonable based salary and then you can incentivize them to grow the business business and so one of the one of the really interesting things that people kind of obsess over is they say well you know a CEO could cost 500,000 my business is only doing $3 million and $300,000 of profit and what they kind of Miss is that generally a CEO has paid a base salary but most of their comp comes from bonuses and the bonuses are based on the business growing and so it's one of those things where it's like if your business is doing 300K of profit you can basically take two or 300 K of that invest it in the base salary for the CEO and then all of their additional comp will come from the growth of the business and so you've align them with your goals so first thing is my B business big enough so you said two two criteria product Market fit meaning we we know what the hell we're doing we're not in the figure it out figure out the product figure out the market uh figure out the what is the offering and changing that every three weeks because it's not working like you have a reasonable continuous cycle of supply and demand for what you're doing and then said profit around 300,000 as the kind of that's the minimum bar I would say so in there I mean occasionally you can let's say you've got a friend who's super Scrappy who wants to sink their teeth into something and you've got a small business that's like a I always call them like an ember it's not really a fire yet it's an ember and someone needs to come blow on it you could do that but I think there's a lot more risk there you really want a machine that's operating you want a car that can drive on the road um before you put someone in and then the other question is can you make someone Rich right because ultimately people who are good great exceptional CEOs they're looking for opportunity and upside and by Nature the fact that they're a Hired Gun CEO tells me they're not necessarily an entrepreneur they don't want to take total risk they want a nice salary they want bonuses they're not necessarily willing to risk at all but often they want to know they can get rich in a in a CEO way so they can make singled digigit Millions for the first time ever uh if everything plays out or maybe they can get a big payout if the business sells or gets to a large scale or whatever it is but ultimately you want to know that you can make someone wealthy with it and so we'll do the exact comp stuff in a minute but the second question you have so first was is the business big enough and do we have prod fit then you also said to me once like are you willing to walk away I think there's a mental side of it too are are you ready to hire a CEO yeah and that's really hard I mean you know do you I remember I got to the point where I fantasized about giving the keys away to someone else and when I finally did I was elated you know but there's a lot of people who aren't like that I can think of one of my friends to him his business is his baby and when people mess with his baby he gets really angry and he doesn't like it and so you need to be willing to walk away and effectively look at it this way as entrepreneurs we all we're all birthing these these uh business babies and now you're giving them to a foster parent can you tolerate that you know can you cope with that someone else parenting your child because that's really what it is and not only that but you have to be disciplined for it to work you need to either be all in or all out you have to empower this person you can't be sitting there looking over their shoulder so I think those are the two kind of fundamental questions to this right are you are you is your business big enough and are you willing to walk away but but when you're accepting the when you're saying all right I'm going to walk away is it I'm walking away because this person's going to to make everything greater than I could or are you walking away thinking to yourself I know it's not going to be as good with me in it but it could be 80% as good and I won't have to worry about it well let let me put it this way the let's say that you're an exceptional product person you'll know the product won't be quite as good because generally people who are good at marketing and sales and operations and finance are just not as good at product so you're going to sacrifice on the product side a little bit but you're going to know the business itself will be so much healthier and grow um at least from a financial measure I found that going from being a checked out founder operating your business reluctantly to somebody who's highly incentivized for growth who's excited to do it almost always the business like doubles in the first year I've been astounded by how much I had been holding back my business yeah that's a great question great answer that seems pretty consistent with what I've heard a Founder the other day was telling me after maybe 8 nine years of running his business he hires a CEO he plans to stick I'm hey I'm here I'm available for the next year transition he's like yeah they haven't called in a little while um you know we be we beat our numbers which I wasn't able to do the last three years and uh everything seems to be going really well turns out uh turns out they didn't need me as much he's like little hit to the ego but also wait isn't this exactly what I wanted and um you know he was he was sort of pleasantly surprised on the upside from there so let's talk about finding the right person how do you actually find a great CEO what do are you looking for so generally I like to I like to find someone who's run a same or similar business that's double the size so let's say I have an e-commerce brand um selling candles well I I don't necessarily need to go find a CEO um who's run a candle business before but I want to find someone who's sold a similar product online and I will generally think about who are my who are my competitors or what companies do I admire and then I'll go on link in and I'll just look for um president coo um sometimes CEO but usually I will recruit a number two and it's that person who's been eagerly awaiting getting you know kned as the CEO and they haven't stepped up yet uh I find those are wonderful people to delegate the business to uh and then separately recruiters and that's a topic we can dig into people have a lot of opinions I had a lot of opinions about uh recruiters that I've actually changed over time but yeah you got I I find broadening the Spectrum with recruiters can be really helpful we have to get a quick shout out to Ty Burke my old roommate and someone I used to recruit and I know you Ed them as well you also use like crazy amounts of uh uh reference checks so here's what we do so we buy the business and as we're buying the business we start asking the question as soon as we know we're going to buy the business or we're going to delegate we we hire a recruiter immediately now recruiters really pissed me off before it was like real filters where I'm going like man why am I paying this guy $100,000 to open a door for me I can just go on you know like Zillow and find the the the house I want to buy and here's this middleman charging a lot of money and I kind of felt like why would I pay some guy to go on LinkedIn and message A bunch of people for me I can do that myself but I realized that I'm distracted and when I need to hire someone I will often just go on LinkedIn or whatever for 10 minutes I'll text a bunch of my friends I'll try and think of people that I have like in an apple note that might be a good CEO I'm not going Broad and so basically um I've come around on recruiters there's some really exceptional recruiters like Ty Burke who um from search Partners who Sam introduced me to he's one of my favorite we also really like Matt Hollingsworth from Al line um and what the way I use a recruiter is just to broaden the Spectrum so even if I'm going to go on LinkedIn myself and look for someone I'm might end up bringing the person to the table who we end up hiring we now have somebody who's um reaching out to people I never would have spoken to and then they're also handling a lot of that administrative work of pushing the process along they're doing the initial interview and one really fascinating thing I didn't contemplate before is a recruiter saves you an insane amount of time let's say that you have 10 candidates for CEO and every single one of those candidates you're going to have to do a zoom with and that'll take 30 minutes to an hour well I think we all know we you've all had that experience where you interview someone and in the first 30 seconds you know they're a dingus right and then you're just desperately thinking like okay how can I get off the phone as quickly as possible not waste time but not have this person think I'm a total [ __ ] and so now I have the recruiter do that call and I get them to record the zoom and then I just watch the first couple minutes and if I'm vibing with the person then I'll move them on to the next stage so if think about from that perspective your time is highly valuable and you've just saved 10 hours of time what is that worth I think a lot and then in some instances um we've actually hired uh people that we brought in that's fine and I just pay the recruiter anyway but in other instances they've brought people in that we never would have found so the guy that runs Aeropress Gerard Meyer we found him via Tha and he was a guy where uh he had run Soda Stream us and he just wasn't on my radar whatsoever and he's one of our best CEOs so I kind of look at the recruiters as a time-saving mechanism um they broad note the the people you look at but ultimately it's just like a tax I pay to have someone else be incentivized to push everything along um and so I'm actually a big fan of recruiters now but you got to use the right people I find there's a lot of terrible recruiting firms and we've used a lot of really bad ones over the years and the recruiting firm uh what are they running you so usually it's a percentage of first year salary I think it's about 20% so you know when you're hiring a CEO and you've got total comp of you know 300 Grand 500 Grand it can be expensive um but I think it's worth paying for if you can find the right partner on it and you mentioned uh looking for a number two who's run a similar sized or similar uh similar industry company um here's what I take that to me you tell me what I what I miss let's say You're The Candle Company you don't need somebody who's run a Candle Company tox the size but maybe you want e-commerce you want it maybe where Facebook was their primary Chan sales Channel maybe you want uh something like candles like maybe selling to the similar customer base or a one-time onetime purchase product not something that's you know a total different kind of like buying psychology um is that right just first on that part yeah you want someone who understands roughly how the customer thinks and then also the channels by which that product is sold right so one one fascinating thing I'll add to is when I'm interviewing them I always ask myself um what is this person's Hammer right so there's that great quote to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail and what I've seen with with CEOs is their Hammer is either Marketing sales operations or Finance right they go to one of or or product they go to one of those things and you know to the product person we released the most beautiful product in the world and if you build it they will come to the salesperson it's let's build a 50 person uh Enterprise sales team to the marketing people it's we're going to spend a million dollars a month on Facebook ads so you want to be listening incredibly carefully to what is the mechanism by which they grow companies because usually that's the one if they did it at their last company they're probably going to try and repeat it right and so what you want them to do is when they look at your company they go oh my God like this is so easy I've done this a million times before I've taken businesses from a million dollar in sales to $10 million in sales and I've done that you know between one in five times in a similar business so at this point are you just constantly collecting people I mean is that kind of how you look at your job is I'm just always I mean because if you're having to talk to all these people constantly and you have 40 companies that's like pretty much all your time I'm always thinking about that I mean my worst fear is we're going to be recruiting for a CEO role and I'm going to forget about that guy I met at that conference you know five years ago or whatever so Chris and I have a Apple notes that we share and we just keep writing down names of people we think are interesting that are Executives sometimes or even within our companies it'll be people that are come up and coming in one of our other businesses that we've thought might be a good CEO for another business um but yeah I'm always trying to scan the Horizon for people who are um smart and I can bring in but interestingly often it is every process is different and and when we hire a recruiter um only like 20% of the time is it someone uh now that we've brought in often it is someone that they go Source I love the uh what's their Hammer question uh because it's so true that the the more experienced somebody gets and the more successful somebody gets they start to develop this hammer and they try to they go run around looking for for ways that they can apply that thing they know to everything whether it's the right thing or not um I think this is a good thing and a Bad Thing uh I've seen the same advice given to kind of um YC type of companies or in Silicon Valley where when you hire a CEO if you hire a CEO That Grew their previous Company by creating a giant sales Army but you're trying to do product Le growth it's a total mismatch you might say oh wow they grew that company from 10 million to 200 million and that sounds good but if they did it in a way that's totally different than yours very few people can repeatably grow businesses using totally new methodologies for sales and marketing and I'm ious also what's your Hammer like uh if if you're a man if you're a man with a hammer running around what what is yours well I would say I'm a man with a lot of different hammers um I've gone really broad now because I've seen so many different ways of growing businesses and I think um I have a lot of tools in the toolkit my old Hammer was product I would always just be like oh my go actually you know what I do have a hammer okay so so my old Hammer was product so I would always do Field of Dreams marketing I would say we're going to build the best product in the world I'm a designer you know I was really proud of what we're doing uh and that'll solve everything and I realized that really doesn't work very well and now I would say my hammer is finance so uh or operations so really what I'm doing is I'm looking at a business I'm going if one if we could just change one thing what would that one thing be that would give the business leverage and often it's something really simple it's like oh pricing right or they're just not selling ads properly something really boring and to to be honest I feel a little depressed as I say that because you're a sellout bro you're a sellout the designer from 20 years ago would be really sad and I still love don't get me wrong like so when we bought let me give arero press as an example I I just unboxed our new Aeropress clear and I just checked out the designs for a couple unreleased products and that was the best day of my month right I love building great products I love being involved with that knowing that if we hadn't bought that business that wouldn't have happened but when we bought Aeropress the boring assumption I made was I'm just going to do really good um online marketing and e-commerce it's really simple they didn't sell online that was my one Insight that was my hammer on that deal and now the bonus the gravy is we get to do amazing products and I get deserve you got you you need to go throw away your Herman millich chair and your Birkenstocks and go put on a vest you nerd you're no longer I know I know I know I know I want to self flatulate so I want to I want to talk about though um some of the things you have to accept about hiring a CEO and also when you interview a CEO what you want to look for um because I think that's probably one of the most important things one of the so to go back to this whole Hammer thing so when I interview a CEO I'm looking for whether or not I not along when I when I interviewed Gerard for from apress he told me what he wanted to do with the company and I already had a lot of those same thoughts and I was nodding along and going oh my God he's putting it better than I ever could and the reason that's important is because when you hire a CEO you are a rider on an elephant right so when you're a rider on an elephant the elephant is going to go anywhere it wants and you're just stuck you can't tell an elephant where to go it's way bigger than you and ultimately it's going to follow peanuts wherever wherever wherever it wants to go and so it's really important that you agree with their uh strategy and one of the ways that this has failed for us is I've loved the CEO candidate and they've said something like uh Hey I was looking at the business and I really think we need to go hard into Facebook ads and I would kind of scratch my head and go well we already kind of tried that I was kind of thinking more this is like an email marketing um you know marketing strategy that we should deploy and they would all always just double down right whatever they say the first time is usually what they're actually going to end up doing and they're just going to use their Hammer um so that's incredibly important is having that alignment and the fit with what else are you looking for in that interview not along what's their Hammer what else so I mean the most important question is do you get the creepy crawlies after you walk away do you feel in any way any cognitive dissonance any weirdness does your stomach feel off um you know you someone could be incredibly Charming I often get this um you know Psychopaths for example they're very Charming people they are wonderful to hang out with but you might walk away and be like there's just something off like something in their eyes or have you had that yeah yeah and I'll tell some stories um but I think the most important thing is you know would you let them babysit your kids right I think like you know either you guys I would let you babysit my kids right but and that's important you're going to hand over your company your baby to this person so you have to have profound trust and so often Chris and I we look for people who are real um so they can be I don't like slick people I like people who their armpits get really sweaty in the interview I like people who get kind of nervous and scratch their face when you ask them hard questions I want to see that someone is a human and when things get tough they will want to do the right thing um and so that's that's like really critical um you know do you walk away energized right you can really like somebody but if you don't walk away energized um you know that's that's not great and then also are they down to have alignment are they down to have skin in the game because ultimately you know the worst type of CEO would be this so let's say Sam's hiring someone to run Hampton and uh they say I want a million dollars a year based salary and you're like okay well you know could we do some bonuses do want Equity how could we create alignment and they just want like lowrisk cash guaranteed that's not someone you want to be working with you want someone who is willing to have skin in the game and risk with you and work on the long term and there's a lot of very shiny fancy Executives that basically want zero risk and they just want to make a [ __ ] ton of money and you got to avoid those people like the plague have you found any correlation between um age or where they live like if they're from a Silicon Valley Company New York company middle of America or wherever the equivalent stereotype is of Canada well I mean I wouldn't say that there's anything about uh where they're from or even what they look like or how they dress or anything like that although I'll talk about that and the importance of matching your cultural DNA with their DNA but the number one thing is the big company people right you you really don't want the flashy person who's got the the you know the LinkedIn with five years at Accenture followed by IBM followed by you know whatever executive role I find that when you take a big a big company person and you put them in a smaller company they just don't know how to function they're not bad there's nothing wrong with those people they just don't know how to function they're used to having like you know an army of people doing everything for them and it's kind of like um I always think about it like restaurants so let's say that you have um you hire let's say you have one restaurant with no systems and you go and you hire the chain restaurant let's say you find a guy who runs like an olive garden and you're like oh my God this guy really understands how to run like a tight tight ship and all the systems and stuff you put them back in um you know your restaurant and they're like well I don't know how to build the systems I didn't do this I just go to my handbook my Olive Garden handbook and they tell me how to do everything so you kind of get that in big company people so you got to avoid the big company folks one Nuance that you didn't say but I'm pulling out is you want somebody who's run a company 2x the size not 20x the size you would think 20x is better right no no it's not actually better 2x is kind of The Sweet Spot of what you're looking for is that correct totally well there's this funny uh I I think of it as like there's a a variety of different skills and if you let's use Chipotle for some reason I always go back to Chipotle but um think about this so there's the guy who invented the burrito right that's that's kind of like if you think about it that's like the founder of the founder right then there's Steve 's the guy that started Chipotle he went hey burritos are a great food let's scale this up let's turn this into a fast casual concept then there's someone who came in and scaled it to a bunch of stores right I think that was still Steve that's a kind of a different skill set he went from one store to say 20 stores and then they scaled it to like thousands of stores and then they managed a public company these are all different skill sets right each of those levels are some uh you know a whole different set of skills right the guy who invented the burrito is very different than the person who would be great at scaling Chipotle to a th000 stores and so I think you really just want to be accepting of you're you're almost running a um what's it called like a you pass the Baton what what is that a marathon a relay race yeah and so you might say the person that you hire the CEO you hire to take your business from two to 10 million you know what at 10 million you're probably going to bring in some new person to run the company then and they're going to know their scale and then you keep going through this and occasionally you're going to get people who read a lot and learn a lot and are highly adaptable and can keep going but usually you know a CEO is really effective for between five and 10 years and every once in a while you get the the special cases that can go the distance and even those exceptions even Mark Zuckerberg who's been running Facebook for 20 plus years he has Cheryl and Cheryl does a bunch of stuff so that he can keep inventing their next burrito he's like oh great I'm going to focus on AI I'm going to focus on metaverse and somebody else will do you know ad operations at this point because that's not what I want to be scaling up or the Google guys did the same thing with Eric Schmidt right they bring they brought in effectively you know a CEO to to run that so that they could keep going and creating the next Chipotle can you talk about transitioning I think this is actually the hardest part um of all this is transitioning and like you have always given me advice and whenever and I believe your advice was right and I followed it but at first your advice was basically just bail uh and and and you were like just talk to him like once a month and then once a quarter and then once a year um and I was like well I was gonna like keep working there and talking to him every single day and like G feedback constantly and be in all these meetings and you're like no so Sam is the question like you've hired the CEO what what are those first 100 days supposed to look like yeah and then and then after 6 and 12 months what's it look like because it's this is the hard part where emotion typically takes over logic totally and it's terrifying to use the baby analogy you know you imagine you're you have this beloved baby and then you watch the foster parent and they're playing a little rough with your kid and you don't quite like what they're they're feeding them and well they don't really know the nap time routine right so it's a little bit scary passing off your business baby to somebody else um what I what I think you do have to rip the Band-Aid and let them jump in the pool I think it's incredibly important that you ERT to your top Executives this person is in charge and uh you can't come to me anymore right so what I what I like to do what I would do in the early days is I would make the announcement explain why I'm making the announcement why I'm making the change and then I would I would literally leave slack I would stop responding to texts from the executives I wouldn't respond to email and I would say to the CEO look you know you're in charge let's do a check-in in a month and then I would just completely check out and I'd say you know look if you want if there's any emergencies you can always call me and get get an opinion but do you give them like a guide like are you like compiling everything in notion like I don't know like like hamb well maybe maybe not maybe not quite a guide or something but you're doing a lot of brain dumps right you're going to spend a couple days with them and go through everything but uh you know business is funny like everything tastes like chicken like a competent CEO will be able to jump into most businesses within five 10 days be able to kind of get the lay of the land and get moving um so I don't I don't do too much of that transition stuff um and and then fir so first you're checking in maybe every two weeks then you're checking in every four weeks then you're checking in every three months and then if you want you can go to six months or a year and I really think that the worst thing you can do is have them writing you a whole bunch of reports and constantly text them and engaging them and making them feel they don't have power and then worse than that the swoop and poop right like so you bypass them you text your old VP of marketing you say I noticed you guys stopped AB testing this on the homepage what's going on with this and then before you know what your CEO feels you're undermining them and all the executives go well I see who's still pulling the strings you know Sam's still in charge I'm just going to go back to Sam and then the water the stress Finds Its way back to you so um I'm a big fan of just being I mean you got to do your diligence if you're going to give this person your business baby you got to know they're not a a epic piece of [ __ ] right that's very important but if you've done all that we can talk about all the diligence stuff so you got to get comfortable that passing your business to this person is going to be okay well how many months or quarters of mistakes or misses do you let them have well it depends I mean you know is it a hard business or an easy business how Stark is it you know was it the moment they started within a month the performance went to [ __ ] is there a good reason for that I think it's a really hard question I mean we've had very very competent CEOs join hard businesses and the business gets worse under their purview doesn't necessarily mean they're doing a bad job it could be a macro problem or there could be some other headwind so I think that's up to you to assess I always say um you know you want Flesh Wounds not mortal wounds so would I allow a CEO to spend 500,000 on some R&D boond doggle yeah maybe I don't want them to feel that I'm holding them back but would I allow them to announce to all the employees that they're changing the business model and shutting down some critical Revenue line uh maybe not you know I'd probably watch something like that and ultimately I think it's important that you say I'll never forget when I was reading 4our Work Week Tim Ferris had this whole thing about anything less than $55,000 doeses not require my opinion and I think it's important you set that control with the CEO so you say anything that that you want to spend more than $300,000 on I want you to come to me I want you to discuss right so you can kind of build a bit of a bounding box around that we got to take a drink every time you say a cute Canadian phrase uh we've got boondoggle we have Dingus we've got creepy Crawley what else you got for us Dingus Dingus isn't even Canadian it's actually it's from Tim Tim and Eric do you guys ever watch Tim and Eric yeah I want I want more of that go ahead Sean let's do um let's finish up actually in the hiring and diligen in stuff so I I have I have one more on the interview so do you meet in person or are you trying to do everything in Zoom do you like spend spend time you know any extended time with them yeah I like to meet them in person yeah um I think there's something to looking someone in the eye seeing how they their body language is you just can't get that same level of diligence I have hired people sine many times but for major hires I always want to meet them in person so in terms of diligence it this is the most critical thing and this is where we've made the most mistakes right you can avoid endless pain if you just diligence people carefully um and this is you know anyone who's hired people at a company knows this you know check references top grading there's all these different ways of doing it um but there's a couple um you know there's this idea of like trust but verify right so I'll trust my gut that's my first screen um and then I'll perhaps introduce them to like one or two other people I trust so like Chris might talk to the CEO as well someone else from our team we'll assess okay do we get any creepy crawly Vibes if that's not the case if we don't then we'll move into actual diligence and we've learned the hard way we've made a couple really bad hires um that burned us and so we actually use these former CIA guys to do background checks they're called business intelligence advisers kind of like CIA but with a b and they are incredible they will interview they'll so they'll call up the person they'll talk to them for an hour or so and they'll write down every single thing they say so if they say oh in college I was a athlete they'll they'll verify that if they say um oh I left that company because XYZ well they'll go and uh look up that company and they'll message five people who might have worked with them and so you end up getting this dossier on the person that gives you a high level thing of what are the what are the positives what are the negatives um and then also have they ever been um you know accused of a crime have they ever had like a track record of like not paying bills uh legal records all that kind of stuff so I think that's really important and we um we've made a really bad hire um about 10 years ago and the guy basically was like full of [ __ ] about a whole bunch of stuff on his resume and it ended up being a nightmare and so after going through that experience I think it's well worth paying between 10 and $20,000 to get this deep reference check done um and so that I think that's just so critical that's that's amazing do you uh sounds like between the recruiter and the reference check the the background check people you might be spending anywhere between 50 and $100,000 of transaction costs in recruiting a CEO I'm assuming you can't do that when it's a $300,000 a year profit business what is the minimum bar you use when you're gonna when you're going to pay for both the the the good recruiter and the the background checks and what would you do for the if you're the person who is more at the 300,000 a year profit um and maybe can't afford those transaction costs how would you do it DIY well I would just follow the same process right so you know you're not going to be able to hire the recruiter and afford them and so you're going to try and cast your net really broad you're going to talk to a lot of different people when it comes to verifying what the person tells you the number one thing is never call the references they give you right any snaky person can find three buddies who can you know say that they're great or whatever it is I always try and Scuttle butt so I'll say Okay um my friend invest in that company and I'll ask them to ask the CEO why that person left or if they recommend I also have this trick I don't remember where I got it but I love this one you email a whole bunch of people who used to work with them or the former CEO they worked for and you say hey I'm doing a reference check on this person um I'd love to talk to you about them if you don't respond to this email I'll take it as you didn't have a good experience oh Eyes Cold such a great it's such a great trick it's such a great trick because if they don't respond people will almost always respond because they don't want to [ __ ] on somebody if they um if you know if they have anything good to say but if they have something bad to say it gives them an out because a lot of people I found are worried about legal liability they don't want to go and like you know say this person's a piece of [ __ ] and then that person sues them or something like that dude I'm going to use that line for any email I want uh I'll just like ask someone anything like if you don't if you don't reply I'll assume you hate yourself and your family yeah exactly sales guys do that all the time it's the worst um okay so you found the person how do you negotiate and structure the comp package for the CEO so um I always like to make the first offer um because ultimately you kind of know what you're willing to pay and what makes sense based on who they are and I think you kind of have to scale up or down based on their experience so there's times where I've taken a risk where I've said you know what this person was um they're a VP marketing but they really have CEO energy and I'm going to take a chance on them I'm going to try and um you know pay less for someone like that I'm not necessarily going to put them into like full CEO comp I'm going to try and go high variable low base um but someone who's more established you know I'm going to give them basically what they what they want and uh and whatever we think the range is there um and then the most important thing is to use total compensation so when you make the offer so let's say let's say I have a business that's doing $300,000 of profit and I can comfortably afford a CEO base salary of 150 Grand right so let's say this person is worth 300 Grand a year 400 Grand a year I'm going to go to them and I'm going to say I'm going to pay you 300 Grand a year but it's going to be $150,000 base and it's going to be $150,000 bonus and the bonus is if you get me to $600,000 of eitaa right and so you're basically using the profits that they've created to pay them the bonus and you've created alignment between the two of you but it's important never to just say well I'm going to offer you $150,000 a year plus a bonus because in their head they're going like no I'm a $300,000 a year person right so I always lead with What's the total compensation and then what needs to be true to achieve that compensation I'm also a big fan of cap bonuses so for example let's say the target is you know $600,000 of eitaa well if they do $1.2 million of EA I want them to get double the bonus maybe even triple the bonus um and that's worked really well for us so the idea of saying look I'm gonna offer you $300,000 a year but it might be$ 600,000 it might be a million dollars a year depending on how you perform um and then the other thing is equity is just hard um I'm not a big fan of stock options I like to try and find people who are willing to if they want Equity they're willing to write a check so if a CEO comes to me and they say okay but I need you know I need Equity I need skin in the game I'm gonna say something like okay so you want um $40,000 of equity per year uh are you willing to lower your compensation by $40,000 or are you willing to write a check you know do you have do you have a stock portfolio you can sell and you can inject the money into the business and I'll let you buy in at a really great valuation and if they don't want to do that then sometimes I'll even loan the money I'll say I will personally loan you the money and then you're going to write a check and you're going to buy it and I have the right to buy back your if you leave I have the right to buy back your stock at whatever multiple of the earnings at the time or whatever it is how how how do people react to that conversation because that's very different than where a lot of people are probably coming from well I want them to Value the equity and they don't value the equity when they get stock options they just look at it they don't even consider it as part of total comp so let's say that like all here's here's the kind of thing I'd hear so they say um I want to make 400 Grand a year and and I want equity and I'd say well okay how is the equity going to work they go well I think I should have 5% and let's say the business is worth $100 million so they've now said Okay I want $5 million and you're like okay well you're you're worth four to five 00k a year based on your track record and your experience and all that kind of stuff how am I supposed to give you $5 million of equity that just doesn't make sense and so I always try and talk about it in terms of what's the cash value of the equity that they're receiving and how do we create a scenario where we have shared downside and a lot of people in Silicon Valley are used to stock options and the way stock options work is let's say sam you joined my company and the stock price is $100 and I say here's $100,000 of stock options at $100 share price if the Shar is drop to $50 it's a lotto ticket and it's a zero it's not worth anything if it goes up then it's worth a shitload and so you end up with this kind of binary situation where they have this lotto ticket that pays out big or as a zero and so what that means is if your value of your business goes down even 10% % they're basically at a zero and so they're disincentivized so I just I don't love stock options and in general I only like giving Equity to people who are willing to sacrifice something for it otherwise you know why why wouldn't I just pay you a really fat bonus if you get down to it that's usually what Executives want they want to do an addition to their house they want to go on crazy vacations they like cash most of the time quick kind of question as we round up to what the downside of all this is is like everything you're saying I think sounds when I hear it I'm like this is the way is a fair argument against this that founder-led companies typically have more Innovation or more soul and things like that and that it's better to have one thing go big versus many things that are potentially okay is that a fair argument do you think or no yeah but I think like I said in the beginning I think it comes down to personality like I think if you're so for me when I was running metalab I started five other companies in the first three years because it was irresistible to me right now I knew the right thing to do might have been to focus on the business but my personality is that I want to go do other stuff so Sam like you seem super focused right and maybe you're better off just having one Focus you wake up every day you you think about one thing but if you start finding yourself getting drawn into other businesses it would be a huge service to continue to run that business right so I think ultimately it comes down to being true to yourself you shouldn't if you're listening to this go oh I should go do this you should only go do this if you're drawn to it it's the same advice I give to entrepreneurs they say well should I go and work in a company or should I be an entrepreneur and I kind of go well if you have to ask that question the answer is probably no right because for me I could never consider working for someone else I if I whenever I had a job I just wanted to shove the boss out of the way way and take the wheel of the business so I think to me it's just it'll be obvious if this is something that appeals to you you'll know you'll be listening to this nodding along and going oh my God I can I can do this I just didn't know I could do it and not feel guilty well dude this is awesome we love having you come on um what do you think Sean yeah this is great and it's also um earned information so this is not something that you you might be able to read in a book but a lot of the Nuance of what you described is from hard lessons that were you know things that went right many mistakes of things that went wrong and the lessons you've learned so we all got to benefit from you know your 20 years of experience kind of going through this process yourself and um I know for me it was a huge unlock to be able to hire a CEO and do that successfully and I was like wow this is cheat codes oh my God I get the business is going to do well it's going to do better than if I was doing it you know I get all of the reward without any of that work and it's a total great trade for this person because I kind of didn't really appreciate how many people are entrepreneurial but maybe not entrepreneurs they are people who are great CEOs but they also got two kids they don't want to take full-on risk so they they want that kind of medium upside um low downside and uh finding that fit has been pretty huge for me so I think that's great A lot of the things that you said that stood out to me the golden nuggets for me was find the find the number two at a business that's two 2x bigger but similar to to the one you're in right now figure out what's their Hammer because that that's probably it everybody's a man with a hammer and and you just have to make sure that that's the right hammer for your your business um and then pay up on the on the reference checks and the recruiter to make sure that you you get enough candidates and then you find the right person because that's a it's a necessary tax you have to pay once the business is big enough that you can support this and then leave them alone that's the other thing most people don't leave them alone they say well it didn't work you know in the first two weeks they did something I didn't agree with so I def fire them what's the balance there like you leave them alone but you don't leave them completely alone I think for you guys they send you what a f a finance only update every every month and then is there anything else to it like a strategy planning thing or do you do anything else so what we used to do is we do a report every single month and they would write like here's what's going on in the business here's the numbers and that was just crazy we couldn't keep up and it also wasted a lot of their time now we get just the numbers to head office and we meet the CEOs annually and then often uh there's certain CEOs we don't even meet because they're within operating platforms so we just meet with the CEO of that operating platform uh usually like monthly or quarterly and check in um by the way this is the number one thing I get emails on like literally like every single day I get questions about it on Twitter and on email and so I actually wrote a PDF on here like a checklist basically on are you ready to hire a CEO and how to hire a CEO and if you sign up for my newsletter it's never enough.com newsletter uh I'm gonna post the PDF uh next week I think awesome okay great I think that's that's the that's the Pod everybody should go check it out never.com what newsletter newsletter yeah and we'll link to it in yeah we'll link to it down here um all right dude thank you that's the pod [Music]

an idea is like an [ __ ] everyone has one okay ideas don't mean anything this guy is known as the Indian Warren Buffett he's billionaire investor Mish PAB and last month I went to his house and asked him to teach me everything he knows about investing how did you make your money after taxes after everything I got a million dollars and I for the first time had money in the bank right that million became what 13 million and uh I said wow well done Mish and uh so they got 70% a year compounded how the hell were you getting these returns I'm always looking at what is hated and unloved the key to moving the needle is inactivity have met and become friends with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett good afternoon Mr Buffett and good afternoon Mr Munger my name is monish PAB how does that happen it shouldn't happen when I look at a CEO I always try to find out did they run a lemonade stand when they were 12 because if they didn't run the lemon stand when they were 12 they're not going to be that great at business at 30 how stupid can you be if you know the big picture you can change the big picture the most important thing in life is are you a fan of uh Bitcoin are you a Believer if you put a gun to my head I would say what do you think about uh Elon Musk Elon is not human if I said what's the number one trait that makes a great investor what comes to mind [Music] all right welcome good morning great to be here Sean you are a great investor but you started as a businessman I'm a businessman trying to become a great investor uh how do those two relate in our brains we actually use the exact same part of the brain uh in both activities so Warren Warren Buffett has a great quote he says I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and I'm a better businessman be because I'm an investor and uh and in his case uh a lot of people don't know but Warren had done a lot of different businesses in uh different areas before he was 17 starting when he was uh I think five or six years old his very first business was uh buying um buying cokes from his grandfather's store at uh at a nickel a piece and then selling them at a dime a piece right buy wholesale sell retail yeah so that was one of his first first ones and one of the things that a lot of uh people don't uh understand about the way our brains work is the human brain actually when we are born it is the most underdeveloped organ uh when we born because the birth canal is not wide enough so for the first 5 years of life the brain is the fastest growing organ that we have as humans the neuron connections are growing at a exponential rate uh from the age of about 11 to about 20 uh that window is when the brain is set up to specialize and um the neuron connections get cut uh so they actually go down quite a bit but the brain allocates areas to own in and specialize so you know if you think of someone like Michelangelo or uh Bill Gates or even Warren Buffett these these guys started specializing at 101 and uh if you start writing code at the age of 10 or 11 for example um like like Bill Gates did by the time he was 20 the expertise that he had someone else starting at 20 would not be able to match him even at 50 so that tenure window is a very critical window in human development and uh unfortunately our education system doesn't recognize that and unfortunately I'm 35 so it's too late we hope there are some 11y olds listening or we hope when you have kids tell your kids yeah you it's not all the the the Cake's not fully baked yet uh so I think the the thing with Warren was that that I think when he was about 10 or 11 years old he was running uh a bunch of very interesting businesses what was he doing I've never heard these so uh yeah like I didn't know this back one first businesses was he used to go to this racetrack in Omaha called aarbon which is Nebraska spelled backwards and uh he used to publish racing tips called stable boy selections basically telling you what what horses to bet on and uh and then also what he would do is when all the races had been run he'd collect all the discarded tickets on the ground and he'd go home and go through each one carefully to see if some drunk had thrown out a winning ticket and and he'd find a few he'd find a few but he was too young to go to the window to collect because under 18 so he would give them to his Aunt Alice who would go and collect for him around the age of 14 or 15 um he had a very good friend in high school called Don Danley and and Danley was a tinkerer he was like very mechanically inclined so one time I think uh Warren went to his home and he saw that uh Don's working on a pinball machine in his garage and uh he asked Don what he's doing he oh I just bought this pinball machine that wasn't working they gave it away paid like 15 bucks for it and I think I can get it working and uh Warren asked him uh how much is it going to cost he said it's going to cost like $3 in parts and maybe a couple hours to get it working and then Warren says uh can you find more machines like this which don't work he oh yeah there's a lot of machines you can buy which people people don't want them because they don't work etc so Dawn and him formed a a company in their minds they never actually Incorporated anything they called it the Wilson coin operated Amusement Company and uh they went to barber shops in DC and these two boys you know kind of you know uh nerdy looking 15year olds they went to the barber and said look we work for a Mr Wilson and Mr Wilson did not exist a fictitious character we work for Mr Wilson and Mr Milson has asked us to present you with a proposition that we can put a pinball machine in the barber shop and we'll come by once a week and whatever coins are in there we'll split it 50/50 with you half for you and half for Mr Wilson so so the barber said yeah put it in the corner right and so Warren got Danley busy fixing pinball machines and the two of them would go on weekends and you know get barber shops every week they're making some money and and so I think he had eventually something like 40 barber shops with with these machines and Warren said that the first week he went back to the first barber shop he thought he died and went to heaven so there was like or $6 in there and uh so their take was about like you know $3 on $18 of capital in one week right and uh and he was he just told Don go as fast as you can Danley what are you doing right now exactly Warren had all these different businesses that he was a senior partner and whoever he was working was a junior partner one time uh uh Danley showed him an ad for a Rolls-Royce for sale for $300 but it didn't run it was a old beat up rolls and you know people is giving away like like junk right and he thought he could fix the rolls so they bought the rolls for 300 maybe another 50 bucks in parts and Danley had it running and then they you know sprued it up and they would rent it on weekends for $100 to weddings and uh and then on the weekdays the two of them would go to school the high school in the rolls you know so so what happened is and Warren didn't he didn't know this but he was specializing and figuring out business in that window of time the 11 to 20 right and so by the time he was 19 18 or 19 I think he went to college when he was 17 by the time he was 17 when went to college he had $155,000 and he told his dad um I'm going to pay for my college myself and he also told his dad I don't need an inheritance whatever money there there is you're leaving leave it to my two sisters right I'm I'm I'm I'm good and 15,000 back then is a lot you know it's about 10 to1 so 150 grand 17y old yeah think about 17y old with 150k right and at that time College was cheap you know uh and uh and the other thing is that he got interested in uh investing his his dad was a stock broker so he used to go to the dad's office in the weekends and he says that at the age of 11 he bought his first stock and he said I was wasting my time till then you know and but you know he didn't really have a philosophy he didn't have investing philosophy at 19 he read the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and that was transformational and he thought Ben Graham was this guy who you know died and passed away but then he discovered that Ben Graham was teaching at Colombia he was a professor at Colombia so when he finished his undergrad he applied fed to Colombia to go to business school there so he could uh he could learn directly from engram and he joined uh Colombia's MBA program must have been 20 or something hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database it's totally free if you just click the link in the description below you can go download a collection of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated and so uh what are you waiting for go download it it's free check it out it's in the description below all right back to the show and then of course after that uh uh Graham hired him and isn't there some story where he tells Graham like I'll work for you for free and Ben Graham says uh your price is too high that's correct yeah but he's still ended up convincing him somehow so actually Graham uh at that time Jews were very heavily discriminated L of antism street so Ben Graham who was Jewish wanted to give the fews that he had to Jewish kids and and young Jewish people because there just weren't many opportunities so he basically told Warren look I got to take care of the community right but but then Warren went back to Omaha in about a few months after that uh Graham called him and said uh if you want to come to New York I got something for you and Warren never asked him what the salary was what the position was he just took the next train to New York uh with his uh with his wife his experience as a businessman uh he was very lucky it got seared in in that window of time and both Warren and Charlie they can crack businesses and business models really fast so when we when we start a business uh we will spend maybe three or four 5% of our time on figuring out the strategy you know what's going to be the product service Market yeah all the how we're going to make it work and all the different plans right and then 95 97% is all the blocking and tackling to make it happen right it's Danley fixing machines yeah exactly and so in the case of investing we use the same brain cells that we use in that 3 to 5% of time and and basically uh one of the things that attracted me to investing was that basically that 3% becomes 80% because uh we don't need a Danley we've got public companies and all of that and uh we just have to pick which businesses we want to own partially uh and which ones we want to ride and so on and so I think that um I I always find it strange if I run into investors who haven't been entrepreneurs because I think they're missing a very key part right and on the other hand I find that entrepreneurs are very naturally um already set up to be great investors if they make a couple of tweaks and but what what ends up happening is that we don't see a lot of entrepreneurs becoming investors and we also don't see uh we we see a lot of investors who haven't built businesses met payroll and so both uh both have flaws so if if you had the um the good Fortune of having the entrepreneural experience then I think looking at the buffet Munger Frameworks it's a very easy transition right it's probably also easier to go business to investor than investor for a long time than suddenly go try to be an entrepreneur well investor to business the problem is the windows closed right you so you'd be you'd be at a disadvantage to start with uh and uh but yeah the earlier you start on both Endeavors right the better off you are there's a great uh I don't know if you've seen this but I didn't know like I always heard okay Warren and Charlie great investors I read the shareholder letters and the shareholder letters are often um they're amazing but they're very like they're high level and they're philosophical in a way then you have um I saw this letter of Warren writing a letter to this I think the CEO of C's candy I don't know if you've seen this but it's a it's a letter and it's I expected it to be very again philosophical amusing instead he's like brass tax right away he's like I went to the store and I have a few ideas for you is a very operational tactical I noticed this price point I noticed this and I was like oh he's he's a businessman like he's just like today we only think of him as one bucket but actually he's got both gears C's is a wonderful uh wonderful business it taught it taught them a lot it taught them more than they ever thought they'd learn from a stupid candy business right uh but one of the things Warren did when he first bought C's is he told uh he told the CEO listen you got free reain run the business like you've been running and so on so forth but on December 26th uh I'm going to set the prices for the next year okay okay so he would sit down with the entire C's price list and he would bump all the prices by 10 or 15% and uh inflation might have been 3% right and so he would raise prices significantly of inflation and what he would observe is volumes went up so and then the year after that he'd again bump it by another 10 12% and volume still went up and and so both him and Charlie were amazed that you could have a business where you're continuously raising prices significantly above the rate of inflation and there's no resistance from the customer base to accepting those prices and that's what gave them a huge lesson in Brands and uh you know he was a died in the wool hardcore deep value investor it was really hard for them they paid three times Book value for C's they were choking almost when they paid that amount uh so uh I think the B sees for like 25 million looking back they could have paid 200 million and it would been still would have been a good deal yeah and ciz has uh sent dividends to Burkshire in the billions I mean it's been about 50 years since the purchase and billions of dollars have flown from Seas to birkshire which has then been used to buy a whole plor of other businesses and and if you look at their uh their purchase of coke for example um they they put a quarter of the entire book value of bushire haway into Coke in 1988 if they had not bought C's they would have never bought Coke right so the lessons that they learned about branding and the power of Brands is what led to the coke investment which was a much bigger home run and they've made many more brand Investments since then half the portfolio is an apple right now right one of the best brands in the world and and I think I think Warren understood this notion of consumer behavior and how powerful Brands can be and uh how powerful habits can be and uh and then he went from there so yeah absolutely and uh one of the interesting things about ciz is that CES wasn't this fast grower it wasn't uh they bought it and then it sales exploded but what I think the the beauty of C's if I remember correctly is that it was just no additional Capital had to go in so everything was just free cash flow coming out so so C's is very much a California story right I mean it it was it was uh found founded in California almost all the sales were in California if you look at C's from the time they bought it till today about 50 years um the unit volume has G gone up on average 2% a year okay California GDP probably at least in the 70s 80s 90s was going up about at least four or five% a year so they were actually and part of that might have been the the price increases okay but even with those heavy price increases they still got the volume going up slightly yeah uh but when you overlay that you know you do 50 years of 10% that's that's a very big number right right and so Seas is not cheap today right and now Warren was very excited about being the candy muggle of the world so they tried really hard to send Seas everywhere right I mean they would open open a store in Chicago and then fall flat on their face then they'd open in Arizona and they fall flat on the face they repeatedly tried over and over and over again to broaden seas and expand it and by and large those uh those efforts didn't not work even today the bulk of the volumes of seas is in California right and um and so when the coke investment came about uh they discover they they found something very different than Seas is they knew Seas doesn't travel well but they could look at more than a 100e history of coke and they knew Coke travels really well they're two countries in the world where you can't get coke uh North Korea and Cuba okay if they opened up to Coke in either of those two countries and Coke did not advertise at all sales would take off it's so embedded in the pop culture so even in countries and places where they've never done any branding before you know um people in Pakistan or India or Bangladesh they're having Indian food with a Coke right right so it's it's ubiquitous and that did not exist with Seas candy it wasn't ubiquitous and and Warren understood uh you can't conf you can't consume infinite amounts of candy you know there's an aftertaste and all that Coke you can actually consume a lot of right there's no uh what does he call it taste memory there's no aftertaste yeah yeah that's right so so I think like I said I think they they move from being hardcore quantitative deep value guys to actually understanding a lot of nuances of Brands and consumer Behavior which was very fundamental to how and why boa did so well so you talked about uh specializing kind of that 11 to 20 years oldish window yeah um today you've done phenomenally well you manage I don't know almost a billion dollars or maybe more who knows uh a lot of money uh and done incredibly well investing uh did you did you do that when you were 11 to 20 or or were you a late bloomer so uh no actually it was just dumb luck a lot of things in my life have been dumb luck um so my dad was a quintessential entrepreneur and um he was really good so you know a great entrepreneur one of the first traits you need is you need to be able to identify offering gaps some product or service that ought to exist but doesn't like Starbucks before Starbucks or McDonald's before McDonald's and so on right and so my dad was really good at figuring out that oh this product should be there but isn't and he was really good at identifying these offering gaps he was also really good at starting businesses from scratch but his downfall was that he was always very aggressive and he was always over levered so when the businesses were going he was literally taking every last dime of profit coming in and everything that he could borrow and just pounding into the growth as aggressively as possible and the negative was that when the first headwin showed up the businesses had no staying power right and so they would run into trouble so my brother and I uh I think after we were like maybe 9 or 10 years old um we were like his board of directors okay and I remember like when I'm I think 10 or 11 years old my dad my brother and me would sit down in the evening and we had to figure out how to make the business survive for one more day so all the walls were caving in there were everything going bad and there were a lot of moving parts and we'd put our heads together and we try to figure out how to make it last right and then we'd make it pass the one day and the next night the same thing over right and so I finished many mbas before I was 12 by and and I think at 15 or 16 I was I don't know why my dad did it but I'm really grateful he did he used to take me on sales calls and you know who takes 15 year old on a sales call you know it just doesn't fit but my dad didn't care and that was just incredible for me because I was getting to see um you know I was in um I finished high school in Dubai so I was in Dubai from the age of 16 to actually 19 and in in that window of time my dad had a gold jewelry business and uh so we used to go I used to go with him uh to these um uh he was manufacturing gold jewelry and he was selling it to these uh retail Merchants right and so he's going into cold calling right right and uh and I'm I'm observing him going into a jewelry store he doesn't know them were you a silent Shadow or did you have a role in no no I I was very silent but I was I was soaking it in and sometimes when he was traveling my brother and I would run the business so they were like all these goldsmiths and all that and we'd manage giving them the gold and taking the jewelry and all that so basically I didn't I didn't realize it then but when when I went to college I I studied engineering and then I joined a uh Telecom networking company as an as a R&D engineer and when we were working on these products I'd ask my boss so what are we going to sell this for and who's the customer and what kind of like what are you going to make on it and my boss would tell me those are all questions for marketing and sales we we don't need to care about that just design the product right he didn't know the answers yeah he that's the poker he didn't know the answers didn't care right and I found that all the people I worked with the engineers didn't care I said how stupid can you be you know you you don't have the big picture the big picture is interesting and exciting if you know the big picture you can change the big picture right and uh so what I did after U two and a half years with the Nerds is I switched to International marketing and that was such a breath of fresh a it was so great and I my learning again Skyrocket and I had a big Advantage because I had a very strong engineering background but I also had all the background for my teen years and so uh what I found is that I was able to connect with customers and figure out kind of what they wanted and how to really get the order much better than guys 20 years more experienced than me because they hadn't had all these experiences and they didn't they didn't think like an entrepreneur right it was was just a uh a small subset and and later in life when I heard about Buffett for the first time I found a lot of commonality right I mean he had a he had a very different experience in the sense that he was his own entrepreneur right but one of the things that's really important is that uh when I look at a CEO I always try to find out did they run a lemonade stand when they were 12 because if they didn't run the lemon stand they were when they were 12 they're not going to be that great at business at 30 okay the the little itty bitty Lemonade Stand has a lot of lessons right and and so I think uh when uh when we have kids I think it's really important in that window they don't need to run lemonade stands but they really need to uh be doing what's going to be their calling right and uh and I think that's what the biggest responsibility of parents is they need to expose them to more of what they think think their passion is you know I've done like maybe 500 plus episodes now of this and the podcast is name my first million because when we first started I would just say I was fascinated by the many different ways people became millionaires I thought that's is cool to hear the stories so that's how the podcast started and along the way I noticed three common things of what you were doing in your teens because I used to ask this question I was like you know you're amazing now if I met you when you were 14 what were you doing and would I have known that you were going to go on to do things and most people are very humbled they're like oh you wouldn't have known but then when I say what were you doing it's always something that no other 13 or 14y old is doing it's like oh yeah I used to go to the shop and I found these uh you know these CDs Rosetta Stone that I could go sell for 3x on eBay and I made an ebay account or I you know I started buying shoes and flipping them so it was always like eBay flipping or sneaker flipping is like a a super common one another one was uh competitive video games because a lot of the strategy you know communication collaboration um you know just extreme competitiveness gets built in there and um and there's a couple others but another one is like a Mormon Mission so Mormons who go and have to sell you know Jesus to to a bunch of people get rejected a thousand times in two years they become incredible salespeople and so you you you see these backgrounds where oh you were kind of forged at an early age to to do this well we have a common friend you know s balky right and you you interviewed him for your podcast and S was an entrepreneur at the age of eight or nine you know even maybe even earlier than that right uh he was selling greeting cards he was making and selling on street corners right you know and uh and then by the time he was 11 or 12 I think he was uh riding code and makeing website you know and uh went from there right you know yeah how did you make your money give me the highlights of your progression in terms of your own ability to to generate money and then start to invest it I actually never ever want to be an entrepreneur I never wanted to start a business because I had seen so much turmoil trauma in in my in my childhood right and I remember I was like um uh 24 or 25 years old and my dad was visiting me I was living in Chicago and he tells me it's time to quit and start your own business and uh so I said you know have you forgotten have you forgotten my childhood and uh you know all the ups and downs he so my dad just said oh that's what makes life great right but he said look the company you're you're in my the business I work for had 2,000 people he said you're such a tiny Co Cog in a such a big wheel you could drop dead tomorrow they won't even miss you okay you don't matter and what you really want to to be doing is figure out something where there's an offering Gap and uh go for it right and and I was actually uh getting a little bit frustrated at work because the company had been growing it was getting more and more bureaucratic and um so I actually uh started to think about um what might be possible and I didn't have any money you know basically I was 24 25 so what I did is I came I came up with some uh uh IT services offerings that I thought would be pretty unique because that time client server Computing was uh just getting going early 90s and uh so I had about uh $30,000 in my 401k and I said okay we'll worry about retirement later and we'll pay the penalty I pulled that out nice and I I I applied for every credit card I could get my hands on and uh so I had 70,000 available to me in different uh credit limits in credit cards and so I said okay we've got up to 100,000 that we can play with and the third thing that I did is I basically did both I uh was going to my my job and I had started my company at the same time because basically what I would do is like from like 6:00 to 9: in the morning I'd work on my business and then from 600 p.m. till midnight I work my business again and weekends right but somebody was was paying the rent I still had a paycheck and all that and I said okay once we have enough Revenue clients profit I can quit right and and I always tell uh tell people that basically um if you think about it there's 168 hours in a week your employer needs you for 40 right and if you live close to work or work remote the commute time is not that much and even if you take out time for eating sleep everything else you have at least another 40 50 hours that you can engage on something other than work right and I used to always get great reviews when I was starting my business I said okay look the plan is to not get fired the plan is not to be employee of the year okay right I don't need to overshoot so I said I'm going to give them just enough so I'm just above firing level you know where it's not so bad they call me in and terminate me I need to be above that okay and I did this for about N9 months and then I had clients revenue and all that and I went into my boss and his boss and I resigned right and uh they they said you know Mish U we really couldn't figure out last nine months like you checked out I said exactly I said my my goal was to just do enough so I didn't get fired but she said she said yeah we saw a big drop in the old moish and the new moish and we talked about it and we actually said it's not so bad that we would fire him but there's something off we couldn't we couldn't figure it out right and then so I explained to them I was going into a business my own business was not comparative with theirs yeah and so they said look when your business fails not if your business fails when your business fails you can come back we're going to give you more money we're going to promote you and you're going to do great so I said you know my my plan was that if I failed when I was going to my business if I failed I said look I got my degree I can look for a job I can apply for personal bankruptcy clean everything off and start over right I said this is even better I don't have to look for a job right I get more money right and so I actually felt like the you know people think there's a people have a a false mental model people think entrepreneur take risk entrepreneurs do not take risk they do everything in their power to minimize risk if you think about Buffett's pinball machine business what was the risk those two 14y olds San's 14 year olds took nothing okay it's $15 in a pinball machine which they could use themselves worst case scenario $3 $3 in parts so the second pinball machine will only get bought when the first one's already producing cash right and the third one after the second one so basically there's no risk right if it fails they sell those machines for more than they bought them entrepreneurs are actually great risk reducers they start with something that seems risky but so that's the other thing that is a commonality between entrepreneurs and value investors uh which is why the same brain cells get used both are trying to minimize risk you know we as value investors want to go lowrisk high return and great entrepreneurs that's exactly what they're doing they're going lowrisk high return nobody is doing highrisk High return the only only so if you look at the United States probably around a million businesses more than a million businesses the year get formed in the United States venture-backed businesses um are less than much less than even 1% of that pie might be in most years less than one tenth of 1% right so if there was no venture capital and no Venture back businesses it would make no difference to the landscape okay we'd still have the million businesses being formed Venture back businesses are a different animal because they are high risk High return right the what the VC wants you to do the VC's got 10 bets he doesn't care whether your bet works or not he just wants one of those 10 to work yeah so he wants you to step on the gas as aggressively as possible if you blow up you blow up right right uh when you are an entrepreneur who's not Venture backed that is not how you go you don't put just you know foot on the gas you're very careful about downside protection so what happened even some of the big uh big entrepreneur who Richard Branson oh I think is the people see him as this free you know risk taker Reckless sort of guy but you you've pointed out that that's not true about Richard Branson in this case one of the stories I love about Branson is is when he had the idea to start uh Virgin Atlantic Airline right the minimum that you need to start transatlantic service is a Boeing 747 okay couple hundred million dollars right and uh Branson got Virgin Atlantic off the ground with no money so what he did is he calls um directory assistance in the United States 5551 1212 in Seattle 206 5551 1212 ask for the number for Boeing okay gets the number for boing calls the main switchboard and says um I'd like to lease a 747 that you guys might have hanging around that you're not using they hang up on him right okay keeps calling them and finally the lady of switchboard says uh let me transfer you to someone who can get rid of you properly right so she transfer him to someone who's head of like commercial sales and so this guy tells him listen Mr Branson in every country we have one customer and you are not the customer in the UK it's British Airways and so therefore there's nothing to talk about so Richard tells them listen I I I agree with you that's fine but just humor me for a second do you have a old Boeing 47 lying around that you're not using and he says yeah actually we do and if one of your customers like the one of the UK called you like British AIS called you and they wanted a plane what would you lease it for so he says well I really don't need to have this conversation but we would lease it for about 200,000 a month okay 2 or 300,000 a month and Branson was able to convince Boeing to lease him that 747 because it was sitting and doing nothing right then when he set up uh virging Atlantic he said you get paid for all the future flights in advance because people buy tickets so the plan's going to fly in April people already bought tickets in February right so you say I got cash coming in two months three months before the pl plan's going to fly and I'm going to pay for the fuel 30 days after that plane lands okay so he had negative working capital and the lease payment is also in areas right so basically he's he was able to get Virgin Atlantic off the ground with zero Equity right now the way I look at it is that if if you can start an airline with no money you can start any business with no money right okay you just have to replace Capital with creative thinking right how is it possible that .1% of the population owns almost 70% of all the motels in America I think this is an incredible story can you explain how is that possible in the early ' 70s a dictator came to power in Uganda iamin and ID Amin noticed that in Uganda most of the businesses were controlled by East Asians Indians patels uh they controlled like 80% of the economy and these patels had come to ug Uganda they were brought to Uganda about 100 years ago to work on the railroad almost as slaves right and but because they're natural entrepreneurs they they went from railroad Builders to eventually owning and controlling his old economy and he was pissed so so ID Amin said Africa is for Africans and you guys are not Africans and these patels had been in Uganda for three or four generations that was their home they were Ugandan citizens you know born and raised right and what he did is he nationalized all their businesses and he threw threw them out of the country which just means took their businesses right he just took them yeah yeah he basically confiscated all not their businesses homes everything confiscated all their assets and he told them you got 90 days to leave the country so these these patels in Uganda were stateless okay you you're being thrown out you know you're citizen of a country the country is throwing you out right and uh and they lost all their money so they they were able to convert a very little small sliver of their assets into gold and uh the United States took some Patel as refugees the UK took them uh Canada took them India surprisingly refused to take the Patel refused to recognize the patels had any right to return to India because they said you haven't been here for 100 years and uh and India was at that time dealing with the Bangladesh Refugee crisis so it couldn't deal with anything more but a small number of patels a few thousand of them uh came into the United States in the early 70s the refugees um they didn't have skills there where they could get great jobs um they didn't have they spoke English with a funny accent and um they they realized that look look if we um buy a really small motel 10 12 14 room Motel the family can live in one or two rooms motels are labor intensive right um the family can do all the work you know it's a job and a house together yeah so basically cooking cleaning front desk laundry and so what what they started doing is they would buy these motels and uh basically fire all the staff and move in into two of the rooms and because they had no costs uh they were able to charge nightly rates that were lower that all the neighboring motels so what would happen is that the Patel owned Motel would be running 100% occupancy the other motels couldn't match that rate because they'd lose money right right because they they had staff workers comp and staff and all that stuff right and what the Patel started to do and they Fels were very frugal they basically were vegetarians uh at that time in the US if you were vegetarian you really host you couldn't really eat out anywhere so by uh they were forced to just cook themselves which was cheap right so there wasn't much of a grocery bill and uh what they started doing is as their nephew came of age for example they would help him out to buy his own Motel right and then the nephew would get it going and then the next one the next one and you run this for 50 years and you end up with 70% of the motels in the country under Patel ownership not only that they've actually gone up market now so a lot of the Hilton Marriotts Western if you really look you'll find it's under Patel ownership right same same math they always are very good operators and then they went into 7-Eleven laundro mats Dunkin Donuts all of it you name it and um but boss bottom line was that these were entrepreneurs that were lowcost producers right lowcost produ producers have an inherent advantage and I remember when I first uh when I first met Charlie uh he had he had read my book and uh and we were discussing the patels he says yeah you know I got some friends in the motel business I just tell them don't ever ever try to compete with a p Patel if you ever find yourself in competition with a Patel Just find another game to play just move on it's not worth it so you said you met Charlie um that's got to be kind of a surreal thing for you uh to have met and become friends with Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett uh how does that happen how does that come about it shouldn't happen you know I was this Squan kid who grew up in the suburbs of Mumbai right and um I accidentally heard a Warren Buffett in the mid99s and it was a big aha moment for me at that time I was lucky the first couple of biographies on him had come out uh and what I realized is when I read about how waren was investing I said all these uh all these models are the same models that an entrepreneur uses it's the same exactly what I was saying that you know uh better businessman because I'm an entrepreneur and vice versa so I said you know but the big Advantage he seems to have is that 4% of time of strategy is 80% time for him and even in the business I had created the it business uh which had grown and scaled I always enjoyed the 4% more I I I I was strategy the figure I was happy doing sales calls and um you know building teams and all that that was that was great uh doing once I said wow if I go into investing it would be 80% of my time because there's no blocking and tackling someone else is doing that and so me that for me that was a big aha moment that I should switch I was lucky in in the mid90s someone bought a small portion of my business after taxes after everything I got a million dollars and I for the first time had money in the bank right and I didn't really need the million right so I said okay what we're going to do is we're going to take this million we're going to invest in the public markets and we're going to find out if we can actually do this you know this you know um an idea is like an [ __ ] everyone has one okay ideas don't mean anything right so you really have to execute it's really execution on the idea that has value you know uh entrepreneurs get kind of hung up on oh I need to get a patent and all that one of the things you have to understand is you can go to your most direct competitors you can tell them all your Trade Secrets they will listen to you really carefully and they will not change Behavior okay so you don't need patents for anything you don't the ideas don't mean anything it's really the execution and um so basically I I said okay let's take the million let's start investing it let's figure out what happens and I was surprised we did really well I think that from like 95 to 2000 5 year period that million became about 13 million and uh I said wow well done Mish and uh so like got 70% a year compounded yeah and um so I was getting I was doing investing part-time while I was running my it business I was much more interested in the investing side losing interest on the business side till till that point when in 1999 I didn't even feel like going into work I I said this is I I just want to just focus on investing and uh so I made I made a couple of big changes then I uh looked for and found a CEO to run my company and basically uh 13 14 million I felt was enough to retire do nothing you know I could do investing full-time right and so my plan was okay someone can run the business whatever's value is there is is there it doesn't matter I can go off and just now do investing full-time and um I had a few friends who had uh basically uh I used to just give them stock tips you know in the mid90s I'd find some company I'd make the investment after that I didn't care who bought the stock right I mean I already bought it right and so I tell my friends hey you know I found this company you are to uh see if you want to take a take a flyer on it and buy it and so on and they did really well on the stock tips right but you know some guys worth like 5 million they would put 10,000 into what I told them right and they would triple their money wouldn't make any difference right so a bunch of these friends came to me and said look we don't like this randomness of these stock tips we don't see you sometimes and you may have sold we don't know we want you to manage some money for us and uh so they were proposing giving me $100,000 each and it would be a million dollars in all right and I said okay I'll do it I thought of it as a hobby I didn't even think of it as a fund but I want to do it in a format that works for me so I love the buffet Partnerships where he didn't charge management fees he only charged performance fees so so what's a normal structure and then what did Warren do so a normal hedge fund would be a 2 and20 structure they would take 2% of assets as a management fee for breathing every year every year yeah and then uh 20% of the profits right so if a if a hedge fund for example let's say has a billion billion dollars under management right the general Partners would take $20 million a year for breathing for breathing and then if if it went up 10% so they would make 100 million for example on the billion they'd take another 20 million on that right uh so basically what would happen is the investor who put up the money on a 10% return gets a 6% return right below the s& right right because of all these frictional costs so Buffett had run his partnership by saying that uh there's no management fee um the first 6% returns go to you and above that I'll take 1/4 and you take 34 so in the same situation if if the fund is up 10% in Buffett's case the first 60 million goes to the investors and the remaining 40 million is split so it becomes 10 million to him 30 30 million to the investors right so it's a it's a better it's a half the fee basically and you're you're paying for performance if he's not up that much you don't pay anything so I like that structure and so I told them I want to set up a a fund uh so it's all legal and we will do it with that structure this they really didn't care what structure it was and uh so PAB funds really started in 99 as a hobby uh with me and my buddies and I had 13 million on the side which was my main focus and I said yeah the there's another million here it's okay if I find something I can buy for both it makes no difference right and um about a year a year after that there was about 2 and a half million we were up like 70% the first year and uh some more money had come in and I said you know why do I treat the fund like a stepchild why don't I think of it like a real business and why don't I basically grow and scale it like a real business and uh and so I I started to do that and P funds uh we had a very good run uh for the first eight or nine years I think we were doing like mid-30s a year on average no down years and the assets grew we were at about I think in 2007 we were at about 600 million in assets under management and I had made a lot of money uh you know the fees and the compounding and all of that so in like a 10-year period you turned the million dollars of managed money into about 600 million of assets of management including new money coming yeah yeah it wasn't all it wasn't just organic but but but the original Money had almost tripled right you know tripled or quadrupled in that period I had asked you yesterday when we were hanging out I said uh you know there's really two questions when you hear the story number one how the hell were you getting these returns what what what did you know about invest what was that part but the second part is how' you what' you do on the fundraising side how' you get so many so much more money to come through the door and you've had a great line of about that uh about how you get more money to come through the door cuz you didn't strike me as a a guy who wanted to be out there fundraising and knocking on doors and trying to raise funds so how does it happen Buffett has a great great quote he says that if you are in a rowo in the middle of the Atlantic uh they will swim to you in shock infested waters to invest with you if you have beaten the market right they will find you he says you could be a leper and they will invest for you that's what happened and also one of the things that was very um difficult for me was that the SEC has a lot of rules and laws uh around hedge funds one of those is you cannot solicit the general public right so when I was running my it business I could call on any CIO and say Hey you know uh would you like to use our services Etc I could literally call anyone out of the phone book uh when you're running a fund you can't just get a list of dentists in North Carolina and pound them that's that's not legal you can't do that um so the SEC said you can only talk to people you know okay I said the people I know I'm going to run out of my Rotex in like five minutes you know there's very few people I know so what I did is I started to meet my investors once a year uh for an annual meeting where I would give them their results and uh take their questions and all of that and I told them listen um there was one reason and one reason alone you were put on planet Earth and that is to bring assets to P funds okay humans are always looking for a calling they are looking for some cult leader to follow and be part of cult okay so you gave them one so yeah you know they were they were wandering in the wilderness they needed purpose okay so I said here's what you need to do you need to go talk to your friends and family because I can't talk to them the SEC won't let me talk to them you can talk to them okay you talk to them you tell them about me you tell them to contact me once they contact me I can engage with them okay so go out and spread the word okay and send me more of your assets too okay so basically what like I like I said I started with a million a year later it's two and a half million 2 years later it's 10 million and it's growing you know and and part of it was that the annual return returns are adding but part of it was that so I had eight investors when I started a year later there were 17 and two years later they were 25 so now I had an audience of 25 uh to prosze and spread the word you know and uh and and of course the results now the other thing that was happening is that uh when I started the funds in 1999 we were 9 months away from the biggest bubble about to burst that had happened in decades the dot bubble right and I I was able to see the bubble not very much in advance of the rest of the world maybe just two or three months ahead I I knew the internet was transformational but I also knew that the Euphoria was too much you know we had pets.com trading at multi-billion Dollar valuations with no ref revenues right I mean there was just common to have a lot of companies people were counting eyeballs they're not counting dollars and they're not looking at net income they're not even looking at Revenue they're just looking at eyeballs right and so so I said okay this this is bad news um it will blow at some point it's going to the bubble's going to burst I didn't know when uh so I had always been a tech investor from like the mid 90s and I had done really well uh Tech had had a great run run from 95 to 2000 it had just done really well and I'd ridden that Cod tail but what I did in 99 when the fund started and also with my own capital is I did a 180 I switched completely to Classic Ben Graham deep value you know what Buffett had started doing in the 50s and one of the things that was happening in the equity markets at that time was the day the NASDAQ peaked I think March 8th or March 99 2000 was the day that Burkshire hit a multi-year low and literally people were pulling money out of their Burkshire stock and buying pets.com right and then then that goes to zero eventually and so I said okay basically there's a lot of basic businesses that had become really cheap because nobody was interested so I was buying Funeral Homes at two times earnings and buying steel companies three times earnings and so a lot of basic businesses which very predictable and doing well trading really cheap right and uh and so PAB funds did really well in fact uh the NASDAQ imploded basically it hit 5,000 in March 2000 by the time it bottomed out the next two or three years it was at 1,200 75% drop you know and uh the Dow in the S&P didn't go down as much but they also went down a lot and uh so it was it was a traumatic period for investors it was a great period for me and and so it was very easy for me to talk to my investors because I was the only guy making money for them okay if they had like five accounts they just moved it all to me because everything else was going down everything else was red and so that's how we we got going so in 2007 um I I think my network at that time was like 84 million and uh Warren had been running uh these uh uh charity lunch auctions where once a year you could bid on eBay to have lunch with Warren Buffett and the money would go to the Glide Foundation which was doing you know feeding the homeless and all that in San Francisco so I said you know I am using this guy's intellectual property and making all this money off him um I really have a big tuition bill I need to pay so I said the lunch is a great way to do that I said I can bit for the lunch and I'll meet Warren I'll be able to thank him in person and it goes to a cause that he supports so I thought about it okay 84 million what's an appropriate tuition bill I said 2 million is is good I think if I if I gave him 2 million I'd feel good about that right so I said okay okay I decided in 2007 I was going to bid for that lunch and I I decided I would go up to $2 million and you can bring up to 7 other people to that lunch so I was going to take my family but there still were a couple of seats empty so I contacted my friend gra gpar he lived in Zurich I said hey guy I'm going to bid on this lunch blah blah blah and I said uh do you want to come in with me uh and I said if you and your wife want to join us uh because there'll be four of us and two of you you can pay oneir and uh and I'm willing to go up to 2 million so guy says W that's too rich for me I can't pay 1/3 of 2 million he says uh I'm good for a quarter million so I said okay whatever the bid ends up at you're capped at a quarter million right and uh so I bid for it U it settled at uh 650,000 uh much less than what I was willing to pay and then onethird of that got paid by guy and uh so my only agenda in meeting Warren was to just say thank you Warren right I didn't have and of course a big Fanboy and you know meeting him and all that Warren's agenda when he has these lunches is really different his his agenda is he wants the people who won that lunch to feel like they got a great bargain so he would take all our what I would call our lemonade lemon questions and turn them into lemonade so he's always is exactly what he does in the booksh show meetings is he's a great teacher and so he was trying to uh give as much value as he could in that lunch and like he told us when we met him he said look I got nothing going on all afternoon right so when you guys are sick and tired of me you just let me know and I'll leave right we kept asking him questions for three hours and then we were exhausted and so we said Warren we just have anything else to ask you you know he said okay I'll I'll I'll take off no problem and uh in that lunch um I told him I said look Warren um my my wife then heren I said she's uh a huge fan of yours but her true love in life is Charlie okay and Warren got competitive he said Charlie is a very boring guy he's a very kind of pessimistic always says no to everything I'm the guy who's really interesting so he said what I'm going to do is you guys live in California in La I'm going to set you guys up to meet Charlie for lunch and then when you meet him for lunch you're going to find that he's useless and I'm the guy so I thought he was joking about that right and two days later I got an email from his assistant to Charlie's assistant copying us uh basically saying hey I met this wonderful couple in California and they seem to think you're more interesting I think they just don't understand so I want them to meet you so we can set the records straight right and so this is really what he was saying this is exactly what he said in the email right was he joking or was he not joking and then I I Charlie's assistant sets us up to meet Charlie for lunch now Warren you can bribe and have lunch with okay Charlie there's no bribing this this is great and so uh we met Charlie my my wife and I we met Charlie in 2008 uh at the California Club in LA and uh I actually found that lunch a lot better than the Buffett lunch okay was great because I think Charlie is just so direct you know and um and I never expected these lunches or any of this to lead to any anything you know just a one and done but it led to a friendship with Charlie he started uh asking us to come to his place for dinner and uh uh I would meet him like four or five times a year for dinner and then uh we started playing bridge together usually on Fridays he play bridge at the LA Country Club I'd meet him about once a month or something to play bridge and that used to be lunch and then about four five hours of bridge after that so it was a it was a a a a wonderful deep friendship for 15 years uh which was unexpected you know just never expected that so let's go back to the lunch you asked him questions for three hours yeah uh what were the interesting uh questions and answers I know you've said one that I want to hear you you explain because I didn't fully I I've heard the tidbit but I want to hear the full story which was he said something about being a harsh greater of people yes what does that mean well I I told I told Warren I said Warren um you know you are both you and Charlie are such good judges of humans and human nature were you always that good at figuring people out so he says to me monish you have mistaken I am useless at figuring people out he said if you put me in a cocktail party with 100 people and you gave me five or 10 minutes to meet each person uh I could tell you three or four people exceptional and I could tell you three or four people you want nothing to do with and the remaining 92 I would have no opinion on because it's not enough time to figure them out so but he but he also said that look what you do in life is those three of your people who are exceptional you bring them into your inner Inner Circle and obviously the three or four people who are you know not not the great humans you're not going to have anything to do with them but the third thing you do is you treat the 92 just like the useless humans and you exclude so he says be a harsh grader so he says that when you have friendships and when you have people you work with your peers and all that he says there's a gravitational pull if you hang out with people better than you you're going to get better if you hang out with people worse than you you're going to get worse so he said that one of the things that most humans are not willing to do is loyalties get in the way for them right so they may have a friend who's kind of weird or quirky or has ethical issues but they've had a long friendship so they'll keep that person going with them uh that has detrimental impacts so basically um I really took that to heart and I said that uh I'm really going to try to see if I can uh focus on the great relationships you know the great people and that's actually been um a journey I've been on now for like you know 16 17 years it's been tremendous it's it's great now it's it's unfair right because you're treating the unknown the same as the useless people but but that's the way life is I think that sometimes you have to make these difficult choices uh because if you don't do that then uh the impact of that is significantly negative and one of the things I realized when I started to uh get to know Charlie I got to meet Charlie's friends so I would play bridge with his friends I'd meet his friends and what I realized is his friends were so off the charts they were so exceptional I said wow this is like a different world right and I said I'm going to take a shortcut I'm going to make Charlie's friends my friends because he's already done all the work he did the filtering you know can't get a better filter than Charlie right and and so I I worked on building relationships with Charlie's friends and some of his family and that's been beautiful I mean some just great friendships uh and you know I realize that there's such a huge Delta in off the charts top .1% top 1% of humans and the rest and you know we we talked about this Adam Grant uh wrote this wonderful book give and take right and he categorizes people uh in three buckets right the givers the takers and the matchers right now the takers you don't want have anything to do with you know they just going to like want to extract whatever they can from you so they're just not people you want to uh have in your life the givers are people who are selflessly trying to help the planet not really concerned about what comes back to them right those are the ones you want to be with and then then the matchers they're kind of doing math in their heads oh you know Shan did this for me so I'm going to do something similar for him they kind of and so even the matchers aren't that great so what you really want to do is you want to seek out the givers and more important than that is you want to be a giver right and uh and so the the interesting thing that he pointed out in that book is that when you're a giver the universe conspires to help you and I found it magical how and Warren and Charlie are great examples of givers everyone's trying to help them in any way they can and so that's the the funny thing is that the matchers who are trying to do this you know Equalization they end up losing the best way to get the most is not ask for anything it'll all come to you right you know and so so these are wonderful models to incorporate yeah there's even some Game Theory with that which is the cost of excluding somebody who might be good or might be great is quite is actually quite low to you but the cost of accidentally including somebody who might be have some toxicity or it's quite costly to you and so uh you know I think even in Investments he has the the good pile and then the the twoo hard pile Warren has a lot of baseball analogies he says that in investing there are no called strikes right so in baseball uh you're at the pitch three strikes you're out right he says I can let a, th balls go by thousand stalks go by and not swing right right I I only need to swing when eight moons line up right and so the fat pitch right the fat pitch right and so the thing is that we live in a world with infinite humans if there are infinite humans it also implies that there are infinite number of good humans so basically uh making of uh excluding a good human from your circle because you can't figure them out there's no penalty for that right because there's a infinite Supply right just to put it for the mathematical way mathematically uh but but when you bring in a substandard person it just there's so many drains it's just negative I want to hit you with some of your big investing philosophies and give me the kind of the The Punchy version of like what is that what is the phrase mean and how you use it so um let's do one heads I win Tails I don't lose much well I mean I think this is classically uh comes from the patels right the it's the dando philosophy uh but but this is this is how we want to uh do all our Bets with people with stocks uh with everything asymmetric yeah basically where uh we always want to look for things where the the odd are so heavily in our favor and uh so in investing uh we do get these anomalies where you you take what's one that you've benefited from or what's an example in your portfolio or your career investing where you felt like you you you recognize asymmetric upside your downside was cap but your upside was high well I mean I think that if I look at my first business for example right I mean I I'm taking 30,000 for my 401k which I can make up and at that time the uh credit card laws were very different where if you uh declared personal bankruptcy you got a clean slate and actually didn't affect your credit because you couldn't file again for seven more years so everyone would give you money after you filed okay so actually they've changed the laws now but at that time uh what I had uh I realized that starting a business has high rates of failure right and so I said how do I um minimize the risk on that and and this is what all entrepreneurs do and I said okay so basically if this thing blows up which there's some probability that could happen um I got my job already they want to take me back and I I clean up the slate and and I'd also drisk it because the company was already cash flow positive by the time I quit my job right and so there was already a pipeline and such and so repeatedly what I've what I found is uh even even in investing uh I mean I'll give you an example like for example I think in 2003 or 2004 there was a steel company uh in Canada uh ipco and um I noticed that they were trading uh for three times earnings right and they the the stock was at $45 they had $15 a share of cash on their balance sheet they had no debt and they had contracts uh over the next couple of years where they had said our earnings for the next two years are going to be $15 a share each year um given because these were these were these were not forecast these were hard contracts right so I said okay so the Stock's at 45 if I just buy the stock and hold it for two years I got $45 cash in the company now it was cyclical business third year could be zero could be negative but I said I I own all the plant equipment everything for free right so my my I made the investment I put 10% of assets into ipco and I said all I want to do is I want to see what Mr Market does with this stock in two years just going to hang out and see what happens so we make the investment and then a year later the company announces is that we're going to have one more year of $15 okay so now you're going to have 60 versus 45 right and by now the stock has kind of gone up and it's sitting at about $90 double in one year so I said okay uh it's still a very cyclical business maybe we should take our chips off the table and while I'm thinking about all that one day I wake up and the Stock's at 155 some Swedish company came and offered 160 to buy them 5 minutes later I sold the company and moved on right so what what I'm saying is that that's what we're looking for right we and in the equity markets because these are auction driven markets when you look in areas which are hated and unloved you will find these anomalies um last year for example I spent about seven or eight months uh studying the coal industry four-lettered word hated and unloved more than anything else yeah I mean uh a lot of endowments and funds are not even allowed to invest in the coal industri it's so much hatred for it so you got excited the math the math was like this if there's a business that is going to exist for 50 years on average it's going to produce a billion a year in cash flow that's going to be distributed to shareholders available to buy for less than two billion where do I sign okay that was a coal industry okay and so it's like you you in auction drived markets you repeated repeatedly run into these things where things you know the companies emerging from bankruptcy there's things that people just don't like uh there's different reasons why things get mispriced right you talked about like um private markets versus public auctions and why you think public auctions present more of these dislocations more of these opportunities well I think I think that uh let me put it this way um let's say this home of mine was a publicly traded company okay listed on the NYSC right every day its price would change right it would be wiggling here and there and if I look at the average uh public company on the New York Stock Exchange the 12- Monon range of the stock might be 70 to 140 in 12 months if if I just throw a dart at any company in the New York Stock Exchange and I just look at the 52e range on that stock price it's going to be 60 to 100 70 to 130 so like a 50% swing it's a big swing right my home which maybe might go up 4% in a year or in a good year maybe three 3% would be vacillating in value it would be sometimes trading 20 30% more than it's worth and sometimes trading 20 30% less than it's worth and if I had a realtor friend and I said to him listen um can I call you every day and just tell me what my house is work the guy would think I was stupid but I would call him on Monday and say hey what's my house he said it's worth 2 million I said oh thank you I call him the next day he said still worth 2 million okay third day he said listen idiot it's 2 million okay and after a month he would tell me oh it's moved to 2 million 30,000 okay and then again he would be at 230,000 for a while okay it wouldn't move because it's an intelligent buyer facing an intelligent seller and so you're not typically going to get um a company like ipco available as the whole company for the price you can buy some shares right because the whole company there's an intelligent guy the Swedish company paid 4 times that price to to buy the company right and so that's just the nature of so reason I like the I've always like public markets is because there is so much irrationality and if you're just willing to be patient uh you know in a year in a year if I can make two good Investments it's a good year okay so we don't need a lot of activity right we just need to be patient and wait for for the times when uh something weird is causing a mispricing right so uh let me ask you a few questions so number one should in your opinion should somebody just buy the index uh lowcost Index Fund or actively invest uh the index is a really good way to go uh the index is too dumb to know that it owns Nvidia and it's even more dumb it's even more dumb that it won't it'll never sell n okay or it's own Apple the last 10 years and never sold it for example so I would say for the overwhelming majority of humans probably more than 99% of humans you're best off just buying an index and I think that the uh the US Equity markets and the US Financial uh Services industry is so efficient that the frictional cost for owning owning an index through an ETF is you know single digigit basis points you know less than uh one10 or 1% less than 0.05% or 1% or so on so it's very it's very small and so I think it's very smart to uh go with indexing absolutely yeah for for the vast majority of people yeah for almost everyone and for whom who shouldn't do that well if you are if you have the talent and the patience to figure out what a business is worth and then um you know have the ability to buy those businesses well below what they're worth and patiently hold them uh those sliver of humans that can do that uh would be better off just doing it that way if I said what's the number one trait that makes a great investor what comes to mind patience if you are a guy who loves to watch paint dry you know you paint a wall and just sit there and watch it dry you will do very well uh did you ever watch Seinfeld uh some episod not not religiously the thing is that uh Elaine Elaine is on a flight uh with her boyfriend okay I forget the name of the boyfriend and I think if you pull up Google you can probably find this clip the boyfriend is just staring at the seat back in front of him okay and so Elaine says to him um would you like something to read he keeps looking at the seat back and says no um do you want to talk about something and he says no he just he's just doing nothing just looking at the seat back in front of it right by the end of the flight she's broken up with him yeah he would have made a great investor that's what you need you can be if you can be happy or like you know Pascal uh Pascal had a great quote he says that all man's miseries stem from his inability to sit quietly in a home in a room alone and do nothing right right and so if you have this ability to watch paint dry watch the back of an airplane seat for a few hours and just be in a nirwana state this is the this is the work you need to be doing I don't know if you know this but you have a fans in a subreddit on Reddit I don't know if you ever have you ever been on I haven't done done much on so I went when I was doing my research for this I'm seeing what do people think about about you what questions do people have and I go and one of the best comments I thought was such a great compliment they go the day I knew that this is my guy I want to follow he's on CNBC he's on a TV show and they're asking for stock picks so give me a stock pick and they go around the horn and everybody gives their stock it's going to be this it's going to be this it's going to go up they go to you and you go I don't really give public stock tips like this um and they're like well you got you're on TV you got to do something and they're like the comment was he refused to just like randomly name a pick or tell people to go buy something and the TV hosts were like why are you on TV and he was like that's not what I do and then he just stayed steadfast and I thought it was such a great compliment but also so so big of a contrast from you go watch Kramer or these guys and it's like you go on and it's like overstimulation telling you you got to do something right now the opposite of patients basally uh is that should people avoid that yeah I mean I I think that it's a big red flag if you're taking stock tips from some guy on TV I think that's just not going to end well you know the guy on TV is not going to be there when it's down 30% right he's he's all somewhere not available have you seen the reverse Kramer index uh it's not just people just whatever he said do the exact opposite and you're up like you're crushing the market if you just did the exact opposite of this guy yeah so I mean I think I think that like I said I think indexing is a great way to go for most people I mean uh so you know uh I wish I wish um in high schools or even Middle School uh compounding was part of the curriculum from an investing point of view and and you know just uh it's really simple but but you know the people people don't pay attention to the math you know there are three variables that uh matter with compounding right I mean one is the the starting Capital you have the second is the um the annualized rate of return you get and the third is the length of the runway right now there's something known as a rule of 72 which is a kind of mathematical just a very helpful rule explain it it's I learned this luckily one teacher in college she used to be a student she came back to teach said because she's like I wish we actually taught things that were relevant in the real world so she took it on herself became a teacher to come back and teach personal Fin and the one thing she did was she's like you know compounding is the eighth wonder of the world and let me just tell you the rule of 72 very simple math but explain so the rule of 72 is just a mathematical Quirk that happens to work so for example if I'm getting a 7% return a year and I want to know how long is it going to take for this money to double I can take 72 divide by 7 it's approximately 10 10 years take 10 years right now if I have a 10% interest rate that I'm getting and again if I do 72 divide by 10 it's 7 years so you can you can switch between the years or the interest rate and it tells you the other one right and and this is um the most important thing in life is how long does something take to double okay because that basically leads to everything else so for example if you look at someone like Warren Buffett right he started he started his compounding Journey when he was like 10 or 11 years old I think he's he would say it's when he was 7 years old he's going to be 94 this year okay that's a 87e Runway so far right uh now the thing is that if you have a really long Runway then a low rate of compounding would still get you a big number or if you have a shorter Runway and a higher rate would again get you the same result so it's very important in life uh and that's why I think that I wish they do this in high school is to start that engine early so for example let's let's take a situation of someone who's just finished college right at 22 years old they got some job maybe like making you know 70 80,000 a year or something and they they put away $110,000 in their 401K right they're 22 years old in in an index right the index has done 10% a year now what that means is the 10% a year means that that 10,000 will double every seven years so let's take a situation where the person is now 64 years old right now they started at 22 with 64 so it's 42 years 42 years is Six Double right I do this to make it easy right okay so six doubles right that's 2 the^ six 2^ 6 is 64 so that 10,000 that the person saved at 22 is 640,000 at 64 but that's not all they have at 23 they save 11,000 that's again sitting at some big number and you keep going and you know sometimes we see these news articles there some guy who's a janitor janitor of some college and he gives 4 million to the college and lived in a one-bedroom apartment whatever right why are we surprised okay if you actually run the math he actually didn't even save that much and he didn't even have that a such a great compounding engine it's not like he found Apple 20 years ago or something that's not what happened what what happened was that there was a consistency and so actually my uh my push back to my dad when he was telling me to start a business is I was telling him at that time I said look I got a 401k I got 30,000 in the 401K right I'm going to I'm contined with 15% a year my employer at that time was matching the first 2% so it was becoming 177% taxfree basically it's tax deferred and my income's going up over time so I was when I first started working my salary was 31,000 right so I'm saving 4500 a year right but if I was still working my my my pay would have been hundreds of thousands or more and I'm putting away a lot of money so by the time I get to retirement it's like it's game over you know lots of extra cash available no problem and I never missed the money because it was pre- tax right taken out so it's just great so I think I think I I I wish that uh young people understand that yeah listen you can pursue lottery tickets you can pursue entrepreneurial dreams you can do all of that that's fine but on the side keep this going and and start it early let it be boring let it be a stupid index fun Vanguard and whatever and uh and that's it the uh the tortoise is going to win the race right you know what's the uh circle the wagons philosophy well the circle the wagons philosophy actually came out of uh when I was thinking about Buffett's letter last year to shareholders the uh 2023 letter he he pointed out that in 58 years of running bursha uh there were only 12 decisions that he had made that had moved the needle for bushire now busha had a tremendous run they've compounded um I mean till recently were compounding at 20 plus% a year for 58 years that's you know if you're doing uh if you're 20% a year you are doubling every three and a half years okay and that means after 35 years it's a 10 doubles and 58 is another 23 years so you've got another uh what one six six t so 16 doubles uh 2 to the^ 16 now the way to do 2 to the^ 16 is 2^ 10 * 2^ 6 2^ 10 round number is 1,000 it's a th000 x right and 2^ 6 is 64 it's 64,000 times what you started with okay if you started with a $100 it's 6.4 million okay $100 is 6.4 million okay so he he's saying I would calculate in the last 50 years 58 years buffets made three 400 at least 400 different investment decisions he's saying 12 are the ones that mattered right the god of investing has a 4% hit rate that's the god of investing that's why we should Index right what are the rest of us mere mortals supposed to do so now the thing is that the I was thinking about his 12 bets right and I I I thought about okay which were the 12 and I think he never mentioned that but you could guess which one C's would be one of them Coke would be another one AMX uh Gillette cap Cities Washington Post you know you can come up with the names you know uh bushire haway energy a Chan hiring a chain probably was the biggest bet for them with paid off huge for them what's the story with a there's something about the recruiter for him so what I realized when I thought about these 12 bets was it wasn't the buy decision the buy decision is important the important thing was they never was sold se's stayed in the stable for 50 years Coke has been in the stable for 40 plus years right so it wasn't the buy decision it was the paint drying decision okay that was the important thing so when you find yourself in the happy position of a small ownership in a great business just find something else to do with your time uh play bridge or whatever have you have you considered golf uh I have golf is great and and so if you ask Charlie he would say the single best decision best investment booksh hathway ever made was the search fee they paid to hire a Jane okay now a Chan walks into their offices in 1986 1985 actually never having worked in the insurance business right um from scratch without them putting up venture capital or anything the business he's created for them today probably has a value north of a 100 billion okay I mean it just gets lost in bursh because bsh is so big but I'll give you I'll give you an example of um of a uh a discussion I had with Charlie I think there maybe 2 3 months before he passed away so he was telling me that um a you know bsh bathway writes uh super catastrophe Insurance like you know uh insurance against hurricanes uh earthquakes and so on right and um many many years uh there when people are looking for earthquake insurance in Florida uh hurricane insurance in Florida uh Ajit would look at the rates being offered and just take a pass okay B basically he would find is too competitive whatever else people not giving enough okay uh what he did in 2023 uh and they mentioned it at the at the meeting actually is that um he wrote um hurricane Insurance uh on Bush's behalf uh reinsurance with a maximum payout of $15 billion so if if these hurricanes had hit now uh basically the math is like this I just want to explain how how ait's mind works um Burkshire would pay out on a big catastrophe like in uh earthquake uh Hurricanes 3 to 5% of the total insured loss incurred so for them to have a 15 billion payout you would have to have had an event with insured losses in Florida of 300 billion it's beyond and and Beyond Katrina right is beyond all of those right so it's it would be need to be a really big event to for them to have a 15 billion payout the premium he collected uh to write that 15 billion policy take a guess take a guess five billion he collected five billion okay and I was sweating that guess no no but but but he he collected that's exactly what he collected how much did he pay out in 23 zero there was one came through my guess would be they might have paid Out 3 400 million okay you know some 300 milon collect 5 billion and and what Charlie said to me is ait's done this about six times okay where he's picked the years that he's written these policy because what was happening in most years is the premium offered was 2 billion he just took a pass right right a lot of all the other insurers wrote that policy Burkshire took a pass right no C strikes right and and and now for example uh we've had um we had some unusual uh losses like for example um that uh that ship in Baltimore right now that's going to end up being about three 3 to 5 billion in losses right and it's the biggest Maritime loss in global history it's going to change premiums for ships in the future Burkshire will probably be writing when everyone else is saying I don't want to do that you know it's like the cat who sat on a hot stove and doesn't want to sit on any hot or cold stoves ever again you know you have a thing over there I saw in your office that says it's like a placard it says trouble is opportunity absolutely that's a that's a the story of that it's a quote by John Templeton uh and I actually uh the good friend of mine PR Wata in Canada they call him burshire haway of Canada War Canada and uh I had seen that uh that plaque on in his on his desk and somebody sent it to me and so it's a great quot I mean I think that that's what what we're trying to do as investors is we uh want we we need to be fearful when the world is greedy and we need to be greedy when the world is fearful and so basically when the world is running away from coal we need to run towards coal right so I'm always looking at what is hated and unloved right and usually you will get a lot of mispricing when something is hatden and unloved right uh tell me about Bitcoin are you a fan of uh crypto Bitcoin are you a Believer outside my circle of competence and I would say that if you put a gun to my head I would say it's going to end badly M and why is that it's in the eye of the beholder there is no intrinsic value as I understand it to Bitcoin now you can argue that there isn't an intrinsic value to the dollar uh but it has the full faith and credit uh of the US government which is then backed by the uh hardworking American people so basically I think that uh I think that it's U for me it's in the two hard pile but I think for most people I would just say take a pass right most people who have invested in Bitcoin couldn't really tell you um why it's or what it's going to be worth and why it should be worth that okay uh fair enough so one of the reason I wanted to fly here is because it's fun to meet these kind of outlier investors or even just hear the stories and I've heard you tell a couple stories about guys I've never heard of that um I would love for you to to tell the story because I think most people have never heard of these people so tell me about um Nick sleep who is Nick sleep or uh junjin Wala whichever is your favorite give me give me one of the the stories that that well I think Nick is uh Nick is a wonderful guy and there's a book called uh uh Richard Richard wiser happier that came out uh two three years ago and there's a chapter on him Nick is very uh he's a recluse he doesn't do uh interviews and such I was actually surprised he even talk to the author but it's worth reading the the book and uh you know him he he and his partner Zach uh they would uh come into their office and basically just sit and read annual report after annual report till they were blue in the face you know I mean they were just and um and and they would uh want to see if they could understand uh different businesses and that exercise of reading those annual reports LED them to the annual report of Amazon right and for example I I've been a customer of Amazon known Amazon for a long time Etc familiar with the business but every time I would uh take a cursory glance at Amazon it looked very expensive on a earnings basis a PE basis it looked really expensive and the reason it looked expensive is they were investing so far ahead of the curve on the growth that uh what what should have been categorized as capex wasn't was just categorized as expenses so the US government was really funding their growth because there were no taxes uh being collected now what what uh Nick and Zach were able to do because they were just sitting in their office with no distraction reading year after year of buffet uh of uh bezos's letters and the Bezos letters are worth reading I mean I think they're they're very uh clear he clearly laid out in those letters what he was up to right that he's basically Ally that he wasn't he wasn't uh completely candid but he was basic you could tell that the business had very high Returns on Capital and he was investing uh he was throwing a lot of things against the wall but basically they were very low risk bets if any single bet didn't work it didn't wouldn't sync the company and um so for example one of the bets they made was AWS right which became a huge and they didn't know it was going to become as big as but but basically um they also made a bet on fire Amazon Fire which didn't work but basically I think what uh what Nick and Zach realized is that here was a very gifted Capital allocator who understood all the different facets of building a team going after different markets he actually disrupted multiple Industries and so they had placed u a bet on Amazon and uh and because Amazon was doing so well it was becoming a larger and larger portion of their fund and in the UK there are more regulations on hedge funds than we have in the US the UK regulator was telling them that we see this position as very high risk uh and you guys need to diversify so they were getting pressure and they felt that they understood the business so well so they looked at each other they were they were managing I think two or three billion uh they had made hundreds of millions in for each of them and uh they said look uh we are independently wealthy we never thought we'd be here we're young uh why do we have to listen to some regulator right we could return all the capital to all our investors and uh what what Nick said is if I return the capital I'm going to put everything into three stocks and these are three stocks he owned maybe a dozen stocks but he was going to go into three stocks the three stocks he was going to put oneir each into was uh one3 Berkshire one3 Amazon one3 Costco right and so he said I'm very comfortable with these three talks they very built to last businesses and he did that and what what happened uh a few years after they hung up their boots is um it's really funny the uh Amazon still kept you know it's a juggernaut it still kept going and so it became 70 80% of the pie so instead of them being 1/3 each it was 80 1010 for example right and uh uh Nick decided that oh maybe I should take some chips off the table here and so he cut the Amazon position in half and bought uh another business which has not done well went sideways and that goes back back to Buffett's point of 12 that worked in 58 years is we are not going to if Warren Buffett has a 4% hit rate the rest of us are going to have a 2% hit rate okay so but you also need to get rich just one so I I think that what worked really well for Nick and Zach was they took the Buffett lesson which is that once you have a great business just leave it alone now even after he was sloppy and he took chips off the table from 80% or whatever still done very well right and and I think one of the things that uh investors forget is that um if you look at the the Walton family um none of them are running Walmart Sam Walton passed away a long time ago it's been several decades since Sam Walton passed away The Waltons have for the most part kept the Walmart stock and for most of them it's almost the entire net worth in a single stock right so more concentrated than even Nick sleepers right and uh it's not a business that they control it's not a business that they run it's not a business that they are on the board of um none of them gives them sleepless nights right and uh so for example in 200 um 18 I started visiting turkey and I was just looking at things hated and unloved at that time and I saw that the Turkish markets were screening really cheap everyone in the brother was just exiting turkey and I have a really good friend of mine in Istanbul very good investor kind of classic Ben Graham investor and I told him hey Haider I'd love to visit Istanbul and I'd love to if we could visit all the companies in your portfolio starting with the company with the your strongest conviction biggest position to the smallest position and I said don't take me to see any companies where you don't have money in okay he said Mish it be a blast so I went in 2018 first time to Istanbul the Blue Fish on the Bros forus was great and all these different businesses we saw were great you know and I didn't really do much work he told me what places we were going to but I just said let me meet the companies first I went back in 2019 and we're driving to this company and I like I said all these Turkish names and companies I said I will do the work on the back end I'm I'm not going to spend time so as we're driving over I said hia remind me what company are we going to what's the what's the cliff notes version he said okay he says uh this company going to visit racas has a 16 million market cap $16 million market cap and he says a liquidation value of the business if you sold it today is 800 million so I said um is it a fraud he said he said no I'm I'm invested in the company and so I said you're telling me the company is trading for two 2% of liquidation value he said yeah I said why he said it's turkey you know everything's cheap I said but this is outlier cheap okay and Ras basically is a very simple business they uh the largest Warehouse operator in Turkey they rent out all these warehouses these are 99% leased inflation indexed and um they leas to Amazon Ikea car 4 Mercedes Toyota like Blue Chip clients and all of that right so I went and uh met the father and son who run the company and the founders and um and then after that I went and visited a bunch of the warehouses and I couldn't find anything wrong with it basically uh and he was absolutely right if you just went to any realtor in turkey and said this is their ad warehouses uh uh give me a value in each one he would just look at the rent and he would tell you okay you know you're looking at about $70 $80 a square foot for each Warehouse they had 12 million square feet it was about a billion dollars and there was 200 million of debt so 800 million liquidation value and 16 million market cap okay and so then I thought okay this thing probably um trades by appointment and maybe can't buy the stock but turkey has very high trading volumes because they're all gamblers and um so I found that when I when I started buying the stock that huge volumes are available and I I spent $8 million to get a third of the company okay now the way I look at it is that you know when you look at you know Buffett's letter with the 12 positions or you look at Nick sleep with Amazon right um the family that runs the business they have maybe 40 45% ownership right uh I'm an outside investor at 33% I'm no board seed but the way I look at RAS is the way the Walton family looks at the Walmart stock right uh I said uh and what what I've noticed since then since 2019 is they have increased the value of that business so I would say that probably today the business might be worth one and a half to two billion somewhere in that range and I think they'll I've never seen them make any decisions that were stupid they're very smart about the decisions it's very well-run so I say okay basically uh we are done uh we will keep that business I don't care about the stock price so the 16 million market cap now now is about 500 million you know in four years and you know the Turkish L which when we were investing it was five L to the dollar today it's approaching 33 L to the dollar Turkish L's collapsed um in dollars we are up almost 30X right right but uh the business is worth more right and so the thing is that it's exactly what what Buffett says is that basically uh just leave it alone and uh as long as that family and that father and son are running the business we will just uh keep our stake and uh and uh let keep running so basically the idea is that uh I'm also going to when I look back going to find there were a few things that move the needle big time and the rest it and and the key to moving the needle is inactivity and so that's what you you got to be just you got to be very patient and be very inactive right you talked about uh Bezos being a capital allocator um Buffett obviously capital allocator for Berkshire and what you know who are the other I guess like if I just throw some names at you or some companies at you like I'm curious to hear your take on how well they allocate Capital because we know how maybe how good their brand is or their product is but uh we were talking about this yesterday there's a transition from you're a product manager where your focus is Building Product and you're people manager where you're building an organization and then you're a money manager and you're now you know you're sitting on hundred billion dollars you have to figure out some way to invest it this is like you know so so tell me meta or Facebook what do you think how do you think they've done with uh Capital allocation well I think I think it was really surprising to see how um he did a 180 I mean uh I think uh Mark basically moved from being a Spen Thrift to being a Patel you know uh he I mean literally I I just can't uh I think it was remarkable to see uh an entrepreneur pivot that way right so uh you know meta was a country club you know they had all this spending going on in all these areas and he really tightened it up I mean I was really I mean and it showed up up in the numbers uh they I mean Facebook is a great business you know all the different brands they have and different properties they have are tremendous um it is the norm in capitalism that great businesses will be sloppy with how they execute I think normally it's very rare to find a great business which is also tightfisted and meta wasn't tightfisted but it is now M and uh so that was just wonderful to see so I think yeah I think the capital allocation there is excellent now right what do you think about uh Elon Musk fellow uh fellow Texas resident um the United States this is one of the just be most beautiful things about the United States is Elon wasn't born here okay and he wasn't educated in his first 20 years of life over here we the United stes got a finished product basically and uh he's created tremendous value tremendous jobs and disrupted multiple Industries um I think I think Elon is a exceptional allocator Capital yeah it's terrific actually and Tesla gets a lot of there's a lot of conversation is Tesla overvalued is it undervalued is it you know too frothy I guess what's your take on uh when you look at a business like Tesla how does your mind analyze a business like T it would it goes into the two hard pile I I would I would I would I would say this I would say that Elon is not human okay he's Beyond human um if you just think about all the things he's done I mean now the neuronet uh and and um you know boring company and uh you know what he's doing with SpaceX and all that it's uh it's just really very remarkable uh the execution is off the charts um and uh I think I think like I said I think it's just uh uh unbelievable in terms of what he's been able to accomplish so I have a lot of respect I think I think Elon understands Capital allocation really well and I think uh all the businesses that he uh he gets involved with or he founds they do so well because he gets so much out of the people which basically means he gets so much out of the capital right I mean he's his hiring is so good uh the teams that he's building are so exceptional that uh I mean when you're hiring a software engineer uh there could be an engineer who's worth 10 10 million a year and they could be another guy worth 100,000 a year and he can tell the difference right and so he's that's that's a great skill to have yeah I love that uh we'll end with this we have Charlie uh you know here and he passed away and you were friends with him what's a uh maybe your your favorite story or lesson from uh from Charlie Munger yeah I mean I I obviously I miss Charlie I think uh he he was one of a kind I think he was just a and and I I've been thinking last several weeks several months about so many of the lessons and things but one of the things Charlie said in one of the last interviews uh he gave um uh someone asked him I think uh what would you like on your gravestone and he said uh I tried to be useful and I think those those words I tried to be useful um encapsulate Charlie really well uh if you look at Warren Buffett's tribute to him that he did this year in the letter um Charlie selflessly helped Warren uh a lot I mean without Charlie manga there's no burshire Hathaway um even though you had a Warren Buffett there and I twice I went to Charlie when I was facing uh difficult personal situations nothing related to investing right extremely helpful to me on point I just did exactly what he told me to do and those issues disappeared right and so Charlie always was trying to see how can I help the world uh in all the institutions that he touched uh you know his memorial was at the Harvard best Lake School in California and La um transformed that institution he was at the board of the Good Sam Hospital transformed the hospital busha hathway transformed I met so many partners he had in different businesses always gave them the better deal and uh I think in every way possible he I think that was just absolutely correct he selfless ly tried to be useful and you know Charlie I don't think Charlie believed in God I don't think he believed in religion right and I think he didn't believe in Legacy he I think he believed that when we're gone we're gone it's Asher than dust right till one day before he passed away he was in the hospital he knew he was dying he was trying to get one last Grant done to a nonprofit no upside to him he's dying right right uh um six days um six days before he passed away he was buying a stock okay you know a stock we discussed you know and uh i' send up a write up on so uh I'm just saying that I think Charlie extracted everything he could from his mind and his body the other thing was that he never complained lost sight in one eye uh many decades ago he was almost blind in the other uh he cared most about reading right that was most important to him and I saw him one time when the second eye was giving him a very serious problem where he could have gone blind this was maybe 10 years ago in the second eye even when he was facing the prospect of complete blindness um he was so stoic never said oh poor me self-pity his respon to me was I'm going to have to learn Braille you know you know that's that's how he was going to deal with it you know and so I think yeah there I think it's this great uh we have such a big Rich body of work that he left poor Charlie Almanac and uh I think a lot to learn from him right well thank you for sharing that and uh thank you for doing this this is hopefully your you know process of uh of sharing some of your wisdom so thank you for doing this it's a pleasure I really enjoyed the session thank you right on okay hey all right sounds good thank you great [Music]

okay these are the five most interesting businessmen alive these are going to be eccentric billionaires people who not only have a crazy business life and have just done a variety of wild [ __ ] these are people that they should be making movies about so we got a [Music] list can I start off with number five we're going to go 5 to one one being who we Crown as the uh the most interesting man alive the criteria for this by the way is they got to be interesting so not just rich not just successful but fascinating interesting um that can be good and bad they have to be men we have a separate list coming for women and they have to be alive so nobody who is you know some dead historical figure fair enough yeah you gonna kick it off yeah I'll kick it off okay so number five is a guy who won the game twice and on his way out the second time is just flipping the bird to everybody and this is a guy named pavl durov I call this guy James Bond with Wi-Fi if you see this guy's Instagram you'll know why I said it he looks like James Bond he travels around the world he's a international Man of Mystery but he he built his his claim to fame as uh you know using his laptop using a Wi-Fi so this guy's basically the Russian Mark Zuckerberg he it's even more impressive than Zuck so when he was young he built um the Facebook of Russia and it was called VK and what's cool about this is is two things number one he actually beat Facebook so there were many countries in the world where somebody built the Facebook of Brazil the Facebook of Africa the Facebook of Europe we there's been tons of these and in every single one of them the endgame was no no no Facebook is the Facebook of Brazil Facebook is the Facebook of India and Facebook dominated everywhere the one place they couldn't dominate was Russia and in an interview Zuck was talking to Sam Alman and he even said he's like God the only ones we could never beat were the Russians he was like it was insane he's like we would make a change and literally like 12 minutes later they would have that update on their on their side like if we moved a pixel they moved that pixel and he's like these guys were just the most prolific copiers we' ever seen and we just could not figure out how are we ever going to overtake them if they're the world's smartest mathematicians and programmers who have dedicated who are dedicated 247 to beating us or cloning us and doing exactly what we do if if they can't come up with a better idea and so he gave them a you know a hat tip so he creates VK it becomes the Facebook of Russia he won but he had to sell it because one day the Russian government approaches him and says pav we need some information he's like cool what do you need to know like we need some information about all your users and what they're saying he's like uh what why and they're like well they've been you know there's been some users who are saying some anti-government things as you know that's not how we do [ __ ] around here so give us some names and uh we'll make sure that they get quiet he's and while you're at it drop your pants and bend over and cough so he doesn't want to do it and so what pavle does and by the way this is not like um you know this is not just a business move this is not a lawyer sending you a ceasa toist when the ref Russian government comes knocking this's a pretty uh Ser there's serious consequences for what you decide to do after that you comply great uh if you don't comply there's not only consequences for those people they were after now there's consequences for you and so what he does is he not only doesn't comply he flips the bird so he goes and he posts on VK the government request the memo that they the secret like kind of letter that they sent him telling him what they needed and he said they're asking for your data I'll never do it and here's my official they ask you know here's my official response and he posted a picture of a dog wearing a hoodie and that was this famous picture of a dog in a hoodie that he posts he's like here's what I have to say about this and he just posts a dog with a hoodie and so immediately he's now in trouble uh you know the they they raid his apartment he ends up losing this company has to flee the country never allowed back in Russia you know costs him basically everything his entire life gets completely uprooted and his it's not like he was just like you know a guy he had something to lose here and so at the end of all this he says and I would do it all again without hesitation and I love that I love this guy and so what he does he now gets kicked out of Russia he loses his company he does get $300 million because he sells it on the way out to some other guy who is going to comply so I don't know fully if I if I you know what happened to your principles I'm not sure sure what happened after that but whatever he gets $300 million and he he's uh he hasn't fully left Russia yet uh but he's like kind of like figuring out his way out but he's like dude I can't even message my brother who to tell him like what you know what we're going to do because they'll just see these messages like they want to see our message they're going to see all these messages so his brother who is a double PhD in math is like you know what let's make a encrypted protocol encrypted messaging protocol so that we can communicate like this is [ __ ] that they could just read all our goddamn messages and this becomes the the precursor to telegram which is now one of the biggest messaging apps in the world so this guy not only invented Facebook he then got kicked out it's like if the Winkle flosses had beat up Mark in the locker room took Facebook from him kicked him off Harvard campus and then he goes and creates WhatsApp cuz that's basically what he did how how big is is telegram I I know it's huge but I don't use it do you use it I use it I love it it's probably my favorite messaging app of all messaging apps it's incredible product it's got a billion users dude what's so good about it other than the encryption thing which is huge I mean the encryption thing is huge um it's just like really well made like the app is really fast works really well it's got a ton of features like you know you can do a broadcast channel where it's like Twitter and you're broadcasting to a bunch of followers you can just message each other you can do huge groups you can have admins you can send like stickers and memes and like you can send a ton of different types of messages it's a it's a really well-made app and has a billion people using it yeah about a billion users now last I think I heard was like 800 million but like I think recently he said something like we have about a billion users never runs ads he's refused to sell any equity in the company he took about a billion dollars of debt but he never sells any equities just him and his brother own the whole thing he's got 30 full-time employees so he's got 30 employees running a service that a billion people use all around the world and every government attacks them and tries to like break their encryption or ban them because no government wants this nobody government wants the citizens to be able to speak freely he is the sole director Equity holder and he's the sole product manager he works directly with every engineer and designer himself he has no HR he only recruits people through something called contest.com which is a contest platform where he puts up engineering challenges and the people who are the best at cracking his engineering challenges get hired they get an offer to come work at telegram is it a Russian company no he's like it's crazy everyone calls us a Russian company we have no office in Russia we have no employees in Russia we have no servers in Russia but the media just will be like oh Russian founder blah BL blah blah he's like dude I've he basically for a while he just moved around the world every three months living in different airbnbs um and then finally he now settled in Dubai this guy's worth about $15 billion so he's the richest expat in Dubai he's one of the you know top 150 richest men in in the world and then you go look at his Instagram you're going to love this dude the guy's ripped he's absolutely ripped and every photo there's never another human being in any photo with him every photo is him alone with his shirt off doing something manly as hell and it's hilarious it all the photos look AI generated it's like if I said hey generate a um Rich billionaire living in Dubai who uh is on the Brian Johnson protocol and wants to become Instagram famous this is what DOI would give me he's literally on a pirate ship on some of these photos yeah I have a bunch um another quote I love from him so yeah he says uh they're like you know you're a billionaire billionaire billionaire he's like dude this billionaire thing's like a little overplayed he's like he's like yes it's true I've had a few hundred million dollars of both uh dollars and Bitcoin in a bank account for 10 years and I've never touched it he goes yeah that's true he's like but I don't own any Jets or Yachts or mega mansions like do any of that [ __ ] I would rather make decisions that would influence how a billion people are going to communicate rather than sitting there choosing the color of the seats in my house that only me and my relatives are ever gonna see that's amazing I read I read another interview with him where he goes I went to San Francisco to see if I wanted to open an office there and I met with Jack dorsy and it was great and I went to the Twitter office which the Twitter office is in the epicenter of kind of bad stuff or uh crime is happening in San Francisco I used to live down the block fromit and he said after the meeting I was walking around and three guys tried to mug me and the interviewer was like well how'd it go he goes blood was spilled but he does that that he doesn't say like who's blood he just said there there was blood well he he he was like yeah three three guys tried to see my phone I fought off the robbers and then he posted on Twitter he's like I he's like my goal was I was trying to tweet out I just hung out with Jack dorsy because Jack dorsy made Twitter he's like that's what I was trying to do on my phone when they did this so he posts a picture of his bloody knuckles reaching for a book which is just a hilarious thing he goes and this is the Tweet he goes just got into a fight with guys who tried to grab my phone near Mission 980 scary neighborhood question mark not for a Russian [Laughter] time yeah this guy's pretty badass I like the idea that San Francisco is like the nice quaint neighborhood in Russia it's the nice clean family family area of Russia yeah I read that and and it was so funny yeah he he's clearly uh man securing his social presence but I think I believe it yeah the guy's amazing and he just flexes on everybody his Instagram is just a pure Flex yeah I mean he's awesome this guy's a good one hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show how does uh telegram make money or do they uh they basically don't make money they've made I read somewhere I don't know if this is 100% true trying to find it but like um two things one they take donations and so I've read something that they've had over a billion dollars in donations from users and that's been part of what keeps it going and like you know it's 30 people and then it's the the the server costs right so it's like you know there there's burn but it's not like he's running a 3,000 person or 30,000 person company um in addition to that he raised a billion doll uh debt Bond uh which is basically like a pre-ipo coupon so he was basically like we're going to make money someday and we need money now to get there he had offers to sell 10% at a $30 billion valuation he turned it down so he turned down 3 billion then they came back and said we'll buy 10% out of $40 billion valuation so $4 billion he turned it down and he said I don't want to sell any Equity I'm scared of what an investor will do for this he did a crypto token back when crypto was really hot he raised over a billion dollars for um their crypto coin but then the SEC came after him and was like this was basically like you were selling Equity like you called it a token and it was a utility but like this is equity so he had to return a bunch of money and that that that token project never got off the ground because he had raised and I think the minimum at the time because I was looking into investing in it is you had to buy in chunks of minimum 20 million God so basically people were forming syndicates and was like oh you want to come in for 500k all right cool we're trying to get to 20 million so we could buy some some of the telegram token because you had an app that actually had a ton of usage the most brilliant uh you know like engineering team probably that exists on Earth or you know one of the top 20 engineering teams on Earth and um and now they were going to do a token to try to make money and um you know figure out like basically you'd be able to to use the token to to do things inside the app so anyways that's kind of some of the things they've tried but you know he has you know quote unquote some plan of how they're going to make money that doesn't involve selling user data this guy's really cool all right that's a good one yeah who's number four who do you got all right so my goal with this was to pick people who you have no idea who they are and hopefully most of our audience has no idea who they are either and so we did not talk before this so it's just a coincidence that my guy is also Russian I call him the Russian Richard Branson his name is Oleg tinkoff so he grew up as a in a mining family so very like humble beginnings but he goes to the city because he wants to experience freedom and he gets into cycling for some reason he's into cycling and he goes abroad for a bike race and he sees someone wearing blue jeans and this is in the 8S in the Soviet Union the Soviet Union's about to uh crumble and become Russia and and he starts bringing home these blue jeans and selling them and he's like all right it looks like people in Russia really want this like Western fashion and so he opens up a chain of stores where he starts selling blue jeans but then everything else perfume VCRs Electronics this is right in 8990 where the the Soviet Union is crashing and these people actually want to be able to buy stuff from from Western countries and he kills it and so in his early 20s he sells that business and he makes something like $7 million and then he does that you'd expect him to do he starts a ravioli business is this guy just watching commercials in the states he's like Levi's got it uh okay next one ravioli cool we we'll do that too well what he does is he goes to America every once in a while and he like he like he says he goes every five years to learn what's popular in America like different advertising whatever and he like basically brings that to Russia have you ever heard of the phrase uh it's a it's a word Baba Baba Babushka I can't even say it right it means Russian it's like a Russian grandma it's like when you think of like Fiddler on the Roof abka yeah Babushka it's like a Russian grandmother with like a scarf over her head so typically raviolis they have a different word for them in Russia but the raviolis were made by that type of person and it was like a comfort food and so he gets the idea where he's like we're gonna do something sexy we're gonna make this like really stand out and so he buys this huge ad and it's just a woman's be ass and it says something like uh ravioli's not made by your grandmother it's like a woman's be ass with flower on it h as if I guess this woman's ass is pounding out the flower I don't know which is kind of weird when you think about it I don't want ravioli like that I don't understand but I'm hungry yeah but it takes off it works this business Works he eventually sells it for $21 million so his next thing is that he's in uh California and he actually meets with Dan Gordon from Gordon beers that's interesting to you and I because Gordon beer was a micro Brewery outside of San Francisco one of the co-founders are at the time CEOs was actually uh Lorenzo fertida from UFC and he starts seeing this trend in the 990s where these micro breweries are quite popular and so he opens up a micro Brewery in Russia and he calls it Tink off breweries and it's kind of like Sam Adams beer where at the time beer in Russia was like not that good tasting and he goes we're actually going to charge four or five times the price of normal beer and we're going to make this thing uh very Americanized and he says like he's got this F famous phrase where he says beer and freedom go rap together and he's all into like freedom and like not in line with what Russia wants him to do and so he starts this Brewery it takes off so they started in 1997 but by 2003 it's doing 35 million in sales two years later 2005 it's doing $200 million in sales and that year he sells it for $200 million which is a huge sum he owns most of the company so he just s sells his company he's immediately in nectar Necker Island with Richard Branson and and olog is talking to Richard he goes Richard I was in America recently I moved there for just like a few months and I was able to get a credit card it was so amazing how easy I got a credit card we need this in Russia and Richard's like you should start it and so that's exactly what he does like six months after selling his Beer Company he starts this credit card company it's called Uh tinkoff bank I guess is how it translate but or Bank of tinkoff and he for some reason names everything after himself because he's great at marketing and his name is popular and so he starts this uh bank with $70 million of his own money and he actually buys a bank and the reason why this guy is interesting is because or this bank is interesting is we know what Mercury is we know what a bunch of these Neo banks are he beat all of them he started this in 2005 and it gets huge to the point where Goldman invested into it uh he invests $70 million of his own money a bunch of people invest in it and it becomes massive and so the business takes off it's up until recently 2021 it was the second largest issuer of credit cards in Russia it was the largest digital Bank in the world and the idea being like we don't need branches we don't need any of that it's just all going to be online and we'll send you your card and so it goes public and his stake in it is worth 10 billion do and here's where the story gets kind of crazy just like pavl Russia does not like olig he talks a ton of [ __ ] uh basically at one point when they uh invade the Ukraine he's very anti- the war he says he just says Putin you're full of [ __ ] all these oligarchs in Russia you're all full of [ __ ] he tweets us out he goes the generals they wake up with a hangover and realize they have a shitty Army how can the Army be any good when our when the rest of our country is also [ __ ] like he says these things on he tweets this out he says all this crazy stuff and eventually they delist tinkoff bank so it's no longer public and he loses most all of his money and so at this point he's worth I think he he was able to like forell some of his shares and he walked away with like $ million and he's now he has leukemia and he's dying he's going to die soon and he basically is still talking mad [ __ ] he says like they wanted to punish me for this and to that I say [ __ ] off I want to die with Good Karma and for people to remember me for being strong and fair and so he's paid the price for being outspoken and he's still being outspoken and he's been completely screwed but he's doing a good job of kind of still sticking it to the man the other thing that he's done he's always done he's done really well at challenging the status quo the reason I have found this guy is he owned a very successful cycling team cycling is not a very popular sport I'm one of the few guys that watches it but he did a great job of like getting into the cycling game and he like criticized the tour to France for tons of stuff they eventually changed tons of rules and finally he's a [ __ ] in the best possible way so there's this famous story where for his micro breweries he wanted to name the street that the brewery was on tinkoff he wanted it to to have the same name of his restaurant and so what what he did was he got a basically a version of an encyclopedia and he made a fake encyclopedia that said years ago in the 1700s there was a brewery on this street named tinkoff and so we need to do it justice by naming the street out it after it because this is a historical thing and so they Nam the street after it years later he admits he made the he made one page in an encyclopedia and just put it in there and they totally went for it and so he's done tons of things like this and he's going to die soon they he says that he's he's he basically has said he's going to die soon and he's donated what's left of his big Fortune it's now a small fortune to leukemia uh and so he's young and if you look him up he uh he's famous for dyeing his hair he kind of he looks like Richard Branson actually and so he's very Richard Branson esque he dyes his hair purple because that's the color for his cycling team he's pretty eccentric very unique guy uh he also wrote a book but the books hard to read because it's uh it was translated but he's a columnist and he and he writes a lot so you can read a lot of his work speaking of which this is my cue for you you know books are cool but books are a little little heavy for me if any of these people wanted to put their thoughts out there they would have great newsletters and if they wanted a great newsletter they would use a great newsletter platform like beehive and that is our Thrill of the show this week the most interesting men in the world if they were ever going to write a newsletter they would write it on beehive back to the show um anyway so what do you think of ol he's an interesting guy you've never heard of him I think fascinating never heard of him well done you you got me with that one I like that um yeah this is this is super cool and I also like just the idea the the move of I'm just going to export Western culture I feel like this is a common blueprint for coming up with you know really uh really big businesses which is you go to Japan You observe Japanese culture you find the most interesting bits of it and then you export that culture to a different country that doesn't quite yet have it but you but you know most humans are pretty similar and um and you can sort of create the demand especially when some cultures just tend to be NE net exporters like I think the US is a net exporter in you know movies and entertainment and you know has certain strong values like freedom and whatever else so you can like use those in bringing that to a place that's sort of uh you know deficient in those areas um and so I think that's a that's just a cool model is exporting culture from one one place to another and that's what he did he went and studied business for some classes at Berkeley and he would just see what's going on in San Francisco in the Bay Area what's interesting what's neat and he was inspired by that and he said every five years I go to America to learn these things and I don't want to bring them back but right huge coincidence that we both chose Russian Russian guys Russian expats sort of uh I guess that kind of sells our stance and sticking it to the man sticking it to Putin all right my next uh I think I'm gonna do a back toback here because I have well an extra one to do do so number three for me I call him the walking middle finger number three is Shawn Parker and Shawn Parker is um a fascinating guy so a lot of people know him because in The Social Network movie Justin Timberlake is supposed to be Shawn Parker and he's this like super charismatic kind of know-it-all guy that um you know tells them to hey drop drop thethe in the Facebook just make it just Facebook it's cleaner right do you think that's real yeah so that is real um but a lot of that role is not how Shawn Parker actually is like he he's like I'm he they were like what do you think the movie got right he's like well they got some some of the stuff right but the most of the character he's like I'm not like Justin Timberlake he's like I'm not cool and smooth he's like I'm weird and insecure I'm he's like I'm a lot more eccentric like they made him seem like cool and normal I'm not cool and normal he's like I might be cool but I'm I'm definitely not normal and I want to just tell you a little bit about this guy so one of the commonalities I had when I was searching for for people like this and you'll see the next guy I have has the same story is that when he was in his teens hack was a hacker hacked into something and got arrested so I don't know if you know this but basically when he was a kid he was 16 years old and he basically got Tracked Down by the FBI because he hacked into like a for 500 company's Network and they were like hey he got offered he eventually got offered a job with like I think the CIA he turned it down he was like no no no I'm like you know I'm on the rebel side you guys are the are the authority I'm I'm Rebel and so he creates of course Napster and Napster is just like one of the coolest slash like biggest middlefinger companies that I I think has ever existed um you know obviously people today proba there's probably some a generation of people today who don't even know what Napster is but Napster was like the first place before Spotify first place where you could just go and you could just like get access to all of the world's music and then movies and other things too but like really music was the main thing and it was illegal you upload the songs you had other people could download those songs and it was music file sharing and it got mega mega popular and then it got sued out of existence and to like let the young people know this was gamechanging I think you and I must have been in grade school like 12 and 11 and 14 when this came out this was such a big deal it got to the point where artists would even release fake music that were Auto remember that when they were scrambled after 10 seconds they get scrambled because they want the fake song to go viral yep yep exactly or like a comedians I remember I forgot who it was it was like Dane Cook yeah Dane Cook basically be like Chris Rock comedy special featuring Dane Cook and like people just read Chris Rock comedy special and the first three minutes were Chris Rock doing comedy it's like and now Dane Cook and Dan Cook got mega mega Popular by basically it's a growth hack a genius growth hack which is to say oh how do I basically like hijack the SEO the search intent of Chris Rock in order to distribute my own you know comedy virus to to everybody else so napsha was super cool he get Su it out of existence but the thing I like about Sean Parker is that um there's this phrase that uh Kevin Van drump said once and we're gonna have him on the Pod he's he's the guy who um what's his newsletter called the farming newsletter I forgot what it's called but he basically writes the biggest newsletter for farmers in the in the country and he has Farm con and a bunch of different things but he said something to us once he goes you know the the train always comes back a second time we're like what do you mean he's like for all of the best possible deals Investments Trends opportunities you overlook it the first time very common and you think you totally missed it I missed the boat he's like but I he's like I just see it over and over again the train comes back around you know maybe um you know you you didn't invest in Facebook but then the stock tanks for a couple months that's your time to get back on is like it's not always going to be the same price as it was the first time but for the truly great things the train has such a long Runway it's a so much upside that even if you just get on the second time you still get filthy rich and he's like the same thing happened with Bitcoin the people who just kicked themselves for not buying Bitcoin the first time they heard it at $150 instead of just buying it at 500 they just kept telling the story about how they missed it at 150 and then they missed it at 600 700 800,000 and now it's at 60,000 they're still missing it he's like but the smart people are like well the train came back around let me hop let me hop on I do I now recognize the value in this thing and I feel like Shawn Parker did that with his career so for a period of time Shawn Parker was seen as this kind of like bad boy but like kind of Untouchable like you couldn't invest in Shawn Parker he's too rebellious he's getting sued out of existence the big companies hate him the government's after him he was like an Untouchable and then later it was like oh Shawn Parker this guy was the you know he he led the round into Facebook and he um was the early huge investor in Spotify he was did this and that and he became the guy who could do no wrong but those weren't his companies but he recognized that those companies were winners and actually made his fortune not on the thing he did Napster but in recognizing the Brilliance of the next Shawn Parker and that was you know Daniel e for Spotify or it when he was like Facebook he he did this when he was like he was an elder at 25 yeah yeah and every hacker looked up to him because he's guy's an icon he used the reputation but not necessarily the money to make all his money usually you use your money to make money he used his reputation to make money so couple things that this guy did that was that's pretty fascinating so first I'm going to give you some lifestyle things and then I'm going to give you the career story so crazy lifestyle things so I met somebody who went to his wedding have you ever heard about his wedding yeah man he got a ton of [ __ ] for it in like the Heyday of s Silicon Valley so this guy basically spent somewhere between five And1 million on his wedding and he was like and so the interesting thing here is just like weird people are not just like they're not just like crazy in their business and super chill in their normal life most of them if you're if you're wired a certain way you just apply that to everything that comes your way so for example when it came to time to get married he's like all right the budget no budget let's just do the sickest thing we can imagine so like we're going to go to a forest in the big sir and it's not just going to be a wedding it's going to be like like an immersive theater experience like I know people who were there and they're like it was crazy you walk in and like you could see the stars above you but it was daytime it's like how the hell are there stars and like there was rabbits running around like wild rabbits that were just like you know there because we were in the forest and they like but it was all planned had the the costume designer from Lord of the Rings made everybody's outfits um you know he ended up paying like2 or three million doar in fines because you're just you're not allowed to just use like the most beautiful public like forest for your own wedding but he was like [ __ ] it I'm doing it uh to propose Sean are you sure they're like is there permit and he's like put on your put on your costume and get in here um to propose he baked his wedding ring into an onion gave it to his wife like what let me know what this is dude it's like being it's like being mad at a UFC fighter for getting like drunk in a fight in the street it's like yeah he's an animal what do you expect right the guy who gets caged up in his underwear and fights another man to the death like he wasn't super chill outside the Octagon that's weird um he bought this $55 million house in LA from Ellen degenerous and then like tricked it out um he's just got like his houses are crazy like it's worth a 30 minute dive just to go look at his houses but even in his other stuff like you know rich people do philanthropy but like how you do it is also interesting so for him he's like I want to bet on he's like I'm going to take a venture capital approach to philanthropy so he's like I'm not just going to donate to the Red Cross or whatever he's like I'm G to find the people that are trying to cure cancer in the most interesting ways and that nobody will fund them because it's too crazy it's too unproven they have to like they'd have to convince the whole world that their crazy approach is going to work he's like but that's what that's like in the startup world that's exactly what happens some crazy kid has a crazy approach that like you know most likely will not work but if it does it's going to change the game and that's what VC's do they bet on that he's like I'm going to do that and you know for curing cancer and so he's poured in tons and tons of money into unorthodox Cancer Treatments how wealthy is he he's very wealthy so when he identified Facebook as like a thing and he was like um you know what I want to you know invest in this be a part of this Mark really liked him he's the one who connected Mark to Peter teal to make to get the investment um the first 500k investment he's the one who convinced them I think to move to paloalto and leave Boston which then let them you know recruit the best talent which let them you know succeed when other social networks like frster and Myspace were failing um so Shawn ended up owning 4% of Facebook which is just like became worth like I don't know four or five billion dollars uh just on his Facebook stock then there's an interesting story of how he invested in Spotify have you ever read this email that Shawn Parker sent to the Spotify founder wasn't it something like this is Napster but done legally exactly so he just cold emails them in 2009 Spotify launched in like kind of like 0607 range Spotify launched in Europe So Daniel I think lived in Sweden and then on top of that uh you know they only launched in Europe because the rules allowed them to do it in Europe but he he knew he had to build up enough critical mass before entering the United States Market it's like one of the the weird reasons that Spotify and all the other music sharing Services never worked because they all tried to start in the United States and all of the music labels were so ready to just sue the [ __ ] out of everybody from Napster that like you couldn't have done that that was not they would come after you when you were just a baby an infant so he writes him this email and it just subject line thoughts and he's like Daniel and Shaq he goes I've been playing around to Spotify you've built an amazing experience as you saw Zuck really likes it too I've been trying to get him to understand your model and I think he just needed to try it to see it for himself then he talks a little bit about Facebook he's like you know we should partner because we can integrate like you know spotify's music stuff with Facebook social graph all that but then he's he just compliments me like your your design is clean elegant tight and fast it's clearly lacking some important features like the social stuff but I think you've done a great job sequencing you've nailed the core experience blah blah blah ever since Napster I've dreamt of building a product similar to Spotify I might have tried had I not been quote sidetracked with Facebook Founders fund like you know like this dope [ __ ] that I've been doing and he's like to be fair um I also was like you know pretty scarred from the record labels um he's like and he's like you know so I've adopted a what watch and wait thing to try to see a when the labels would come to their senses and realize that they need something to distribute music and two until a product that would come in that would fix all the things we got wrong with Napster and he's like you have done that and then he just goes on he articulates from a product point of view what they have done right and what they need to change and he's like I can help you do this [ __ ] and he ends up leading a $15 million invest into Spotify which is like you know an amazing investment I want to read you one other Shawn Parker story so the guy pretty magnetic and actually this story comes from you a long time ago you posted on the hustle a blog post about the the this famous story of the painter who took stock in Facebook I guess he was like supposed to get paid 60 Grand and instead of taking the 60 grand for the painting he did on Facebook's office wall he took stock and the stock ended up becoming worth $200 million I almost uh chose for this segment uh because he David Cho I think he's a crazy man he's a crazy man and he did this interview on Howard Stern and what that's cool about it so I knew the story I think everybody kind of knows the story of the painter what I didn't know is why he took the stock and the answer to why he took the stock is that [ __ ] Sean Parker he's like that guy and so he's like dude uh and so Howard's like why did you pick the stock like you know were they offering not a lot of money and he's like no they were I told him the price is 60,000 they said yes he's like that's a lot of money he's like yeah I just I decided that's what it was going to be worth and I think he was like coming out of jail or something at the time and Sean Parker loved this artist was like no no no this artist has to be the guy and he had tried to get him to do something for plao his other company but they didn't have any money he's like finally he hit him up he's like yo we finally have money I'm at this new thing called the Facebook uh we I think we have enough money come on I want you only you can do this painting so he comes over he's like cool it'll be 60 Grand you want me paint this whole building it'll be 60 Grand uh by the way if you if you I've been to the Facebook office and they've reone it but like part of the ceiling they Ed the same drywall so you could actually still see the painting right and so Howard's like what happened like they they didn't have the cash he's like no no they had the cash he's like so why did you take the stock did you do you believe in this are you like an investor did you believe in this he's like dude I never invested in anything in my life he's like they he's like I asked Sean I was like what's this company he starts describing uh you know what Facebook is a social network for college kids and I was like dude that's lame as [ __ ] and he's he's like I wasn't on frener I wasn't on MySpace I hate that [ __ ] he goes um and this is for college students oh even worse I hate education I hate College I never went I don't even like college students and he's like so you hate no social networking you hate College he's like yeah I dropped out of school I hate everything about school and he's like and it's only starting on H Harvard and Stanford campus oh man like I hate Harvard I hate Stanford I'm like an anti anti all all those things that they stand for he's like so why' you do it he's like because every time I'd hang out with Shawn Parker he would just tell me like yo I'm gonna make some [ __ ] happen he's like before he went and met with Peter teal he says oh I got to go I gotta raise money for Facebook and he goes I'mma Bend these [ __ ] Minds he's like and he came back and he's like and he's like yeah the rich he's like those [ __ ] ended up being like the richest men in America like you know like Reed Hoffman and Peter teal and he's like dude this little nerd this scrawny nerd he's got a lot of Swag and confidence and he's like he's just and he came back he had raised the money from them and he's like okay interesting and he's like so uh he's like you want those cash or you want stock he's like you're you're in this like yeah he's like all right he's like I sized him up and I'm like this guy's going somewhere he's like so that that's why I took the stock that's awesome that is so awesome and it ended up being worth hundreds of millions of dollars I don't know what he sold and when he sold it but that's insane and that's what you know these people are they have a sort of magnetic a magnetic trait to them uh that I think is is pretty common um as a great example were you going to talk about his career or is that the career part let go to the career part right well you know that he's done a few other things he had a bunch of things that failed so he had plaxo he had air airtime he had you know a bunch of things like that then he was managing partner of Founders fund that's all I know what else is there have you heard of opportunity zones for Real Estate you know I believe he invented that so basically I'm I I I read this a long time ago I'm going off the cuff but basically opportunity zones if I remember correctly they're zones designated by the government that show these places are impoverished or they're like Warehouse spaces and we want to incentivize investors to to open up I believe residential build build stuff there and I think it was his idea and he and he Lobby the he lobbied the government and he turned it into a reality opportuni those are the brainchild of Shawn Parker he um in in the early 2000s he was Facebook's first president and he wanted to minimize his capital gains on his Tech stock Fortune so he lobbied the government to create this idea of opportunity zones so that investors would be incentivized to invest in areas that you know were were not receiving enough investment and uh and he did it that's pretty that's pretty fascinating yeah he convinced the Obama Administration I think it was to make this a reality and now it's a thing where billions and billions and billions of dollars go to this and it was his idea and he didn't just come up with the idea he he lobbied the government he changed the law uh which is really fascinating that he did that so he's done a bunch of interesting stuff and I think in fact I think he also played a hand in Obama getting elected a little bit or something like that I mean he's a political guy uh so he's he's done a bunch of interesting stuff all right let me do number two then you do number one all right so um number two is Tom Anderson AKA Tom from Myspace and I call him the guy who won the game and simply stopped playing which is really critical almost all these guys like you talked about Oleg it's like he did this and then he went bigger and then he went bigger and I think that's a common thing but Tom had one thing those guys will never have he had enough and he was able to walk away and so Tom story is pretty wild I didn't I didn't know the backstory so also age 14 hacks Chase Bank gets R access into Chase Bank all of the names the bank accounts the the um the the the amounts in them he could have wired as much money as he wanted out of it he did not uh he knew their mortgages he knew everything and he was basically the leader of a hacking crew and his nickname was Lord Flathead and so Lord Flathead gets Rude access and he leaves a message in in Chase Bank and he says um basically you need to let me keep my access um or I will you know expose all this information I will leak all this blah blah like you need to give me give me full access even even you know just U acknowledge that I won and give me access to this thing and he starts bragging about it so he tells 40 of his friends he shows them exactly how he did it how he hacked Chase Bank at age 14 and this is why the FBI conducted one of the biggest raids they've ever done a simultaneous raid of 40 different people all happening at 7 p.m. all in one area because they didn't know who was the the kind of the The Mastermind behind it but they knew who all had you know had seen it or had access to it or was talking about it and so they raid everybody at 7M they steal his computer they take all stuff but they leave him alone because they're like the guy's 14 what are we gonna do we can't charge him and so he gets off and he agrees okay I'm not gonna hack stuff anymore that's his origin story so now he ends up creating Myspace Myspace obviously was one of the biggest social networks in the world and uh Myspace was dope for a bunch of reasons that don't even exist anymore so you know if there's he's on our top five but he was in everybody's top eight on MySpace which was like you know my top eight friends and he was the first friend to everybody on MySpace he has the iconic picture of him turning away from a whiteboard wearing his white shirt everybody knows that photo everybody who's our age at least that grew up on MySpace and Myspace like was kind of a culture shifter um like something that Facebook never really actually captured was that Myspace actually was cool for bands and getting you know Discovery for music and talent and art and um and Myspace was kind of amazing and he sells Myspace for $580 million and he pieces out he bounces he he he has a quote where he's like yeah before the acquisition I could do whatever I wanted it was pretty fun he's like now I have it takes all this time to get anybody to agree on things because they sold to News Corp I think and he says um you know there's like a budget review and a process for everything it's a pain so I'm out so he he pieces out and he's I think 38 years old or something when this happens he's pretty young and instead of doing what almost every other business guy does which is like cool and now I shall you know change cancer free speech I'll take Rockets to Mars Tom's like no I'm GNA travel the world and uh and just take a bunch of pictures he's like I'm just GNA go have fun so I'm G to read you what I admire about this guy a his Twitter bio is not it doesn't say I'm Tom I invented MySpace I exit vised to news cor for $580 million currently a VC and you know professional dad uh you know husband of two husband of one father of two you know he doesn't do all that [ __ ] the virtual signal he just says enjoying the good life my new hobbies are surfing architecture photography and golf and what he does is you know basically he's like I'm not gonna waste my time just debating politics or like trying to be the next big you know venture capitalist or whatever he's like I'm too bus busy like you know my eyes are too busy blinded by the by the Reflection from the Mal sea I can't I can't be bothered with all that [ __ ] I'm just going to go travel the world do awesome things and take awesome pictures and so he becomes if you go to his Instagram he becomes like a world famous photographer D he has se almost 700,000 followers and he takes beautiful pictures like his his Instagram is amazing it's just pictures from his life traveling the world and he even he's surprised he's like I didn't have a big background of this he's like but I took a few photos I was traveling and he's like I couldn't believe what was coming out of the camera he's like I couldn't believe that this was coming out of my camera so he's like yeah I decided I'm G post this stuff and so you know he starts posting it gets popular so his second act was was was as this the reason I put him on this list is because I was on air chat the other night and somebody shared a story about him they go you know the they go Tom is a hero of mine of all the Tech Heroes he's one of the biggest because he was able to win the game and then bounce and they go not only did he win the tech game but he won the photography game and then he bounced from that too so if you go to his Instagram his last photo that he posted was like 300 weeks ago so you're like what happened where didd he go why did he stop and why did he stop was because Tom has the ability to have enough and what happened was this guy goes I I ran into Tom and I was like Tom why aren't you posting pictures anymore he goes oh dude I was traveling one time I was in whatever Thailand and I was um he's like I I keep all my camera stuff in my locker and my locker got jacked and he's like somebody stole all my cameras so I was like all right that hubby's done moving on can you imagine like not only winning the business game then you win the social media game and you're super popular and everything you post you get the dopamine Rush of hundreds of thousands of likes and comments saying how beautiful it is how they're so jealous of your life and then someone steals your camera and of course you could afford another one but you're like maybe it's a sign time for the next adventure and he just moved on to the next adventure so what's he doing now so uh the last thing I could find because I was like I needed to know this answer and I went into um by the way he does reply to some tweets I did did remember that he replied to one of mine and if you go to his replies or maybe he didn't but I somehow he came he did reply recently and it was like the last time somebody had heard from him and he just replied like with Emojis um to somebody and people like oh Tom he's back and somebody on Reddit was like I bumped into him in Hawaii he's like and I basically got the sense that this guy is literally just like swimming taking pictures doing like kind of like U you know he's just like swimming hanging out um he's like I think he's just like you know hooking up with like smoking hot women and I think he's just having a great time and he's like not bothered by anything they're like that's the vibe I got from him for my 302 encounter and that was the last information I could find about Tom look at this picture I just posted Tom's on that longevity protocol This Guy's in his 50s now and look at him he looks great he's young he looks fresh he looks happy he but he looks like he's in his 30s he looks really good yeah without uh you know life hacking every you know bio optimizing and taking 96 pills a day and like cold plunging for 10 minutes every morning like he's just like cool I'll just live a stress for you happy life and get a lot of sun and hang out and eat good food and meet cool people dude when I think of hackers at 14 I don't think guys who look like Shawn Parker or or Tom so God bless these guys what do you think they look like Harrier rounder like for sure Harrier and for sure rounder these guys aren't that hariry or round they look great so they've won yeah that's part of why we put them on this list because they're awesome in more ways than just uh just their uh you know the net worth all right I'll I'll bring it home like I said I tried to pick people who you or the listeners would not have any idea who they are there's a 5% chance that you've had a runin with this guy though and I only put maybe 10% because I think he would have ran in the circles of Michael Burch but basically his name is uh Vivy Neo so VII space NE v o Google this guy for me really quick tell me who you think he looks like you probably don't know pop culture enough so I'm actually going to say it he looks exactly like Sting okay he definitely looks like a rock and roll icon or like you know what I think the guy who invented Zara should look like yes exactly exactly that's a great which by the way Google the guy who looks like who who started Zara doesn't look like that looks like what I think a hacker looks like uh so I call this guy the Israeli Great Gatsby and so I need to tell you this guy's story because he's incred mysterious so this guy he's famous for being an investor he claims to be and many people including New York Times claim that he was the largest shareholder in Time Warner he was a very large shareholder in Goldman Sachs so he like runs in all these amazing circles he's the Godparent of some of rubert Murdoch's kids and he's like incredibly well connected the reason I heard about him was do you know how uh there's that famous like Bohemian Grove like who's who of of the World Conference called Allen and Co like the Sun Valley Allen and Co conference where everyone walks out in their vest you know what I'm talking about and they have those high def photos every photo on Google Images is him at the Allen and& Co conference he sticks out he's a really good-look guy and he does not look he looks like a rockstar and I thought it was Sting at first and they said his name was V uh Viv Neo and I was like who the hell is this guy so I started researching him so here's his backstory he uh was born in Romania eventually moves to is Israel and his parents die when he's in his 20s and his parents were very successful they owned a chemical company and they leave him something like $3 million and he was obsessed with Hollywood and so he moves to LA and he's like somehow I want to make it into the entertainment business and so the story is is that he got some type of low paying like not low paying but he got he convinced some guy who he met at a gym to hire him at this man's Investment Bank because Viv was like look I like investing I a thing or two about it I've been investing my parents' money hire me and so this guy eventually goes on record his last name is Burke and he goes somehow he just this guy just starts showing up at my office and he was incredibly engaging however he didn't do anything and that was his whole point is that he did nothing he was kind of a gopher and he didn't really do anything and all the Traders and money management guys were like what the hell does this guy even do he doesn't keep a schedule he can't he he's like a hummingbird he's so add he just jumps around from thing to thing and I didn't even know what he was doing but he just showed up at my office until suddenly he quit showing up and I don't see this guy for years I went to his apartment to see if he's okay he moved out of his apartment I couldn't find any records for him I just I was looking all over the place in Yellow Pages I couldn't find this guy he comes back into my life like three years later and he's totally different he dresses fancy he starts hanging out with celebrities and we have no idea what what he did in those two three four five years and so the rumors about this guy and there's all these articles about what the hell does this guy do for a living none of us can figure it out because he basically has said that he's one of the largest shareholders of Time Warner which was eventually sold for tens of billions of dollars like I said he was one of the largest shareholders of Goldman and he's hanging out with all of these celebrities and so he's like I said he's friends with the rubert Murdoch uh Viv he owns homes in New York City he owns home in Beverly Hills he owns these mansions in Malibu and Lenny Kravitz eventually lives in one of his guest homes that's how fancy it is and a reporter goes to like check out his house because it's like this amazing piece of architecture and they're like what do you do for a living and he won't tell anyone what he has done for a living it even comes out that he uh is engaged to the actress from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon this woman is like one of the top five most famous women in China and he's engaged to her and everyone's like dude what the hell has this guy done like we have no idea what he's done for a living and it turns out he's also one of the larger investors of Twitter one of the larger investors in square and if you Google him you'll see there's all types of photos of him with Leonardo decao with all these like young amazing attractive women even though he's like 65 now he hangs out with all these celebrities The Who's Who of everyone and there's reporters are like I have no idea how this guy is everywhere he's always at the biggest events I don't know what he does for work I can't figure anything out about this guy and he's a prolific investor now in startups he's uh that's how I thought you would have known him and he owns homes that are worth tens of millions of dollars many of them you know he's got one in I think Beverly Hills that he tried selling recently for like 50 or sorry that he bought recently for $48 million the homes are filled with the most amazing art you know these things by bosia Keith Herring like tens of millions of dollars worth of artwork and he claims to be a startup investor he claims to be a public equities investor uh have you ever heard of this guy I've never heard of this guy guy and also I'm still unclear are you saying you don't think he is those things cuz you're kind of like he claims to be this he claims to be that but like the story doesn't fully add up so what's the what what's your take here the story doesn't fully add up because if you own more than 5% of a publicly traded company you have to be listed as that and and New York Times have asked Time Warner and a bunch of his people uh they go he is a shareholder that's just all they'll say they'll say he is in fact a shareholder and he's in the ears of the CEOs and the CEOs of Time warmer will be like hey VI Vivy is really important to our operation he's been a big deal now a lot of people think there's rumors that he's part of the Mad which is basically like the Israeli like Secret Service because no one actually understands what he does and you'll see him with all these interesting celebrities he looks super fit and they all say the same thing about the guy they go he's the most charismatic person we have ever met and like story after story after Story it's billionaire after billionaire after billionaire are saying oh Vivy he's one of my best friends and they'll say well do you know what he does for a living you know we don't really talk about that but he's the most engaging guy we will ever you'll ever talk to he's the least boring person and they go we're best friends because just like this person this person and this person who will say the same thing he came up one day and he sat next to me and I couldn't stop listening to what he had to say because he was so interesting to talk to and so my theory is that he is in fact very wealthy and he's wealthy because he made connections to a bunch of different people and he connected them and would get little bits of equity into a variety of businesses and he's fascinating to me is because he's completely kind of made up this fake persona that has become a reality and you know if you read that book 48 Laws of Power one of the rules is to change your image constantly and he basically disappeared in his 30s and he came back with a new persona and he became that person and many like Hollywood people have been like this guy needs a movie if you guys would know this man had the greatest New Year's resolution of all time he's like all right new year new me literally now I'm the most charismatic interesting well-connected romantic and richest person in the world fantastic you've never had runin with them no I've never I've never bumped into this guy have you um and I'm glad too because it sounds like you know have you ever seen Eric Weinstein talk about Jeffrey Epstein like the first time you met him what did he say that he was charismatic well no he's like the hair on my neck stood up immediately he's like it didn't add up like uh you know where did this guy you know how have I never heard of this guy where did he get his wealth how did he create this hedge fund how is he splashing cash around like this how does it why does nobody know him from like before a certain time and he's like he he's like Jeffrey iene was a government construct like he was basically a government you know created uh entity that was meant to you know ultimately like get you know comprom like you know blackmail on a whole bunch of Rich successful people and that's what he goes around talking about on podcast um I know this guy at all but it just reminded me of uh of of that like the ma the mystery of like who is this person how how does this all that up like okay you your mom left you 10 million bucks but then how did you become such a big shareholder and all these things like that's not a a big starting amount of capital to be able to um to accumulate big stakes in things it's also interesting that like you know he he was one way that he came back years later as like a totally different guy with a totally different personality and and a different Persona dude the New York Times said he's the single largest shareholder of Time Warner which uh is a big deal that's that's billions of dollars and it's amazing that today's age that you can't find out this guy's background no one really knows no one talks about it look at this picture I put into uh the doc it's him at the Allen and Co conference riding a bike while the two people he's talking to are walking yeah and he's like dictating that's not even possible dude how you going to ride a bike and how are people going to walk and talk next to you you can't even I've tried that you can't ride slow enough where they could do that and they can't walk fast enough for you to do this this just added to the Allure to me in a way that nobody else will really understand this is impossible he is defying physics to be able to socialize like this and you see him with literally the most powerful people on Earth and he is always talking with his hands flailing yeah he's gesturing like crazy in all these pictures and and the people who are the most powerful people on Earth are are leaning in listening there's a photo of Tim Cook stroking his chin leaning in like oh what's your opinion on this and he's just engaged them wildly and so this guy like he is like somehow in the ear of the most powerful people on Earth but no one knows who he is I think it's hilarious that we ended this list with a guy that we basically know nothing about no one knows anything about may not actually be an interesting guy and we also massively reading into these signals of like from these like random photos where we're like look look at the way that lean is happening oh he must be charismatic or like I'm like look at this bike look at how he's biking while other people are walking how can he even do that wow this guy is is fantastic we have so little to go on we are grasping for straws on this guy we not grasping he's I'm grasping too there's something here about there's something here about this person I need someone to message me information about him surely people in our audience know who this person is I did that on a t-shirt by the way I'm not grasping you're grasping that's our version of like you can't triple stamp a double stamp all right well that's that's the list I think the real list uh here is basically that these are the most interesting billionaires you've never heard of that's right where we've I agree with that um all right that's the pod [Music]

our buddy Val tweeted this out the biggest pizza chain in the country is one I've never heard of Hunt Brothers Pizza these guys went in and basically found a new way to do the pizza business they've spread to 9,000 stores and I'm pretty sure they're doing over 500 million a year in Revenue what these guys do is they created a pizza restaurant that is only 50 or 100 square ft the way it works is they put them into convenience stores gas stations the owner of the gas station now has a little pizza shop inside so he can pop SP a pizza it takes 5 minutes it comes out broiling hot and they can sell them by the slice or as they call them by the hunk a hunk of pizza is 1/4 of a pizza and they sell it for like $2.89 or you can get two hunks for $5.49 basically you buy the equipment for 10 grand but then after that there's no contract there's no licensing fee there's no royalty fee so it's very different than a traditional franchise all you do is you have to buy the ingredients from them

an Executive Health checkup is basically something that CEOs High netw worth individuals will do where they basically pay somewhere between $5 and $10,000 usually to go for one or two day visit to a medical center and you do a battery of tests and just think of it like the Four Seasons meets a doctor's checkup and so you go and it's kind of this executive VIP treatment and they just put you through a bunch of tests all in one day first of all most doctors won't recommend these secondly even if you did you wouldn't get all your appointments done in a day it take forever and each one you're kind of waiting in line you don't have the TSA pre-check to be able to just go through and do this why is this an interesting business idea so the Mayo Clinic which is probably the leader in doing this is estimated to do over $100 million a year on just their Executive Health checkup service my idea is that somebody needs to create this for sfla New York you know just charge a 10 to 20,000 a year membership fee and it's an annual checkup for you or your spouse even if you can get 5,000 members across any of those GEOS you're doing 50 million a year recurring Revenue

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
okay so the news is this if you've been listening to this podcast you know that Shepard is a business that I'm a part owner in I've been talking about it on the podcast and it's a great business and last week news broke that there was a private buyout of a majority stake in the company for $ 52 million at a $52 million valuation it was done by Nick Huber I had the opportunity to sell my shares in that I decided not to not a single share I'm holding every single share so today we're going to talk about I guess we'll tell the story of you know how Shephard even grew in four years to be a $52 million company how I ended up getting involved with it becoming an owner in the business and why one of the owners in the business did this buyout how they they took $29 million and bought the majority controlling stake in the company so that's the news now here's the back [Music] story all right Sean uh last week you guys had in a big announcement so you and Nick bought Shephard and that's amazing I didn't I didn't do it Nick did it not me yeah but you're part of it you're were part of it you're you're you're one of the partners and I guess maybe I'm gonna interview you at least for this first segment because I want to learn all about it sure I think it's amazing what Nick has done so let's start with the beginning explain what Shephard is and then I guess we'll start it in like 2020 when it started and explaining like how it grew and what happened last week yeah so there's a guy named Marshall hos who was entrepreneur done a bunch of different things I think he owns like a hotel in St Louis he had a bunch of e-commerce companies some goofy one like some Emoji something something then he had Peele which was like a phone uh phone case type like a thin phone case so he was in e-commerce and one of the common things with e-commerce is e-commerce is like a real business but it's like a lemonade stand business every margins matter and so what a lot of e-commerce operators do and I did this too with my e-commerce brand I think 60% of our staff is is offshore is because margins matter you have to figure out a certain specific problem which is how do I get great talent at without paying the full cost without paying the full cost of hiring Stanford grads and Harvard grads or or you know even just a normal median worker in the states and so a lot of us we go to Talent hot beds like Latin America where you find great programmers or data analysts or the Philippines where you can find a great customer support team that will um you know do the job at a fraction of the cost usually about five times less than it costs in the states so five times l is like pretty massive so Marshall's running Peele he starts hiring more and more people overseas and he decides to start a company called support chipper which at the time was ridiculous I saw I'm friends with Marshall on Facebook I've been friends with Marshall since 16 or or 14 when he told me he was doing this I was like this is silly but then I saw The Branding the website pretty much looked the way it does now from the beginning well he uses your favorite color of green as well and so and so he he creates his brand and you're right like uh the idea of hiring Talent overseas is not new this has been going on for a long time I remember my dad once bought this book called The World is Flat and I was a little kid and I read this book and it was all about globalization of talent uh and it was something that big companies were doing but more and more small companies have been doing the startups uh and the like especially for specific roles right so anyways he starts his company and it starts doing decently well he's promoted on Twitter and starts to grow so now Nick comes along Nick Huber from sweaty startup exactly Nick's got a storage company he's in the real estate space and what people don't know is Nick has certain companies like U he has a cost segregation business cost seg is basically when you buy a property you do a cost seg study and it allows you to accelerate your depreciation so instead of depreciating something over 30 years you might be able to accelerate the schedule to seven years it saves you a bunch of money in year one so it's well worth the it's well worth the trade to go pay for ceg study in order to save the money so most people who do a ceg they hire us Talent what he does all of his talents like in Colombia they do it on an iPad you like walk around with an iPad right I'll explain how it works so the way it works is and I'm far from an expert the way that I understand it is basically typically real estate has something like a 30-year lifespan but they came in and said look the rules actually say that your windows can depreciate in 10 years your roof is actually only 15 years so what I need you to do is do a video tour with one of our people on the phone and I have a a checklist of things I need you to show me in the home and you got to walk through and spend about 30 minutes just walking through the house and I did that and the person was I knew he was I mean he spoke perfect English but I thought he was overseas and I was like I actually don't know where you are for some reason I thought he was in Europe I had no idea where he was and there was a guy on the other line as I'm like looking through the house and he's marking down what type of Windows I have and things like that right and so pretty crazy that used to be something you somebody walks on foot through the building and has a clipboard with a piece of paper and now you've got lowcost talent in Columbia that are getting it done for you right so anyways he builds that business so he's using shepher a lot so he ends up going Marshall and uh Cuts an affiliate deal I think initially it was an affiliate deal which was just hey uh if I send you traffic if I tell people hey I'm using Cher is great give me a cut of the fees that you that you generate the revenue that you generate Marshall says yes Nick starts sending traffic and along the way Nick goes back and he says you know what affiliate's great but my be's not wet enough I need a little more skin in the game so he cuts a deal with Marshall to end up becoming a part owner of the business business continues to grow last year almost a year to the day I become a partner in the business I approach Marshall I say hey same same story I'm a power user of the product I have a big audience and um I think I can help grow your business would did this all come from the place of it'd be cool to grow a company based off of your influence I had a lesson which was invest in your p&l and this was a lesson I learned the hard way which was when I was running my startup studio and for six years I was trying to make a successful CH I was trying to be successful make money and what I learned in the end was that a lot of the I would have made hundred times more money had I simply look at our expenses in our pnl and just knocked on their door and said hey can I invest I'm a big fan of your product I'm an early user of this product I really understand this product and whenever you're raising your next round at whatever valuation do that maybe I can help you out in some small way and you know we were I was one of the you know first I don't know 200 companies using slack uh elastic search pager Duty we were using early on figma we were using early on like all of these like tons of them I I don't even know like there's like 20 apps like this and so I learned this lesson the hard way which is you you should always try to invest in your p&l so you look at your expenses you figure out which expense is Meaningful it's a line item that you notice but you don't regret it so an I use your products let let's talk and so we uh we ended up working out a deal and it was a a great deal for me what actually I thought at the time was a great deal for me it turned out to be an even better deal for Marshall so he had a lot of uh wisdom in making that deal because I thought I was getting a fa very favorable deal but he understood the power of the audience and he understood the power of what we could bring to the table and he listened to MFM he saw what we were done on Twitter he know Nick had come on MFM before and mentioned it it was like their biggest day in a year or something like that so he kind of had a he had enough validation to take a leap of faith uh but it was still to be clear a leap of faith so it turns out better than we expected like we had forecasted how much we thought we could grow the business and I try to over always under promise overd deliver type of thing so I was like look I think we can you know maybe 50% maybe 75% we basically grew it by 300% so the business was basically tripled in the last year valuation grew and along the way different acquisition offers came up and I went to Nick one day and I was like hey look there's an acquisition offer I think this thing still got a lot of Runway to run and actually the initial idea was Nick why we what if we bought it what if we raised the money and we bought this thing so most people don't know that that was the initial conversation and Nick's like I'm I'm thinking the exact same thing uh let's talk to Marshall and see within an hour I'm like too much work never mind Nick I don't want to do this this is too much effort for me it' be a huge transaction like he to buy this business so what what actually ended up happening is Nick announced he said big news yesterday I acquired a controlling interest in support Shephard for 29.7 million so he paid $ 29.7 million to buy enough to become a controlling owner of the business I think he said the valuation I think yeah maybe they did in a different one 52 million was the valuation they said $52 million and so which is pretty amazing because from the time one literally one year ago I think it was April or May that we we did the in my deal that means the value of the company had more than tripled in a year so you know just tremendous value growth a win for everybody involved my state grew Nick state grew Marshall did obviously phenomenally well and Nick goes and he basically raises the money and so raises the money to to go and buy you know basically for 30 million bucks he buys a controlling steak in the business hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list

Little crew we we threw in a little bit welcome to the team finally yeah we're we're very very very small stakeholders uh amongst us thing it was hurting me to get rich without you I got to be honest it kept me up in that a few days that's right we we we have a very small taste of it but okay so and here's what I wanted to bring up about two or three years ago you and I did a podcast where we said look there's all these people who have created billion dooll companies off of Instagram they've done it off of YouTube um they've done it off of Facebook there's not really been any breakout hits off of Twitter yet because Twitter's audience is a bit small uh but I was like I think it's good I think we both said it's great because it's text based you get to know people whatever and there's it's a B2B crowd a little bit more so value crowd yeah more so than the other places and it hasn't happened yet but I think it is happening right now I I think I don't know if this is going to be a billion dollar company but I think the fact that Huber uh like went out and raised this money to do this that is a big swing and it took a lot of Courage for him to do that and it could our our prediction could be coming true as we speak very ballsy move I gotta say very ballsy move to do this and I tweeted this I go ballsy move I can't wait to see how this plays out and people thought that was a negative thing but to me I literally just metant like oh my God I can't wait to see how this How This Ends like what is the story what is the story G to be and I think it's gonna end really well it's not ballsy the bad way it's ballzy that he took the ball in his court and he's like trying to do this thing and I and by the way what I tell everyone is I don't want to bet against Nick Nick is a is a really good entrepreneur and if someone can pull it off I I have faith that he can pull it off you know when you watch somebody play sports you learn a lot about them and I played basketball with Nick Huber he is a he's a Workhorse he's an incredibly physical player he's an incredible he comes to the pickup games with a mouse with a mouthpiece in it's like bro I don't know how much contact you're planning for but it's more than I was ready for today and so you see you learn how he operates let me tell you a couple things about this so Nick could have been on cruise control the guy owned self storage facilities Self Storage is literally a closet you lock it's the like the least operational thing you could possibly do is literally put your put your objects in this door and lock it forever like that's all it is I think it's a hundred million worth of self- storage units that he owns so it's a significant amount my point being is he's kind of uh financially he uh he could have been he could have been good spot he loves to hunt he's got little kids he left to do outdoors he L to play sports he could have just been chilling then he has a Twitter audience so he starts he could have done affiliate deals he started launching all these agencies he's like I got a SEO agency he's like I got a Hiring Agency I got a um you know I forgot what else he has he's KAS he's got like seven different agencies he started and each of those would have brought in I don't know 50 to 100K a month enough he could have been totally chill he chose violence he chose to not chill he chose to bet his entire career put his entire network and net worth on the line basically to say this is to take this bold bet and you love to see it i' love to see it I don't think it's going to fail I think the even the worst case it's it's a very survivable thing I think best case is is quite huge it could be a very big outcome for him and I think it's so cool that he's doing this yeah yeah it is and like look I thought we were taking a big bet when like when I put my name on something or Nick puts their name on something it's got to be good because we're spending all this time years building up a reputation years building up a loyal trusted audience at the end of the day you got to turn over your cards and if you don't have if you don't have the hand you know you were just bluffing the whole time and you can't do that Nick took it to a whole new level which is to basically say forget all my other [ __ ] I'm going all in on this and I think that's that's really awesome okay so now let me tell you the big picture take so forget Shephard for a second this is part of a general idea I've had for a while couple years now which is the idea of an audience co-founder so when I started my first companies I knew I needed like I myself as an entrepreneur could do part of what was needed to to succeed to succeed you need to build a great product you need say identify a gap build a product that fills that Gap you have to have a maybe a technical uh team in order to build the product you need money you need a bunch of things and as a Founder you try to go do all the things you try to identify the Gap you try to go raise the money you try to go recruit a team but it's hard to do by yourself and so very common in Silicon Valley is to have a technical co-founder and a technical co-founder is you know that's the person who's going to do the the engineering the building and you rely on them to do that and you're say I'm going to do the the the other components of this business well now I think there's a more more common Playbook which is the IDE of an audience co-founder what an audience co-founder is is you partner with somebody who has a has a cheat code in go to market right they have a Advantage they have an unfair advantage that is non fungible that is non um not easy to recreate yourself they and what they do is they essentially lower your cost of customer acquisition um sometimes to the point of being zero sometimes negative but it definitely lowers it which isn't new this isn't new you know George Foreman and then since the beginning of time we've talked about celebrity Partnerships of exactly so so they've evolved and so what that's what I want to bring up like the evolution of these so for example you got the Foreman grill and it used to be you hire a celebrity they hold your product they smile buy this product right that was an endorsement then this then the the audience people they they got a little bit wiser they said oh instead of just taking cash for this I'll take some Equity too thank you very much so they started taking Equity too and you're gonna put my name and face on it then that means I'm gonna have to own a piece of this so you get the form and Grill you get all of these celebrity alcohol Brands you get McGregor doing proper whiskey I think McGregor owned about 15 to 20% of proper whiskey you have Logan Paul and Prime I I don't know but I think it's something on the order of magnitude of 20 to 30% you've got cloy doing his tequila you got the rock doing his tequila you got Ryan Reynolds doing his gin you got a bunch of people that do the the sort of celebrity alcohol brand the celebrity Cosmetics brand right Rihanna with Fenty Beauty but but each time it's getting a little more and more tied in with the co-founder so you go from hold up the product and ding play the jingle to putting my name and face on it to actually it's named after me actually I'm going to be the one creating the media that we use to Market this thing instead of you paying me twice a year to come to some so some commercial shoot I'm gonna be posting every day I'm Kylie Jenner I'm gonna be posting every day on my Instagram stories about this I'm Conor McGregor I'm gonna be reposting tons of material on this I'm gonna take a bottle to the press conference I'm Logan Paul I'm gonna take a a you know a bottle of Prime with me to WrestleMania when I'm uh when I'm and I'm gonna use it I'm gonna Crush one right before I go in the ring and so the celebrities become more and more involved and now what's happening is this is transitioning out of major celebrities doing major you know uh consumer products to more and more what's happening in the software space which is more new I would say so you have Russell Brunson do this with clickfunnels you have horoi just bought a chunk of school and now he's wearing a school hat and a school wipe beater everywhere he goes because he's trying to promote that product and so you see what me and Nick did with Shephard and you see that basically these brand brands that are almost private Equity Brands right so we build a consumer facing brand and then we do private equity and the beautiful thing is that the private Equity guys don't know anything about brand and the brand guys don't know anything about private equity and if you happen to be somebody that knows about both you have a pretty unique uh proposition in the market and so I think we're going to be seeing more and more of these audience co-founders where people realize that I can either just take a bet that my product will get off the ground that I can get out of the kind of the the the muck of similar products at the sub scale and try to break through and they're going to use their cap table as a tool for to do this and um I i' I narrowed it down into three things that I think you need in order to make this work because I think there's going to be a lot of people that try this and they're going to fail and here's I think the three essential things you need in a audience co-founder the first a large trusted audience trust being the key word here there's a lot of people with an audience but they have low trust meaning if they go tell people hey you should go try this you should read this book you should try this lotion you should show up at this event should watch this movie how many people actually go do it and I'm not going to name names but there's a lot of people that we know that have audiences but they don't have anything for trust or they have audiences but Their audience is broke and so the only thing they could sell them is very cheap things for broke people basically and so you have to find the right trust somebody with a trusted audience so trust that's quite challenging to measure but large is easier so I could tell you so so our podcast MFM if you measure YouTube including shorts which you could argue and I would agree with it that shorts is nonsense but we had something like 90 million impressions last year across the podcast and then if I had to guess your Twitter handle probably had another 10 to 20 a month uh million impressions and then your newsletter I don't know how often you send it you send it once a week let's say let's keep around number of 100 thousand so you're talking to Mill tens of millions of people a month would you say that's accurate no to be honest no I think the number of people is a lot less than the number of Impressions sorry for sure tens of millions Impressions I don't know how many people maybe a million maybe more than million I think I think we reach somewhere between half a million and a million people truthfully right and there's a lot of people that will exaggerate these numbers truthfully I think that's the absolute ceiling of what we reach but then the trusted audience is a fraction of that but um it doesn't matter it's it's the depth of trust that matters and this is the total mispriced asset in the market because the easy thing to measure is number of followers number of views number of of of Impressions that something gets a little bit better might be likes or replies but then even better is bookmarks even better is how many people click the link and then the ultimate source of Truth is revenue there's other tests that I like to think about so another trust test is um and I talked to a guy who who's getting millions and millions of views on shorts and I said um hey if you tweet it out tomorrow that you are um hanging out at this coffee shop in Austin and you said hey I'm hanging out from 10 to to 2 tomorrow or 10 to noon two hours I'm hanging out uh stop by how many people would show up there are some people that would have a line out the door and then there's some people that nobody would show up for because they have a very fleeting transactional impression based thing they are not the focus of it maybe they're putting up meme content or they're putting up uh you know like canned videos that are highly animated but they're not even involved in it there's no trust that's being associated with them um another trust test if I email my list tomorrow and I said tomorrow I'm putting out something that I've been working really hard on that it's [ __ ] good trust me and I said it's it it'll be available at 5:00 a. tomorrow and it's gonna be available to the first thousand people that that try it that's it how many people would set their alarm right right there are certain companies of products you set your alarm for Apple gets people to set their alarm and come camp out to get their new product it's trust at the end of the day right that's the that's the measurable value of a brand is trust and so I think that's the the number one variable number two product to audience fit so basically uh if I came on here and I started telling you about colone it's not going to work it's just the wrong product for the wrong audience uh it's not what my audience wants it's not what they trust me on it's not the right price point given the the uh size of my audience right I sell products that are worth tens of thousands each Logan Paul sells products that are worth $4 each but he's got a much bigger audience you got to find an equation that works so product audience fit a great examp example was the episode we did with Danny Austin on this podcast Danny Austin was a woman who was she was uh she had struggled with postpartum I think postpartum hair loss and was really insecure about her hair she wore wigs for like a year then she took the wig off and told her her Instagram audience like this is what I've been going through I feel a little bit silly I felt insecure about it but I'm trying some things let's see what works and eventually ends up creating her own line of Hair Care called divvy which is a a product to cure this pain point that she authentically had that many people in her audience authentically had and trusted her for it and so the highest highest version of product audience fit is when you genuinely authentically experience a problem and can tell a story about it and that story resonates with your audience because they also have that problem and they believe your story third one content creativity so how good is this person at creating an ongoing stream of content that plugs the product dude that's shockingly hard by the way very hard to do it's very hard good at it I'm good at it I think you're good at I think Nick is exceptionally good at it as well Nick is fantastic at it I he posts probably I think a 100 times a week on Twitter I looked it up and he's good he makes hits and you see this everywhere so uh when Logan Paul and and KSI launch Prime they did a photo shoot they did the photo shoot of them drinking and then there's this viral image there's this image that goes Super viral and it's basically it's Logan Paul drinking Prime and KSI drinking Prime but KSI was kind of like bent down on one knee and then somebody photoshopped them together so it kind of looked like KSI was you know like going down on on Logan Paul and then they printed a cardboard cut out of that and they put it in the aisle of I forgot Walmart or wherever they were launching so they the news was we're launching in Walmart and many okay what does a Creator do normally hey guys just so excited uh can't believe it we launched in Walmart good for me um you know go go check it out please go buy our product from Walmart right what Logan Paul does he's smart about is he knows how to go viral around his product he knows that it's not about patting yourself on the back it's not about a generic announcement that doesn't mean anything to the audience he gave them a reason to share the news which was put put him and KSI in a compromising situation made a joke out of it and then that image goes and gets 100 million views right and it's the same story but he knew how to package it to go viral he'll also do things like um he'll create content that'll be um I'm going to try to make this drink using these three Flav ver of prime so it's like it's kind of like those will it blend type of commercials but he's using his product you know for us we will do like me and Nick we would do um a workshop where we were we did a like a delegation Workshop so I was like look is that what most people call those things I mean haters will call them webinars oh yeah but they're called haters you call a webinar I call you a hater I knew it was a wummy word I couldn't think it was Workshop something like that yeah it's on the web I forget it's kind of like a seminar but we would do these things and they would drive so much business for the for the business and so we would we would come up with what is a value ad thing we could do that delivers so much value in 45 minutes and at the end we just say by the way if you want to do this Shepherd's a great tool but you've delivered so much Goodwill and so much value that you can you can do that anyways there's a whole bunch of stuff around content creativity how do you on an ongoing basis uh create native content that is going to continue to bring the brand front and center or do it we created The Thrill of the shill for example to give ourselves an excuse to talk about our products so there are creators that are better at that and there are creators that are worse at that we're you know we're good but there are people who are incredible at who do you think is the best like who do you look to besides uh some of maybe some of the non-popular ones is there any non-popular ones you look at and you're like that's really great there's a guy on Twitch named Dr disrespect that I first noticed is incredible at this and I noticed it because majority of twitch streamers get a ton of blowback if they ever mention a product a service to chat immediately sell out sell out sell out oh my God whatever Dr disrespect created a brand that almost allowed for it and he created so much humor and cont it's like you don't want to be in the middle so either you just never sell out or you try to try to sell product but you're trying not to sell out you're sort of hedging and the audience can sniff that out a second and they will pounce on you or you go full you go full sellout at twitch we even did this when Amazon wanted twitch the company to promote Prime day it's like oh how are we going to do this our our community is very sensitive to us promoting something especially promoting a big Corp Mega Corp like Amazon and so they created a campaign called twitch sells out and they made you got joke twitch sells out and that was the whole campaign was well today twitch sells out and they basically like they leaned into it Dr disrespect would do this he he would do a promo promo with Old Spice and then he would create like a full like a full like content series around this thing around Old Spice and he would do it in such a way that by the end of it the whole chat was looking forward to the next Old Spice like fot what he call it like the Champions club or something like that he would create all these little things around it because he was a total character he knew how to do it so he was I could see how much money he was making he was making way more money per viewer than the average twitch streamer because he knew how to monetize that audience do you remember we had Justin Meers come on and he told us about his new company called is it true Med or true medicine true Med yeah true Med so true Med um I how do you explain it is it h a spending so it's like a a kind of a boring topic but basically like you could spend your insurance money anyway his co-founder is this guy named kayy means and kayy means is uh I guess he's a I think he's a doctor or former doctor but he's like obsessed with metabolic health and I followed him on Twitter and he is indoctrinating me on like healthy eating I bookmarked his thing yesterday same it was like the Four Points four thing like you know basically he's like America has like you know a 20% obesity ra or something like that in young kids and like other countries have 4% here's the four things we should do immed effective immediately to turn this around and I was like sir yes sir you know for presid I've never met this guy but godamn he's convincing he is so convincing and so his company and he does it in such a good way because his company is a very specific thing HSA spending and you can buy like healthy stuff I think you can buy like an eight Sleep mattress or whatever using like your insurance something something like that but anyway he'll he his whole Crusade is on like processed foods and over being overweight and things like that and so he's like uh a renegade and a champion for like healthiness and it just so happens I have this thing that I that you could actually use to like buy some of these things so like he tweeted out the other day he's like America's super obese here's Four Points like you shouldn't be able to use um uh food stamps on soda or uh a pharmaceutical company should not be allowed to advertise on TV and he had like two or three more things and I get obsessed with it and he's starting to change my opinion and then I'm slowly starting to think about trumed his on by the way cuz I've seen him now do a couple of these Rants and each time I am so convinced I am so convinced that I actually schedule time on my calendar to look up opposing evidence because I'm like before I just fully bathe in this Kool-Aid same I need to hedge myself I need to create some firewall where I go see if this guy's full of [ __ ] because he is very convincing he's very convincing and this is a really good example I asked you for non-popular example I guess I had one Kaye means is a non-popular example of a well I guess he's I mean he's not like mainstream popular but he's somewhat popular in our little circle of of a B2B product and he is selling it wonderfully absolutely yeah I think it's uh I think it's amazing uh there's a bunch of these by the way liver King Nick bear like a lot of guys do this and I think the the interesting thing now is it used to be celebrities hold up the product and endorse it or it would be the celebrity creates the company themselves what I'm finding now is this interesting new new variant of this the new strain which is company that already exists finds a audience co-founder to accelerate growth and by the way if you're trying to do this come to me I want to do this again I want to do this one more time the shepher thing went so well uh and I I tweeted this out I go you if you have a cash flowy product that is genuinely a great product like it has to be a great product otherwise I'm not going to put my name on it um and you are bootstrapped you are not on the Venture path hit me up Sean at sha.com I want to do this one more time you have this thing on here about the curse of family riches and I want to talk about that but before we talk about that I want to tell you a story about someone I spoke with recently so there's this company called Simple modern have you heard of simple modern of course so simple modern is a website that sells basically mugs but I think they sell a ton of stuff so like Stanley mug competitors tumblers they sell a ton of stuff I talked to him the other day and he gave me his annual revenue since they started the business along with the profit from some of the recent years and he said I could talk about it and so I listed it here in this document so when when people give you their revenue do you just go do you just like evil laugh or what do you do well whenever I talk to people I'm like hey before we even have a conversation just so you know I'm not saying any of this um and then in our 20s we tried to get girls numbers in our 30s we try to get Guys numbers yeah yeah I want to know people's uh people's income but then at the end of the conversation I was like dude this is so fascinating can I share this or not and he was like yeah dude I don't care you can share and so anyway he started this company 2015 in 2017 they had 10 million in Revenue 18 they had 20 million they grew it and I I'll skip a few years up in 21 they uh got 80 million 22 95 million 23 this most recent year they did 180 this year they're expected to do $225 million selling these tumblers it's mostly tumblers and he started the company with like $200,000 in his 30s and so he's bootstrap company he owns half the business because he gave a away a lot of the the the business to employees and I was uh asking them about it and by the way in 2023 they did 180 million revenue and $45 million in EV in profit and so he's been able to make like a significant amount of money but the reason why Mike was so f fascinating to me is he's based in Oklahoma so he's this like real soft sweet wonderful nice guy he's uh I'm sure he's aggressive in business but when you're just hanging out with him he's like a sweet man and he was like I started this company because I wanted to do two things one I wanted to just build a business that I could hire people who I admire being around and number two he uh he's like I just wanted to give away a lot of money like I I feel like it's my mission to like give away money and so this guy since the beginning of the company the company has pledged to give seven or 10% of their profits away to Charities and the people within the company vote where the charity goes to and so he actually doesn't have control he set it up so everyone's allowed to vote but in the meantime he's been giving away all his money and so he's giving away something like $100,000 a month of like the Beckham family money and he like said what is he's like I I've I've been able to save up like uh $4 million but I'm still giving away something like a million a year right now and I don't know if my $5 million liquid net worth is going to go up a significant amount because I intend to give as I go and he's been giving since the beginning so he's like when it started I was giving away 5,000 a month when I was making uh he said uh what did he say he like when I was making 200 Grand a year I was giving away 5,000 a month and my intention is to continue giving so when I die I don't have a lot left I've given it away as I've gone and he was like basically like I kind of wanted to be generous when I was alive not when I was dead which is what a lot of people do and I don't know if I'm going to leave any money from my family or not maybe I'll leave them enough that they have a little bit of something but we're going to give away most of he's like my net worth right now is probably $200 million based off the value of the business I'm giving it all away and I was so fascinated by this and it really actually inspired me not enough to take action because honestly it's still it's still a bit fearful if I'm being honest like I'm so quite fearful of it but he seemed so freaking happy talking about this do you give away any money at all like this uh a little bit yeah not like this um sounds like he's giving away 20% of his liquid net worth per year something like that yeah like a significant sum and and his liquid net worth is growing because he was like this is the first year that the business he's like we're GNA do 45 million in iida it's the first year where like we don't have any new ideas within the business so we're going to take a big fat dividend and I'm gonna end up giving most of that away uh and I'm just G to give it away as I go two parts of this are impressive one is uh money where your mouth is there's a lot of people that that talk about oh yeah I want to people give things away and then they live their whole life and they're like it's like the S bankman Freeds of the world where it's did you give any of it away what happened what happened to that he was giving as he goes I think that's really really really great some of the happiest people I've met in life are the people that give the most same some of the most successful people I I know in life um are people that give the most and the the more interesting thing is of the people that give the most they've been giving from the beginning I think that's the real takeaway is like the fallacy that when I have enough then I'm going to give and it just creates this like internal fear of you know giving away right um you know this year last year we did when we had uh Scott Harrison on I did the thing where I gave away my birthday so I basically said uh I'm turning 35 I'm GNA give $35,000 to charity water I'd set it live on the Pod so I can I can say that out loud here and then I encourage people hey if you want to give me a gift go to the charity water thing donate the gift there do you know how much that rais I think it raised like about another 30 or 35,000 I think it raised 30,000 so in total this pod gave you know audience people gave 30,000 I gave 35,000 and it was an uncomfortable give like not that like it didn't change anything in our life but I when I went downstairs I told my wife I was like yeah on the pot I got kind of inspired and I committed to giving away $35,000 and she was like she was punch you in the stomach really hard yeah she was like what are you doing I was like I'm helping people and she's like help me and I was like what and she's like take off the trash I was like okay sorry um but you know just in general it was an UNF it was unfamiliar territory to just like that on a whim commit amount of money that's you know meaningful that's a car you know that's that's like something um and I really like the feeling and every year I try to do that I try to get to giving away in a way that's meaningful to me so the other thing we did was when Tony Robbins came on WE pledged to give away I think it was 40 or 50 tickets uh each ticket's you know 50 to$ 500 to $1,000 basically um you know so that's you know sort of 25 to 50 Grand that we give but I'm like giving away an experience that was really mean meaningful to me that I think could help a lot of people and so um by the way I need to go pick the winers for that that reminds me so if you've been waiting you didn't miss out I didn't pick the winners yet there's like a thousand people to go through and I just left that pile of you know 2,000 applications I was like I'll get to that when I have some free time but I will do it um but the idea is give an amount that's slightly uncomfortable for you I think that's a uh a good practice that I'm just now doing last three years I think I've done that and and probably should have been doing it earlier to be honest I've not I need to do it and the reason it kind of interests me and I was like Mike is it okay to be selfish about this he's like well yeah so I was like do you get tax advantages he's like yeah like it it we you could like you you can like there is some stuff I can capture trying to find the other reason to do it well he was like it's like he's like I'm not gonna not take advantage of something like but that's not the reason why I do it but it is it is a nice like cherry on top that I could take but I was talking to him I was like you know what's crazy to me so he's uh religious but not in a way where like we disagree on anything uh like he's very kind about his [ __ ] and uh I was like dude if you're telling me that you're put here on Earth to like please God by giving away money I never want to bet against you that's like the best motivation on Earth you know what I mean like who who wants to bet against that person uh like I don't want to go against you you're gonna like destroy everyone you got the best motivation and so what's this thing on here about curse of of of uh oh was it it was familiar riches I read I said I didn't know when to break it to you that you thought I was saying family riches but it says familiar riches here's a transition you talked about giving away money this is the greed side of it this is about making money okay so I have noticed a pattern in myself and in many others and I call it the curse of familiar riches and here's how the curse goes you grow up thinking a certain amount of money means you're rich for me that was always a million dollars that's why this podcast is called my first million I used to play games with you know my sister whoever it' be would you rather would you cut off your pinky for a million dollars would you and it was just like escalating what if scenarios that's an easy yeah yeah exactly that was a starter yeah um I never even asked about $10 million never thought about a billion dollars I never even heard honestly I never heard the word like I never even heard people talk about billionaires never knew a billion when I was growing up it wasn't even on my radar as a thing uh I thought a million dollars was like all the money so you have this idea of like what a ton of money feels like but even a million dollars wasn't my goal it's not like a million dollars was what the rich people have that wasn't what I thought I would have and so I thought making six figures $100,000 was like the goal that was the you've made it line when I met you and you were making six figures I thought you were the wealthiest person I knew it was a great feeling I enjoyed being the wealthiest person you knew yeah I was like 50 Grand a year oh my God you a driver um so anyways I I the curse of familiar riches is you have you start with this amount of money that you think is a ton of money and it is a ton of money to you at the time it's all relative and then you get you you do it right so I graduated from college I think my first job well my first thing was a startup and we were paying ourselves nothing we were living off of we made $25,000 of prize money from a business plan competition we lived off that three of us so we you know eight grand a year or something but then I got I we got kind of acah hired I ended up getting a job and my job was paying me 120 Grand a year and I was laughing I couldn't believe that they were paying me that much money and once I was making $125,000 or $120,000 my brain this is why it's called familiar riches my brain could think of many other ways that I could make $120,000 I could get another job doing this I would maybe hear about an opportunity I could realize that I could Stitch these two things together and if I did those two things it could be like $125,000 and so there are a once you get to a certain level whatever that level is it's quite easy and familiar to come up with one or two other ways that you could make that same amount of money and by the way that exists at every level at every level this is this is the problem this is why this is the curse and so the easy thing to do then is when you get to 100 Grand you realize oh I can go get this other job that would pay me 100 Grand or even 120 Grand or 150 Grand but it's basically between a one and 2x of where you're at so you you can figure out how to make about what you're at 50% more or just double but your brain breaks after you say awesome how do you make five times more yeah and I remember hearing at the time like there's a guy who makes $500,000 a year in salary and it was stunning to me I was like he's stealing the money from the company there's no way anybody could create that much value that they're making a half a million dollars per year he just gets paid that that's insane I and if you ask me Sean what's the pathway you're at 120 now how do you get to 500 my brain would short circuit and break and so what I did for many years was I did things that were very familiar and I found a way to one to twox my earnings and then when we got acquired by twitch whatever and I got my package the here's your upfront cash and I sent it to my dad and my dad I think the most he ever made was 300 Grand in his life and a year a salary and um so I sent him the offer and he called me and he's like it just keeps going I go what he goes I thought the first line was the total amount and I was so excited and that was the B signing bonus he's like and then then the next thing he's like then they what is the RSU what are these things what are they giving you and he's he couldn't believe it and he emailed me again that three days later he goes I just read it again I still can't believe it and he like thought it was like a menu where you like pick one of the options turns out it's more like a like a added all up and so and my brain broke too so what am I getting at here uh after that I started to ask questions I started to realize wow there are people forget making 500,000 a year there's people that make $2 million a year there's people that make $5 million a year and so I started to use as a thought exercise how does how would I make 10 times more than I'm making today and at first again the brain broke there was no answer I sat down again the next day and I said how do I make 10 how how do I make 10 times more than I'm currently making well I guess if I was going to do that I would and i' and then you start to get creative you're like is there anybody who makes that of course there are what do they do how do they do it they start to reverse engineer some things and then you add time into the equation I remember we came on this podcast because I had a brain breaking conversation with Nikita beer we were like Nikita what are you up to man you're just sitting at Facebook you're just been four years you're just rotting away over there what's going on he goes yeah I'm thinking about for the summer how do I make $10 million in 90 days and I was like what I never even heard somebody asked a question oh no was it it wasn't $10 million it was how do I make was it was like a million dollar $3 million I forgot it wasc about yeah it was it was not 10 it was more like how do I make a million dollars in 90 days and I was like I don't even know I don't know what do that time scale breaks all the existing answers I have but sure enough there are answers and that that summer he created the gas that app called gas and I think he made $7 million in revenue and then they got acquired by Discord the son of a [ __ ] did it and I was like what the hell is that and so I started asking myself better questions and I've just noticed this and it's just a prompt for the world anybody who's out there you don't you don't have to do this it is absolutely wonderful to be completely content of where you're at and to focus your energies on other things besides making money probably healthier and if you're doing that more power to you but if you're slightly broken inside like me and you don't go to therapy and you think that money's going to cure your problems this is a good exercise to actually do it which is to absolutely refuse any option that's going to make you one to twox your money you have to completely say no to anything that is a one or twox where you're currently at and only think about what would it be a 10x and then let your brain short circuit every day until your brain starts to come up with answers and it will it just takes like five to six days of doing that every single day to get to start generating some answers so I want to give two points to that one I actually think there's good news the good news is is that you know how they say money doesn't make happy um I actually think it does make you happier so the good news is is there is a threshold I don't know what that threshold is it's different for everyone it could be tens of millions it could be a certain amount of year uh per year but that $70,000 study uh that's [ __ ] if you zoom in on that graph it continues going up it just doesn't go up as steep steep and that study is also like 20 years old so it's totally outdated but there is there is some number I think where it will make you happier the bad news I know a lot of rich people you and I know a lot of the same wealthy people we know people who are billionaires um we know people who are hundreds of millions millions millionaires I am just about 100% positive and I can tell you that this is based on my personal experience it's never enough it is never enough you and I have a couple friends who it is enough for a very small group of people but for eight out of 10 people it's never enough and that whole 2x idea it always exists and so it is a challenge but it's imperative that we it doesn't matter if you're making 100 Grand a year it doesn't matter if you're making 500 Grand or 50 million a year that we have to figure out how to be happy and present and uh enjoy ourselves along the way because once you just automatically get that outcome or whatever you get it it doesn't change a significant amount from like where you were the months or years prior what's the Jim Carrey quote he goes I wish I wish everybody could be rich and famous so so they would know that that's not what that's not the answer it's absolutely not the answer it I think it can make you happy but it doesn't necessarily make you happy let me tell you one for all the uh Finance personal finance nerds out there what I used to do is so money is kind of a weird thing because when you like sell your company or something like that it's just like for the first few weeks the only major change is when you log into chase.com the number like the digit like the screen looks different like if you think about it that's like the old that's like and that is awesome but that's like it's kind of weird that that's like there's some weird psychological thing where that's the only like meaningful difference is that number is different that have come on the Pod and said they used to just go to the ATM and just click print receipt like just like do a random withdraw 10 bucks print receipt please just so they could see the number so I'm gonna explain how I hacked that so they told me that I heard that as well and so about two years before my exit I used to use this thing called personal capital.com it's basically mint.com whatever whatever you're using could work I you can create a manual account where you can add in manually where it's not connected to your bank account you can just add it numbers I put in like 15 million in the manual account so it said that my net worth on paper was at least $15 million and so I saw that number and then I sold my company and I got the money and I went and deleted the 15 million and I and then I saw like the real number and I was like well I've already seen this for the last two years like this isn't really like that different you know what I mean and it's in a shocking amount of stuff to my brain to like see that number leading up and so you almost get used to it it's very strange and it kind of ruined that like initial depit because I was like I like these numbers are kind of like the Same by the way I got to be the counterbalance to this because I've heard I've listened to many podcasts YouTube videos and I've heard many people say similar things that you know money doesn't make you happy there's never enough uh you know that day after it happened and you know nothing really changed you know I just kind of felt a little I I didn't know what to do I kind of actually almost had a little bit of a depressed period afterwards and I'm not saying that they're lying I'm sure that's true for many people I had a very different experience I had what I had exactly what I would have hoped it the more money I got the happier I got the more free time I had the less [ __ ] I had to deal with sure I had some new problems but they were way better than money problems and then when when I saw the number in the bank account I said [ __ ] yes and I was so excited and I had such a great day and I took my parents to dinner that night and I was so excited and they were so excited for me and I bought a bunch of socks and those like these socks make me happy because I got a bunch of matching socks with the highest quality and the highest highest kind and then I felt amazing I felt better and the money made me feel better and so there are people out there for whom this happen don't don't misunderstand me I said it makes you happier it made me happier but if we didn't but we still want more right we're still having conversation of how do we two or three or five or 10x because if we were truly content we wouldn't be asking that question and so what I'm saying is we still want more and it does make you happier but it's it in itself is not always it's not like the answer it is potentially part of the equation right and I guess the thing that I'm talking about right now is really just a question of of Leverage meaning for the same inputs can I get more outputs okay so so all I'm saying is that if you just change your brain to say you know what I am familiar with many ways to get this amount of rich now because I've done it I know other people have done this I've been doing this for a little while now I am comfortable at this level and there's more levels that I would love to be at you know without 10 Xing my input can I 10x my output I'm always interested in that if I could get 10 times more people listening to this podcast without having to record 10 times more or prep 10 times more that be aesome you do it that'd be awesome I would do that any day and I think even you did this when we were talking about growth for the Pod it was like here's some lwh hanging fruit and then you were like is there anything we could do that would just get like a million views per video like let's just shouldn't we just like ask that question at least in case there's an interesting answer and that's kind of what I'm saying which is you want to ask that question because it it fries your brain for a second and it forces you to think a little differently you may you may decide that you may never come up with a great answer or you may decide I don't want to do any of those things or I'm totally comfortable with where I'm at but I just think that there is a curse of familiar riches which whatever level you're at if you're making 10 million a year you probably now know a bunch of ways to make 10 million a year but you'll have very few ways to make a 100 million in a year and as a thought exercise I think it's very valuable to say let me say no to all things that do the that are at the level I'm familiar with and let me only think about and consider options that would 10x where I'm at um and then see then you could decide afterwards whether you want to take any action on that or not let me ask one question as we wrap up yeah you're talking about earning would you spend 10x what you're spending now in order to get used to that life in order to get used to it yeah in order like not an idiot you know like like um you know they act as it so I've got friends who will say like uh you know this is going to work therefore I'm going to just behave as if it works and I'm going to spend because I like uh burning the boats and feeling this and I have to make it work I am totally into act as if but not by spending that's not the I don't I think that that that perverts the spirit of act as if or living from the end so what the way I do it is act as if means um to me I'm like in decision- making meaning I'm willing to say no to doing certain things that come from a scarcity mindset so maybe I would have said yes to some speaking gig because it gives me money but if I had 100 million bucks I wouldn't say yes I wouldn't go travel leave my family go to this speaking gig and duth you know I would I would just I would just say no and so Del so I use it in order to just put myself in a more of an of abundance mindset in order to make decisions that are more aligned with who I really want to be those aren't like oh let me go buy a tiger in order to increase my burn rate in order to add the pressure to me like I just think that's a completely unhealthy way to go about it or the other version is how would I you know uh a lot of people walk around with a lot of anxiety a lot of stress or in a in a big rush they rush through their day they're constantly feeling a lack of time and they live again in the scarcity mindset lack of time um uh lack of ease and so they act as if that I try to do is put myself in a place where what if I was what if it was all figured out what if I knew what I was doing what if I already done it what if what if you know what if x was already done and it allows me to just walk through my day with a greater sense of presence and ease and joy and less stress less anxiety less of a rush so I'll use it in those areas I will never use it to be like hey how about I just like increase my burn just to see how it feels it's like you know it's like aren't people into like dripping hot wax on themselves before they like you know do do stuff like not me I'm good don't need to do that and if you live in duth you can kiss my ass is duth even a place I just said that I had a yeah there's a duth in Minnesota but there's probably a duth in a lot of places shout out to The Listener who just caught an absolute stray in your lucky day if you Liv Toth just comment in the YouTube and let us know but you could still kiss our ass um all right that's OD [Music] what

the number one source of divorce is not infidelity or lack of shared values it's usually got something to do with money and also 70% of divorce filings are filed by women we don't like to say this because we like to pretend women have no agency and that they're just doughy little foes the man loses a business becomes broke or has a mental breakdown when a man loses his status as a provider he's very inclined to be on the wrong end to divorce so I think a lot about young men I think a lot about Financial Security I think every man should start with the notion that he's going to be responsible for the economic well-being of his household and by the way sometimes that means getting out of the way and being more supportive of your partner who happens to be better at that money thing than you and that's a wonderful thing but start from a position of this is my responsibility

if you have ever listened to this podcast or you like this podcast or it's the first time listening to this podcast I swear to God I swear on my life this podcast is amazing today this episode specifically I can't guarantee all about all the rest of them but today's episode is amazing everything that you've ever liked in any piece of content that's around business life motivation inspiration uh people doing cool [ __ ] it is in this episode I swear on my life you will love this episode and I've never said that before this is the first time and it's probably the last time I'll ever do that because I don't want to die the last 20 minutes are by far the best uh make sure you get those last 20 [Music] minutes all right we're live Sean how you doing how am I doing dude you know it's funny some days I wake up and I'm Andrew huberman's Gods son I wake up I stretch I get my soaz loose I get outside I get some sunlight I cold plunge I sauna I do everything I meditate I focus I pray I don't even believe in God I'm just praying to the universe I do everything and then some days are like today where I wake up and I just wage war for my boxers in my bedroom I don't get out of bed I open up my laptop I'm like oh what's coming in what's coming into the inbox I'm ready I put on my armor and I just start I'm launching ad campaigns I'm fighting off a cease and assist I'm texting somebody I'm I'm diling a deal and three hours fly by I haven't brushed my teeth I haven't changed my clothes I'm like I'm just s s sitting in bed I do a zoom call they're like are you in bed I'm like brother I haven't gotten out of bed yet I just started I woke up and I was playing the game and I if I'm honest with you if I'm totally honest with you I've never feel more alive than when I'm in that second mode I'm sorry you remember forgive me I just feel more alive when I do it the wrong way it usually starts with like something bad that you see like a fire like why the hell are we spending this much money on this or what exactly that's why wage war cuz I'm like something triggers me I'm like exactly why are the numbers lower than they should be F this I'm going to single-handedly change this dashboard right now or um you know somebody text me saying um whatever did you see this or hey um you know we get an email in that's like hey you're screwed I'm like not only am I not screwed I'm thriving hold on just give me 90 minutes on this and I will turn this around and I just like I don't know it's just it gets something in me something comes out of me that's just more valuable than all of the good healthy stuff years ago we talked about a company on here called jambies and I felt it was the stupidest idea that I've ever heard I think it was underwear that you could wear shorts bro I'm not gonna Flash the audience but just so you know I'm potting in jambies right now and that's what I was gonna ask were you wearing Jam like I thought it was the dumbest idea and you're like oh I own a bunch of jambies I bought like 30 pairs of jambies um I even cut a deal with him for the milk road to advertise but I was like pay me in jamb credits he gave us $22,000 of jamb credits to run an ad and I was like dude I'm eaten off this $2,000 uh you know store credit right now I've never been more thrilled speaking of eating I see on the top of our document that you have something called the insane Pizza business yes what's what's that all right you're gonna know about this I didn't know about this so our buddy Val tweeted this out he goes the biggest pizza chain in the country is one I've never heard of Hunt Brothers Pizza yeah and here's the hook these guys went in and basically found a new way to do the pizza business they've spread to 9,000 stores and I'm pretty sure this is my guest work but I'm pretty sure they're doing over 500 million a year in revenue and they're growing very very fast so what Hunt Brothers is if you're like me and you're a dainty Little Flower that only lives in you know metropolitan areas civilized places yeah exactly we cut our nails over here okay so so I've never run into a Hunt Brothers but apparently if if you've never worn Jorts before there's a direct correlation of how often you worn Jorts and how often you've eaten Hunts Pizza V diagram is a circle yeah all right so basically what these guys do is they created a pizza restaurant that is only like 50 or 100 square feet the way it works is they put them into a lot of times convenience stores gas stations places like that and the owner of the gas station now has a little pizza shop inside so he can pop in a pizza it takes five minutes it comes out kind of like you know broiling hot and they can sell them by the slice or as they call them by the hunk and they sell a hunk of pizza a hunk of pizza is a quarter you know one4 of a pizza and they sell it for like you know a hunk is289 or you can get two hunks for 5.49 or you can get two hunks for free if you go to our YouTube channel And subscribe nice segue thank you very much good job I really just do this to amuse myself at this point two HS for the price of a like I take it all right so so what these guys are doing they they basically you buy the the Fran you buy the equipment for 10 grand so you give them 10 grand they give you the thing but then after that there's no contract there's no licensing fee there's no royalty fee so it's very different than a traditional franchise all you do is you have to buy the ingredients from them and so the way it works is you buy the ingredients from they they have like I don't know distribution centers across the across the country they have like I don't know what is it like hundred something you know 16 Regional distribution centers 100 trucks that are delivering pizzas daily to out of each Center to um to do this and it's crushing in the south in rural areas really a lot of areas it's like the dollar store how the Dollar General or Dollar Tree really have thrived over the last decade and one of the reasons is like there's a whole bunch of places that are kind of stranded stranded Ed Land people don't build enough retail there and so you know the Dollar General becomes the spot it becomes like the store you can use it's like where you go and get a gallon of milk yeah exactly and so what these guys are doing is like there's a Hunt Brothers inside the gas station there might not be another restaurant for like 10 miles or there might be just very few options and so the Hunt Brothers becomes like you know the defacto restaurant Choice have you ever been to a town that's been like that yeah my buddy uh my best friend in college my buddy Trevor was from a place called Lander Wyoming and in and I was like I've never heard of Lander and he's like we got five traffic lights total yeah there's one street that has like stop you know stop lights and there's five of them and that's it we went there and it's the only time in my life I've ever been like yeah let's just drunk drive it's fine there's no cars here we literally got drunk and we drove and there's not a single car on the road because there's nobody in this town there's like nobody there's no human alive he would leave his car key in the car in the ignition would he just got go to a store he just come back out and like the car the key is already in the ignition dude a lot of times they'll leave their car on like when I go and visit my cousins in these areas they'll leave the car on he bought his car used and he was one day at a gas station and this giant Native American guy came up to him was like brother is this your car and he's like yeah it is and he's like hold on he goes back to his car he has a key he's like I used to have that car here's the key here's like an extra key that I've had for that car for a while it's a it's a crazy place so anyways there places like that where Hunt Brothers does really really well I thought this is a pretty genius model because what they did was they changed the footprint so in the same way that Five Hour Energy said let's not sell an energy drink in the fridge where we're competing against Red Bull and Monster let's get let's create a small shot size you know non-refrigerated skew that we could put right up at the front by the register they changed the footprint and because of that they were able to compete in a category because they became a category of one we're the only energy drink that's a shot size at the register and what Hunt Brothers is doing is they're like we're going to create a new categories forget dominoes forget Pizza Hut we're going to be the pizza that's in the gas stations and it's ironic when I was researching this I thought like you like oh this must be like isn't it gross dude people love this pizza they're like dude I they're like honestly it tastes better than the pizza I get at dominoes like the the the amount of um like love that this brand has it's almost become kind of one of those it's so bad it's good yeah it's like White Castle it's like White Castle where it's like it's just it's it's distinct so if you want it that's the thing that's going to solve that problem but it it doesn't feel good and just here's the math on this so a normal Hunt Brothers location might drive 10 grand a month of Revenue okay now remember they have no royalties they have no licensing fees they don't charge you a marketing sirch charge all they do is is they just charge you for the ingredients it's about 50% gross margin so that means on 10,000 per per location they're doing 5 grand a month per location in the ingredients 5 grand a month times 9,000 locations that they have is 45 million a month holy [ __ ] over 500 million a year and they're like dude this is great it's working they're like now we're going into military bases any Bas like anywhere where you you couldn't justify a full restaurant buildout um we can we can still survive like we're like the Cockroach of the industry we could we could survive in places other people can't so like you know a dominoes might make 700,000 a year in revenue and Hunt Brothers won't do that they'll do 120 or 150 or 200 so they do less Revenue but they're only 100 square feet or 56 square feet right it's like tiny and so they can just fit into places other people can't fit and I just think this is a it's an amazing business I was blown away by the scale and I think that there's actually many other businesses out there like the 5H Hour Energy example like Hunt Brothers that if you just change the form factor and you figure out how to do the the sort of like um the mutually I forgot what it is like there's like a type of parasite that's mutually beneficial it's like a like you know those fish that that live on top of whales they like we eat the thing off you but then we get all this other free stuff that's basically Hunt Brothers because if you're a gas station you put one of these in people will come in well guess what they don't just buy the slice they'll also buy a drink and then they'll buy this and whatever and they're like you know for for a long time gas stations basically subside on you know oil beer and cigarettes and now there's like a new one there's like a fourth Horseman Pizza Pizza is now here and so this like fresh food inside gas stations is has become like a big win-win for them and they've been around forever it looks like on Wikipedia they started selling pizza in 1962 changed their business in 1991 to the current iteration so they've been around for for a long ass time hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people spot have put together a business ideas database it's totally free if you just click the link in the description below you can go download a collection of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated and so uh what are you waiting for go download it it's free check it out it's in the description below all right back to the show they did a thing called Pepe I think it was like Pepe's wholesale food or some [ __ ] like that and they were doing kind of the same thing but without the front-facing brand so they were doing Wholesale Food wholesale food they you know selling food in wholesale to to other places so they had that kind of like the supply chain side of it but they didn't have the brand and so the brothers came together and they were like what if we made the consumer brand for for this and it's kind of like a B2B Toc model right we'll we'll give the brand to these gas station owners to these convenience stores and then we'll Supply the wholesale food like we already knew how to do what's even crazier is how weird things become culty so for example have you had canes can's chicken raisin canes or raisin sorry Raising Canes like it's okay it's fine but it just has like a crazy cult it just really weird how things kind of catch on like and I'm really fascinated by that because Raising Canes is fine I guess like it's really weird how they serve their stuff in styrofoam still and they just give you like a piece of bread um like that's just kind of odd and that's weird that it it's now a cult thing amongst young people and it's weird that this is also one of those things but it takes like 30 years because it's almost like you have to grow up knowing that it's a thing and then when you're growing up it's got to be like the nostalgic thing that you post online about you know what I'm saying it's not a game plan you can execute because it's not predictable and it kind of takes 2030 years to do it but when you do it you it's like it's like when you um it's like those people who you know get hot and they're in their 30s or something it's like what that's that's found money how'd you do that it's like these brands that they kind of just were like low stakes brands that survived but then 25 later years later they become trendy they're like we what the [ __ ] we're trendy now these mom jeans are cool now all right sweet I just had these because I liked them right um and that's basically what happens to these Brands is 25 years in they get this gust of wind that like Picks Them Up and makes them cool all of a sudden do you remember uh X XFL like the alternative NFL and they had crazy names in their jerseys like he hate me of course your XFL name is Sean found money Purry that's found money that's your that's your new nickname now the guy who got hot in his 30s all you're officially found money that's cool uh I didn't think that this would interest you and I like you more because it does I'm trying it's actually part of my my PR team was like Hey you need something relatable bro blue callar hey can we find a bluecar business for this guy to talk about here Sean uh you know we're hit we're tanking in the numbers because you didn't know who doly Parton was we got to re Revitalize we got to make it more relatable score is dropping I got my like my PR team over here like guys we need something let me tell you another thing that is uh probably even more random so listen to this so in 2013 this 29-year-old Swedish software engineer he posted on Reddit in a uh web development subreddit and he said I'm fiddling around with Google Maps and their new API and I made a small application I'd appreciate your feedback and suggestions and you click on the link and this it's this thing called geoguesser have you ever heard of geoguesser no all right this is going to blow your mind and so his original application was a small thing where you basically see a random street view of Google Maps oh I've seen this and you have to guess where you are and so they'll drop you off like you could do like a it depends how hard it is but you see a barn and you see like some grass and you see like a half of a road and then on Tik Tok there's these guys who are like this is rollal canas and then they like drop the pin and they're within like 20t of it it's like insane yeah and so like it could be easy so it could be like Time Square or the you know Athens or something like that but then it gets more complicated where you'll get dropped in someplace in Ghana and you have to look at the license plate and you're like the license plates are yellow I know that's a thing in Ghana and I also know that like these cars are this model of car they quit selling that in Ghana this might actually be this other location and so it's like a contest basically it's a game and it doesn't okay and so up until 2019 it's only doing okay it's um I believe it's a Swedish company and all the revenue is public and so 2019 the company did $467,000 in revenue and $61,000 in profit so he's five years into this business six years into the business or sorry three years into the business and it's doing okay and like barely a full-time Living Well the pandemic hits this thing explodes and so check listen to the revenue growth 2020 2 million 21 10 million 22 18 23 they did 21 million in revenue and 11 million in iida and the owner took out $9 million in dividends and so at this point this thing is called geog guesser so in 2019 2020 the pandemic hits people are sitting at home originally it's just monetizing with some advertising not doing that well he decides to put up a pay wall so you have to pay for certain games and his Revenue blows up and so does his traffic and so so at this point this guy geog guessers this website it has 50 employees and does and it has 50 million registered users and if you go to their traffic on similar web it's like 12 or 15 million a month totally and there are all these YouTubers and Tik tokers who are famous now because of it and so there's a YouTuber that I was looking at and I would watch his videos he has something like 1.3 million subscribers and in fact geog guessers has created a World Cup so it's a $100,000 in prizes and they do this like in-person event and these guys get dropped off in the most random locations and they and at sometimes within seconds they can guess where they are to within like a mile it's insane that this guy has built this company and it's just amazing that something so small and so silly has become such a serious business this is an amazing find kudos to you love that you found this I had no idea this was a business I had seen the games of the guys guessing this like there's there's one guy I mean I can't even describe what he looks like but he's like ingrained in my mind I see him all the time on Tik Tok who's just like he's like a god at this and it blows me away what I didn't realize was that there's actually a business for this I just assumed they're using Google Google Maps I didn't even know that there was a there's a website that does this and that I went to it I tried to sign up to play I want to play while we're doing this and it's a you cannot play you cannot do a single until you pay and the pricing is hilarious it's like $2.49 a month to play like five minutes like you get to play once a day but if you pay 289 a month like for an extra like 40 cents you can play unlimited and my brain's like screaming the value just for 40 more cents I get unlimited play and so uh yeah I want to do this I we should play a game of this online do you have an account we should we should play one no I I didn't I didn't sign up but I should the guy the guy's YouTube who you're thinking about on Tik Tok I think his name is rainbolt and I think he has over a million subscribers on YouTube and his views are huge and so and he's not the only one there's tons of these guys doing this and it's really actually wildly exciting to watch it's very strange dude we should sponsor this there's not many things I think we should sponsor there's not many places where I want to be a big fish in the smallest of ponds but if there's one it's this nerd Olympics of geoguesser to be able to go and sponsor this thing for like you know 1999 get get to my first fing Banner somewhere it's awesome right we are we are the official podcast of geog is what I would like to be it's really cool uh what these guys have done and the cool part is is that just like uh in the UK so in the UK there's a website called company's house where you uh if you're a company that does I think 10 million in Revenue you have to display your reports or your financials uh I guess in Switzerland or wait is he Swedish I think he's Swedish sorry in Sweden you have to do the same and so it was actually a little bit challenging to find these numbers because I've got to do all the translations but uh you can actually see all of their numbers uh for their revenue and things like that and so you can go back and track their growth it's really fascinating I'm surprised I mean I'm surprised at many things I'm surprised this things doing 20 million a year at Revenue I'm also surprised that it's only 50% margin what do you think what are this guy's costs what what is happening here I don't know how much do hosting cost even would know you you had one of these sites not $10 million like so I'm going to get this brother in AWS plan like what's going on yeah I don't know uh 50 employees cost $5 million maybe or yeah why does you have 50 employees what are they doing I don't know man you got to look at them look him up on LinkedIn but I know that he but on his if you go to the geoguesser career page they like list all their people I don't know I think they they have a bunch of uh advertising stuff so I think they have an ad sales team because if you go to their like employee list it's like developers of course but then like account managers things like that so uh Google increased their Maps API costs 14x so it went from a dollar to $14 per thousand API calls so that's got to be that's got to be why and that's why he uh put the pay uh paywall in because he's like ah Google's forcing me and by the way five years ago so he puts the pay wall up here's a post on the subreddit for R geoguesser title why the pay wall is the worst idea ever it says so first of all I understand that Google increased its um API fees by this and I understand that Geer needs to make money however I don't understand why all of us sudden there's a pay wall I can't do I can't play it all every single map every single thing is is this why do a pay wall do more ads do you seriously think users are going to pay a subscription fee I think 90% are going to leave and never come back this move was in no way intelligent especially because geoguesser is not the type of game you're going to completely talk you're going to keep playing and keep talking about um the pay wall is a is a great way to make sure nobody ever plays your game again so congratulations un ruining what you had spent years building and your best achievement it is now your worst flop ever five years ago well I would say that uh the owner's new uh the O the broker of the owner's new uh Penthouse overlooking Stockholm really disagrees that that was a flop sorry I can't hear you from the 19th Floor Penthouse yeah yeah dude um this is amazing and uh this is like the you know internet dork version of like a Revenge bot when you get this when you get this type of hater comment and then you're you know you're proven absolutely correct uh this is this is Revenge yeah he the found money award uh I don't know if I used that correctly but we'll just assume I did still workshopping it uh yeah so anyway pretty pretty sick right geog guesser what do you got right I got a Qui I got a quick one for you so this is my side hustle of the week it's not quite a blue collar side hustle it's actually a white collar side hustle so this is a um you know this is a a um ivy league side hustle so saw this story the other day that Alex e I don't know how you say the last name uh who is a sophomore at Brown University so shout out to Alex coolest sophomore at Brown uh this person is basically flipping you know high-end restaurant reservations so the story was basically like the guys basically created a ton of accounts on resi on Open Table calls in calls in using fake voices fake names and he's getting uh uh reservations at Carbone and all these cool New York restaurants like the hottest of the hot places gets a months in advance and he's flips it for $750 or I got a restaurant I got a reservation at Carbone and he flips it for $1,500 and he says that in the last year he's made $70,000 flipping restaurant reservation 70 grand as a side hustle doing this and his his screen name on appointment appointment Trader is glorious seed 75 oh my God which I know you were thinking about for baby names and it was your second choice but but glorious seed is just a phenomenal name I'm a big fan of this kid that's definitely was the nickname when she was in her B uh in her mother's stomach my Gloria seed um the quote I love was this Alex said it's like some people play Candy Crush on their phone I play dinner reservations was this in like was this in like the New Yorker where was this yeah it was in the New Yorker but it was like buried halfway through the story so the story to me was wow some sophomore is making 70 grand flipping high-end res restaurant reservations that's awesome but the New York article was like like 15 pages long and it was all about like how restaurants are really busy now it's like who is the editor of this like you buried the viral story of this uh you know nine pages in this is ridiculous that's an insane what do you think about that I mean so I think someone doing that I think they're going to be incredibly successful I think this will get shut down as he shouldn't have talk to the New Yorker yeah exactly what are you doing oh you the only the only explanation that would make me respect the more is if this doesn't actually work anymore and then they're like all right well let me just go get some free PR as my like backend bonus out of this because like the Arbitrage is going away or it's not working as well anymore yeah I had like two crazy months during the pandemic or after the pandemic you know stopped and everyone wanted to go to these restaurants and my run rate was 70 grand but let me just feed this to the New Yorker and get some free press that would be a cool story if this was actually working really well and you went to the New Yorker to go talk about this silly move don't need to do that uh and yeah I'm like you this is actually a waste of tal a waste of time and talent but it does show me that you've got talent and congratulations you will be successful but you're kind of wasting yourself right now it's not a waste for uh a 20-year-old uh it's it's a it's a worthy it's a worthy cause if you're a sophomore in college but yeah like this like it'll be done it's probably already dead he probably already got Gloria seed probably is already banned from the uh from that website dude when I was a sophomore in college my friends and I had a genius idea to try to win the McDonald's Monopoly game and unlike the movies where the guy who actually did it he like figured out how to win we just tried to brute force it you know how he figured out how to win right he just at the he worked he worked at the place that made the pieces so I would have respected myself more if I had contacted the the place that made the pieces and been like hey man I'll give you a th bucks if you tell me where where Boardwalk is instead we were just like hey we're just going to dig through dumpsters and go go get the go get the pieces that people throw out and see if we can win and I I ended up making like three grand that that year wait did you really yeah we like found some we like won something it was like worth like probably a couple thousand dollars but I wasted like a semester of brain power of like extracurricular brain power doing this and I thought I was winning and uh you know what's it's like winning a carnival game it's like I won the bear it's like dude you spent $ winning that bear do you know you could have just bought the bear for six six bucks right that's basically how I treated my college career a bunch of you know really dumb really dumb side side hustle ideas that kind of panned out but if I had just done like something useful with my time I would have made you know 10 times more in the long run did you really I mean winning $1,000 on that thing is kind of like a rush have you ever won the lottery or like any type of scratch off I've won like Raffles I've won like poker tournaments I think on scratchers I've never had a big win uh I've played a lot of scratchers I probably I probably down a couple thousand bucks Lifetime on scratchers as my guess wait do you really you still buy them not anymore because my wife looks down on me uh for doing it but there was like a three-year period of my life where like if I saw a scratcher uh you know I'm buying I have not bought a scratch off thing or a lottery ticket in my entire life that lines up you're the same guy who sold his company and then put it all in his like a CD and never touched it congratulations I I've been missing out so I'm a pretty degenerate Gambler and I spent I have I have a lot of you know like anyone who's a degenerate about anything you have stories that are it sounds like you're rock bottom and you're like bro that's just scratching the surface of what I've done uh like you know I've gone on riverboats and I've you know overdrawn my account and I've you know I've done really dumb stuff uh when I was in my early 20s gambling so I I love gambling and if you take me to a casino I'm I'm a happy I'm happy as a clam but I went with with my mentor my investor who's a billionaire I went with with my my my my mentor Michael Burch and we go to Vegas for like a conference or for for a meeting we're gonna go meet ruer Murdoch actually and so we're there for this big me big meeting and we're staying at the win I think and we go you know we go down to the to the floor and any degenerate knows like there's a certain feeling that comes over your body when you walk the floor of a casino when you enter the casino it's like something about the air The Sounds it like physiologically does something in my body for sure and some like Michael you want to play I'm like let's uh let's find a t we got you know a couple hours before this thing let's uh let's Gamble and I'm just like I want to gamble but I'm also you know I'm trying to hang out with him and I'm trying to be cool and whatever and you're only like 26 or 27 I'm 25 years old maybe he's 40 or something like that 4 yeah 45 I don't know how old he is uh and he's like you know a thousand time whatever 10,000 times wealthier than me and smarter than me he he's everything better than me and so that became very apparent because he's like I was like do you gamble and he's like not really and I was like oh why like you know you don't like it or whatever he's like why would I gamble um like you know the house has an edge right and I'm so I have these chips in my hand and I just put them back in my pocket and I really haven't gambled since because I was like oh so the rich successful guy I admire just pointed he's like yeah like this is a losing game why would I play a losing game and just him saying that you know my mom has told me to stop gam like I've had friends been like yo you should you know why don't you just not do it and nothing has ever sunk in except for this guy just being like why would I play house has an edge I thought you were going to like uh like right when you walk into the casino you turn your hat backwards and you like untuck your shirt and you're like pok's here I have a different dialect I'm like prison Mike the office or date Mike yeah like date Mike nice to meet me yeah I thought you were GNA just like changee like thanks for holding my money and just started saying that to people um speaking of money we got to get a shout out to one of our sponsors beehive yeah what's not a gamble starting a newsletter on beehive you know what's not a gamble putting your content out there for the world of love and you know who's making money instead of you know pissing it away Tyler dank the CEO of bive who just raised a crazy amount of money $33 million uh announced yesterday and then he opened up some Community round he's like oh by the way like if you want to invest beehive and you missed out on the fun and he just posted in two hours they cost a million dollars of community M ra this guy created amazing like PR Halo you know he's creating a cult of Believers it's pretty impressive to see what he's doing and I think I'm one of the Believers I had the opportunity to invest in this when they first started and I passed I don't remember what the valuation was what was it 10 it was under 10 I think we both passed under 10 I realized my sins and I came and I said father forgive me let me invest after I started using the product and then I was like I was like I was using the product I still really wasn't fully convinced cuz like I don't know how big this Market is how big is newsletters is this too Niche and then he they kept shipping updates so fast and building features so well I was like okay I've learned enough times in my career like just don't bet on like a Workhorse founder and a team that ships this fast for a product you love and you use just like go if that if those boxes are checked just invest it's okay you might be surprised on the upside with the market which it seems like I guess is the case here because they've they've really taken off um but I want I normally do not sell I have a policy actually I think think there should be an official MFM policy which is we do not celebrate fundraising news fundraising is not to be celebrated I mean think about what you're saying when you celebrate fundraising it's either a combination of congratulations now the game is starting like you don't get cheered for to start the game you get cheered when you win the second thing is it's congratulations you gave up a piece of your company right like you shouldn't really celebrate fundraising too much I thought this was an ad for them where we're supposed to make them look cool but here's why I like it cuz he said something he had a great quote if there I'm a sucker for one thing it's a great quote and he said like you know in his slack to his team he's like all right guys money's in the bank but the rents still due that's so good I don't even know fully what that means but that sounds like some Mafia [ __ ] and I dig it uh which is some version of like cool we got all the funding but like we still got like this doesn't mean anything we still got to pay the rent we got to put in the work and actually deliver and so I like that line that the only reason I'm willing to talk about the fundraising because he said the rents still due and I think the rents still do is just like a a a great great slogan he also had in the tech cren article he goes look we're only two years into this and we have a billion emails going out and like that line does in itself isn't a lot but the fact that this guy is this I don't like using the word cocky because that's negative but he's so confident I love I love what he has and I uh I don't know what the valuation was for this maybe it was probably north of $100 million so he's right I'm wrong I lost on that one so kudos to beehive and if you want to start a newsletter beehive with two eyes they still need to change their name though beehive.org start hanging out and he pulls out a blanket that he goes yeah I keep a a picnic blanket in my bag at all times and he like lays it out I'm like all right cool and then he goes hey do you want to throw the frisbee I always keep a frisbee on me and he has a Frisbee and then I was like I guess and he go and we get done with that and he goes hey do you want to fly a kite I always have a kite on me and so he pulls out a kite hey you want a kiss I got lips yeah that's the next one and I'm like this is the weirdest guy I've ever met and then I get to know him over the years and I realize it's totally genuine you're just a weird guy and this is act so fast forward a few years later Nick has written a book called The two-hour cocktail party he's by the way all none of this is an ad we just we admire this guy's weirdness he lets his freak flag fly we dig that and he just did something interesting which is what we're about to get to yeah and so he uh starts getting a little popular on the internet and he tweets something out last week here's the Tweet I'll read it verbatim he goes I want to go on a blind date and I want to go to Tokyo next weekend here's the qualifications if you're a woman with a passport who likes Sushi and Japanese food and you could ride a bike in a big city let's go and I'll pay for everything but in return you have to film stupid videos of me for my socials uh and then he puts out an application where you could sign up on like a Google doc so I I called them do you know how many applications he got to this four 400 women applied to go with him and he sorts through all the the listings and he sends me like his top five and his top 10 and he does calls with them to figure out if it's what he says a culture fit he's like I I want to see if it's basically a job interview he's like I want to see if this is a culture fit and so this post that he writes about or writes on Twitter it gets something like two million views the original the original tweet and people are so bought in now fast forward a few days ago he's on the date he picks the girl up until recently he never showed the woman but he is tweeting out and documenting the whole thing saying I just picked up flowers for her I'm about to go pick her up at the airport I've scheduled a Ramen dinner for us and then we're going to do this this and this I'm nervous and he's like explaining his inner dialogue publicly each tweet is getting hundreds of thousands or millions of views and he's saying exactly what's going on eventually he shares her face and they look like they're having a blast and I talk to him and people are reaching out to him from all over Japan and like he shares he goes we just got this amazing dinner reservation because this man owns this restaurant who's hosting us or we're going to host a Meetup with all the people who are following along and the date goes so well they've extended the date so right now it's Wednesday I believe they're still there it was only supposed to be a couple days they're five or six days in he has Netflix and Amazon reaching out to him about a show for this it's just like one of the most viral things that I've seen about such a weird topic and people are so bought in I've got so many people messaging me saying are you following what Nick just did Nick just shared that the date's going well I'm so invested into this that's exactly it I so invested into this I love this on so many levels the main thing is just I love that Nick's just being himself and I love that he like there's there's many ways to be rich we've talked about this before you could be rich with money you could be rich with time you could be rich with friends Nick's life is Rich with fun and adventure and I think that that is something that that's why this is resonating because I think there's a deep part of a lot of us that is like am I making the most of my time on this little blueberry right like you know am I am I am I making the most out of my time in life and I think what Nick has done with this Tokyo date to me it's not about dating it's not about anything it's this guy is like living he's had he's having an adventure he's having fun and we want to go along for the ride and so I think we should actually go tweet by tweet with this thing dive deep for anybody who's not following this so tweet tweet one so all right so tweet one is he goes I want to do a blind date in Tokyo next weekend you read that out out he puts a Google doc let's read the Google Doc you open up the Google Doc and it says Nick Ray Tokyo blind date do you like sushi do you like exploring new cities do you like blonde guys with glasses come if so come to Tokyo for a blind date next weekend it'll be fun possible itinerary you arrive April 25th you leave April 28th it's now May 1st they're still going it's like that you know when you play spin the bottle and they got you know Seven Minutes in Heaven it's been 11 minutes what is going on in this closet over there I must know so he says if You' never been to Tokyo we're going to do some touristy stuff blah blah blah we're going to go to Shinjuku at night go to some hot springs team lab tea tastings this park each day we'll try two or three restaurants maybe four we'll walk a lot shop eat and explore why I'm doing this I went to Tokyo last summer and it was excellent but after a few days I wish that I had a fun cute friend traveling with me just to say that out loud I mean I'm not even saying that and even a part of me you know clenched up but I had to read that those words okay I just wish I had a fun cute friend traveling with me all right so I wanted to talk and share stories with and also film me for my dumb Instagram reals uh Logistics I'll get you a flight I'll get you a hotel room is this crazy I guess but it also sounds fun yes exactly that's The Sweet Spot Of Life um feel free to reference check me here here apply blah blah blah and so you had to email him to apply so you said he had how much 400 women apply 400 which let's just take a moment a moment to admire that yeah so um you can go on a dating app as a guy and normally it's you send 400 messages to get one back he sent one message out and got 400 women coming inbound yeah work smarter not harder my friends all right so so that's sweet one he also tweeted out the conversion rate between the Japanese Yen and the US dollar and he was like all of you people thought I was going to be spending a lot turns out it just turned in my favor and he's like it's like tweeting out like the the universe is conspiring to help Nick Gray with this date so he's giving updates kind of bypl so he's like I'm flying out here's what I'm going to do he's like here's the agenda he's like she's uh you know I'm I'm in on my way to the airport she's on her way to the airport I'm G to pick her up I'm gonna get flowers he does a poll on Twitter should I bring flowers yes bring the flowers no Chill Vibes guess which one won the poll which one 55% bring flowers 45% too too try Hardy dude 45% of twitters are are losers that's an easy he's promoting his blog he's like by the way I'm traveling here's my travel pack of must halves he's got refreshed tears he's got his eye mask he's got like some I don't know some tape I don't know why he's bringing tape uh things are getting a little crazy here he's got a toothbrush okay so he's going step by step as to how he's going to do this okay so now he picks her up and he never shows her face he only shows like like her hands accepting the flowers or the back of her head as she's taking a picture in awe of the Tokyo Skyline so let's just read here he's at the airport he goes I pick he's like my blind date update so he goes waiting for someone at the airport is humbling you're scanning hundreds of people's faces trying to find the one person who you've never met before each passing person ISS no not her not her no not her until I see her come out I pump my fist in the air and call her name she runs over and we sort of half hug we look at each other square up and full smile I I think we're both thinking the same thing wow you are real she might have been think something else but I think that's hilarious at least I have a feeling deep in my stomach that is yes she is real that's a relief I knew she'd be real but you never know what what are people on the in the internet saying about us she asked me I say it's 90% hype and 10% worry that you're going to cut out my kidneys I like those odds she says damn full romcom we're going full romcom this is great um I sent her on a side quest while I handled the train tickets to get us back to downtown Tokyo we board the train to start talking conversation comes easily a Ramen tour starts in two hours the comments blow up people are are fully in fully in subscriptions on notifications on I got to do this so then he talks about I I booked a Ramen tour for two reasons if it was awkward for us to talk then somebody else would be leading the conversation it's the tour guide and it would keep her awake till 9 P p.m. through the jet lag so we meet we do this we do that we tell our tour guide that we're on a blind date he misunderstood us or we must have misdated us he he said but you said you just flew in how did you meet I explain what's going on with the date the guide is confused but he likes it and he likes us she and I share a glance and smile the ramen is good and I like her end of chapter dude he's doing great right in this 50 Shades of Nick Gray is actually the name of this date dude this is this is incredible so he's going and I love that there was there was one there he was talking about he was just like honestly I'm exhausted I kind of over plan like my nervous energy around this made me like schedule too many things I'm feeling exhausted I just said good night and like um you know honestly I'm just I'm just totally totally pooped out tomorrow I'm going to act a little bit differently I'm just going to settle in a little bit and every day step by step um has just been thrilling he did a Meetup so he's like I'm hosting a Tokyo Meetup for us anybody who's following the blind date and then he posts a picture in the park and there's like 20 people there he's holding his book it's his date him and 20 random people in Tokyo who are like fully invested this date that came for a Meetup dude so listen to this so uh on one of the two hours ago he posted it's late I'm always late we are running through the side streets of Tokyo most upscale neighborhood to make her dinner reservation she's wearing eyeliner and I have on my least wrinkled shirt it'll be our last big meal together and I want to make it special in two hours we'll cry over a plate of Kobe beef I get a message I like to treat you and your date to a fancy dinner in Tokyo I love the stories you share and I'll pay for everything please enjoy but what's the catch the foreign man I don't know has a travel company that does reservations nice nice reservations are hard to find in Tokyo the catches that will like it and we share I grab her hand and I risk a jwalk to Sprint us towards the skyscraper you have the Royal option is the only thing the waiter says before a train or a train of lobster shrimp and beef is sent our way we eat and joke about how ridiculous the amount of food is and we have a sense of excitement and Dread about how this meal will play out and it's a picture of this massive amount of food overlooking Tokyo and he's just writing this these almost poetic posts the entire time as he goes um it's this is just great this is great and I texted him and I'm not going to blow his story but uh I think they like each other uh and he said that he said that he'll come on the Pod he said he goes I don't know if I want to and I go okay no pressure and then he replies back he goes actually you guys promoted me for a long time I'll come on and we'll talk about it and so he's gonna come on but uh it seems they like each other I'm so in uh I'm so in my first marriage let's go I I I've been waiting for an opportunity to turn our whole podcast into a dating show and I think the time has finally come Nick you're the man this is a reminder to everybody step up your adventure do do something fun do something a little bit out of the box and good things happen in your life I I really do believe that he created a situation to get lucky that cool things would happen that that you know whether this date works out or not is sort of irrelevant he's gonna have a great adventure a great story to tell and he he opened up the door to where maybe maybe lady life can walk in what if he marries this woman I don't I don't know if my little heart can take it if he Mar I only got two ventricles brother that would fill it up too much I uh I had a person come to my house one time and they were bringing their new girlfriend and I find out that they're staying at my they stayed at my house for five nights I found out on the third night that this is a blind date in the first time that they met and they got married uh a few weeks ago that's great um all right do we have anything else I got a little little bit of uh I have one one sort of Life advice type thing I liked let me hear so this is not new actually we were we did a podcast with Scott Galloway which maybe it's come out by the time this comes out I don't know exactly and Scott said a bunch of things he talked about his business he talks about his money but he said one thing in the middle that has stuck with me days later like I can't I honestly can't really remember all the bunch of the stuff he said about money but this one little phrase stuck with me and I kind of want to give it some extra shine you know in the we talked about don't bury the lead to me this was actually the lead and we had talked to him about when he was younger and he was going he's pretty open about going through tough times he talks about when he went through a divorce he talks about when he you know hadn't made it yet he talks about his insecurities and he said something which was like he goes you got to keep your sales up and I was like kept your sales up what did you mean by that keep your sales up he's like you know like even when things were going poorly I um I didn't let it I didn't let things go poorly um even if I felt down I didn't take actions that were down he's like so even when things weren't going my way I I got down but I didn't stay down he goes I kept my S up so that he's like you know I started eating right I cleaned up my room I would make sure every day I would go out and I would talk to people and um you know he's like I just did little things I would try to be kind and try to be generous to somebody that day even though I was feeling kind of low and I felt like things weren't going the right way I started taking actions you know I kept my sales up so that that when the next gust of wind came I would be ready and that's what happened the wind came and I was ready because I had my sales up and I just thought that was a beautiful life metaphor and just a a great philosophy to have which is like you got to keep your sales up because the things that happen that are good in your life are not fully you know your your doing they're not your creation there's tons of market conditions and luck and um you know contributions from other people that help you out that come your way that's the wind and you can't control the wind but the thing you can control is having your sales up so that when the win comes you actually get a benefit from it like if you're in such a lull or in such a low point or you're in such a funk that even when the wind comes you weren't ready for it it passed you by now that's that's on you and so I just love that metaphor that philosophy of life and I wanted to kind of bring some attention to it what do you think about that it was good to hear from him about it because he had a lot of first of all he was a late bloomer in terms of traditional success so he told the story about how he had a bunch of companies that actually were doing good but he lost them he got fired from them he told a story about how he didn't have a relationship with his father and his single mother there was it was a hard upbringing he got divorced uh and he had his first kid I think when he was 40 or something like that a little bit later in life and he was like I have to make money to provide for this kid I can't just be jerking off like I've been messing around a little bit too much and it was good to hear that advice from him because I admire him and he was sort of a late bloomer and so I know that he experienced hardship and he actually is living this life of of of keeping your sales up and so that's why it was particularly special it was better to hear that from him this versus some like 28-year-old you know what I mean yeah uh yeah if you see like a 24y old on Tik Tok talking about this like you have the right idea you just don't have the scars to prove it and I thought Scott has the scars to prove it and I just love the phrasing you know even when I was down I didn't stay down that's so powerful dude you know you're allowed to go down but you you're not allowed to stay down and also like a lot of these little things I I never had the words to explain it but it resonated with me because like you know I'll do things where you know if I'm feeling a certain way I'm be like all right I'm making my bed this morning or [ __ ] it I'm going for a run I don't even like running I suck at running but I'm going for a run I'm gonna run till I cramp and it's like all right I'm gonna run till I cramp it's like why do those things on the surface making your bed seems like a nothing action it's like dude making your bed's not going to help you you know go get that girl or not going to help you you know recover from this breakup or go get the job or go get whatever help turn your business around but like anybody who's actually done it knows that actually those things are linked you don't know how they're linked and this phrase to me is a great way to link them it's like you I'm not just making my bed I'm getting my sales up today and all of these little actions I'm taking I'm getting my sales up and I now I kind of like at the end I can connect the dots of like what were all those actions and little habits that like instinctively in my gut I knew were the right thing to do but I didn't really couldn't have logicked and told you why that matters now I know why it matters it's because that's getting your sales up so that now that when the wi comes you're ready there's this awesome video that's not very popular but it like it's so good it's uh the guy from SNL I think his name is Tom Bennett he made this no dude it's a it's a essay it was a essay for it was a Blog first and then they turned it into actually they turned it into a movie this wa we really a blog post became movie oh dude it's one of the best blog posts ever it's one of the the video is so good okay so this this guy Aaron is the guy who wrote it he go it's called how to lose weight in four easy steps yeah and he goes I spent the last past year losing 80 pounds and getting in in shape a lot of people asked me how I did it specifics on my diet how many times I worked out so I thought I'd just answer all my questions here it's just four easy steps ready here we go number one no beer this probably one you've heard of before but every time you drink a beer it's like eating seven slices of bread that's a lot of bread number two portion control is especially true when you go to restaurants and your meal comes cut in half and ask the ask the waiter right away for a takeout container so you can save the second half for later number three have your heart broken and not just broken shattered into bit itsy bitsy tiny little pieces by a girl who never loved you and never will and then the rest of the post is basically about the Heartbreak and I was like wow I remember reading that intro and I [ __ ] cleared my calendar I was like I am going to sink into this blog post this whoever wrote this this is genius level writing and I loved it and the whole step three is like get your heartbroken and then it's like start going for walks to feel better and so you start going to the gym and you previously thought that gym rats were a bunch of Bros and now you realize that they're your family and you start making puddles and you start eating chicken and more chicken and you make more puddles and you repeat every day and then suddenly let's read some of this is beautiful let's just read some so B girl who never loved you and never will join the gym at your work start going to the gym regularly even though you don't know much about exercise and you're way too weak to do anything except for live live 5 pound weights and do the elliptical machines with the old people do it until your sweat makes a puddle on the floor then go home go to bed early and do it again the next day and again and again listen to stories of your ex-girlfriend [ __ ] around with gross and terrible people stories from your friends who think they they're doing you a favor go to the gym and make more puddles of sweat uh buy buy books learn about muscle groups how they work together start eating healthy start start planning meals try to forget her more puddles and it just keeps going and keeps going make puddle after puddle and eat single chicken breast and work and sleep and the weather gets warm and the weather gets cold and all you know is Taylor Swift songs by heart and the only thing that exists in the entire universe is you and the gym and there's a different sort of happiness it comes at night when you're the last person in the gym and it's you and the girl who does weird leg exercises you end up walking walking out at the same time her name is Melissa she works at the building next to you she's worked there for two years she asks you for dinner on Friday promising it'll be healthy the leg exercises she's doing by the way are called pivoting curtsy lunges uh and then it goes into the you know the love story it ends with step four no sugar yeah no fruit juice yeah no juice one of the best posts I've watched that I remember when I first watch I you get te eyed it's uh because it's it was I guess it was a blog post first I didn't know that and then it was a YouTube video and then I guess a whole movie The YouTube the YouTube video it gets me teed and it gets me so motivated whenever I watch this so that's a little a little bit similar to Scott Galloway's your sales up this was just like the most positive episode we've ever done yeah positivity baby that's it that's the Pod all right we have a big announcement possibly the biggest announcement of the Year from us so pay attention turn the headphones up we are doing a challenge called my first muscle instead of my first million this is my first muscle it is a fitness challenge that we're doing we want everybody to get involved with it Sam tell them how it works and why we're doing it all right so here's what it is summer's coming up we got this thing called the Pod bod we've been sitting here I think we're on 650th episodes or so we want to get fit so it's a challenge it's a race actually it's a 100 push-ups 100 squats 100 burpees 100 times 100 times 100 that's your first million and it's hopefully going to be your first million muscle so here's what what you're going to do you can do any order you could start with burpees you could start with squats it doesn't matter but when you do a burpee you got to go nips to the floor your chest has to touch the floor and then you hop up and when you jump up do the top top of the Burpee your feet need to leave the ground and you should film yourself doing it and when you film yourself doing it you have to time yourself too and then you have to share the video with us at my first mil pod on Twitter exactly or you can tag me in Sam directly either way so just to summarize turn a timer on uh best case scenario film it to but at least turn the timer on and do it you have to you have as much time as you need to complete 100 push-ups 100 air squats so no wait and then 100 burpees you can mix it up and you can do them in whatever sets of five or 10 or however you want to mix it up you just got to get it done that's the challenge you've heard of 75 hard you've uh you've heard of the

and so I got a I got a that was just V1 that's okay just I was a nibble it was a Costco sample of it I just need to now iterate and get better there's two things here the first is just doing it so I

with this you brought this idea from uh Jesse itler about the misogi a hard physical challenge that you do something that that makes you a little bit scared that pushes you past your limits it's good to do these and instead of having everybody come up with the misogi we want to give the community one that we can all kind of share all do together and I don't care if you're out of shape um don't let that be the reason you don't do this uh you know if you can do push-ups on your knees do push-ups on your knees all right you might not win the prize but get it done you'll be proud of yourself when

for the prizes you got to do it legit and you got to have a video camera when you're doing it otherwise we don't know if you're uh you know this is not the gentleman's agreement you got to actually

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I want to leave with one thing which is Naval you're friends with nval do you have any stories about Naval anything that you noticed early on or the sort of the insightfulness that that he has it's actually the first time I met Nal I went into a coffee shop in the mission in San Francisco and I ordered a coffee and I'm waiting at the counter and there's this very attractive girl standing next to me and she's very friendly and she smiles and I start talking to her and I'm chatting her up hitting on her hoping to ask her for her number and take her out and maybe dinner maybe drink who knows and then I see Nal walk up with this huge grin on his face and he's like I see him met my girlfriend and I was like oh damn and he's like nval and he just had this huge grin on his face you know who you were or he was just like I don't think I'm not sure I don't think so didn't lose his cool was just like wow what a good way to like totally calm and then we then we started talking and like hit it off and you know that was probably God knows when I was I don't know 2008 or something you're like a man crush actually move out of the way face palm yeah uh and I I just I admire Nal for his ability to speak truth and ask uncomfortable questions and is less inclined to the type of people pleasing that I'd say many people are predisposed to myself included like there are definitely times when I'm maybe too polite or or tell White Lies to make people feel good or what like normal human social lubrication right nothing major but it's like you know if my girlfriend's put on a few pounds she's like do I look fat I'm like no I'm not going to say yeah you look really fat not to say that Nal would say that but he's Direct in a way that cuts through the noise and is very refreshing to me have you been able to uh pick up or uh learn anything from them in in terms of tactical stuff on the investing side or tons of stuff on the investing side I mean uh I think the site was way back in the day Venture hacks oh yeah that he and nivy co-authored that was basically the kind of Wikipedia Bible of Angel Investing and Advising for and inside game on venture capital I mean Naval is Jedi level when it comes to early stage investing very technical he just ends up in every deal you would ever want to be in it's it's the sort of you know pinky in the brain meets like forced Gump meets you know sidarta you're just like how is he in every cap table right he's incredibly skilled as an angel investor he's very curious he's very interested and it's not at all limited to business so if it's David Deutsch or other thinkers he introduces me to a lot of eclectic thinkers from different disciplines and his his exploration is is certainly not limited as it is with a lot of people to say the sport of business or Finance or investing a lot of people are one-trick ponies that way he is not a onetick pony I admire that as well I have a funny and of all story which is I have a buddy who was doing some like when Facebook launched its platform my buddy made an app it was like one of the silly apps I don't remember back then it was like people throwing sheep at each other and stuff like that he was doing one of the like silly apps but it was clear that oh Facebook platform that's like an opportunity and so smart Silicon Valley people were interested my friend's sitting in Georgia and naval's in San Francisco and he gets an email from Naval basically you know found the contact us page or whatever and was like hey I'd love to meet with you sometime talk about your app I'm a venture capitalist here in in San Francisco friend doesn't know who Dev all is doesn't know what venture capital is but okay sounds interesting he's oh you know like sure I'm open to that next email is a plane ticket like here's a plane ticket goes out tomorrow so friend's like okay go gets on a plane flies out here meets theal meets him in his office he's like he asked me questions for like 30 minutes and he's like I had no idea what the right answer should have been but I'm saying whatever's this my honest answers the was like hold on goes into the other room comes back has printed out like a term sheet and says like here uh you know I'll give you whatever half a million bucks or something whatever it is like some amount of money for you know some percentage of your company and my friend who's like 23 or something like that is just like I don't know who this Indian guy is I don't know what the deal I don't know any of the words on this page my app is stupid I don't know why he wants to invest in it uh I don't really understand this so he's like I just don't feel comfortable right now and he's like and Nal at the time was like I think Facebook is going to be you know huge I think it's going to be the platform where you do lots of things you're not just going to talk to friends on there you're going to be able to do XYZ that's my thesis that's why I want to invest in this because my friend was like honestly this is a stupid idea why you this is not a business and so he gave him that that pitch my friend was like wow that sounds awesome I didn't even realize all that I had stumbled into this gold mine potentially so he's like listen man I just uh I don't understand what this thing is I just need to think about and I like no problem by the way that same week he meets Keith R boy Max Lev and a bunch of other people who are ALS giving him the same pitch but in different flavors like Keith R boy was like you should come work for us he's like I don't want a job he's like see all those people right there all those programmers they're going to put you out of business like tomorrow and he was like this is a stupid app it's not a business to do it waste your time doing this you're going to put me out of business that isn't a business I live in my mom's bedroom what are you talking about and so he goes you know the great thing about Nal though is that like 15 years later now my friend's very a very successful Tech entrepreneur he's like I actually dug up that old term sheet it was so fair he could have taken advantage of me and I didn't know anything and he's like it was incredibly founder friendly and fair that told me a lot about Naval that at that time when a lot of people were in the Heat of the Moment about this kind of gold rush in that Facebook app days and I was clearly a novice he operated with very high integrity and I thought that said a lot about him yeah that matches with my experience I've always seen that in Nal yeah for sure right on well Tim thanks for doing this man I really I really appreciate it yeah my pleasure man thanks for taking the time mission accomplish for I hope [Music]

Sam this the secret to my success right here a plain gray t-shirt free shout out to Kohl's these is this is the Kohl's super soft tea I wear a new shirt basically every day um which feels phenomenal you remember the TV show cribs where Master P would only wear a pair of Air Force Ones one time what do you think my last name stands for I am masterp myself [Music] all right I have a uh an idea for you so would you like to hear billion dooll Healthcare idea actually Healthcare is the wrong word Healthcare actually when people tell me Healthcare ideas I just kind of tune out and run away I'm like ah isn't that like super complicated hard and impossible let me just let me just ignore this completely um but I think you'll like this one so have you ever done an Executive Health checkup not yet but Nick Huber's convincing me that I should do it okay so these things are pretty interesting have you done one I've never done one I've uh I've tried I've basically gone through the process of booking and and there was like that's kind of the point they didn't have a lot of availability yeah so a long wait list oh I got to travel to Arizona to do this like gez like if this was just here in the Bay Area I would have done it yesterday but it's not well that's the idea let's open one of these up in the Bay Area in LA and in New York okay so what are these so an Executive Health checkup is basically something that CEOs High net worth individuals will do where they basically pay somewhere between five and $10,000 usually to go for a one or two day visit to a medical center and you do a battery of tests and just think of it like the Four Seasons meets a doctor's checkup and so you go and it's kind of this executive VIP treatment where you go and they just put you through a bunch of tests all in one day which normally if you try to do in your traditional thing like first of all your normal doctors is going to be like why do you need this test you don't have it do are you having heart issues it's like no I just want to like proactively measure my like heart health every year and like make sure I'm on top of that um and so you most doctors won't recommend these you know normally secondly if you even if you did you wouldn't get all your appointments done in a day just like one day knock it all out take months it be spread out it take forever um and each one you're like kind of waiting in line you don't have the uh the TSA you know pre-check to be able to just go through and do this so this is our actually better analogies actually fly private and a lot of times they would talk to each other right it's not comprehensive yeah okay so why is this an interesting business idea so the Mayo Clinic which is probably the leader in doing this is estimated to do over a hundred million a year on just their Executive Health checkup service right so that's basically 17,000 the last number they publicly released was 177,000 patients did it in 2015 um and you basically got to fly they have four locations or Arizona Jacksonville Minnesota or London so like not in you know hot spots but like that's where they have their their big hospitals and so Mayo is doing this the Cleveland Clinic does this and then there's a bunch of private practices that will do this too so my idea is that somebody needs to create this for sfla New York it's the Soho House for medicine and um you know just charge a 10 to 20,000 a year membership fee and it's an annual checkup for you or your spouse even and um if you can get basically 5,000 members across you know in in any of those GEOS you're doing 50 million a year recurring Revenue that's only that's like 100 patients a week right it's like it's not insane something like this especially with the like longevity Brian Johnson like huberman like there is a very very big Trend in this direction and I don't really think that Genie is going back in the bottle like I don't think that people are five years from now are gonna be like I just don't care about health anymore like I just don't think it's going that way I think people will get disillusioned with some of the things that are happening but I think on the whole more people are becoming you know conscious than before and as that kind of high net worth class it becomes a high status thing to do to be you know Health optimized I think that this is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger when we started this pod I I think I said one of the big things that I'm bullish on for the next like 10 20 30 years is I always thought it's insane that you can have like a cancer in your body and like the conversation of well had we just known about this sooner we could have fixed this but we don't or we didn't so you're dead uh and like that's kind of crazy crazy to think that like had you just walked through the doors and gotten this test you would have been this was could have been solvable 100 years from now it's going to be insane that you didn't know how your body was doing yeah I agree maybe 50 years from now I don't know I don't know what the number is but like for sure by 100 years like the idea that you could it's like dude my grandpa used to walk around and he had no [ __ ] clue what his like glucose levels were he didn't know if he had cancer people just had cancer and die it's like you know when we talk about like small poox and polio just killing people or like you know like I don't know like how'd you get around without Google Maps it's like ah you just like you just keep stopping at gas stations and then you'd unfold this map you'd trace your finger and then you'd ask a guy he'd tell you like when you see a blue thing turn left and like that's how you got across the country it's like going to a restaurant and saying you want smoking or non-smoking sections it's like wait that was a thing you you could go to a smoking section of a restaurant you know like because I that was one of the things I was alive for I remember as a kid like saying ah you only have smoking available fine we'll do that do you know what else that's similar to starting a newsletter today and not using that's what it's similar to and that's the thrill of The Shield today I'm GNA tell you guys about beehive easiest way to start a newsletter spin it up uh start your newsletter it has all the growth tools built in it's got an ad Network so you can start making money on your newsletter even if you have a small newsletter I see people every week on Twitter posting that they're making $ th000 doll a month or $3,000 a month on their newsletters and they don't even have that big of a newsletter it's pretty crazy uh putting your thoughts out there aside from the money is is I would say the most underrated thing that a smart person can do if you're a dumb person you don't need to do this but if you're a smart person putting your thoughts out there and creating a magnet that will attract like-minded people create a little landing area for luck in your life where people can reach out to you because they heard something you said or they agreed with something you said or they offer you a job or they want to work with you or partner with you that's what happens when you when you publish and so highly encourage people to do it and if you're going to do it use beehive it's spelled be h i i i v.com weird name beehive but it's a good great service and uh Tyler's awesome you guys I do think people should check it out Tyler's a one of the most interesting entrepreneurs that we've come across by way actually the best thing about Tyler is his playlist on Spotify so if you go on Spotify you need music for while you work he has a playlist called Big desk energy is it actually good it's awesome dude I listen to it all the time when I work big desk energy great name and it's a great playlist and he keeps it updated so he keeps trating it as he goes and I've told him I was like d I you know beehive is great but the playlist is legendary the playlist is so good but you invested in beehive so that's the one that needs to work out so I did invest in behive Al so uh I invested once I use the newsletter twice a week and I use the playlist seven days a week all right beehive beehive.org got cancer or something like that you could do a full body MRI um at places and so I went and did one and I I you know the reason I didn't talk a ton about it afterwards was I just don't know the science behind some of these things and so it might be great I know several people that have said oh I did a preal scan and we found something blah blah blah I've talked to doctor friends who are like this is BS um and I'm always like you know there's like a there's like a Theos uh six sense in my body where I'm like just be careful before you endorse something that you don't understand the science of that's making a very bold claim that doesn't mean that they're doing something wrong or that anything is up with it I'm just saying I have no idea if these things work I do know that the stuff like the executive checkup where they're doing like more tried and TR trusted like tests are um you know a bit more more safe right this like the Lindy effect right they've been around for a longer period of time more widely accepted in the community more testing has been done they've made it through that Gauntlet whereas the new stff the full body MRI it might be awesome it might be Overkill I'm not sure I can't say dude we have a lady so we do like for Hampton we have like perks so you get discounts to different services and we partnered with one of these MRI companies and this member and her boyfriend or her husband went and got one together and he had cancer they caught cancer and he got surgery and he's good and uh she was telling me the story and I was like that's insane that is absolutely insane so there's one positive story for I think they said like one when I was there again I don't want to repeat these CLS I don't know what what's true but I think they were like you know one out of 20 one out of 30 people come in find something that's insane it's so funny when you go do these by the way you're just like no news is good news so you're like I'm GNA go voluntarily check this thing give myself a very high anxiety day and then I really what I want is this anti-climatic like yeah you're fine dude 35 what are you doing you're normal do you feel bad no oh okay cool then uh that's that's the best case scenario at the end of these things hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's

singing any song that you want him to sing and so you could use it for theme songs for background music of different things it is awesome it's one of the few AI things that I've seen and I'm like this is wonderful this works there's a perfect use case for this it's really good dude my uncreative ass doesn't know how to use these I'll be like uh make it a journey singing Don't Stop Believing it's like their actual song I'm like I guess I just wanted to hear that song I [ __ ] listen to it yeah you're like a journey song about a boxer in Philadelphia and he's trying to beat the USSR and what he got and it's Eye of the Tiger dude um the uh there is a cool version of these though um you see that Drake tweeted out a song that he made using AI uh like AI Tupac and AI biggie on his track yeah it's awesome I love these things dude let me tell you this story so I had to do some camera I had to set up this camera at my house and I don't know how to do it and a friend of a friend connected me with these three kids they're 20 years old and they uh they have like a marketing agency but I guess on the side they like help people like me set up their camera whatever they come out here they help me out and after about four hours of them in my house doing work I'm like all right so what's your guys' stories like I could tell that you're like being polite and like you're trying to ask a little bit about me and like let's talk let's let's hang out so it's these three kids that are 20 years old they dropped out of college to start a marketing agency and to get business they go to uh what's it called is it called a Better Business Bureau like where like your local small town communities have these like business bureaus they go there and start convincing all these small businesses to make promotional videos for their website so they start making videos for their website and then they're like well what do I do with this video now so they go to their clients and they go well you should run Google ads we'll do that for you and we'll make a website and they're like all right cool I've this website and how do I get leads and like well we'll run the ads and then we'll just get leads to you and I go wow pretty cool what software are you guys using and they go we just use like our iPhones and they go and a matter of fact my phone's ringing right now it it looks like someone's calling for this particular landscaping company so they put their phone on speaker and they go hi this is uh XYZ landscaping services how can I help you and uh they go hi this is Rosemary I live here and um I'm trying to inquire about seeing if you guys can come and like build this like small project at my house and she goes oh yes ma'am I'm not the owner of the business but I'll put you in touch with her right now and so they you have their iPhone out they click hold they call their client right there and this is at like nine o'clock on a Saturday they go hey Linda I've got rosemary on the phone right now she wants this this and this I'm gonna merge you to right now and she goes all right sounds good he clicks merge and he goes hey Rosemary this is Anna the odor um she I filled her all in about what you want and I'll let you guys take it from here and then he clicks mute and just puts the phone in his pocket and he goes that's that's $400 right there and they're doing $155,000 a month this way these three kids they're like yeah we like have been grinding at this for like 12 months and then we're finally at like 15,000 we're able to pay ourselves we've been each been door dashing in our free time in order to make bills uh pay our bills because we live on our own and I just think to myself you've got it great stories begin exactly like this you guys they're asking me for advice I go guys you're it's going to work out just keep doing this for five years dude the best part of the story by far is that's $400 right there put I'm gonna start saying that every time I unlock my phone and I'm with my wife I'm just gonna be like another $300 it just it was awesome what these kids were doing and uh I I disrespect the hell of that type of stuff and it it just showed me the these guys have what it takes and this is how like great stories begin is these little like it's not complicated stuff it's really simple it's not sexy but it's awesome dude my brother-in-law I was asking him over the weekend I go yo what's what's your favorite job you've ever had and he goes oh easy Smoothie King in high school I was like Smoothie King in high school you've had a whole he's 40 he's like 43 or something I was like your greatest job was your first job 23 years ago or 26 years ago he's like yeah no doubt and I was like why did you like it so much like free smoothies or something he goes no no no my boss was so funny he's like my boss was this character he's like you know that thing I say every time I answer the phone I go yeah he goes I stole that from my boss and the thing he says on the phone is the thing his boss said so one day he was in Smoothie King and the phone rings like the Smoothie King like landline rings and his boss is basically like you know if my brother-in-law is 17 this is like a 19-year-old you know normal dude he's a manager of Smoothie King kind of an overweight guy and he goes ah must be Jordan about that summer league and he picked up the and my brother-in-law thought it was so funny that he just came up with that on the fly like it must be Michael Jordan calling about summer league and for literally 26 years my brother-in-law every time the phone rings he goes must be Jordan bought that summer league and I could tell it just puts him in a good mood every single time well now the new one is uh when you hang $ um you want to do one what do you got all right I got another thing that's funny well it's funny and not funny but the funny thing about funny things is that if you take a really not funny thing like war and you multiply it times a funny thing together they become funny that's the beauty that's the beauty of of humor bold statement let's see let's see how uh you pull it together the pizza meter do you know what the pizza meter is I don't know what the pizza meter is okay so the pizza meter is a way that people on the internet knew that the Iran strikes were happening before the news reported it you might be wondering how could just random people on the internet know this before mainstream media and the answer is the pizza meter and so the pizza meter is basically a a signal that people watch for which is basically they study the um they watch the pizza shops that are around the White House the Pentagon places like that and they look that if there's a sudden Spike and if you know for example if you go on Google and it says busier than usual and you'll see like wow 10 p.m. it's like spiked way higher than normal that you know that something's going down that's the only reason that the closest pizza shop to the Pentagon or closest pizza shop to the White House would have spiked like that is that there's something going down that has the staff there late at night ordering pizzas and so they know and it's basically been a signal for like the uh the invasion of Kuwait the Iraq War most recently when Iran launched those missiles at at Israel um and so people knew that this was coming because of the pizza meter and the funny the story behind this is pretty funny I don't know if you I guess if you've never heard of it you probably don't know the backstory either but it got popular because there was a guy named Frank and Frank owned 60 franchises of like pizza shops around DC and he actually went and told the LA Times he was like um the news media doesn't know about something Big's going to happen they're in bed sleeping but my guys my guys are out there on the front lines doing deliveries and we know when something's going down because we'll get a spike of deliveries to the Pentagon at you know 11: p.m. at midnight at 1:00 am and that never happens and so this happened and then the government basically had to shift their they sent out a memo they're like hey guys you can't be doing this and so now they send staff out to try to pick up pizzas and do all this other stuff to kind of like Smooth out the curve where it's not so obvious that some shit's going down isn't that hilarious dude this is brilliant there there's a phrase for this and I can't remember what it was but it's basically where you do all of this work to protect something and just the smallest dumbest thing that you forget about that you don't even realize is the key to you know unraveling the entire thing this is awesome this is so cool and I'm reading the Wikipedia right now it started in 1983 with the invasion of Granada and then again in 1989 the invasion of Panama what they noticed was that domino pizza deliveries increased dramatically right before the invasion by 25% like so this has been going on for decades this is this is the password one two3 of Wars it's like the easy to guess password that like you didn't they didn't realize actually the true origin story was this of this was apparently during the Cold War the Soviet intelligence agency was using indicators like this so not just the pizza thing but other things like this to try to alert them of a potential Global crisis and they called it uh pisant like pizza and then intelligence pisant and um so that's how that's like how it started and then Frank kind of put put a spotlight on it and there's other ones too so like recently so this happened before the Iran thing people were like uh oh Pizza meter spiking right now and then sure enough within 24 hours the news came out about the Iran thing the other signals people were like hey wait wait it's not just pizzas cuz they realize that the second best signal is that gay bars in the area see a like a big drop off in foot traffic when the government like is when they're busy basically and so people were looking at gay bars there was a guy who was like hey guys I can confirm because the the politicians would normally be going to the gay bars yeah exactly so this's guy who tweeted out he's like hey guys I don't know what this means but I'm at uproar right now and there's way less government guys there than usual tonight and normally like I know whatever Thursday night this place is popping there's nobody here and so now there's the the DC bear index which is basically trying to measure um you know like the the gayar foot traffic as well so this is up there on my Mount Rushmore of silly indexes there's there's some other great ones that you might not know about do you know about the Big Mac index I think you probably know that one is that just the price of a b Big Mac or it's like a better uh indicator of like inflation or what they call PPP so uh purchasing power parody so basically how much is a dollar versus a euro versus a Frank versus a Yen and the most common denominator between all of those countries is what's the price of a Big Mac and so you can go see that oh man a Big Mac relatively is now more expensive in one place than the other that basically indicates that that currency got weaker it's a more true indicator of the currency strength or weakness than like what the government will tell you so that's that's what the Big Mac Nick is supposed to be and by the way all of these are you know they're not they're not bulletproof so there's people who are like oh the pizza thing doesn't work anymore blah blah blah who knows I I I you know I can't say that these are like you know perfect science or anything but they're they're funny the other one that's great is the Waffle House Index you know this one uh for hurricanes yeah for storms basically they there's a three color a three-color system so Waffle House which is open 247 365 so it's like uh how do you know how bad a storm is it's basically green is Waffle House is still open an operational full menu yellow is it's open menu and red is it's closed if Waffle House is closed and the guy like the director of FEMA came out basically was like you know it's bad when the Waffle House is closed and so it became a whole thing The Waffle House Index a Mount Rushmore of indexes is awesome that is a hilarious bit I I I thoroughly enjoy this one and by the way have you ever noticed if if waffle houses are supposed to be open all the time why do they even have locks on the doors do they maybe they don't they do cuz I went went to one recently and I was like if you guys are open all the time why why do you even why do you even lock the place up I'm sure they enjoyed that conversation like look dude you want waffles are not like scrambled or what what do you want uh it didn't work out uh that's pretty good uh where did you why why did this interest you there's this General Trend which is like whenever there's like a murder that happens or like a crime or there's like the Boston bombing do you remember like Reddit was basically solving it almost in real time or like you but they got it like they got it all wrong yeah but there is like yes that seems important but it is pretty fun to follow along and just see like what the open- source intelligence Community can do and like they do get things wrong but there's you know there there's several examples of this or like you know if you go look at the root CA the root the root um you know discovery of maybe some conspiracy or some uh um some some expose it's usually like some guy a message board notices something and that's like often like how things get figured out and so you know that's how they caught the you know the Silk Road for example you know they went and looked at Message Board posting for example um but you know I just think that's cool that like there's a there is like the official agencies but then there sort of like this open source community of internet sleuths and you know I don't think they're they're not necessarily better but I just think it's a cool in addition to uh what it what exists out there let me show you something that I saw recently that is related to indexes so I got curious about uh I was looking at like I saw an article about some of the most profitable companies in the world now let me list a few that are very obvious so Visa of course Visa is going to be one of the more profitable companies something like 40% uh income compared to their revenue Nvidia birkshire Haw hathway very obvious ones two less obvious ones Public Storage I think we've talked about Public Storage you know they make something like 50% profit on each dollar that they they take in on Revenue another one is relics we've talked about relics they own the academic publishing industry and it's like a very controversial thing because it's kind of a pay-to-play model and it's a little it's a little weird but there's two that stuck that stood out to me the first one I'll tell you because you may not know but it's called the Intercontinental Exchange do you know what the Intercontinental Exchange is no well the second one that stood out is NASDAQ so the inter Intercontinental Exchange owns the New York Stock Exchange and so these two stock exchanges are some of the most profitable public companies in the country something like uh I think in 2018 the inter Cal exchange I think it's I think they call it ice IC 60% profit for every dollar that it took in and this company is worth something like I think today it's worth 35 or $40 billion doll one of the most profitable companies out there and it makes uh I think 10 billion in Revenue so it's just like printing cash and it kind of got me interested that these stock market exchanges might be the world's greatest business models because when you think about a stock market exchange once a stock once a company lists on an exchange they're basically never going to go away and a hopefully a great company like a Ford or something like that can last for a hundred years it's incredibly challenging to build a new Stock Exchange there's actually only I think 15 of them in the world like like legit big ones and the barriers to entry are super big but it got me interested do you know who started a stock exchange recently have you heard about this it's called the long-term Stock Exchange Eric Reese Eric Reese from the the book uh The Lean Startup one of the most famous startup books of all time so I think he started this in 2010 or 2012 a while ago and it's taken a while to get going and the reason he started it was at the end of The Lean Startup in the the epilog he lists like a bunch of ideas that are interesting to him and he said on this talk he goes all these ideas have been started my readers have messaged me saying I've started this this and this after this book and he goes the one thing that no one started was a long-term Stock Exchange so I decided to do it and one of the reasons he decided to do it was because so the large uh index funds or or a lot of the large Traders do you know how long they hold a stock for on average no I have no idea 10 minutes that's how long on average it's I'm super bullish on this stock for the next 10 minutes yeah like me at home with all my ideas yeah it's for 10 minutes is the average hold time and he was like I think that's insane because nothing has changed with that company and it really bothered him another thing that bothered him is there's this chart you like one chart businesses there's this chart that shows the average number of public companies and it's been going just straight down so I think 20 years ago there was something like 10,000 I think today there's like 4,000 public companies so people just don't want to take their company public for a variety of reasons one of those reasons being is that it's kind of a shortterm like what does Warren Buffett say in the short term it's a uh it's a what does he say it's like a measuring stick but in the long term contest long term it's a weighing machine yeah that's right and he's like that has a lot of people don't like that they don't want to take their companies public because of that so basically in 2011 he proposed this idea of this thing called The Long long term Stock Exchange where you get more votes for how long you've held the stock so if you held the stock for longer than someone who who just recently bought it you get more votes into how the companies run theoretically and he actually raised something like a100 million to start this I think in Jon Horowitz funded it and and a bunch of other that wasn't the only thing right I think there was like a mandatory oneyear hold time right wasn't there like a if you buy you you can't sell within a certain period of time wasn't that the rule yes and there's and there's a few other rules where the companies in order to get listed on the stock exchange you have to do what you just said you also have to like have a plan as to how your company is going to be great for the next many decades and so they like it's all about long-term stuff and so yeah there are a whole bunch of rules about this now the story isn't exactly going well because I think there's only like two or three or four companies listed on his exchange so far I think it's uh twio uh I think twilio assana and thread up I think those are like I don't think there's that many companies listed there and those companies are also listed on the NASDAQ so I don't know why you would use Eric re's long-term Stock Exchange however I thought this idea I didn't understand it when I was younger I'm like why do you why do you need to do that now I'm kind of growing to understand like that is pretty badass and this is an epic idea that has not played out yet but I was researching these exchanges and they're so fascinating at how they work it's this weird it's a little bit crony capitalism because they're in bed with the SEC so they're in bed with the government and there's a lot of Regulation around this whole thing but it's so fascinating and Eric re was talking about starting it he was like in order to start it you have to file paperwork and it's called SEC 00001 so when you file paperwork with the SEC even for a startup it's it's all these paperwork this is literally paperwork number one it's the first like it's their first document and he like has and he filled out all this paperwork and now he's finally kind of starting to get a little bit traction but I found this to be so fascinating these these stock exchanges and how they're probably one of the best business models I could think of all right I have a bunch of short stories uh related to this number one uh I met the CEO of I think either the NASDAQ or nysse he came to my office once and I didn't he came to meet Michael Burch who was our like main investor and they were hanging out and he's like oh come in here and join and so I'm sitting there and I'm like I didn't even know the exchange was a business I was like what the like why would it have a CEO it's a business and he's like oh it's not only a business it's a phenomenal business and he's like basically we have the exchange and The Exchange in the US obviously is the big one but what they do is it's a software company actually so what they do is they power the stock exchanges of like a whole bunch of different countries so it's like oh I mean Finland needs a stock exchange they're not going to build their own thing they'll just take the US's like battl tested super you know military grade exchange and they'll just be a customer of it and so that was the first like line of business is basically that countries will use their uh software to run their own exchanges the next is that they basically fight for IPOs so he's like yeah big deal is basically how do we versus the NASDAQ um compete to get you know Facebook's you know IPO how do we get the next big Tech IPOs so that's why he was in Silicon Valley meeting people was like these are long-term relationships and like when the time comes that they're deciding which exchange to list on like that's a big deal for us and it's a network effect right the more great companies you have on your exchange the more valuable your exchanges but it's like a network effect married with Enterprise um you know like super Enterprise contracts married with like complete defensibility like nobody like literally like regulatory defensibility so you get the defensibility of network effects and of regulations and then you get the business model of Enterprise you know Enterprise sales and so pretty phenomenal um business actually it's also a marketplace right because they could take fees on all the the different transactions that exist so pretty phenomenal business you're absolutely right and um I was surprised to even learn that this was a business it's just another reminder that like everything you see around you it didn't just show up it's there because somebody somewhere has a motive and a and a profit in order to generate that product or that service or that thing that exists and once you see that you can't like unsee it uh so that's my first story Second Story is about Eric Reese so I'm I love Eric Reese uh like his blog was one of the key blogs that like you know my like entrepreneurial Journey like I was like oh this makes a lot of sense like that's why we failed we should have been doing this [ __ ] and I got to meet Eric I went to his house in San Francisco nicest guy nice guy but also wasn't just like pleasantries he was nice but he was so helpful like I was like oh we're planning on doing this it's and he's like okay that's an interesting idea I was like yeah we're doing this big launch blah blah blah he's like don't do the big launch and I was like but I just told you I I told I like talked for five minutes about my big launch plan he's like not a believer in big launches uh here's why he's like basically here's what you're going to do you're going to take the worst version of the product that you've ever made and will ever make that you have no idea if there's demand for and you're going to completely blow your wad telling everybody how great this thing is and you have this like you're going to put all this energy into that and it's going to completely like the odds of you just getting it right and your initial product being good enough is so low that you're actually like lowering your odds of success by doing that and then now it's like pretty common this like fallacy of the big launch this is like 10 plus years ago and at that time like big launches were still kind of a thing that people tried to do and um he talked me off that ledge and then also I was like uh I came to him and I was like you know we have this uh idea it's not really working so I'm thinking about pivoting to this he's like okay here's he's like how are you planning to Pivot I was like oh I think we're gonna make these like change this feature and start to test this and blah blah blah he's like cool here's what you need to do he's like you need to take your old idea you need to bring it to Town Square you need to shoot it in the head I was like what what and he's like your team is going to be so confused unless you explicitly tell them that hey all the [ __ ] I've been saying for 2 years it's changing like the old assumptions turned out to be wrong we learned this by doing this and now we know that's not the path we now know that this is a more viable path or that this is a better path to be trying that old idea is done that old assumption we had is done and he's like you need to take it in the middle of everybody and you need to really do a public execution of the assumptions and the ideas that you no longer are married to because nine out of 10 CEOs are too afraid to um to sort of admit that they were wrong or to like be really explicit that like no we that was a dead end we need to go back and we need to try something new is like you try to like blend it together and just kind of like keep iterating in the shadows basically and you're like kind of like your team is always like half confused and they don't really know what they're supposed to be doing is that the thing we've been saying or this new thing or do we just bolt this new thing onto the old thing and then that doesn't really work either he's like you know when Instagram pivoted and they became Instagram they basically were like look this other thing bourbon this idea of location based check-ins we're not doing that [ __ ] anymore locations suck uh we used to say location means everything location now means nothing it's photos with filters okay and we may have a new app with a new name and it's photos with filters and they're like but the old app had photos with filters in it he's like yeah but the old app was about the old [ __ ] and this is not about that anymore this is now about this new thing and uh that was very very valuable advice that I don't know nobody else had ever told me and I bet nobody else would ever tell me and I'm saying it here on the Pod because you know there's probably 100 people out there that need to Pivot and like this was good advice it really helped me that's such a good metaphor too that's a very that's a very uh that's a very sharp metaphor yeah exactly I needed to be punched in the face because like most Founders we ask for advice and really what we're asking for is can you please affirm the things I want and anything you say that I don't want even though it's important I'm GNA like ignore to my own detriment and then 3 years later two years later when it's all failed I'll be like huh maybe there was some like wisdom that if only I had listened and uh I thought it was really good that he just like punched me in the nose so that I couldn't ignore the advice and most people that that's actually very generous most people won't put themselves out there to do that most people don't need it doesn't it didn't help him you know I I went to his house that changed my life he never heard from me again right like I've never bumped into him again and so you know I I paid back nothing uh for that but he he kind of went out on a limb and was like look I'm going to be direct with you bro and uh I really appreciated directness because that's actually what I what I wanted do you think his new company's going to work well it's his old company because it's 10 years it's like 10 plus years old now dude yeah I I don't I mean as much as I love the guy it just seems like this idea has not come to fruition there's you said twilio ass and thread up twio Dlisted voluntarily so now there's a SAA and thread up they have two companies listed on the exchange so like in terms of objectively it's not working unless there's some other you know momentum I know that for a long time they really couldn't do anything they needed the like regulatory approv and that was like a multi-year thing so I it does seem like they've crossed that but you know it doesn't seem like they have a lot of traction at the moment I wish they did I think it's a great idea I wish they did too I wish they did too in the words of uh what's his name Gary Halpert never has more money been lost and try to convince the market what they should do versus what they want to do maybe long-termism is what you want the market you think the market should do and not necessarily what it wants to do maybe that's not what companies or investors want I think when I was thinking about this how do you make this work and I'm like well I think the biggest way to make it work but this has to do with the SEC is to get rid of quarterly earnings calls I think quarterly earning calls should probably go away I think that this is actually something that I think Trump proposed this but many other people have proposed this I think he's like no audits never check anything he uh I think I think that's something he proposed but I think the earnings is ridiculous every three months it's kind of crazy um but that's beyond I think long-term stock exchanges like per view like I think that's like some SEC [ __ ] but anyway I thought it was interesting I doesn't sound like it's getting the traction that I wish it would get but I still think it's intriguing the coolest innovation in this space was actually from crypto crypto basically when they had the token stuff FTX no no no like like crypto tokens that it wasn't uh this they didn't clear this for reg regulatory wise but the the idea was actually really good which is that a app should be able to issue tokens to the users or members of its community that are helping build it we've all been a part of things early on where without that user contributing without them being a part of it without them them actually participating whether it's Airbnb or it's the drivers on Uber like for them to not get anything or like you know Reddit for example Reddit after like 20 years was like we're going public we made billions of dollars and the mods who you know have made this place what it is and who actually created these communities and run them uh they're like you we're going to go we're going to do the thing no company does we're going to let you buy the stock at the at the price 20 years later when in reality like the the proper way to do this is what crypto was trying to do which was let any app create an incentive mechanism that will that will reward early participation of people who bring value to the network so that if the network actually becomes valuable you by being there and putting in work that was like the equivalent of an investment you're were able to invest energy what if you do that it actually gives you a chance to spin up new network works or new things now of course all these things have the other side of the coin which is you might attract the wrong person the person that's just there to get the early coins right it's like the the worst customer is the one who's like the coupon Clipper who's just you know there to just redeem their early early thing then then then quickly cash it out and bounce and so there's all kinds of things you have to get right to make this work but a lot of them are EV evangelists yeah like you know the the the idea that you could allow your early adopters early evangelists and ear early contributors to own a piece of The Upside in something I thought was a really good idea and a big step forward um that just simply doesn't exist in the traditional system today all right well that's my bit on stock exchanges I'm going to be paying attention I I think this will make it to Eric Eric you got to reach out to Sean man and let him let him thank you uh face to face um what do you got all right this is my um Hustler of the week so we kind of have uh we got the blue collar side hustle we got the Billy of the week that's for the billionaire of the week I don't know what we call this lady she's the uh the Hustler of the week which is just somebody who's just making [ __ ] happen her name is Danielle Baskin which I thought was the same name as the Tiger King lady but maybe it's not um here's her story so I saw that this lady is doing a fruit swag company basically imagine you're a company and you're hosting some conference your HubSpot hosting inbound and you want to have something cool something unique for like you know 10,000 attendees they got enough t-shirts how many Koozies can one have uh oh great a pen how thoughtful of you and so what she does is she's like I got it put your name on fruit baby let's do a Salesforce avocado let's do a lift banana let's do a mailchip pineapple or whatever it is I guess it should have been a MailChimp banana uh but basically she prints corporate names onto fruits and charges five bucks per fruit to the companies and companies pay for this for their conferences and she's made a bunch of money doing this I think it's awesome and what I liked about her was I looked her up and she's like this like kind of this uh opinionated artist and she's done a bunch of these random businesses so she uh she was like bike helmets are ugly so she painted her own bike helmet and then she kept getting stopped at places for um for her bike helmet and so she's like okay and so she created a bike helmet company that just does like cool looking bike helmets and then that was like her first business and so she was doing that she like made us she's like I don't know anything about tech but like she went on like I don't know Squarespace and then like got like a you know put stripe on there or PayPal on there and started to Tak a payment so that started to work then she's like all right where do I sell these helmets and so she bought a vintage tricycle that has a wagon attached to it like a three-wheeler with a wagon and she just piled up all the helmets into the wagon and made like a cool little stand and then people were like yo I love your stand and she's like huh all right I'll start selling these stands and so now she sells the helmets and then she built the stand for the helmets and then there people loved her her stand so much that she started doing uh she started selling Sands I think the fruit thing started the same way she was like oh yeah just to be funny I created this this fruit thing and then people were like hey can you do that for my brand and it just a great example of this this awesome quote from the founder of Geek Squad he said marketing is the tax that you pay for for an unremarkable product and this lady has such a remarkable product she just builds remarkable products products worth remarking on that she never does needs to do marketing and she actually just spins up new businesses because she'll do she'll make something for herself and then 10 people will talk about it and she's like okay that's business that's a thing and she'll make it she has another thing called mask alike where you upload a picture of your face and it makes like a covid mask but the bottom half of your face on the mask and on her branded fruit website she needs some her copy is funky she needs to move this part up this is actually good this should be the tagline go bananas and it says uh how they work with local farms The Source produce and they put these like stickers on the produce it's pretty cool this is pretty cool if we do a MFM Meetup we need to have this at one of them I don't know what our fruit would be but like I'm a beat I'm a beat guy I like beets uh big big fan of Beats so you eat beats how do you eat how do you eat a beat dude I think I told you this my buddy Sam soy from college one day sent me a PowerPoint deck he's like oh I was listening to the podcast I haven't talked to this guy in years and he's like oh I heard the podcast you're talking about health here's my Beats Pres presentation I was like what and he just say this this slide deck of all white slide no design and he just says beats want to have a longer Life Next slide beats want to have better sex next slide beats want to feel good every morning beats and he's just like everything you want is on the other side of just a few beets and he's like you need to buy raw beets you need to put them in a smoothie here's my recipe beets are amazing for you how do you eat them I just blend them up in a smoothie like what's that mean what part of Blended up in a smoothie is unclear what do you mean that that's incredibly unclear do you literally take a bunch of beets and put them in a smoothie and like you juice it make a smoothie and one of the ingredients is beets okay that's what I was asking you just said but what you said was you just put beets in a blender and make it into something so what do you put what is your beet smoothie recipe so his recipe his recipe will be spinach beets water uh I think like a splash of OJ he puts like olive oil salt he puts like different stuff than I never put in smoothies like oliv I never would have thought of hemp seeds he makes like a killer like super healthy smoothie and uh I'll try to I'll publish the recipe I got to go find the exact recipe I haven't done it in a couple years but for like a year and a half I was all on the Beats train and now did it make you feel better yeah it feels great uh well mostly because his presentation was very convincing and so like I got Placebo pretty hard there but the hard part is that raw beats are the worst for cleanup like you have to peel them and then there and then everything is red your hands are pure red The Cutting Board is red your whole kitchen is red like these things are like just pure ink and so that's the only reason I stopped was for a period of time I was like I'm just tired of like having red hands for the all day you know so I need to figure out a way to do this I need some gloves is the answer dude what a dork I love this guy yeah you made a face like it's gross but this is everything you stand for in life doing weird Overkill stuff for health I'm not that Overkill but beats are like I don't running right now how long's that race your training for a mile two miles what are you doing you're not over how long is it about 50 of them about 50 of the miles oh okay so like a marathon wasn't enough you needed [Music] two but you're not overkill for sure uh all right well congratulations to Danielle how'd you find her I honestly have no idea are we like the chis you're like the Christopher Columbus where it's like you discovered America it did not exist before you before you it was it was not a thing you came across it now it is a thing uh yeah by the way she to me is like the female Peter levels in real life so you know he's like Indie hacker just spins up cool ass projects online makes a bunch of money I feel like she's the female real life Peter level so that's that's how I think about her I also have a couple of her ideas that she's had that she's been tinkering with so um basking has been tinkering with other applications for this idea for example what if company sponsored produce that's at the store so you could buy discounted fruits or vegetables if it came with the Brand's logo on it what if Taco Bell sponsors some Tomatoes or avocados for instance and then you could think about the brand as you make your Super Bowl guacamole these are the thoughts going through the mind of Daniel Baskin dude she has a whole website full of like crazy things so she's done drone sweaters sweat sweaters and clothing for cold drones uh she's got the helmets thing she's oh my God she she has an an escape room for your baby in your womb Womb

what is the most important part for a video to pop off the hook the Hook is so important that sometimes I figure out the most viral hook isn't the most viral idea so then I have to come back to the idea and change the idea based on the hook what is the Tactical process you take power words should be the first thing that starts the video what's a power word what do you mean power words are things that will instantly hook people that are very strong words such as free $0 stole or any like crazy word and the reason I say that because I see a lot of people start their videos with this is I'm out this is is not telling me anything about the video I actually scroll cuz it's bad as opposed to if someone says free chicken sandwiches all weekend I'm in where are these free chicken sandwiches I was in the moment you said free that's the number one thing you want your books to start with power words the second thing is you want it to be progressing the video the reason why this is is also bad is because it is just saying a statement it is not doing anything this is blank doesn't tell me what you're going to do it's just telling me a statement

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
my first million let's go my first baby mama my first camine experience my first [Laughter] [Music] addiction here's what I want to start with I love some of the things that you say and one of the things you said is don't follow your passion people who are already rich tell you to follow your passion you should follow your talent can you unpack that can you explain what you mean I wanted to be an athlete that was my passion and then I'm going to UCLA was a blessing because I figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't in the 0.1% you need to be in to make your living as an athlete and there's a fair there's some pretty basic axioms that should guide your career choices around where you invest your most to Precious capital and that is your time your human capital the first is the sexier the business the lower return on investment you want to be in fashion the arts movies modeling Sports inless you get really you know incandescent green lights from a very early age that you're going to be in the 0.1% try and make a living somewhere else and then do that on the weekends and that is if you uh the SAG after the most talented actors in the world it's hard to get a sag after a union card you have to actually B something these are the most talented doctors in the world 182,000 of them 87% of them don't qualify for health insurance because they don't make more than $23,000 in a given year so the key is finding not finding your your passion but finding your talent and then committing to developing Mastery and if you can develop Mastery in anything that has a 90 plus% employment rate which 98% of sectors enjoy the economic accurs the camaraderie The Prestige the relevance just the sheer Joy of Mastery will make you pass passate about whatever it is and I'm passionate about taking care of my kids I'm passionate about being able to step in and help my aging father I'm passionate about I'd rather be rapael nidal or Federer but kind of I'd rather be me than the number three or number four tennis player in the world because I have Financial Security I get to go to Wimbledon on my own terms and not be as nervous and not throw up or before a match so yeah I'd rather be n doll but pretty much any one else playing tennis I'd rather be and I got there with boring companies so the the the the less sexy of business the higher the return on investment so I would suggest that we stop you know think about well what could I be good at I think that's what your 20s are for workshopping stuff and and also getting it wrong I started in Investment Banking and I was terrible at it I didn't like them they didn't like me and I had to go back to business school and just start workshopping where could I be great what what industry could I be great in so don't you know find what you're good at and then get great at it and then be a DJ on the weekends by the way congratulations today the today's the release date of the book right algebra of wealth y today is the day so that's that's going to be huge I mean I I I read the algebra of Happiness a while ago and I've been watching the videos forever and so I kind of I I didn't get an early copy of the book but I will buy it and read it and so you'll get my $23 I need you to we're by the way we're number one on Amazon on today I just thought I would drop that cuz I'm desperate I'm desperate for your affirmation Sam that's all right I'll give it to you I'll give it to you I won't starve you from that you you've got it I look up to you I think you're the man thank you well let me let me ask you about the number one on Amazon real quick you uh you're a pretty stoic guy in fact when you come on the Pod it's uh it's always surprising to me that you are so even Keel but it's the launch day of your book you worked on this thing really hard you're number one on Amazon what how does Scott Galloway uh celebrate oh you know I'm not I'm pretty flat I don't I'm I congratulate the team it feels great it's very gratifying I love benchmarks I'm addicted to everyone's addicted to something I'm addicted to strangers affirmation which is kind of pathetic at my age and that's a form of affirmation but it's very rewarding because so many people work so goddamn hard on this thing just not me but you know my researchers my analysts my PR people my social people my publisher my book agent you know greatness is in the agency of others so it's just very gratifying and plus my podcast co-host got to number three on the best sellers list so God damn it if I'm not going to get to number two I must beat Caris swisser so Sam if you could go buy several thousand books I'd appreciate it um and if you like it write a review and if you hate it please buy more and send them to an eneme but yeah I'm I'm addicted to external affirmation it's really pathetic well so I mean the the book from my understanding is that it's basically talks about the people who have money and the people who don't and what are the commonalities between the winners and the losers and you have I've read this for years there was this awesome Fast Company article about you and I've seen you say this in videos where you were shockingly calculating when starting your last company L2 I think you said something like uh deoe did a study they did a study that showed what's the difference between the people who sell their companies for five to 10 times Revenue versus those who just sell it for one or two times and you had these like four or five things and it was uh they own a niche they have recurring Revenue Tech is at their core and that they're International and then finally they have defensive IP and then you went on and said how like in your 40s when you were starting L2 40s and 50s you were like only focused on money you said I worked my ass off I was there at the office at 2 am you said uh but I don't regret it you said it was totally worth it and when you were starting L2 I don't really know too much about that industry or that business other than a handful of Articles were you that calculating with work working backwards from an exit and by the way the story ends with you selling it for $120 million 160 boss Jesus get your facts straight and by the way I'm number one on Amazon today I don't know if I told you that yeah I I I didn't have a lot of money and for me work was about getting Economic Security I was very focused on money and I'm not saying that's the right way it was just my way and I had done a lot of analysis and the study referring to said okay are companies that sell in any industry they you know the lowest 10 percentile the upper desile of the valuations they get taken out at and the study looked at the common features of the companies that got sold in the top desile and it was all the things you talked about and that's literally how I shaped the business model I opened a London office right away I instead of charging Consulting fees I said pay me a quarter of a million bucks a year and I'll answer your toughest questions using data um we focused on luxury and then consumer Brands we broaden our niched a little bit we spent I raised $17 million to create a series of technology and scraping tools swi that I could collect more data points than anyone in the world such that when the inevitable guy from the analytics Department came in with his arms crossed to play gotcha um they just couldn't argue with our data we just collected more data than anyone in the world on these issues and tried to distill it down to something actionable so I was very focused on exit and we sold for eight times Revenue new so yeah man my basic pitch to people was you're going to work your ass off and I'm going to try and get you to you know e I'm going to try and get you to where your parents were 20 years earlier and if you're looking for balance this isn't that place um if you're really into management or other things tell me and I'll I'll I will try and like shape a a role around what's important to you but we are a small business going Allin to try and create economic for us and our families with prop te media we're about 14 people now I purposely didn't take outside Capital I'm not on that hamster wheel again I'm not trying to Jones for an exit I'm trying to build something interesting that has relevance that has a little bit more impact on the social issues we think about and also pay our people really well I used to pay people below market and give them equity and I was throwing nickels around like there manle covers because I wanted to have a profitable company I could sell now my priorities have changed and the people who join the company I tell them this isn't the kind of company that gets sold but what I'll do is I'll share I'll give you Equity or participation in my book deals you know you are a junior analyst you get one or two% of any book deal I get you get you know try and create some economic upside for them my natural starting point is that people come to work to develop Economic Security for them and their families to increase the currency their currency in the marketplace experience and also to develop relationships the workplace is a great place to meet friends mentors additional you know co-founders and we spend a lot of money on we saved with Co we gave up our office we save about 8 or $900,000 a year on an office because of course as a narcissist I had to have this amazing office in SoHo which is stupid and I have this rule at work or not this rule to but this benefit if any four of them are together they get my credit card they can go to Broadway or they can go to Tulum and they've done those things without asking my permission as long as there's four of them they got my credit card and the number one source of retention I think the key to building a small business is retention because if you find good people you just don't want them to be with you a year or two years and go to Google because the switching costs are enormous and if you find someone good your job as an entrepreneur or the CEO is just to create an environment where they want to stick retention of employees in my opinion is just huge and I find or I read a study another study on this and it said the number one source of retention or the number one lever for retention people think it's compensation people think it's culture it's whether or not that person has a friend at work if they have a friend at work they look forward to going to work and they are less likely to leave and so what I try and do everybody interviews everybody when we hire people but these kids it's really inspiring they'll go they like six of them will go on vacation together they'll say oh Scott you're speaking in hurg Germany all six of us are going to come and and they have a great time together they like each other and it's really it's a powerful kind of business weapon if you will now I don't think you can do that with it's a company scales Beyond 50 100 people um but I found for a small business it's really powerful hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database it's totally free if you just click the link in the description below you can go download a collection of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated and so uh what are you waiting for go download it it's free check it out it's in the description below all right back to the show and is the trick there that you don't try to be their friend because I've had that problem before where I'm I wanted to be the friend and that made the management a little bit messy uh and I realized it's it is much better for me to not be the friend and not be included in in the the hangs uh the whole company functions better even though even personally I was like oh man they're all going out without me but actually it was far better that it went that way I always had a healthy sense of what the the Border was me me and my kind of my president of my committee and the partner at L2 we're both about the same age and we have the same view we have parties all the time we show up early as soon as [ __ ] starts getting a little like crazy we leave yeah we a we don't need to see them see them drunk they don't they definitely don't need to see me drunk and my attitude is what you're interesting or what you're saying Sean is really interesting and that is I'm just coming to the realization as a dad um I'm not their friend I'm their dad because it was really upsetting to me that my kids did kind of I don't want to say they don't want to be my friend but I just naturally assumed that my kids would adore me and be really into World War II history and Crossfit because that's what Dad is into and guess what they're not and what I realize is I'm not I'm not their friend I'm there to be their dad and it's kind of the same way I think I work with such young people I think the you know the average age is probably 30 or 34 because I'm there but the mean or the median is like 25 it's basically a bunch of kids overeducated super ambitious kids and it's easy they're doing dinner and drink somewhere I show up for dinner I leave before dessert and then they can you know they can enjoy each other without thinking they're being judged by by Scott uh so yeah I don't I don't I don't um I draw sharp relief between um you know work and fun with those guys I I love it I go out with them but I go out for the first couple hours and I then I disappear so they can they can have their own fun I love the uh if four of you together you get my card that's amazing little tidbit uh I'm I'm here to collect little lessons learned from you today and that's uh that's one immediate one for me thanks manam so like obviously you're kind of you're I don't I don't know if you're at the peak but you're you're at you're kind of killing it right now in terms of your pod and kind of being a public figure the books and everything and then before that you had the company so you had a huge financial outcome one of the things that I think gets kind of brushed over in your history is what you were doing with kind of being an activist investor I know you were on the board of New York Times and you made a few other like pretty like substantial Investments I know you working with the hedge fund uh to do that what were some of the deals that you were doing what were some of the kind of the best deals what were some of the worst deals what were some of the signals that you had where you uh were like this is an interesting deal I should pounce on this sure so there's a bit of a backstory there I started coming to go Red Envelope I went public I was on the board I got into a fight with arguably the most successful venture capitalist in the world spoiler alert he won the fight I was kicked off the boards I was kicked out of the band that I started which was like emotionally and mentally very taxing for me and then I got angry I was a really weird time in my life my mom was dying and I moved in with her and during the day I would take manage her health care at night she was living in Vegas I'd go to downtown and get shitty drunk with strippers and quote unquote friends and then go back and manage my mom's Healthcare and watch everyone loves Raymond and jeopardy with my mom it was a strange time in my life I was also very angry because I'd just been kicked off the board of Red Envelope so I took a half a million dollars of my money and I filed a proxy to replace the entire board and I learned everything about activist investing and shareholder governance and I tried to kick everyone off the board and I own 10% of the company and I think I got 12% of the vote and my proxy solicitor said the 2% was probably a mistake so basically no one voted for my slate and that was kind of a low moment for me like okay now the world has told me they don't want me involved in this Corporation or in public companies and then 6 months later I got a call from a hedge fund that said you're crazy but you're are kind of crazy we have some stakes in companies and we need someone to kind of go in and rattle the cage and it just struck me that at your lowest moment you really don't know where that might lead and um I got backed I went into a company called I bought 10% of a company called United retail which was a plus-sized clothing brand I basically showed up and said let me build your website you don't have a website this was a while ago where I'm going to try and replace the board they said fine stock went from 2 to eight and I'm like wow this is easy then I did it at Sharper Image bought a big stake there went in there the company seemed like a mess stock had gone up a little bit I got out I did a Gateway computer went on the board there that was more difficult we made a small amount of money but I never lost money doing it so then I went and raised $700 million and became the largest shareholder in the New York Times and went on the board there and timing is everything and in this case I went on the board in March of 2008 and the stock went from 16 to three in about 5 months at one point I think I was losing 10 or 12 million of other people's money every day and we almost lost the business the company almost went bankrupt I don't know if you guys remember that but in the world of media people just stopped advertising they just stopped it was like our tap of Revenue just got turned off and it was sort of the great financial recession it kind of ended my career as an activism because one I don't think I was very good at it and two I was getting to a stage in my life where I just didn't want to be combative anymore I didn't want to go to war with CEOs I didn't want to I was just exhausted by being an antagonist I thought I'm never going to go on a board again unless the co wants me there so but I did that for a while I learned a lot I made a little bit of money but you know I was I was in my early 40s and quite frankly just trying to figure out a way to make a living so I could stay in New York which isn't easy and you know I think I was flailing a little bit um but it was it was a great experience I learned a lot about human nature about shareholders about governance I get called a lot by Boards when they're being challenged by an activist because I was one and I I think I have some insight into how these people think yeah it was just a strange time in my life um U but it was you know it was it was interesting it was it was fun I just wasn't very good at it yeah that's cool you've had a bunch of different careers and uh I like that I like variety I like people who have different chapters and sagas of their life and and you mentioned like like your 20s are for figuring out what you actually like to do or what you're actually good at um or the intersection between those two it sounds like yours went past your 20s and you just kept experimenting uh you know along the way is that is that a fair fair assessment for you yeah Investment Banking no good at it business school started a a brand strategy firm called profit grew it to a couple 100 people sold it for 33 million what do I want to do I know I want to teach um the implosion it took me to you know from what I thought was being wealthy to not being wealthy teaching wasn't going to help me or help me maintain the lifestyle I needed or wanted to maintain with two young kids in New York so I needed to find other ways to make money and I did the hunting for a while did boards and then saw an opportunity and analytics and benchmarking and started that company I think 09 or 010 and that was my kind of my big win and the time timing is everything I got swept up into what is the greatest bull market economy in history 08 to present is probably going to go down as the greatest extended bull market run in history people don't understand just what an anomaly the last 16 years have been relative to the history of the market and just as I was coming into my Prime income earning years you know the winds just just just filled up my sales and I caught you know I finally got all the moons sort of lined up if you will but I've always said you know you got to be humble when things work because a lot of your success isn't your fault at the same time I wish I had been more forgiving of myself when things didn't work because I have trouble forgiving myself I struggle with anger and I the person I get most angry at is myself and I have trouble getting past [ __ ] um you know I was on a I was at a book thing last night and I said something and it just came out wrong and I like sitting in bed and I can't get past that one thing it went really well but I can't think that way I focus on what's what's wrong um and that would be my advice to people is be humble when you have WIS because a lot of it isn't you but also forgive yourself because you know again a lot of it isn't you my roommate in college had the poem If on the by by I think Richard Kipling on his wall and one of the great lines of that poem is uh you know if you can meet Triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same uh and that's always stuck with me that's kind of what you're talking about like your greatest triumphs M maintaining the humility and then in your your greatest failures not beating yourself up too much um you're a big proponent of stoicism and that seems like a pretty stoic way to be give us the like you know there's a lot of people listening to this right now that may be familiar with stoicism don't practice don't don't kind of know how it applies to their life like make your pitch what's why is why stoicism matters to somebody well just for your own mental and emotional health and Ryan holiday is kind kind of my yoda on stoicism and he just Stills it this way life is not about what happens to you you can't control that but you can't control how you respond to what happens to you and I've tried to always remember that and I have trouble practicing it but you know the the ultimate stoicism piece of art in modern history or modern media is Brokeback Mountain if you you can't fix it you got to stand it and that is try and focus on the things you can control and you can control your emotions it's very difficult to control what happens to you and you know just also recognize and this is more atheism than stoicism everyone on this podcast everyone we know everyone we care about what they think of us they're going to be dead in a 100 years in the blink of the history nothing you say or do or what anyone else thinks of you is going to matter for very long and something that really is help me when I was embarrassed or I thought I didn't equip myself very well is what you realize is just imagine yourself when someone says or does something stupid you said you think to yourself oh that was stupid and then you go back to thinking about yourself and you know people aren't thinking about you your wealth your failures your successes as much as you are and so the key is just trying to be comfortable with yourself and comfortable in your own skin and not only that really kind of focus on what your spouse thinks of you is your spouse happy do you have a good relationship with your kids because what Twitter thinks of you really isn't that important and because I had so much trouble actually footing my emotions to that logical notion I know it doesn't matter with people on Twitter or the Twitter mom think of me but I couldn't emotionally separate myself from it I don't have those skills so a role model of mine is a guy Nam Sam Harris he's like oh I got off Twitter I can't handle that he's like why don't you get off of Twitter I'm like yeah I can so I sto I'm off of Twitter for the last nine months and it's been one of the most accretive things to my mental health and I didn't like to admit this but I would say five or six weekends where I just got really bummed out by something probably two or three of them started on Twitter and I thought why am I on something that's making me on a regular basis upset and uh there's an addictive nature to it I think it must be just and that's what freaks me out I can modulate it you know can my 13-year-old son and not like that do I even know that he's upset when he goes we have a rule in my house our boys aren't allowed to go into their rooms with their phones alone because I think this thing will can literally take a teenager especially a teenager girl down a rabbit hole and kind of zero to 60 really fast and then start serving her content oh you're worried about dieting well here's extreme dieting tips despite the fact we know you're 510 95 pounds oh you're depressed well here are some videos of people considering suicide we're going to normalize it for you and I don't think parents are really in touch with just how ugly and how fast it gets really ugly so you know I'm trying to be very thoughtful about what it is as a you know stoicism controlling what I can't control and then trying to be in better touch with my emotions and recognize that when you're down it's more about the chemistry in your head than any legitimate reason to be down it's you're going to look at the end of life the biggest regrets my colleague at NYU Adam alter did great research on people who are very near death and paliative care and their biggest regrets are one they'd wish they'd stayed in better touch with friends they wish they'd live the life they wanted to lead not the life Society or their parents wanted them to lead but their biggest regret is they wish they'd been less hard on themselves they wish they'd forgiven themselves they wish they'd allowed themselves to be happy and that's kind of been that's something I've been very focused on it's like okay stop beating yourself up you're going to be dead soon why wouldn't you squeeze as much juice out of this lemon as as as conceivable and like afford yourself the opportunity to be happy and be sad if you need to be but I think of stoicism as again life isn't about what happens to you it's how you respond to what happens to you and decide what is in your control and you know try and try and be good to yourself try and forgive yourself and also just try and be humble you are never more prone to a really big mistake than right after a big win because here's the thing you start thinking you're good at picking stocks you start thinking you're so skilled at work it wasn't that someone senior to you took an interest in you and championed you you start thinking I'm great at real estate I just didn't get get lucky and buy a home at the right time so be try and just try and ignore the market when the market tells you you're a failure and this is personal too you know there's been moments in my life where I thought I don't think I'm ever going to be able to work again I think I have room ruined everything I don't think I'm ever going to make a very very good living I remember thinking saying to my partner at the time let's move to a lowcost neighborhood of Charlottesville or a Raleigh Durham I'm going to teach try and write you know make decent livings and just have a really nice life and my partner's like that's giving up and I'm like well that's not giving up but I thought this is it I just need to substantially downgrade my expectations and I'm I don't mean to say that that's not a great life I remember thinking after my divorce like I don't think I'm ever G to have someone who I can share my life with again I'm like this just is never going to happen to me I'm an unattractive broken man who's never going to find like a partner again I I believe that for a short time and I think that it's important that everybody recognize that you know you are the answer to a firm's problem you can find someone who you can love and is going to love you a great deal the key is getting up putting yourself in a place to success ESS getting out of the house being friendly being risk aggressive surrounding yourself with people and exercise nutrition that makes you feel good about yourself such that when the winds kick up again your sales are up and I've always tried to do that um I've had a lot of failure but I was always had my sales up such that when the winds kicked up again I was in a position to to rumble so to speak because I have a lot I know a lot of people who are very successful and then they hit some failure a personal failure a death of a parent they can't quite get over a divorce a company that fails and they get stuck they can't forgive themselves they can't forgive others they can't for forgive the market or they don't they lose their Mojo whatever it is and two three five years seven years goes on and they just haven't progressed and they start their skills start atrophying their confidence starts atrophying so what say is put a statue of limit whenever anything happen bad happens to you you got to put a statue of limitations on it a parent dies you know within 12 weeks you should still be sad and thinking about your parents but you should be able to you should be able to function you know you go through a real emotional trauma or breakup well how serious was it how much time What's the statute of limitations if business goes out of business okay mourn for a little while what is that two months 3 months but if you aren't better if you aren't back sending out emails trying to raise money going out trying to meet new people whatever it might be within that timeline you need to reach out for help and get unstuck because time goes really fast and your skills atrophy and it's sort of a downward spiral and something I've always been able to do is mourn and move on Churchill said the key to success is the ability to move through failure without losing your sense of enthusiasm and I've tried I've been pretty good at not losing my sense of enthusiasm you're a you're you know you've got brilliant ideas I think you're a good business person but you talk about not just following your passion but your talent and I think that what you're most talented at is communication I've seen you speak live I've seen you I listen to the Pod I've seen your videos you do such a good job at picking really sharp words and sharp phrases and just small examples like a coocher I've noticed that you love that word and I've never heard anyone use it as much as you and I'm like oh I love that word when he uses that word it's it's a beautiful word or you sign your emails with uh uh life is Rich like you you've got beautiful phrases I think that uh I even by the way I even had a chat gbt where I uploaded like 150 of your blogs and I would ask it questions to like help give me like ideas for phrases because you're really good at that who do you steal from when it comes or who you inspired from when it comes to language I mean you seem like someone if I had a guess like you're a George Carlin guy something like that who do you steal like some of your delivery from or inspired by for writing because you're really good and do you have like a a bank of like when you see a phrase you're like oh I'm going to take that phrase and use that somewhere if you don't have a kitchen cabinet of people that you learn enough about that you can mimic them you're trying to play A Team Sport solo you're on the field alone and I didn't figure that out till I was older so I absolutely when I see something inspiring I read maybe one book a year people think I'm well read I'm not but I'll find a book that's really meaningful and I'll try and read it two or three times so I can adopt it into my gray matter like Daniel Conan's thinking slow and fast I've read that book a few times and I know everything about loss aversion Theory I know a lot about the relationship between money and happiness I read observations of the bander by Peter Dreer I read sa Sapient several times I want to like really really you know embed stuff lately I write down things in my phone that I just think are [ __ ] hilarious like jokes you know when my do I wrote down something today as a prank when my doctor walks in I put on gloves I'm going to try that I love my doctor I love the idea of him walking in and me snapping on cloves just to see his reaction um we were talking about Trump today and I saw this great quote that said consequences rarely show up lubed I love that um I just whenever I see something that really I just think you know I I love going out in the public except for that the fact that the public is there you see these things every day and I will write them down and incorporate them into my rap and especially great phrases you know greatness is in the agency of others I remember my VC said that I'm like that just makes so much goddamn sense I'm gonna use that over and over and over so I have a lot of inspiration um I surround myself with really intelligent young people I know that's ages but I think young people have a different frame on things that help me so but to not to not sort of if you're just reading something and not you don't take away stuff you're going to remember you haven't really read it you haven't really absorbed it but it's all all manner of stuff I think um I'm you're you're right I'm totally inspired by George Carlin I think he's fantastic on society I'm inspired by Ricky D I'm inspired by this comedian named Michelle wolf I think she's fantastic but yeah I've read a lot about Muhammad Ali I think he's you know be courageous be poetic but yeah you absolutely every young person should find a couple people they find really inspiring and try and learn everything about them and what they said such that you can kind of turn on Muhammad Ali and you know mateline Albright Secretary of State you know 4 foot1 I find her inspiring around public policy or GE on geopolitics so I've read a lot about her our you know our memory is long and our reach is far I love that she used to say that about America to its enemies right basically a really eloquent way of saying don't [ __ ] with us boys and I just love that this 410 woman only in America can wield you know the most powerful nation in the world in terms of our foreign policy abroad and I found her and she was an immigrant I just found her inspiring so I wanted to learn more about her so I could be her on occasion anyways yeah build a kitchen cabinet of people SC I got a uh my notes app here of my it's called funny phrases and I just I collect these I'll give you I'll give you three of my funny phrases on here they're completely out of context so you won't you won't get it but you'll get it because you do sounds like you do this too when somebody's thick you could say that they're built like a baguette I like that somebody's got the body of a get uh okay next one um if you want to talk about something that other people are avoiding you say look I'm going to address this like an envelope right now that's a dad joke I love that another one would be for CEOs who have bad uh you know a terrible sense of a vision of the future if this CEO was the shooter at JFK he would have die to natural causes I love these little little isms little phrases little sentences I you're goingon to lose this game okay so uh he looks like a suicide bomber that's having second thoughts um this is more serious I absolutely I absolutely love this one this is more true life advice your goal isn't to get the apology but to forgive the perceived debt I love that I love that um I wrote this thing down this is really bad um teaching my son about sex ads so I walked into his room with a banana and a condom and he said what's the banana for and I said I can't get hard on an empty stomach I I literally think that's the funniest [ __ ] that just hit Sam that literally just hit Sam I just think that's so inappropriate and so anyways sorry guys all right I'm I'm not gonna this like getting into a rat battle with Tupac I'm not I'm not gonna I'm gonna put away my swipe file right here even though I just had a good one I'm I'm gonna give up you you win um what are you excited about right now like what are some things that are going on in the world or products or ideas trends like uh you know I think you talk a lot about like you know stuff that's wrong with America with the world with culture with Society but I want to know the opposite what do you what are you pumped about that's not easier for me I mean I'm to be blunt I'm a I'm a glass half empty kind of guy I think a lot about loneliness I think a lot about struggling young men I think about the threats of AI what am I excited about um I have a I work with a really talented group of people that are really inspiring I love the work we're doing I mean I'm I just really enjoy it I get to travel a lot with my kids I got kids that are at a great age and I get to do a ton of fun stuff with them that's really intoxicating you know I'm just I get to have a really nice life at this point and I'm just enjoying it with a partner just really leaning into my kids you know just the Hallmark [ __ ] I'm I'm just really having a nice time with the people closest to me and I'm healthy I got good healthy kids um you know the boring stuff man it's not anything kind of I mean I'm going I'm on my book tour this week I go to La for Bill Maher and then I'm meeting a bunch of college buddies and I'm going to Stage Coach and then I go to Miami for a bunch of speaking gigs and then I go home to London I mean I just have a I have a really nice life right now and everyone I care about is healthy I feel relevant so I just have such a wonderful life and I'm trying to slow time down so I can really appreciate it because you know there's no getting around it but um I I had lunch with Ted Sandos which I realized is a name drop but I'm I'm desperate for for your guys's affirmation but his wife wrote a book on Grief and there's this great line she has this great line and that is um grief is Love's receipts and I just love that I just if you really care about I didn't have a lot of grief until the age of 40 and I realized it was cuz there was no one in my life that I really loved or really love me other than my mom and so you know what I would bless or wish for anybody is they have a lot of grief in their life because what it means is they have loss and when you have loss it's because you had something wonderful in your life and you miss it so I'm just trying to appreciate how just nice things are and really you know I don't you know I'm not really excited about you know the Euro finals in Germany although I am excited about the European finals in Germany I'm just I'm just enjoying myself this is I'm rounding third I have a really nice life right now I'm just trying to enjoy it because I know everything everywhere ends you uh what do you say for people who are not rounding third like uh people who are you know just just batting lead off right now so you you talk a lot to young people one of the the phrases I really liked or one of the quotes I really liked was that opportunity is a function of density he said get to a place that is crowded with success what do you mean by that because that seems like really good advice for for people well in sort of the motivation for the book was you know that study that you are kind of the average of your five closest friends that there's this weird study that peer group the five people you hang out with you end up being the same body mass index you same end up with similar political values same job same neighborhood I mean it's is weird you become the same person what's different though whe there's greater variance is that of those five people even though they make kind of similar incomes one will end up poor three will be okay and one will end up quite wealthy and I tried to understand the behaviors that are in the strategies between the person that ends up financially secure and the the others that are less financially secure and there's some general best practices around youth you absolutely want to get to a city if you're ambitious I'm not suggesting this is the right way it's just my way if you're ambitious and you want to have influence or Economic Security before you collect dogs and kids you got to get to a city two-thirds of economic growth is going to happen in just 20 cities and so if you're really ambitious I mean get to the biggest city in your nation then get to London if you're in Europe or New York in the US or if you're in Tech San Francisco because those cities are really competitive and you're going to be playing you know how when you play tennis against players better than you you your game elevates when you're in a big city you're playing against the best players in the world it's hard to it's hard to live in Brooklyn it's expensive which means you got to be really good at what you do and you're surrounded by people who are going to inspire you and who are really will elevate your game and at some point you'll probably have to move out of the City because it's it's difficult with kids but while you're young get to a big city try and try and find really High character successful people to hang out with just find people you want to be like or that you admire professionally and personally and try and establish those friendships and try and hang out with them because you rise or fall to the level of your peer group and the thing about cities is you're just bumping off opportunities and I've moved to London and my reductive analysis of the US versus Europe is the US is still the best place to make money Europe's the best place to spend it so if you're in the making money part of your life it's hard to beat the US I didn't appreciate the American economy until I left it people start from yes here how can we work together how can we build something together how can we make money together London it's sort of like a very plight indefinite maybe there's very little actual organic value Creation in London it's people servicing other people's wealth that they made elsewhere there's nothing like there's nothing like America that says to a young person if you work your ass off and you're really good and you get a little bit lucky you know you things can happen for you here all my British friends they say that they grew up being afraid of tall poy syndrome meaning uh they didn't want to stick out because their teachers would tell them shut the hell up get in line whereas in America it's if you do something interesting even if you fail you're rewarded as being a hero of like well that's awesome man you got after it even if you even if it sucked the outcome wasn't good you we praise you for getting after it and I think that's a very uh unique American thing compared to Europe in Europe if you stick out you're chastised well not only that but people say in America we Embrace failure that's not true but we do tolerate it and so only one out of seven businesses succeed so my strategy has been to start nine businesses and I got to two wins and all you need is one and if you aren't trying really hard and taking risks failing and then knowing when to pull the plug and move on you're not taking advantage of the American Embrace of risk and failure I've never had trouble raising money because of past failures people didn't mind that as long as you treated your investors well as long you as long as you were a decent person you didn't do anything stupid or unethical people don't have a problem funding you again I'm you know I'm not you know I've had a lot of failure professionally but I've never had I don't you know let me this way when I couldn't raise money it wasn't because I had failed before and that's true in relationships so yeah the Embrace or the acceptance of failure in America is is um it's singular and it's a wonderful thing and if you aren't trying and taking a lot of risk here you aren't taking advantage of an economy that's one of the few in the world one of the few societies um I mean if I was born in China I'd probably be in jail because I'm outspoken and say stupid things if I was born in Europe you know I think I'd be a talented business person but I wouldn't be an entrepreneur that had recognized his success because they don't Embrace failure or that's wrong they don't tolerate it the way we do can I ask you a question about hard work and the reason being is I found I found some what read as contrary things in your work or at least in your story and what you write and so Sean and I have talked a lot about this about hard work and I think people who say they work 80 hours a week for a really long time I think they're either lying or they did a lot of [ __ ] work I think it's to work 80 hours a week for an extended period of time it's incredibly challenging and you talked about uh in in this book as well as some of the other uh blog posts you're saying in my 40s I grinded my ass off all I was focused all I was focused on was money and it worked out and but that's all I did and and I'm happy I did it but it was really hard work but then I read about how uh you delegate a ton I think you said something even as crazy as like you have someone pick out your clothes and you wear mostly the same thing you have your workout outfit and then your work outfit and how uh you at uh prop media you said something like you only meet with your executive producer twice a month you only have one hour meeting once a week with the editorial team you haven't planned vacations in 20 years and all you do is focus on uh uh a handful of things but it even though you're crazy productive now it I don't know does it do you are you still grinding and looking back knowing what you know now could you have gotten to where you've gotten without that 80 hour a week for multiple years work ethic well things have changed dramatically for me now I'm not working nearly as hard um and I hire a lot of people and I'll over not overhire but everyone works hard but I don't I mean when you have a small business and you don't have a lot of money you know you just you got to get everyone needs you need to work hard you need to set an example and you need to uh create an environment where everyone's working hard I'm not sure I was ever working 80 hours a week consistently I definitely had weeks like that but when I look back on it kind of I don't know 10 20 10 15 years I don't remember much else other than work I mean I I worked out when I had kids I tried to spend some time with my kids I still found time for fun and vacations but you know I would vacation two weeks a year now I vacation a lot more than that and but I don't see any way around it it's really my kids when I say my kids my students I'll ask them how much money they expect to be making by the time they're 35 and about 90% of them expect to be in the top 1% which is 700 50,000 a year in America and then they'll talk about that like that's what I expect but I'll say what's most important to you in your life and moving forward and a lot of the time they say balance and I'm like so you expect to be in the top 1% by the time you're 35 but you also believe you're going to have balance in your life I mean I don't I've never seen that I don't you can have it all you just can't have it all at once and and by the way that's that may not be the way to go you may sacrifice you may say I want to live a nice kind of balanced life I'm going to move to a suburb of St Louis coach little league work 40 hours a week be a good citizen find a good partner uh you know coach little league have a nice life nothing wrong with that but the majority of the people I know the young people think they're going to be in the top 1% and also have balance in their life and I just think it's ridiculous I'm like okay the only way to get there to achieve that is if you have one thing and that's rich parents uh otherwise expect to go all in on your career or scale back your expectations around your economics and your influence because it's a competitive market and one of the things people can control is how hard they work I don't think you want to I don't think you want to work so much that you sacrifice your health or your relationships there is going to be some trade-off with your relationships I didn't see my kids a lot when they were little I I was divorced I think it was a contributor to that I was always working in services companies and never saying no to any opportunity the CMO of Samsung can you be in Soul tomorrow for a board meeting sure I can you know I mean I just said yes to everything to try and move the company forward but uh I I for a long period worked very very hard and sacrificed a lot and it it takes a toll and I did it such that I could have a lot more balance now but um yeah I don't I I I this notion the myth of balance get over it if you expect to be influential or economically secure you're not going to have a lot of balance for a long period of time some people are said Geniuses that they can work a modest amount of time make a lot of money work out have a great relationship with their parents be fit donate time at the asbca and have a food blog assume you are not that person so just have a sober conversation and also have a sober conversation with your partner how much money do we expect to have who's responsible for making it what's your approach to spending where are we going to live you know the number one source of divorce is not um infidelity or lack of shared values it's usually got something to do with money and also 70% of divorce filings are filed by women who still and we don't like to say this because we like to pretend women have no agency and that they're just doughy little foes uh is the man loses a business becomes broke or has a mental breakdown when a man loses his status as a provider um he's very inclined to be on the wrong end to divorce so I think a lot about young men I think a lot about financial sec security I think every man should start with the notion that he's going to be responsible for the economic well-being of his household and by the way sometimes that means getting out of the way and being more supportive of your partner who happens to be better at that money thing than you and that's a wonderful thing but start from a position of this is my responsibility um and make sure you're aligned with your partner around this stuff because the thing we don't talk about is that your kids are going to have higher blood pressure if you're economically strained kids and kids in low-income households have greater systolic resting blood pressure than kids in middle and upper income homes you're much more likely to get divorced you're much more likely to have a stroke you're much more likely to be the victim or the perpetrator of domestic violence when you don't have money I mean America becomes more like itself every day and that is it's a loving generous place for people with money it's a rep pacious violent place for people who don't have money so all this [ __ ] that money doesn't buy you happiness oh my God is that a myth I'm not saying you need to be incredibly wealthy but middle- inome people are happier than poor people and wealthy people are happier than middle income people that's the bad news the good news is that tops out you get diminishing returns and you have to be cognizant of when you do get to some level of Economic Security that's the means the ends is such that you can have an exhale release the anxiety that you feel and then then use the opportunity to really spend a lot of time with your your loved ones and cement those relationships and the problem is you get on the hedonic treadmill and you become so absorbed in your own success and your professional identity and money and making more money that you never get to the ends you wake up a wealthy person or someone who's financially scar always thought about their economic well-being and you don't really have a great relationship with your kids or you never really leaned into your partnership and thought okay let's take time to really enjoy each other's company let's do nice things your parents die before you have a chance to really spend time with them as adults I think that happens to a lot of people they just get so caught up and I need the next promotion I need the next amount of money and but once I get here I have someone very close to my life it's a family member and I'm taking them to Africa and they're like making excuses but our kids in the choir they were making excuses I'm like you realize this is your last chance to go to Africa before you're dead right you're 50 [ __ ] years old when are you go when you're 70 but you got to get back to work an extra day I mean what are you thinking we're going to be dead soon and I I just think so many people don't realize how fast it's going to go by and never really never really like super not only super lean into the relationships but just allow themselves just to have a great time I'm going to Stage Coach this week I'm going to go to Country Music Festival I Can't Stand country but I'm going I'm going to buy a pair of boots I'm going I'm going to have a great time and I'm going to do an edible and I'm going to drink a [ __ ] ton and I'm going to have a rested adolescence with my friends and I'm going to look ridiculous and it's like yeah why why not why the [ __ ] not what am I going to do watch C-SPAN all weekend I mean anyway I I can't stand it when people who are blessed with being in this country have some level of Economic Security have people in their life that love them and they love and they don't like crazy lean into it because you guys are younger than I can it just goes so goddamn fast it's just crazy it is just crazy how fast it goes anyways well I don't know how to respond to that Scott here's what I do know I feel like I learned something and I feel a little bit bad inside at the same time I feel a little bit good and you made me feel a little bit bad and I need to go and I need to like burp or something I need to get a little bit out of out of my system I just need to to unwind from that do they not have zolof in London you know I haven't hit the anti-depressant I just did ketamine therapy though that was a trip now I'm trying to I'm trying to just you know like the good news is I hate my life less and less every day so um I'm sort of getting there I'm sort of kid you're like if Mitch Hedberg had a podcast and opened an LLC by we G talk about are we gonna talk about my book do you think I got to number one talking about like doing therapy with you guys on these Joey Bag of Donuts podcast are you going to bring up my book yeah tell us tell us about the book okay we we we talked a little bit about the book but tell us uh the floor is yours make your case as to what I'm gonna get out of this book because I'm gonna buy it and I'm gonna read it thanks for that but I'll read it with a different level of enthusiasm if you give me a little teaser of what I'm going to get out of it okay so the algebra of wealth is the following you know find your talent Focus Workshop your 20s in an industry that will pay you once you have a certain amount of momentum professionally really trying to develop the savings muscle wealth isn't about how much you make it's about how much you spend trying and just get to the point at a fairly early stage where you spend less than you make that is very difficult the brightest companies and Minds in the world are all here to convince you that an upgrade from economy to economy Comfort to economy plus to business classes and investment in yourself no it's not it's a it's consumption don't try and impress other people with your [ __ ] no one's as concerned with your [ __ ] as you are you don't need to order a bottle of vodka at a club for 50 bucks get a Hyundai for God's sakes travel coach save money start saving money early lean in if you're young lean into your advantage and that is you have a lot of time develop that savings muscle diversify the moment you have any real Capital start diversifying that way no matter what happens you have Kevlar you can have a stock go to zero and a bullet hits you in the chest it doesn't kill you because you're Diversified and then take advantage of FL a flaw in the species and that's time and recognize that time time will go faster than you think and if you're just a little show a little bit of discipline a little bit of maturity a little bit of that savings muscle early that the S&P is up 11% a year since 2008 well that sounds boring now that means every 21 years your Investments are up 8X and that 21 years will go really fast so hope you sell a best-selling book hope your company goes public hope you you know your album goes double platinum or some rich Uncle dies and leaves you everything but just in case make sure you're financially secure and I can get you there if you follow these principles and show a little bit of discipline a little bit of maturity because the good news is I can get you rich the bad news is the answer is slowly but we can get you there so the algebra of wealth equals Focus plus stoicism times time times diversification that's the for that's the the formula that's the formula you're the formula guy like you you you've in lot of your talks you use formulas to explain stuff you've had the algebra of Happiness now the algebra of wealth all is this going to be whole algebra of blank uh series because anytime I see that I'm into it if it's an equation I'm into it yeah so humans need constructs to remember things you can read a book and if it doesn't have constructs or visualizations it's pretty easy to forget about it so I really like constructs equations I wrote the algebra of Happiness algebra of wealth out today and I just I'm about to sign a three book deal I'm writing the algebra of masculinity the algebra of work and the algebra of mating those are three topics I'm super interested in and I want to try and do enough research where I can distill it down to some best practices that people can hold on to well I want to talk about the first variable in this you said Focus uh because we talked about stoicism I know about time I know about diversification but teach me about Focus I'm I'm pretty bad at at Focus trying to get better um give me a couple words on Focus as part of this this equation if you have a side hustle you need to find a different main hustle um you're better off with the time spent on a side hustle investing that incremental effort in your main hustle and if you constantly find a side hustle is fine if you're investigating a new main Hustle but the way you get wealthy is not a variety of things it's being really great at one thing so that's the focus and the term we used is is Mastery or ninja likee capability but try and find something you could become great at and that is you know that's not that's not easy but also find again we talked about this before find it in an industry that's not very sexy is if you're in the top 10% of tax law or of installing HVAC or energy efficient HVAC or you're in the top 10% of people who know to how to install soap stone kitchen counters you're going to make a really good living and taking care of your kids is just so much fun being able to be there for your parents is economically is just is just really exciting and a really a lot of fun and I think young people mistake passion for their Hobbies not recognizing when they get older to be able to give money away to be able to do nice things to be able to relax with your partner you know it's just super enjoyable it's almost as fun as you know spinning tun I mean that [ __ ] is fun that is really enjoyable and so put yourself in a position when you're a little bit older because it'll go really fast to just do wonderful things with people you care about and the way you get there is by making more than you spend saving but the first thing you got to do is find a focus you know find something you know we are living we live in a um specialist economy find something like that's your try and just think could I be great at this could I be great at this that's not the question because if you become great at it trust me you'll become passionate about it and you can't become great at anything you hate that's not that's just going to be automatically be screened out I'm not suggesting drudgery is the way if you find something Dr drudger or whatever the term is you're just not going to be great at it but I found Consulting I never I didn't know what Consulting was when I was in college even business school I figured out wait people will pay you to rent your brain wow and I was always really good at establishing these proxy fatherson relationships with powerful men and then basically my core deal with them is I understand brand better than you you're the CMO I'm going to make you the CEO in three years in exchange for that you're going to pay my company a million dollars a year to answer very deep hard questions and I figured that out at kind of my late 20s which was a blessing and then when I sold the company I'm like I don't want to be in Services anymore it's a Young Person's business I'm sick of being on planes so I had to Workshop my life again and then I figured out okay I'm a good teacher what does it mean to be a good teacher means you have to be a good Storyteller but what if I story told in different mediums could I make money in books could I make money speaking could I make money in podcasts and I figured out yeah I'm good at this I could even be great someday and that Mastery has led to a really nice nice life but I've always tried to I've always tried to spend reasonably spend less than I was making sometimes more than others um I finally learned to diversify the hard way I lost everything twice in 2000 and again in 2008 because I thought I'm so awesome that whatever is my focus is just naturally going to be successful through my sheer force of character that's not true so I started diversifying and you know just kind of followed these BAS basic principles and let time take over and really started saving a lot of money in my 40s I deployed an army of capital to start fighting and killing for me and my family and my sleep and that Army just grew in a bull market and you know came home with just immense spoils for me you know because I deployed this Army early and often and I kept adding to it I like here's a tank all right okay I'm saving money I'm not GNA have the fat apartment right okay here's some more artillery go kill more people and come home with money that's a little bit much anyways we're still working off in that one yeah I'm still working through that one wrong choice wrong choice of words accoutrements the accoutrements of my Army Scott thanks for coming on man and uh everybody go buy the book The algebra of wealth he has to be number one on the charts because he needs our affirmation and let's give it to him thanks guys thanks for your success thanks Sam thanks Sean and thanks AR thank you [Music]

all right today we are going to get smarter about short form video short form video is something I am mega mega long on why well I don't know have you ever seen Tik Tok Instagram reals have you seen YouTube shorts these things are taking over the world so today's guest is Jenny Hoyos she is a shortform video genius to be honest I mean every single short she does gets like 10 million views every single one and it's not because she was famous before it's not because she's doing crazy crazy stuff she has just figured out how to make viral short form video so I wanted to ask her every question I could this is an episode of me learning from her the tricks so how does she come up with ideas like how do you figure out a good idea versus a bad idea how does she structure the video how does she script it how does she film it what are the uh elements and the hooks that make the video more viral versus medium viral versus low viral like what is that knob so this interview is me talking to Jenny hoos a 18-year-old short form genius who is going super viral and uh she's going to teach us so in the next hour we're going to get really smart about short all right let's do [Music] it let's jump in we're what we're going to do is in the next I don't know 45 minutes you are going to tell us the specifics the Tactical the breakdown of how you have cracked the viral code you know how to go viral Tik Tok YouTube yeah but you are 18 years old you live at home and your your parents house it's only been 2 years since you started doing a lot of the content that you're doing I went scrolled all the way back and it started off not not so great but then now you're getting like 10 million views per video you've had a 100 million view short that's kind of incredible what is that you is that what what your life is like give people a sense of who who are you yeah you I mean you nailed it right on the head yeah so I'm Jenny hoos I'm a YouTuber who makes videos around the life of a cheap skate I guess you can say I guess you can call me like you know the anti- Mr Beast so you know people call me Mr least yes which is which is amazing branding amazing we've had Mr Beast on here and he's like I spent $3 million per video and I'm curious also when you record uh do you like you know we talk about Hollywood if you ever see an actor in their van or their their truck before they're going to go do a scene they'll kind of get themselves into character they'll get themselves into State of Mind nobody can bother them nobody should go talk to them like they are getting in the zone curious do you do anything to kind of get yourself into a certain state of mind I remember there's a Char Creator called Miss Excel that I I love this story I've told this many times but she creates content of all things about Microsoft Excel how to use it better but like she's super high energy she's like dancing and doing other stuff it's like dancing plus Excel it's a weird combo but it works and she said something like before I go record I'm not like you know I'm not think about what I'm going to say I just get myself into a state where I she she said I feel magnetic like I just get my charisma my my my energy up so high and when I feel like I'm there I run to my camera I turn it on and I start recording because I believe she said I believe that all content is Just Energy transmission it's me pushing my energy through the phone to you the way I feel I'm gonna push it through and then you're going to feel that way too I love the way she described that that's very much how I do this podcast I'm just curious not everybody does things that way is that similar to what you do or how do how do you approach kind of getting in the right State of Mind before you create a piece of content oh my gosh I love this question because I used to struggle with this so much as like honestly an introvert most people wouldn't like see me as one but like yeah the introvert with a billion views yeah like I I don't know I used to do what Miss Excel did basically what you said I used to like try to bump up my energy so that when I film I have like the highest energy but now I try to have like consistently high energy throughout my day every day and I actually built that muscle by doing this thing uh for like a month I would set up my camera for an hour and would do a uh a standup comedy show to myself I I'm like improvised or yeah improvised I've never like I've never done standup comedy I don't know comedy like that's amazing and and I did that just to like learn to not be scared to like tell bad jokes and just like be myself and natural then after that I would like record my entire day almost and like it wouldn't even go online that is fascinating you actually did that you would you would in the morning you would turn on the camera and you would just do a standup routine just to get yourself to feel confident to be okay in the awkwardness and to get your kind of like Charisma reps in is that what you were doing like people go to the gym you were doing that actually okay here's what I would actually do this actually sounds cringe because I've never said it before there's this YouTube channel called Charisma on command so in the morning I'd watch that right and then like throughout the day like I would repeat like the the things I learned in my head and then at night I would do the standup comedy show but like throughout the day would try to record as well just to like get my reps in but that that's essentially what I did I tried to like build up my Charisma and personality just by like recording videos that no one's going to see I don't think that's cringe at all I think that makes total sense um whenever I see somebody who's good at something I don't assume they're just good at it I assume they've worked at this and when you see somebody who's good on camera or somebody who's got a personality that's really you know charismatic I assume it's because they practiced being charismatic maybe they did it informally just in school all the time cracking jokes at the lunch table and whatnot and that's where they got their 10,000 reps but if you don't have that or you're starting as a as an introvert or somebody's bad at it there is a deliberate way to get better just like any skill just like building muscles just like becoming good at you know tennis or whatever whatever else it is and I actually feel I actually look for this I look for things that are really valuable to have but nobody wants to practice it and even worse um people would find it cringe or lame if you said I'm practicing this yeah because I'm like that's a gold mine that is we agreed it's valuable nobody really works on it so if so I don't even have to work that hard to get great at it um to become better than most people at it because most people are not practicing and even worse even if people wanted to practice they'd feel so lame or it's taboo or it sounds cringe or it sounds awkward to do it that's a it's a barrier to entry most people are not willing to do that I hunt down those those skills and I develop them and I it's it's really great to hear you at age 18 doing that same thing that's that's really amazing so you you've said before there's four criteria for an idea novelty uncertainty knowledge gaps and complexity can you explain what this means knowledge gaps is basically telling the viewer I know something that you don't which is why you have to watch or similar to we were talking about before how it's like I did X so you don't have to um and then uncertainty is basically telling the viewer that you're doing something crazy that you don't know what the outcome could possibly be such as like I recently made a video where I sold everything my family owns there's so much uncertainty in how is her family going to react we need to see their reaction to her selling everything you know I'm not a a I'm not so much of a a Tik tocker or YouTuber just yet will be soon but when I write even a blog post or a Twitter thread or something like that I will often put like the central curiosity Gap uh which is basically what what is the person curious about that I can put up front where they're going to want to read to the end to see the payoff Mr P does this in his videos too right he did a video recently which was like I have people age one to 100 uh trapped in these rooms and the last person out is going to win and the curiosity is who's going to win is it going to be the old person is it going to be the young kid that actually is something that comes down to the video idea itself because when I'm brainstorming an idea we want the idea itself to have so many questions that need answered because at the end of the day like content creation on YouTube what piques people's curiosity is a problem that needs to be resolved at the end of the video or a question that's going to get answered at the end of the video and that's what I try to do in all of my videos so let's look at one of them so 23 million views you have what does $1 get you at Starbucks like literally the title is the question the unresolved question yes I don't know what can you get and I guess it's more like what's the most you can get for the but for the buck right how do you get the most bang for your buck that's kind of brilliant okay who has the best dollar menu 3.1 million views also unresolved which which place is it going to be and you can see literally the first frame is like you holding a dollar bill with Burger King behind you and it's kind of like you know you could see what you're going to do you're about to test visually you could see you're going to test what can I buy with this dollar at this place um so the unresolved question is kind of interesting the other thing I like that you do that I don't know if you have any thoughts on this but like it seems like you weave in your personal life or your personal stories so it's not just like I'm goingon to do this crazy thing it's it's like it's my mom's birthday and I want to get her a gift and then you do the crazy thing but at least the video is more like I don't know I I kind of connect with you more I see your mom I like that you're buying your mom a gift you're kind of earnest about it is that a tactic that you think about you know kind of a personal story versus just a generic stunt totally I think that's what makes the videos like quite frankly there's so many people who can do the same idea and it just doesn't go as viral because they're not telling a story and that's why I try to weave in like my personal life because it's more relatable more people comment about it that's how we get that returning viewership hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have Doug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show so what's an example of a video you did with a story that you could have done without okay the best example I have was I have a video where I made a garden on a budget and you know and if you search up other people's videos making a garden they were averaging like 20,000 views like people who make gardening vide videos don't average high views so what was the difference how did you get if a normal garden video 20,000 views your garden video 20 million views what did you do to to juice that video up I told the story of how Ratatouille is my favorite food but it's so expensive to buy it but technically speaking I could just make a garden to have infinite Ratatouille for life and it's my it's my favorite food so it just works out and then also my mom and my grandma were helping me for a portion of the garden it just interweaved so many things that the people can insert themselves into right so you took a normal thing with medium to low stakes you added your why why I care about this and the why doesn't have to be life or death I think that's kind of important I think uh you know a lot of the YouTubers did it as life or death it's like this is you know the craziest stunt you've ever seen and I think Ryan Tran and you you I think you guys are very very likable because it's almost like low stakes Stakes oh a th% especially like now on YouTube people are so used to like these high stakes like seeing $10,000 in a title anymore people don't even know what that even means because they're seeing people like Mr Beast spend a million dollars so it's like you know people are just so numb to these numbers or these Stakes where almost these low stakes are high stakes right okay so let's take a Let's do an example here's an idea and let's try to make it better using some of the some of the techniques we'll just rip on this and see see where it goes live live improv here okay so um let's say I want to make a video about me um me making dinner so I'm cooking dinner one out of 10 you know video concept it's not not going to be the most exciting let's use show me how you would make it better so let's use either novelty complexity knowledge gaps or uncertainty how would you kind of make that idea more interesting I love this so for me if I was to make that idea making dinner right intrinsically not intriguing at all but what's relevant to me is how much of a struggle it is as someone who has like a health condition right so like that's one angle right then there's also the angle of like you're doing it on a budget which is what I usually do so that now that that that's even more of an intriguing angle like trying to make a healthy meal on a budget because healthy is supposed to be expensive right or or it could be um it could be I'm trying to make a fancy dinner but I don't know how to cook that too or I'm I'm a total beginner but I'm going for Gourmet yes exactly and then like there's so many different layers and I also love to do juxtaposition where it's like okay I want to make a gourmet dinner with leftovers from last night or or like a Lunchable or something like that right exactly turning a Lunchable into Gourmet then you know all of these are great ideas and then at the end of the day it's like which one makes you most excited gotcha okay cool and then the personal story part would be why am I making the dinner in the first place why does this matter to me what are the stakes so you we made the idea more interesting by adding the contrast the just deposition the complexity the novelty but then the personal story might be um I invited my mom over for dinner she's cooked for me my whole life I told her I was going to cook her an amazing meal only problem is I've never you know I'm an adult now I moved out of the house but I've never cooked dinner for anybody I've never hosted guess I got to do it the story is even better now because there's even an angle where what if you the video is something along the lines of like you're going to turn a lunch of ballls into a dinner aows because lunch of bowls they don't have a dinner option it's just lunch a bows right and then what's even better is your mom would always would never cook for you but she would always give you lunch of bowls for lunch so now for dinner you're going to give her lunch bowls I mean it sounds a bit complex but like as you script it you know remember like with complexity the goal is to like add layers to give people more reasons to watch but you don't want to actually confuse the viewer and that kind of comes back in with the way you copyright it because you want to say it in a way that's you know easy to digest and drip feed that context right yeah I was when when we were hanging out with Mr Beast and he was telling us about some of his video ideas what I realized was I was like man the reason his videos can get 100 million 200 million views is because it's a concept so simple you could literally just draw it with a stick figure drawing and people would get it two people who don't know each other trapped in a room for a hundred days winner you know if they if they make it the whole way they get a million right these are like simple Universal easy to understand ideas the what you just did with the Lunchables dinner bles thing is both the kind of like that that Amusement like I'm doing this just for my own Amusement I'm not doing this to impress you um I'm I'm doing this to scratch my own itch can I can I do this and like I think that's very likable and also very simple to understand I think that's I turn Lunchables into dinner visually you can imagine that yeah okay that's great all right I'm excited for you to go make that video someday all right so we got ideas and how to how to basically brainstorm to turn any kind of mundane idea into a better idea using using those techniques now actually pulling it off so delivering on it so what is the most important part what's the first thing you do when you're when you you have the idea now first thing you got to get right in order for a video to pop off the hook and and it the Hook is so important that sometimes I figure out the most viral hook isn't the most viral idea so then I have to come back to the idea and change the idea based on the hook when you think about hooks I guess like what is the what is the big picture advice when it comes to hooks and then what is the Tactical process you take power words should be the first thing that starts the video what's a power word what do you mean power words are things that will instantly hook people that are very strong words such as free zero dollars stole or any like crazy word uh because be and the reason I say that is because I see a lot of people like way too many people start their videos with this is I'm out this is it's not telling me anything about about the video like I'm I I actually scroll cuz it's like it's bad as opposed to if someone says free chicken sandwiches all weekend I'm in where are these free chicken sandwiches I was in the moment you said free so that's the number one thing you want your your hooks to start with power words the second thing is you want it to be progressing the video the reason why this is is also bad is because it is just saying a statement it is not doing anything this is blank doesn't tell me what you're going to do it's just telling me a statement as opposed to free chicken sandwiches this weekend you're already telling me the whole story or I'm building a secret room you're already telling me the action even though the even though the power words aren't until three words in secret it still works because it's starting with the action I'm doing blank I'm going to do blank the story is progressing as opposed to a statement being stale that's second thing and uh another thing that's very crucial for hooks or in your general like introduction of your video is to foreshadow the end your hook has to be so clear what the video is going to be about you're not only setting up the video but you're also seeing what the conflict is and what's going to be at the end of the video all in one sentence which is very hard but that's what a really good hook has so I have an example here of one of yours you have one that says movie theaters are overpriced you said that's the hook and then the foreshadow is so I'm going to make a movie theater at home on a budget of only $5 exactly yep exactly you nailed it you want your hooks to have the setup conflict and what the resolution is going to be all inone what metrics in a video map to that so like for example um you know on YouTube in a normal YouTube video the thumbnail and the title matter and you know that because you could see the uh click D rate how many people actually choose to try to watch your video when it comes to short form video what metrics are the you know top two that that are related to idea and hook yeah so the idea hook metric would be the viewer swipe away percentage view versus swipe away and what is like good and then what's like amazing for that percentage that that number yeah so I've heard the average is 70 where pretty good for me is 80% plus and excellent would be 85% plus but for for for my channel we average around 80 85% which is not is very uncommon like I think beasts is like at 75% so I've heard and then the second one is like the uh so you have the the viewers swipe away and then what's the next most important metric retention retention overall yes retention I'd say is that it just shows how how much the viewer enjoyed the video what do you shoot for with retention it depends on the video length but generally you want to be at at least 90% on my team we usually go for 95 plus wow and uh again I I think for most people it's like 15% or something crazy crazy low Okay so so the hook at the first frame uh what about the visual what works in the actual visual because there's with short form there's no thumbnail and people aren't really reading the title I don't think so what's your what's your philosophy on how what to put on screen what that first frame should look like yeah I try to keep it as simple as possible it's very similar philosophy to like a title and thumbnail same psychology in a way where I try to keep it like little to no Focus points High brightness High saturation and we like we'll go through we'll go through so many lengths and measures and after effects and V effects just to make it like pop out just that much more such as like sometimes We'll add artificial fire just to make it look crazier like one in in one of our shorts I went to Hell's Kitchen but that you don't really get that message across unless you actually add the restaurant on fire you know and it's like something as little as that up at the logo of the restaurant it looks like there's a fire is that not real there's no fire there real that's not real people think it's real yeah so we try to we try to make like things really stand out even with the secret room when I first hit the wall I just dented the wall I didn't even break a hole and we actually had to make a VFX where it would look like I made this giant hole like I broke a giant hole when in reality it wasn't a giant hole that broke it was like a little teeny tiny hole because I had like a a little small Hammer so it's like little stuff like that we try to make we try to enhance things to look even crazier in post interesting and so what was the first thing you said no no little to no Focus points what does that mean so what I mean by that is we don't want any busyness to go on I think you know it's a really good example if you can show who has the best dollar menu like in the first frame just pause it and notice that that is not a real environment like we actually took myself we rotoscoped myself and then we found a image of McDonald's on Google that was so much cleaner that had no cars the logo was clean there was no trees just so it could be perfectly like just look perfect for the viewer if that makes sense that's what we to do we want the environment to look as clean as possible so there's no busy points so all right so great so we've done idea uh how to go from meh to good to Great we've done to hook how to grab them by the throat get that 80 80 plus percent uh view rate now you said foreshadowing is the next part what is foreshadowing and how do you do it because I this is one that I've heard obviously I've thought about the ideas I've thought about hooks uh this is not something I do in my process what is foreshadowing foreshadowing is when you give a viewer the expectation of the end of the video and the way I've coined it is you basically want to tell the viewer that there's an Amazon gift card at the end of the video essentially like they need to watch till the end sometimes you'll have to explicitly tell the viewer oh you'll get blank at the end of the video usually a lot of my foreshadowing is implied so who has the best dollar menu it's very implied that by the end of the video I'm going to tell you who has the best dollar menu essentially and that's that's usually the best foreshadowing one that's like so obvious because it's within the hook and it's implied but even better even stronger foreshadowing and hook is when you have a mechanism so an example of that is what is $10 get you in Miami now not only do you know by the end of the video what $10 get to you in Miami but you also know what how I spent the $10 now the mechanism is actually seeing the money being spent because in the first second you see oh she spent $2 at an $8 budget and then a couple seconds later oh now she's at five and we have a sense of progression of where the video is going because otherwise if the viewer does not feel like the video is constantly progressing then they're going to leave because they don't feel like even though you said that there's something at the end they don't know where the end is so it's also very important to make it clear let's talk about storytelling uh you have a great quote you said what is storytelling storytelling in one word is change yes unpack that what does that mean I think the biggest thing is progression I I guess when I say change I mean progression so similar to what I was just saying like the viewer wants to feel like they are constantly either learning or laughing even more or they are building towards something they don't want to feel like you know they're watching something stagnant like they're just watching paint dry the best storytelling is when there's character development change in the actual character where at the beginning of the video the character started at one point and is now at a new point at the end so I I subtly did that in my short that hit 100 million views so basically I built a secret room with $ Z and my goal was to have a secret spot to watch YouTube and in the beginning of the video my mom was yelling at me for destroying the house and how there's nothing under there like I'm crazy what am I doing and then at the end of the video she ended up having the secret room and pretending like it was hers now it was very subtle but like change like that is what actually made the viewers not only watch till the end to see how that gets resolved but also rewatch the video again knowing that yeah that's interesting what and rewatching that's that's like a big part of your strategy right to get it's number number one is hook number two is overall retention which is video progression and number three is rewatchability what gets somebody to rewatch there's not that many things that get people to rewatch so it's it's probably the toughest thing to do uh so there you could you could do Easter eggs which is essentially like hiding little things in the video that people are going to comment about and potentially watch again to see like did did that actually happen yeah I do that all the time I like a video I open the comments then they reference something that I didn't see the first time so I end up watching it again yes and then I go back to the comments and I and it's still looping in the background and I probably end up watching the video three times exactly so that's one way another very easy way to do it is just tutorial videos in itself are rewatchable because people are especially if it's on shortes people are not going to watch a tutorial once and automatically know all the steps so usually when you have specific steps or lists or listicles is what it's called it makes it very easy to rewatch and then and my favorite method is actually having twists in your videos because when you have a Twist now the viewer is going to want to re-watch the video with that new knowledge knowing what the twist is that's interesting I like that um what about uh storytelling mechanically so you know what are some techniques I know you've talked about this uh I think the the butt there method which I I did you get that from the South Park guys yes I did yes I did uh explain explain what that is yeah so buto storytelling is basically adding conflict throughout the video so that it makes it more intriguing as the video continues so an easy example is if I made a video going on a walk let's say very bad idea but you know I went on a walk and then it started raining and then I kept walking and then I kept walking and then like like there's nothing there's nothing new that's like really happening because it's just you just keep doing things it's like and then this and then that like that's such a boring story as opposed to constant conflict being created when you say but so so for example I was walking but then it started raining so I had to find an umbrella but I'm in the middle of nowhere and don't know where I am so I went to pull out my phone but uh my phone is dead so I started running and you see what I mean like the story feels more intriguing because you're instantly adding more conflict and you're instantly finding that conflict much easier by simply saying but so yeah there's a great clip of the South Park guys doing this where they have a story written on a whiteboard and they just cross out all of the ANS they're like this is how toddlers tell stories when it you know they came from from school it's like and then and then this happened and thisen and then then miss she gave me this and then this and then I got candy and then this and he's like just cross out all the ANS and just try to replace them with but and you know but so right so but this I wanted this or I was doing this but then this happened so then I was forced to do this but then I another obstacle so then I tried this other technique and all of a sudden like any story can become interesting just using that like that's probably one of the highest leverage techniques that just changes the interestingness of a story um another one is Stakes do you use stakes in your story I know like uh you know basically what's on the line why does it matter that you do this um I know a short is so so small in length so you know you can't build it up in the same way you can build up a movie or a documentary but have you used that or do you play with that idea yeah I love using stakes and the way I see Stakes is also like including a y right and usually with Stakes it's either like artificial or just like a personal why but for the most part I usually try to make like real Stakes I kid you not like we always default to like what what's actually happening in my real life that we can actually include as real Stakes so for example in that secret room video it's like the initial why and the initial Stakes are you want to watch YouTube your mom's not your mom's yelling at you saying you're watching too much YouTube so you're trying to build a secret room exactly but then by the time you take the sledgehammer to the wall the stakes have actually elevated it's like oh my God she's breaking down her house she better pull this off or else you know now you thought YouTube was a problem breaking the wall is going to make her mom even more mad right so you you know the best stories actually increase the stakes over time yes and we want the viewers to be at the edge of their seats at all time like I know this conversation is like primarily on shorts but like even on like my recent long form the stakes were incredibly High where I sold everything my family owns and and the stakes were were basically like this is what kept the viewer at the edge of their seat where it's I'm selling everything without my family knowing and I'm going to keep selling bigger and bigger items until they notice but when they do I'm going to give them all the money I make to prove that uh cash is better than trash essentially so now like it's like it's a crazy idea Stakes are high because her she can get in big trouble with her parents and then it's like you know when is she going to get caught how far is she going to get and while I'm saying all this I'm showing clips of like me taking the microwave and a bunch of decor and moving furniture out of the house and like it's like oh my gosh this is legit like this is crazy right things are getting messy now right um yeah like the you know even great TV shows Breaking Bad for example so what's the change he's a high school teacher kind of a pushover um pretty boring life then he gets diagnosed with cancer he knows he's going to die and that his family is going to be left with no money so big Stakes all of a sudden okay but he's a high school teacher so where is he going to get money so he decides to you know deal drugs basically to sell drugs in order to get money but he doesn't know anything about making drugs so he goes and he meets his high school you know former high school student but that guy's a drugie so he doesn't know anything so this guy takes over and actually creates a proper lab out of it but the the cops come after him right that's the story and along the way the stakes get bigger and bigger at first it was he needs a little bit of money then it's oh the the you know the dealer that he's working with tries to to Rob them then it's the DEA after him but then the DEA is his brother-in-law and it just goes on and on and eventually he's running this Empire and the stakes have gotten even bigger now it's life or death and um you know he's sitting on millions of dollars and so the stakes escalated which is why a lot of people consider Breaking Bad one of the greatest shows because it did that so well um yeah I want to recap we started off saying let's build the perfect short we did idea and how you how you could tag the idea to make it take a a meh idea and make it more interesting then we have the hook the first frame how do you grab their attention and get you know 80% of people to actually watch versus just swipe away you have foreshadowing which is hinting at what's to come the payoff the promise of what might might come at the end and then you have the retention the storytelling what keeps you hooked what keeps you engaged that sense of progress as the video is going on last thing is the ending so how what's the end of this perfect short that we're creating what what do you how do you think about an ending and how do you what do you do in your endings I noticed some of them are kind of like abrupt I'm not sure if that's intentional or not yeah so a lot of people on short form content will sometimes not even give a payoff because their retention would be like crazy high because they would have no drop offs but at the end of the day there is no viewer satisfaction if you just like don't give a proper payoff so my intention with endings is to keep it as short as possible while giving some sort of payoff even if we have some sort of retention drop because our goal is to ensure viewer satisfaction so then next time the viewer knows she's at least going to complete the story at the end of the video so not frustrating exactly so we want the payoff to feel so good and the way it's called is Peak there's there's a theory called Peak and Theory where essentially you dictate your emotions or feeling or opinion towards something based on the ending so like just like you would watch a movie you can be bored for the whole thing and then like the last 30 minutes was really good and those 30 minutes will dictate your feelings throughout the entire movie you would say that was the best movie I've ever watched even if the first half you hated it right just because the ending is the last thing that you remember so that's why we want the endings to feel intense emotion so just close it off with either uh strong wholesomeness or like just like the funniest moment in the entire video um and a lot of the times we like to do twists just because they'll have great rewatchability essentially interesting interesting um so that's the that's the perfect short now let's talk about the process so you know you've done some interesting things I I I've heard you talk about getting ideas you're like I got thousands of ideas for shorts you know steal like an artist what does it mean to steal like an artist and and what have you done to to kind of steal like an artist to generate lots of lots of great ideas yeah stealing like an artist is essentially taking inspiration and rather than actually recreating video ideas so for the most part what I mean by that is it I I usually steal from like topics or like different movie techniques as opposed to like taking actual IDE ideas cuz I don't know I feel a little icky doing that well it's steal like an artist not a steal like a thief right so like steal like a thief is you take the exact idea from something directly in your lane and you just copy it yeah exactly you copy it word for word frame for frame there's people that are doing that still like an artist I think is you find inspiration from things direct but also indirect adjacent spaces right um and then you put your remix on it you have to find a way to add your twist um to that same base idea yeah I think I think the the easiest example where I stole like an artist is I'm very inspired by like what Mr Beast does like like he genuinely is like changing people's lives he's philanthropic you know he's making people happy and it's like how could I do that with the Jenny hoyo twist and it's quite literally doing what he does but on a budget I think that's like the best example just like I when whenever like I want to take inspiration from someone I try to find what's my unique perspective that I can add to it that's great you you've also um done like built some tools I think you like scrape you scrape uh data off these platforms so that you're able to analyze a bunch of videos um and you're looking for some kind of outlier I would assume or you're looking for something in that data can you describe what you did and and what you look for so you know like like you said my team has built a bunch of tools and the goal for that is to understand our viewer psychology so recently our number one goal is to increase subscriber conversions because we have over a billion views um and two million subscribers where the average person would have like 10 million subscribers so we're like okay we let's increase our subscriber conversions and essentially what we did was we created a tool where we took all my videos and I manually labeled what I did in each of those videos so some of them were labeled as had my family in it other videos were labeled as malicious content so me pranking other were others were labeled as like wholesome and Etc like I just labeled every video every video with any possible thing the video could be about and a bunch of different like things we did for example if I mentioned YouTube or if I said subscribe or literally anything that could have happened I labeled them manually and then we put them in a graph and a chart to see the subscriber conversions on that specific video to find how I can maximize subscriber conversions and doing something like that we found that I double my conversions when I have my family in the videos and specifically when I'm making wholesome content where I surprise them such as like you know uh giving my mom a birthday present for example would have twice the amount of subscriber conversions but then wow because we have these tools actually what what what's interesting though is you know if you don't have this tool the average person would see on my it'll be like on my YouTube Studio they could be like oh you got double the amount of subscribers so you should do that but that's not necessarily the case because what we found was I got double the subscriber conversion but 10x less the views when I do that I actually get my regular conversions when I do malicious content but 10x the views which actually means I'm getting 5x more subscribers which in theory means that's actually what's going to get me more subscribers it's basically little things like this that we're building tools for to find how we can maximize uh views retention viewer satisfaction and Etc one of the other things that uh I really liked was when you describe you're studying the platform and you're like I will go look at a channel and I look at a short and you know if I see a short that has 10 million views that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best concept if the person on average gets 10 million views exactly but if they on average get 10 and this video gets 30 it's an outlier concept for their Baseline and then you looked at all those outliers to figure out the differences between gr ideas versus just normal ideas is that right correct yeah it's it's all relative how did you do that what what did you do do that manual did you just go Channel by Channel and just try to look at their view their their VI accounts what did you do yeah unfortunately that was all manual so usually the way I find these outliers is by going to trending every single morning every morning I will go on to the trending page and I'll watch every single trending short that's like your your morning routine yeah and my nighttime routine because it it's like they change it and my lunch routine I'm always doing that that's exactly what's crazy is too once you get used to it you actually don't have to like just rely on trending cuz now my shorts feed is just a bunch of trending shorts because I watch trending every morning and night now when I go on the shorts feed I find trending like content as well and um and then I have a swipe file which is what I actually learned from the books Ste like an artist and I have a swipe file that I'll put all these things in if I want to Ste like an artist I want to ask you a couple more questions tactical questions one um audience so do you you know there's there's different theories in marketing they're like you need to have a Persona or a Target Target avitar there's other people who say I'm just making for me um there's other people who say you know you should do a market analysis and find the the biggest Market possible and then a psychographic analysis what they care about blah blah blah all right that's you know what what do you do you're you're actually winning what do what do you do when it comes to audience yeah so I used to have my younger self as my avatars and you know I think you can go pretty far doing that but I realized if I want to get to 100 million subscribers like I need to have multiple avatars and now at this point like I don't necessarily talk to one specific person I'm just trying to cater to every audience it's like I guess long story short I used to do all that market analysis but now I don't so yeah so what do you use as the guiding principle now just like kind of what what would anybody what would everybody be interested in is that the the different a different question yeah the guiding principle is making content that's intriguing for kids because at the end of the day like that's the biggest audience on YouTube while making it mature enough for adults to also watch so you know there's a lot of kids content where people are screaming it's like how do I make kids centered content that isn't screaming and is a little more like natural yeah like you know Pixar did this amazingly right pix did it made movies that a eight-year-old and 80-year-old can both go and enjoy and maybe for different reasons but it's one product it's one piece of content that just appealed to such a to totally different age groups exactly that's exactly what I'm trying to do and I think it helps having my mom in the videos too like I try to have her as much as possible because people can relate to me coming from a young perspective or people also watch us because they see my mom and they're like oh you know I watch the videos because it's like it it kind of reminds me of me and my daughter you know it's like it gives the viewers multiple reasons give me your take on where you think this all is going so um it's amazing that every platform is now short form video it's amazing that people are getting millions and million you can you've got a video with 100 million views that number is is bananas um but also I think people are trying to figure out how to switch to long form and a lot of people are kind of using their shorts to try to get to that because maybe they sense that the shorts is not building as much loyalty or trust you know the algorithm picks what you see not you going and seeing the people you've chosen to follow necessarily so where do you think this all goes like five years from now what does this look like where do you think the puck is heading uh or what are your kind of predictions for what you think where you think the value is or what you think are maybe some misconceptions other people have take any of that of like where do you think this all is going I'm just curious to hear your takes I feel like I feel like it's going to be like the extremes that do well in the sense of like I think either short form content is going to be continuing to grow or really long form content 20 minutes plus is going to deep or really quick value yes really deep or really quick value like you kind of don't want to be in between exactly that that's genuinely like where I think it's going to go yeah I I think I think social media is going to kill Hollywood honestly so let me ask you about you now so you um you're obsessed is that fair to say yes I'm I have a very obsessive personality it's scary did you get a obsessed about other things is this the first thing you've become obsessive about or did you like get obsessed with some video game before that I'm obsessed with I get obsessed with everything it's it's a problem it's a problem or it's a benefit it's it's it's both it's both yeah and what is your what's your goal with this like I guess you know people ask me this all the time they're like so when people get like a like a million views or 10 million views do they get money from that is that the is that are you getting rich off this is that the goal with this um you're 18 what do you what do you want out of this what's your goal yeah so I'm basically living to fulfill my childhood dreams it's as funny as it sounds like I started my YouTube channel when I was 8 years old like I I am literally living the dream and like I just want to keep like achieving my childhood goals which is like it's kind of cringe probably to say but like quite frankly like that that that is the goal and ideally like honestly like I really do want to inspire people to understand the value of money and to not be so spoiled because you know when I was a kid I didn't understand the value of money and I would always ask my family for things and you know like my parents being nice like they would give me these things and it's like it wasn't until I got older when I realized like oh my gosh like they're working so hard to make money and I would be asking for these things like that's not right I don't know like and I and you wouldn't even need it and I want to inspire people to to like live a happy fun life without needing that much money which is why like my content is centered around having fun on a low budget see that's interesting because I thought you were saying I want to inspire people because I'm I want to be the biggest YouTuber and I want to inspire people who you know that you can make it as a YouTuber and blah blah blah what you said was very different though you were like your your thing that you do in these videos is about having great experiences either you know giving a a great gift or having a creating a fun project or eating your favorite food but without having to spend a ton of money being more resourceful being more handy being being more sort of self-reliant versus you know money Reliant and um that's kind of cool I didn't realize that that was your goal I'm glad you I'm glad you told me that that makes me kind of think about what you're doing in a different perspective and I think it could be a lot bigger if that's the perspective versus I want to be the biggest star I can be yes totally and it's kind of tough though because I'm going to be completely transparent like I genuinely want to be the next Mr Beast like I want to be the female Mr Beast like over 100 million subscribers but I still want to stay true to that message which is gonna be kind of tough is it's like you know Mr V spends a lot of money to be where he is can I do that without I don't know right well that's the whole that's your premise that's your whole thing so um all right that's that's kind of amazing Jenny thanks for doing this thanks for coming on uh where should people find you and what's the what's the shout out what do you want what do you want people to do from here if you want to work directly with me feel free to email team at jos.com we can have a one- hour consultation call together and I will review your your videos your business you know let's let's blow up on social media love it thank you Jenny thanks for doing this yeah know this is so much fun I love this

and I'm like yeah I could see how this would work if this is working on secure married you know two kids with a third on the way 36y old me dude 17y old me would be like this app is now my life and I think that's what's happening so the the general Trend here is basically [Music] that Sam uh notice anything different about me today you're wearing a college shirt do you know what that's called nowadays Sam no it's called look maxing have you ever heard this term I've seen uh genius CEO use the phrase look maxing yes okay so I want to talk to you about look maxing because I saw this app called umax and so I download it it says are you male or female I say okay mail it says 1 million 1 million people have done this on UMX uh are you ready and I'm like yeah I'm ready and so then it says take a picture of your face right now and I'm going to score you on how ugly you are so your boy takes a bed selfie then it's like hey you want your score pay 3.99 and I'm like gladly sir take my money Apple pay 3.99 and um I'm a 69 overall Sam I just found that out this morning that I'm I it's something I've been wondering my whole life really is where am I and I am a 69 over overall I am better looking than 49% of the people which means the majority of people are better looking than me and then what's interesting about this so wait that math doesn't work out you're not better 49% was is there 110% of people no I'm better than 49 51 are better than me well why are you a 69 then shouldn't you be a 51% no I don't know yeah that that doesn't make sense yeah 69 overall okay so I got a 69 uh but my potential is an 83 I'm intrigued tell me more app and so the app basically then rates me on my jawline masculinity my grooming my skin quality my hair from that one selfie of you in bed it's AI it's two two you take a side profile and then you take a front profile what do they say about your jawline you got a good jawline oh D jawline 69 skin quality 68 masculinity 82 nice your boy's a man yeah you know you're a man when you have to use an app to tell you you are man so what's amazing about this app this app uh I saw it on Twitter um somebody tweeted out an interview with the founder and um he's hanging out on the subreddits and I don't know if you've seen But like on Reddit these uh like here's if you go to the beauty and grooming category so like there can be a bunch of reddits in here number three and number five are both this number three is Li maxing advice and number five is mail grooming with 744 th000 members and so these are three of the top five subreddits so he's hanging out in these and basically what people do is they go post pict ma grooming just pictures of pubes no it's your your hair your beard your face it's your your ah that got it okay and so you would post a photo of yourself and you would say hey um give me some advice how can I look better strangers of Reddit uh you know my family they all just tell me oh you're beautiful honey don't worry at school I'm too embarrassed to ask you know I don't want to look like a loser but on Reddit we're all losers here it's all good and so they they post a photo and they say what can I do better people give advice so what this guy did was he turned that into an app he's like let me sprinkle a little AI on this turn this into app the app does three and a half million downloads he's making six million in ARR on this app right now 6 million AR run rate the app costs 3.99 a week when you unlock your thing so I think it's like one of these like you pay to unlock because oh my God I really want to know and then you forget to unsubscribe is you know probably the the reality but you're supposed to do a daily update as you take the steps they recommend so for example uh now this part the first part was me doing it for science the second part was me being like well you know it's got a point here so I click in and it's like hey you know your first he says your glowup routine and it says first priority is skin care how are you gonna make your skincare better so I click it and it says easiest way to improve your skin is limit your processed foods op for meats and natural produce work out five times a week and wash your face with warm water in the morning and evening that's the easy mode it says the best mode is you should clean your face in the shower moisturize after the shower exfoliate two or three times a week and it says products for you and then there's like some uh wow some skincare product and I went and I immediately was like let me buy this [ __ ] so I bought this $20 um thing and it's not like their product it's like just a link to Amazon of Cave's like moisturizer after shower or something like that and I'm like yeah I could see how this would work if this is working on secure married you know two kids with a third on the way 36-year-old me dude 17-year-old me would be like this app is now my life and I think that's what's happening so the the general Trend here is basically that um guys who are you know guys it's like acceptable to be like how do I um how do I look better and normally the answer was just we go to the gym that was like the societal Norm was you could become a gy bro and you're not seen as doing anything weird or lame or what ever it's like acceptable and now guys are like cool but what about from the neck up what what am I gon to do about that and um honestly Sam this is my greatest fear come true and the greatest fear is for for years decades centuries and Millennia men have had a truce and the truce is this beauty is all relative and if you don't try I won't try and while women had to put on makeup and wear heels and do lip fillers and then they started it became a beauty contest and they all had to continue to keep up with whatever the Norms were guys were like look I'm not doing [ __ ] to my face like yeah me neither bro I'm not doing nothing it is what it is take it or leave it as is condition and now as soon as people really start doing this it's going to become an arms race everybody's gonna have to do it do you do anything for your face nothing dude I no lotion no moisturizer no skincare routine I've never applied a cream in my life I'm not even really sure what you would do if you put it on like what what are you supposed to do I have no idea yeah I've never done it either but since I married a black woman I now have so tons of like lotions and all this crap like in my house and I'm slowly starting to like learn a little bit about you dude you're a muggle that's that's for wizards it doesn't doesn't work no I've been my eyes have been opened to the Korean skincare routine I'm like slowly understanding what all this stuff means and I want to use it but I've never I've never really gotten into it until recently where I started seeing some wrinkles and I'm like all right I think I can learn now and the the is is that like when you see issues like you know you should have done something like five years ago right uh but this is amazing that this guy's doing it's one guy yeah I don't know how many other people but yeah one guy basically saw the trend on Reddit and decided to productize what he saw people were doing on Reddit which I think is just a a great like you know one one common way to do a business is that is you You observe an organic Trend and you say cool could I use Tech to make this more efficient and to actually like ramp this up when did he launch it this thing is pretty new dude this is like yeah it's not that not that old I don't know exactly when he launched it but it looks pretty pretty fresh it's also such a simple app like when you download this you know that this was built by like a growth person not a skincare person not an engineer's engineer this is built by somebody who was like trying to solve a problem and was like cool big blue buttons one button per screen can't get lost um all right I'm going to take take a picture I'll give you a number all right and then I'm going to tell you how to make the number go high I then I'm also going to give you your potential number which is higher and I'm going to sell you a product to fill that Gap and like um they also have like a a chat GPT so it's like your coach so it's like um you know you can go on here and be like how do I um lose more body fat and then it just it you don't even type the question you just select from one of the preset questions and then it types out some advice for you from there then you can ask it more questions and it's basically like a custom you know chat GPT type of interface uh for you from there and the idea is that this is like an overall trend so there's more more thought on there but I stop there hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people

uh work slack and they were like uh you know trying to get us to use it and I was like this is like asking me to step on the scale a few days after Thanksgiving like I'm just not going to happen ignorance ignorance is bliss I don't want to know I don't want to know the the reality um but this is awesome I guess I I guess I'll use it are you paying 3.99 oh yeah paying 3.99 honestly I would have been happy to go to $799 I'm just saying that out loud so I asked a friend and I said I said under the under an anonymity I said he I know I like I know he knows about this kind the trend the space he's younger he's more into Tik Tok and stuff like that I was like can you give me the ear your honest reaction what are your thoughts on this and he said um he said well to most older guys this movement just seems completely bewildering like what are what are what are young guys doing nowadays but it makes sense he goes he goes it's a response to men generally being rejected and cast aside we can now take ownership and pride in how we look can you max out your natural genetics and ultimately become a more desirable person um you know Society men about their looks has been viewed negatively narcissistically seen as lame um or even gay but now the view the The Narrative is Shifting where they're just frustrated and they want to be able to you know to be their most attractive self I can see this trend continuing to grow it's already big in Korea with the Korean beauty Trend basically like in Korea I think men's beauty products are like you know on par or close to on par with with women's beauty products um and he also pointed out like an interesting thing which is that I don't know if you're not a big Sports guy but two of the most famous college athletes not named Caitlyn Clark um the two two most famous male a male College athletes uh are there was this guy named Caleb Williams he was the the quarterback at USC so like imagine like the most alpha male position in the country you are the quarterback of USC you know the in La you're the you know you're the guy and he's this big athletic guy but he would paint his nails and um and he would get he got criticized for it and people were like oh man I I don't want to like cuz he's in the right now I don't want my team drafting a quarterback who cares about that stuff and like I want a tough guy and people were and other people are like what are you talking about why are you overreacting the guy paints his nails so what and then the there's a a guard a Duke so the you know Duke's probably the number one basketball program in the country and this guy Jared McCain built a huge following on TiK ToK by doing goofy Tik Tock dances where he's laughing and happy uh like even if they would lose a game you know a day later he would still do this and he paints his nails and like the opposing teams would would harass him in the crowd every every game uh calling him all sorts of names but he was like dude I'm just doing me I'm having fun he's like oh yeah it's a superstitious thing I did it once I had a good game so I decided to keep doing it and he's like I don't know I like it it's fun uh what's the big deal and at first he got like a lot of negative backlash but then over time over the course of the year on Tik Tok this guy had massed like one or two million Tik Tok followers I think he was one of the highest paid because you know college athletes can get paid now so he's one of the highest paid nil athletes because he was getting sponsorships from beauty companies like the nail polish companies are sponsoring him you know paying this guy you know tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars just to post a simple 10-second Tik Tok and so in the end he had the last laugh and and he you know for someone like me I became a huge fan of this guy just because he was so unafraid to be himself and um that was you know obviously a very that's a very attractive trait in general dude this is amazing by the way I when I was in my like boxing phase my boxing instructor who was like a tough guy and would kick my ass all the time he wore nail polish all the time uh and I was like why are you doing that and he was 25 and he was like it's a thing it it's cool it's what people do and I was amazed by that you know I I remember as a kid you would paint like a fingernail black as a punk rocker but now it's like it's mainstream I think I think it's cool by the way I just downloaded umax and I just took my pictures I just clicked the button that says give me the results I love yeah I know I know I didn't even want to do this it's not real this isn't real this isn't real this it's not real your jawline f fantastic I could tell you that right now an 89 oh my God you are maxed sir wait what my my masculinity is 93 my skin quality no it's just good lighting it gave me a 94 my skin quality is not that good and I'm frankly I should be in the you're doing that thing that women do you're like no no this little thing I bought oh no this was on sale at Target you know you're immediately going it to that mode that's hilarious it's said classic hot guy thing to do I I dude if I'm hot I mean that's just not the reality overall 89 potential is 95 uh masculinity 93 jawline 90 cheekbones 87 I got some work to do uh what are you gonna do shave them yeah what do you do I I don't know with your eyebrows I guess get them plucked I don't know this is uh this is a good app I'm gonna have to take pictures without good lighting and actually get a a realistic rating uh I just paid my 3.99 I'm into it to this guy so I have a few uh spin-off business ideas for this so I think that um uh I don't know if you've seen but you know what Med Spas are these things are booming no what's a med spod uh Med Spa are absolutely booming if you don't know about them we should do a separate segment Al together about them but basically it's like micro blading uh you know you get your Botox you get your lip filler I don't know what what doesn't happen there but it's stuff like that basically the optional aesthetic glowup type of stuff that you could do um that's beyond manicure pedicure and like you know hair blow or whatever has Your Wife by the way Sean has your wife ever said that she wants to get BOTOX and if she has what has your reaction been she has said it um she's like uh she's like oh yeah I want to do it someday and I'm like are you just float she's like floats it out there's a little trial balloon just to see how it feels I feel and um and I'm like what no you don't need that again I just go into that mode and I'm but like genuinely like I you know I've always told her I I prefer her like completely without makeup I think she looks way better that way and so I've been telling her that for like you know a decade but she's she's like I'm not doing it for you you idiot I know you like me like she's like this has nothing to do with you every man every man has had that same response my wife will say it too and I go no just age normally you look great just be normal and so I think every man has said the exact same thing about women in Botox it's very funny they get this Botox and I think most every man that I've spoke to they're like I don't give a [ __ ] just just age also it goes like it's not even just like oh you're fine without it it's like actually don't get Simon Cal like have you seen Simon cowl yes they all look like cats like Chesire cats it's weird man they all look the same it's like they they go to The Madam tuso wax Factory and at some point it's like it look you look fine you look good oh you look better oh my God you look like non-human and then they never recover from then so there's some stuff there that's like a little scary to me they all look like the ladies on the desperate housewife or whatever it's called like the housewife reality shows I I can't I don't like that look and I think most men do not like that look so that's a PSA for the women listening uh and what was okay Med Spas that's cool okay um I think influencer content on this Niche is going to become really big so I think that anytime you have a new generation anytime there's a learning curve and there's like a trust Gap and there's you know it's a it's a new Norm that's being established you need your you need your Shepherds that are going to guide you you need your Sherpas that will take you up the mountain and so I think that um anybody who goes all in on this like in terms of their social content you know there's going to be some you know 21y old dude who all the you know 15 15 to 19 year old dudes look up to or even actually 15 to 24 year old dudes look up to because he's going to show his before and after and I think that there's going to be room for and I'm sure this already exists I'm just I don't I don't even open up Instagram so I'm probably out of the loop on this but um I think there's going to be some really big influencers that can go into the space because they're going to hold the keys whatever products they recommend whatever procedures they recommend whatever Brands they recommend that's where the masses are going to go because you're in a low trust environment you don't know anything and so you're going to need that so I think that's an opportunity here um more AI driven app so I think I think another person could create umax right now and get the same exact result I agree I think this app can be cloned in seven days and I think you could just Blitz the marketing on it and you will also have a six million AR app that's the unfortunate side of it um I think that male nail polish and male like makeup brands you know it's obviously coming uh but even like as a Gateway I think that somebody could recreate Old Spice so like what's the deodorant for guys who care about their like guys who are like in gym culture and maybe now even in kind of like hair and grooming culture um who is speaking to them like I don't think Proctor and Gamble knows how to speak to them I don't think they have the right influencer strategy I don't think they have the right brand and content strategy and I think somebody could do what Native deodorant did for like um you know the natural movement and you know native basically built a product that would ride on the wave of natural chemical free aluminum free products and that was where Native got built I think some can create the axe or Old Spice of today right now and get bought by practor and gamble or unever whoever for you know2 200 million $300 million if you you just build a great brand this is insane and in Hampton uh we have this company's called for them and their name is kylo and they have a company that makes clothing that are like unisex and they're killing it and if you would have told me that this company was going to take off 5 years ago I would have been like you're insane they are killing it and they are kind of pouncing on this exact same niche of men who are Andro androgynous you know what I'm saying like this uh Timothy shamayne my wife said she likes Timothy shamain and I'm like what really Timothy shamain that guy like it's these feminine men are kind of having their moment at the at the moment which I guess they always have right like MC Jagger is basically that uh prince prince is that you know feminine men have always kind of killed it in the game but this brand is one of those brands that I didn't think would be uh a thing and it is and so I'm on board with what you're saying so I'm luk maxing now all right I mean I'm in I'm in on the trend I'm gonna ride this I'm gonna relate to my fellow uh you know 17-year-olds and uh and I'm GNA see what happens this is great dude good find I can't believe this umax thing is as big as it is I had co-workers share it with me today you brought it up it must be like going everywhere then well someone did an interview with the founder and did a good like Twitter summary of it so I think it was just like a tweet that like a lot of people saw today God bless them God Bless America God bless capitalism right I would have thought that this was like some Chinese app because wasn't there a Chinese app recently that was like here's what you look like if you were better looking well yeah I thought it when I first downloaded I thought it was gonna be like face tune I thought it was gonna be you take a picture it makes your picture look better this is like no no no the real face we're g to try to make your real face look better by the way I we should shout out the person who who did it uh a at ATP I think is that 0p I don't know how you say the the name of the person who did the podcast interview but shout out to them those good good find good interview by the way the tagline for this app is become hot it just says youx dbec hot this is uh these guys are just digging right at every insecurity we have I love it all right let me tell you about a trend that's happening as well so this will be like the trends episode umax is happening right now I want to tell you about a trend that's happening as we speak before we get to the trend and and this is recent some news just happened but before we get to that Trend I need to tell you the background so have you heard of this company called Dupont it's a large Chemical Company so in the 1940s they were tasked by the government of coming up with a sealant for atomic bombs so basically atomic bombs needed some type of like sealant for gaskets gaskets are the parts that put two pipes together so nothing leaks talk about a job you don't want to [ __ ] up yeah a job you do not want to [ __ ] up and a job that requires a chemical that is very very very very strong uh the chemical they eventually created it was one it's one of the strongest Bonds in chemistry it's a very strong chemical and this chemical it's resistant to heat and it's super strong and so the world the war ended and they were like we have this great chemical what do we do with it and they start testing new things with it and they go we got a great idea let's make a pan out of this if we make a pan out of this nothing will stick to the pan even if it's burnt food and so they run all these commercials they go we got this new thing called Teflon they trademark it and they go this chemical you can burn food on this pan and you can still just wipe it off it's the easiest to clean thing and it takes off this chemical we're going to call it Teflon uh but it's it's a long chemical name but it takes off and they trademark it and they make it a huge thing and it's and it's a massive hit starting in the 40s all the way up until today it's this big hit well what they noticed was that there's this subset of chemicals that when you make Teflon called pasas and pasas is basically a broad term that describes like 9,000 different chemicals that are kind of created when you create Teflon but what they noticed is that some of their workers working on the line were getting sick and so they go we should probably like look into this and test this a little bit so they started giving it to rats and the Rats started getting enlarged kidneys which is a bad sign then they go well [ __ ] let's give us to monkeys and see what happens with these monkeys it killed the monkeys and then eventually after 20 years of making this chemical we're getting to the 70s now and some of the ladies that are working on this on this in this Factory they're having kids that are be being born with weird defects like some kids were born with one nostril or like they had eye issues like it was a massive problem and they tested these kids and they found that they had p in their spines and so it was like being passed down from mother to son or mother to to child and they're like all right this is really weird now this is actually becoming a big deal for some reason the FDA doesn't call them out on it they're still able to produce this now we know Teflon is incredibly popular nonstick fans are are incredibly po popular but here's the problem with this chemical because it is made for Atomic bombs essentially it lasts forever this chemical doesn't get broken down and now we're calling them forever chemicals instead of peass a lot of times in the media they'll just call it a forever chemical and what they're noticing now is that basically 100% of American of Americans have pasas in their body because it gets in our water and so it's in all the water in America not only is it in all of uh our water it's in everything else so for example all your cookware your non-stick panss that's an easy one however it's in all of your uh it's in a lot of your cloth clothing so any clothing that kind of feels like plastic like a um like a uh rain jacket or like sports pants or like workout shirts that has past in them and it gets even worse it's actually in all of your food packaging and so um in order to uh for your pizza box in order for the grease not to seek through and go through the cardboard it has pasas in it this can of soda I believe has pasas in it because it helps make it a little bit more resistant to liquid well this has been a big deal and so recently I think last year Dupont lost a billion doll uh class action lawsuit where it says that they basically can't be doing what they're doing they have to they can't put this in people's water anymore because they were just dumping it in water or dumping it in the environment and it was getting in our water because the forever chemicals don't go away well last week or two weeks ago I believe the EPA which is the Environmental Protection Agency basically just said that this is a big deal and that they're banning a lot of these companies so Dupont Gore and a few other companies 3M from putting this into water and that they're going to demand that uh local water companies the your city water is gonna have gonna have to start testing for this and getting this out of the water somehow and so that was like a landmark case and so in my opinion this is a trend that's happening right now and I think that amongst my hippie friends do you have any hippie friends who refuse to use nonstick pans yes and I never understood it tell now I never understood it either they just said it's bad and if you look at your nonstick pans what you're going to notice is that there's chips in it there's like little chips from where you like put your fork or a knife on it and it like chipped that little piece of Teflon and it like went into your food You're basically consuming this stuff but it's in plastic water bottles it's in everything and you actually hung out with Joe gbia recently the founder of Airbnb and he said that he only drinks a certain type of water and I looked up that water company what was it called aquapa aquapa was one of the few water companies that did not they did not detect pasas in the water and the implications of this are quite big so have you heard about men having like really low sperm counts right now and that's impacting fertility well one of the hypothesis is is that if your mother consumed this stuff you it the Studies have shown that the men are likely to have lower sperm counts later in life and so there's all these implications where people are getting cancer right now at super high rates and there's Rumblings that maybe this is called from past and so the reason I'm bringing this up obviously this is AIG deal and it freaked me out as a consumer Because by the way the takeaway of this is basically you can't avoid it and you're screwed uh that's basically oh God that's kind of the I mean it's in everything it's in floss it's in everything and once it's there it's there and so our generation might just be screwed but the reason why this interests me is there's a common theme of hippie or like French people being interested in something and it becoming mainstream and popular in the next 10 15 years hippies are just innovators they really are innovators yeah like birken stocks are cool now I mean like they they start stuff early my opinion is right now is a wonderful time to get into this business and I was Googling which products are past free I couldn't find a decent website there's one website called mav.com this lady's been blogging about this since 2009 and she does like crazy tests on like different products so it'll be like which Ziploc bags are past free and she basically does all this analysis where she sends these plastic bags to the lab and then her conclusion is none none are past free I don't have any good recommendations for this mation shout out to her how how long has she been doing this 2009 this is amazing and she has a rabid fan base former chemicals in contact lenses damn it it's in everything it's in everything and she'll and then she'll do like bottle water and she'll like measure she sends this off to a lab and she like measures all the bottle water and she'll say these are this is the order of least likely to have past or she'll do a variety of uh products like jackets or clothing things like that and in my opinion the same way that cold plunge is popular right now the same way that I don't know whatever Trends are popular I think past free or forever chemical free products are going to absolutely take off and they're going to be a thing in a in a in a few years we're going to see do you remember Thrive Market Thrive Market was like an online Marketplace for like organic food we're going to see Thrive market for forever chemical-free products I think this is going to be a very popular thing because all of the brands that you and I probably use are are really really heavy in this so for example like you know 10,000 shorts have you heard of that brand 10,000 no uh it's just like an Instagram brand of of workout shorts that's basically what this what their product is it's like this like plastic liner that in your shorts they're in everything they're in everything not to call it 10,000 but they're in everything it's in your food packaging everything and so the EPA actually just announced that food packaging starting I think next year can no longer have this so everything that you order from door Dash your Chinese uh food cartons everything this has that [ __ ] in it but starting 25 it's supposed to not have any of that crap in it of course there's a huge issue here which is the FDA has kind of like sat on this for like 50 years and the damage kind of has been done and there's new chemicals that you can kind of get around this stuff that are probably just as bad for you but I still think that this is actually a turning point to make this trend mainstream we've talked about inflections on this podcast now is what I call a regulatory inflection just like when covid happened you could do online therapy and you saw better help and bunch of other businesses like that take off this is a a thing that's going to actually get quite popular in the next five and 10 years wow this is uh This is Wild dude it's Not only was this a good segment you might have saved my life and many people's lives by bringing this what a story uh I did not I had heard of past because I tried to buy a like a kid's bed and I was like how come a checkouts not working I guess I frust I like why is this not like purchasing it's like oh I contact help like oh you're you're in California we can't ship p uh uh like anything that contains P to California and I was like ah God how annoying uh what is that what do you mean we can't take it you can't ship it to California I didn't realize what I was what I was angry at I should have been happy about and why are these in you know I guess why are these in beds why why does beds need these why do I should I sleep in these forever chemicals most of the paint you have in your home have it as well and so it's like a it's a sealant is what it is we need to clip this because I think in in two three years it's going to be we're going to see that look I'm looking at these categories like so for example she she's testing you know contact lenses makeup dental floss toilet paper uh tampons uh wrappers um oils pans active wear all these different categories you know that's just like a a a mind field of opportunity to go through and build pfast free you know Alternatives and popularize this story the story that you told at the beginning is the story that needs to be told more right I think it's one thing to say has past it's another thing to say do you know what that is do you know how bad this is do you want your kid to be born with a with one nostril how many nostrils you want kid to have right like that's all somebody needs to say and if you tell that story well that's going to be incredibly powerful well this is why when I read this I was like obviously this is bad but the bra the business side of my brain was like this is advertising gold yeah like I'm like an HVAC guy during a heatwave I'm like this is this is this is gold is that our version of kid in a candy store yeah I'm likeing H operator dur yeah like it was gold when I read this stuff and the reason being is forever chemicals awesome branding they're already branding it for us that's a kind of I feel like that almost sounds like I don't know there's like a slight positive Twi is that good it'll last forever diamonds are forever oh great you know like I kind of want it to be a little more dangerous right like a little more off-putting well I just think that um so there's a lot of research but I think a lot of a lot of people actually uh when I was reading the research there's some debate over it and I don't know why there's too much debate over I wasn't able to like read all the research but there's some debate as to how dangerous they are and in which setting but I still think you can this sounds manipulative but you can use fear to be like just don't have any of it and so for example I remember I was pretty nervous about this ship and so I was looking just for cotton only clothing so clothing that is just plain cotton but you look at which what your clothing is like Lululemon I mean it all has uh p in it and so it's been quite challenging and if you Google past free products you're basically just going to come across a bunch of subreddits and so it's still quite Niche and grass rootsy there's not like a a good website that refers you to different products there's this mamavation website but like it's still kind of a messy website and kind of confusing and hard to read They're not just telling me what to buy and how to live my life they're kind of telling the science behind it a little bit but I think that there's going to be a lot of interesting brands that pop up on this trend I know Patagonia ising doing it right now they've said that 95% of their clothing is PSA free or Ps free I know that Ikea has been on this since 2009 and they try to say that their their Furniture doesn't have it and a lot of people are committed to not having it by 2025 but very interesting movement I think all right I got another trend for you so this is a cool story and I would say this is an example of niches and riches which is a phrase we've said many times and if there's anything more Niche than this I'd love to hear it so here's the story there's a guy named Josh and Josh Dunning he his wife is a high school teacher and when he's talking to her and he goes maybe picks her from school he notices kids are doing something outrageous in schools which is that they're coming into schools and they are just blasting each other with water guns and he's like what is going on she's like oh my God I know these kids they're obsessed with this game is what's the game the game I don't know if you ever played this when you were in school but it's it's the game assassins um and the game assassins the way it works really simply is you can play this one-on-one or like free-for-all or teams or whatever but basically one person is the Target and other people have to find them and you have to basically get the Target first so you want to shoot you want to shoot the target with the water gun first and then after you've got them you get points because you were the Assassin who not who got them and then the the target moves and so first of all that that sounds awesome I wish I could have played that game that sounds great can't believe this is allowed right water guns you imagine the mess this is ridiculous but somehow uh you know rather than being annoyed he sees opportunity um and so he goes how are they playing this game like how do you know who's it and they're like oh we have this sheet this paper and then we have to like keep track of this keep track of the points he's like huh so he goes home and he builds an app and he builds an app called splashing and the splashing app is um just a way to like run assassin's game and so he messages I don't know how Ben found this guy but he's messaging Ben and he starts explaining he's like yeah I built this app and I built I just turned the game into something that would just like keep track of this like replace pen and paper for this he's like it's good because it keeps track of the points and it tells you who's it and all this stuff it's like a very simple app and super super Niche so he would not think this is how somebody gets wealthy so he starts texting Ben his Revenue numbers and he's like um you know week one pretty small week two then he's like week three he's like 40K what I like wow you made $40,000 on this thing next week we're like how's it how's it going did you keep the did you stay at 40K or did it kind of fizzle out he goes yeah 93k like what 167,000 the next week this week 250,000 he is just like week over week it's this thing has gone viral and so he's getting 5,000 signups per day right now uh and so in about four in a four-week span they basically went from no Revenue to uh $250,000 a month in revenue on this it's called splashing splashing let me let me show you the you can go to their Tik Tok every Tik Tok they post they'll post three or four times a day each one gets uh you know 10,000 views or so and then people are posting this and it's also inherently viral so not only do they do well with Tik Tok organic but like this has something that that Michael Burch one of my mentors taught me which was playr playground virality which is um when when bio went viral I asked Michael like how did it grow he goes it had playground virality means like literally on a school playground one kid would be talking about it and all the other kids who were out of the loop had to go home and figure out what the heck this thing was and um similarly like if one group of people are playing splashing in your your school you're going to have to go get the app to like play or you're left out and so this thing goes Super viral on high school and college campuses right now and um and their content is really good because they'll start with someone running after somebody the video starts first three seconds somebody's running after somebody else spring them with water and the other person's like ah no and then they're like laughing and it's like what app is this what game it says what game are they playing is the is the hook and says if you've seen random people running around water guns splashing each other and there compilation of someone splashing someone in a car someone diving under the bleacher somebody like running jumping through a window the trick is they have these videos that like from a marketing perspective you watch these and in the first three seconds it shows somebody chasing somebody else and splashing them with water and it says what game are they playing and then it says if you've seen people all over your feed who are you know spraying each other with water and it's just a compilation of crazy people diving through Windows being sprayed with water it says they're playing a game called splashing and uh the way it works is you're assigned a Target you see them on a map somebody's targeting you and then blah blah blah and so that's that's the game and uh pretty amazing to see this thing going viral and like this also falls into a category of apps that is not sustainable necessarily but who cares but who the hell cares yeah it's a Summer Fling and it's a great Summer Fling dude you we're kind of glossed over the fact that this guy just messaged Ben and he just Ben's just like what are your sales tell me your revenue and he tells them every week that that happens to Ben like 10 times a day it's like in parks and recck where they find out that uh one of the one of the main characters is a nurse and they start sending her dick piics to like diagnose so they could get diagnosed with an STD and she's just like dude my my inbox is just full of like men's penises asking if they have herpes I guess that's just Ben's inbox it's just all these guys sending because he's useful dude like you people tell him what's going on and then he's like oh you should talk to this person they will solve that one problem you're having and then they're like wow love this guy and then he does it again and like you know because I'll be like he uh like two people that don't know each other that we know are talking I'm like oh wow how' they meet he's like oh yeah I introduced them I'm like how did you even think to introduce them he's like well he every week he tells me like how it's going and then he said he was having this problem and so I told him about this other guy who solves that specific Niche problem and now it's like you know working out great and I was like oh you're like a router he's like a like like a switchboard operator who's able to just like once he knows what you need and he knows what somebody else has to offer he makes connections and he asks for nothing in return and that like you know just works out have you seen uh Boardwalk Empire the show no so the main character amongst other things he's basically a mafia guy he's in the mob and he connects like Al Capone with this one distiller who can make alapon whiskey or whatever and whenever he does that he goes all right where's my cut and he that's how he makes a living and gets rich off that by just making connections or he'll introduce Al Capone to a politician who's gonna help hide his whatever that's what Ben needs to do Ben needs we need to start we need to change because in Silicon Valley people make these introductions and they don't ask for anything Ben should ask for something he should get he goes where's my points he just needs to start asking for points no no that ruins it that's why guys like you and me don't don't have he has he just F he's just happy to be useful and then value just comes back dude there's a b there is a business Karma value does come back you know a few of these people will be like hey let me cut you a check or um hey if there's more like that I'm happy to like incentivize you to to give me more like that and he's like okay sure I didn't ask for it but people come to him with that because they're like give me more of where that came from and so he's created a lot of value and I think that in general you want to be like Ultra free or Ultra Premium so it's basically like don't make money on every transaction don't be a gatekeeper who stands in the way of of the traffic flowing and it's like let 99% of the cars go through completely free but then on the one where you know there's a bigger opportunity or something like that we get to invest or we get to be a part of it in some way and uh it pays off for the the 99 free things that he did and I think he's got the right method how old is this guy Josh junning I just looked him up he looks like a young a really young guy I mean that's pretty impressive these uh basically kids like coming up with these things that are making very very meaningful traction as one or two people operations well it's also the magic of software right like software is so different than a Services Agency or an e-commerce PR we have a physical product right like these software things they build it once it runs forever um you know they can have three Mill this UMX guy three and a half million customers can use his thing this guy's signing up 5,000 people a day because software scales software is Magic that's not the magical part the magical part I think is the psychology behind it and I think you know we have a friend Nikita who frankly I don't know what's the reality versus the story but like there's all these people who he claims are coming to him for advice on how to make my app viral and he like says like he he doesn't say it but the the story that I kind of glean from it is like be B Boop you just do this this this you change this thing to this thing that's G to change this metric to this thing and Boop D like where's my money uh and I don't know if that's the reality but he's like he's like hey look three of the apps that I advise are now in the top 100 of most downloaded apps in the in in Apple Store and it's just like is amazing how there's a little bit of a pattern and I don't entirely understand the pattern because I'm not you're just describing expertise right yeah but it just seems like um more than ever before it's becoming Like A playbook um and it just it is ridiculous how like I do think that you could take some of these the these this knowledge and apply it to five or 10 other things and it works almost as well all right hey I want to take a quick break to congratulate our friend Tim Ferris Tim's podcast has crossed one billion downloads billion that is insane especially for a guy who said when he started the Pod hey I'm going to do six episodes just give this a try see if I like it and if I don't it'll just be six but but if I do maybe I'll keep going and he sure enough kept going Tim is amazing at the Pod he's a big inspiration for me in fact when I started this podcast I still remember the day I had sold my company I was walking around San Francisco I did a 4-Hour walk with my buddy we walked ourselves into a frenzy and he goes well what do you want what do you really want to do next and I Saidi think I want to be Tim Ferris I said I don't want to be Tim Ferris I want to have the impact Tim Ferris had I said you know I have listened to so many of his episodes like the uh the Jamie Fox one I remember was epic the ones with Naval are all killer his ones with u Arnold Schwarzenegger were really good you know he's done so many episodes that really stood out to me and and shifted my perspective changed my lens um gave me some inspiration he was there when I was doing just boring commutes and uh I want to thank him for doing the show uh the world would be a worst place if he did not do the Tim Ferris podcast and he's done he's now this is his 10-year anniversary so happy birthday Tim for the 10 year anniversary of your pod a billion downloads that is incredible um he is still to this day I think one of the best question askers on the planet which you probably didn't even think was a skill but it is of course and his quote about questions has always inspired me he says that questions are like the pickaxe of the brain you can use a question to just unlock information that's what he does he breaks down world-class performers by asking them amazing questions so Tim congrats on the 10 years uh if anybody's out there you're listening to this podcast just hit pause and go listen to Tim instead you know what I don't mind it is a it is a great move by you you can find the Tim feris show wherever you get your podcast uh he's also got a newsletter called five bullet Friday with two million weekly subscribers you can find that at tim. blog and you can find the podcast wherever you listen to podcasts so I'm going to tell a story I don't know if I can use the guy's name just because I didn't ask him if I was going to tell the story but I can tell tell a version of the story so uh I met a guy recently really awesome guy became friends with him and he is like a growth expert not like the you know Twitter YouTuber you know I'm a growth expert hire me for $500 an hour and and I I'll be your growth guy like this guy actually like the big name Silicon Valley products he was like running the growth team there and so like you know like in the same way that uh you know chaman or Javier grew F you know they were the the lead guy on the Facebook growth team and they like they fought those Wars or Josh Elman did this at different companies there's another guy who did this at other companies and so he was describing to me he's like yeah he's like um I went for a walk with him in Silicon Valley like the real Silicon Valley meaning he was walking he's like that's Steve Jobs's house that's Larry Page's house that's Mark Zuckerberg's house and they're like I don't know if you've ever been here by the way in Palo Alto these are like completely unassuming houses by the way um they they're not like Mega mcmansions they're just like small cottage houses in a cool little neighborhood that's open in paloalto and he's like yeah that uh he was like I was like how did you um you know get connected with because he was telling me about somebody he knew I go how did you get connected with the people and he goes well I had built an expertise around SEO he's like I just understood SEO I had done it to two of my companies I just really I like I feel like I knew SEO better than most people and somebody introduced me to um to the guy from quora Adam D who was like you know co-founder of Facebook now was doing Kora and cor had cor had a SEO problem they're uh they were heavily dependent on SEO traffic and then like some Google update happened and their their SEO traffic was dying uh or was having trouble for whatever reason and um I did a call with him and he's like I um he's like on that one call I told him I was like oh it's this you are getting penalized by Google for this you need to change that and it'll fix it he's like and it fixed it and like the growth you know went up and then I told him one other thing after that they did one more call I did one other thing and like basically like the Kora growth curve was like you know really impressive afterwards and um Adam you know called him and was like Hey dude like can you can I will you come work here can I hire you as a consultant I'll pay you any number uh to hire you as a consultant and he's like also how did you do that uh because that was like my team been working on this for months and like you just pointed at the thing you're like this is it and he's like well it looks like there was just one thing he's like but actually the the skill is that there's a thousand you know needles there's a thousand straws in a hay stack and the trick is just to find the one straw that matters and it looks like oh man you only had to move one straw but it's like because I knew the 99 other things 99% of things to ignore I knew which which ones were not the answer which told me it's got to be one of these two things and then I pulled that out he's like that's what expertise looks like when it's done well is is not that uh it's not that you come up with more ideas than anyone else you can quickly eliminate the 99 Wast of time and try to find a one or two that matter uh so I love that principle then he said another thing he goes so when he offered me that I was like so did you go work there did you take the Consulting gig that'd be awesome I bet they could have paid you a ton or whatever he goes I had a better deal I told him I'm gonna do this for free for you but when the time comes I know you're super connected silica Valley and I just moved here um I would love for some introductions like you know if I do come up with something I'd love for you to make an introduction and at the time Adam's like done easy you know that that's the price amazing I got a steal here he's like but actually I got way more value out of that trade he's like because then when I cashed in that Chip he's like people would say he's like I could get an intro to anybody and that intro would come like with extreme vouch of this guy's like the Magic Man and he's like that and Adam doesn't make many intros so as soon as that they int me the person would say not only did Adam vouch for you Adam never makes any intros this is the first intro he's ever made because he knows like to intro meet is you know kind of a high bar so you must be really something and that was kind of that business Karma you know coming back and he's like I didn't do it in a manipulative way I just thought that that was a better ask and uh I was like wow that's a great great story that's awesome that is a really good story I want to get him on I think he's got some he's got some good uh growth stories and growth advice so I'm gonna try to get him on I I'll ask for his permission I um I think today was a 10 out of 10 I feel hyped I want to like go and learn about some of the stuff I want to look up splashing I want to play splashing first I need like friends that are immature enough to play a water gun game with me adult we need adult splashing Austin I guess I'm not I got to go buy a water gun but uh in Texas you guys just play with real guns yeah we're going to call bleeding instead of splashing um that's great is that the Pod well we have one more thing one more thing about expertise and this is also the thrill of the shill um I was watching one of the podcasts that I recorded when I went to Austin and the guy said something he goes uh this is a guy who's who's Joe lonel and his claim to fame I think the title of the podcast is going to be the guy who's created more billion doll companies than anyone else just an incredible claim to fame and an incredible title and so he goes um he was saying something he goes he almost paused me while I was saying something he goes oh by the way that's always a good idea I was like what what is he talking about and what he's saying was he goes anytime a company that was successful doing one thing had to build internally their own tool that's not their product but they like hired Engineers that Engineers working on something thing and they were like that's the tool that like some internal Homebrew tool that they used was like part of their secret sauce for their success but it wasn't their main product he goes that's always a good idea which is basically to I call this the export framework you export something that was built internally and you make a product that's available to all and so he was talking about this for example with paler he started paler now a $50 billion dollar company paler you know the Genesis of it was he was an intern at PayPal fighting fraud and so at the time PayPal because PayPal was getting popular basically what he said would happen he goes somebody would you know somebody you know some cashier at a gas station is having a bad day would would kind of steal your credit card number and they could go sell you know 50 of these on the black market to to the Russians Russians would pay $100 a pop for these credit cards stolen credit cards and then they would go charge up this thing and then then the customer would be like I didn't buy any of this stuff and so they would charge it back he's likeing PayPal was left holding the bag of that charge back and that to the tune of like millions of dollars it would have put us out of business it put out most of our competitors went out of business for this one reason and so fighting fraud was like a really important thing and we had to build a set of tools to be able to do like data data detection fraud detection and like fight the bad guys he's like and then when I started paler I was like what if we took all that fight the bad guys stuff and we made it available to the government to be able to fight the bad guys for counterterrorism stuff because this was after 911 and so he was given that example of like anytime you see the home brew tool that spins out becomes a product that's a successful business well today's sponsor is exactly that and that is beehive so beehive was basically origin great plug great plug the show I guarantee you that nobody does AD reads like I do ad reads right I'm gonna teach you something tell you a story and then I'm gonna give you the value too that's a great thrill and I'll give you the shill now the shill part is these guys were inside of morning Brew which is probably would you say it's probably the most successful newsletter business outside of Agora right like the most successful mainstream newsletter business nearly a $100 million a year business $100 million business grew really fast and you know and both of us have tried building newsletter businesses and these guys built like grew it faster than both of both of us we we were successful they were even more successful they grew their newsletter about five million subscribers and and the Secret Sauce of how they grew their newsletter their growth engine was this internal tool that they built which let them write a write a newsletter easily like format it get it all ready to go baked in the growth stuff so like referrals and you know like recommendation things at the bottom of an email when it's like hey send this to a friend and you can get a free sticker a free mug or free t-shirt or whatever that all of those little tools that they built internally this guy Tyler basically spun out and created beehive to do that independently so now anybody like me when I built the milk Road I didn't have to build any of that [ __ ] milk uh morning brew has like you know I don't know how many hundreds of employees we didn't need any of that [ __ ] literally it was me Ben and one other guy and like the three of us built a newsletter that we sold for millions of dollars because we could just use beehive off the shelf and so if you're looking to build a newsletter either personally or you want to start newsletter business like me and Sam did beehive is the way to go they basically took all the secret sauce that was inside morning Brew turned it into a product that you can use off the shelf on day one 10 out of 10 I was I was thrilled I just imagine Joe lale just holding up his finger to your lips and saying sh shut up just shut up shut the [ __ ] up beehive it's hilarious too because uh I'm trying to connect with Joe he's like this billionaire who's created like you know spy technology for the government $50 billion company you know tools that all the asset wealth managers use adapar a $3 billion Company open gov which sold to governments and basically sold for 1.8 billion he he's got a a like weapons company that builds like EMP pulses that will you know knock drones out of the sky War tools and I'm like yeah yeah me too man I'm an entrepreneur too just like you me and you same same um yeah I built a newsletter company yeah I did it like kind of part-time for a year and then sold it um not for a billion dollars just like few Mill I it was great though yeah then uh what else do we got podcast talk to my buddy Sam a couple times a week that's pretty dope I'm working hard out here man all while you were wearing camouflage sweatpants you and I are the same this while we were at a cold plch together and I was just like also hyperventilating and being like how long do guys like this stay in the cold bunch I think it's longer than I'm used to but I cannot I cannot get out of this plunge until he does I die an icicle or I live you know with all the glory of this and you're like uh oh you did a multi multiple billion dollar companies I got a 69 on you hot uh so what you get so are you had the LIF maxing no I didn't think so I just was curious if that was a priority for you that's a that's a typical 49 perent answer bro uh so check it out uh beehive that's with two eyes by the way be kind of hard to spell hi I IV they're hi yeah that's weird by the way they give they post their revenue I don't know what let me dude Tyler the CEO for the next time we give the shout out we'll focus on Tyler Tyler's a great CEO I thought he was a Loose Cannon and I think he sort of is no he's just good-looking that's what you thought you were like H nobody this good-looking and cool is gonna be a good operator he actually is he's just he I thought he was just too loose of can and then I realized that his aggressiveness is actually awesome uh and I I did not invest in them and it's one of the things that I'm like oh I should have done that it's I almost didn't invest so I did I did end up investing actually I think I passed the first time and so I what I did was I passed the first time because I was like ah I don't know how big this can get and then we started using it for the milk Road and I used it for my personal newsletter so I became a customer first and then I would just see like anytime we'd have a problem they were so fast to fix it and they kept releasing stuff I was like oh okay I called him back I was like I want to invest he's like well you changed you think the Market's bigger I was like no actually I think the Market's the same size but um you guys are like relentlessly shipping and I'd rather just bet on somebody like that than not bet on them and like you know I'm often wrong about Market size markets can trick you markets can look small and be bigger but Founders or teams that operate like this that's like always a good signal and so I'm like let me just bet on the known versus not bet because of this hypothetical unknown thing um but what but I almost didn't because and when I did the call he had a surfboard behind him and I was like ain't no way I'm going to invest in a CEO who surfs regularly enough with the surfboards behind him in uh in his room but I was wrong next time we talk about him we have like four or five more stories about Tyler Tyler's an interesting guy and uh I I I respect the hell out of him he's a good entrepreneur I want to see what their revenue is at right now so they uh he tweet 12 million is it dude look at this graph 7 million in AR was February 1st so two months ago and this graph is literally like shaped like this uh it's pretty crazy and he go because this doesn't include some of some revenue from the ad Network oh no March 19th quickly approaching 10 million ARR so they're probably just under 10 Mill 10 million AR now yeah they're it's an amazing company they've taken off um is it just beehive.org [Music]

what can you teach me about the first 5 minutes of a podcast the most important 5 minutes are the conversation I have before I start recording with someone that would be putting them at ease to the extent possible my job is to make you look as good as possible every guest has Final Cut let it all hang out and we can cut whatever you want to cut you'll get a transcript nothing's going to get published before you give it the okay put the walls down General housekeeping so they don't get distracted like if you need to take water break bathroom break pause stop you want to start a story over again that's all totally fine I'll keep an eye out for things that I think we might want to cut like if you accidentally mention your kids' names or something like that so like oh this guy's a done a lot B is actually looking out for me c has actually sat in my seat a lot

the most successful people in the world respond instantly it's kind of infuriating how true it is but when you email the billionaire CEO it's like a 30-second response when you email his vice president can be a week or something that is just so true I really try and force myself to respond fast I wrote this little script for Gmail that archives my email every 24 hours so I have to respond or it just disappears and I feel like it's a really good nudge of like just send the simpler text message like response

you have now created by my account at least $4 billion doll companies directly probably more than that what would you say you are doing different than the average good founder so L I have some unfair advantages [Music] right okay Joe thanks for doing this man and thanks for uh inviting me into the the morning workout the cold plunge and uh and everything in between breakfast good to have you here Sean so I want to start with Lessons Learned you one of them that we were talking about this morning when we were doing our workout was um making decisions on Blended reasons or having like a blended strategy for how you're we're going to win we're going to win doing these five things and why that sounds like a good idea to the average person but it's actually a very bad idea can you explain that yeah I wrote this piece online like nine lessons from Peter CH I sent to All of palent here that's been like sent to all my other companies as well and it's one of my favorite pieces and that's one of them and the it's one of these logic things where usually there's like one reason that dominates everything else and that's just that's just the nature of the world is that is that when something's successful it's it's kind of like the power law rule right like in a venture capital like fund even there tends to be one thing that successful that's like bigger than everything else and that's true inside of companies as well it's it's very unusual like extraordinarily unusual for there to be like two similarly equal like like like products or Revenue lines or something like that right um especially early on in a company so usually if you if you think you have like two or three reasons for doing something or five reasons for doing something what that means is that you actually haven't figured out actual reason you have no strong reason yet that means you have five weak reasons which is not good you want to find like what's like one really strong thing you're driving towards and that that's how startups work and this is it's a really seductive trick trick I mean first of all you have to be taking a big risks to even do a startup it feels like rather than like you know most people a lot of people like do incubators because they're like oh I don't want to do one company I'm gonna do 10 companies and like by the way that's like much less likely to have a big success because you're not focused and then but so even within a company they're like they're trying to do the same thing they're trying to be like well well here's five ways I'm going to make money and like no no no man if you really want to do a company figure out the way you're going to make money and that that tends to be how it works you know and that applies to revenue streams so eight revenue streams means you probably don't have one awesome Revenue stream exactly growth strategies if you have seven things we're going to do for growth means you haven't figured which one is actually the one that's going to work the one that's going to just compound like crazy and it may change it may change over time but what's the thing that's working now you're pushing on yeah and then uh the other version of that is Blended reasons for doing something I think um I read once that Reed Hoffman kind of uses the same philosophy and he said he gave the example of oh if there's like a trip to China and I'm deciding should I go to China it's far away it's going to take two weeks and should I do this trip he's like in my chief of staff came with like a list of pros and cons yeah like multiple Pros multiple pros and then a couple of cons that's an almost impossible it's a guaranteed way to make mediocre decisions is to do long Blended lists of if you don't have a key reason to be there like stick to your work yeah exactly that's what he said he's like if if we don't have one reason that that alone is worth doing then we should just say no is that something you do Reed was one of the key key mindes at PayPal of course with Peter tal and others so who knows who actually come up with these ideas it may all be be Reed's ideas that I'm recycling he's a very smart guy well I say them as for mine now so it's I think that's that's the best way to you know the highest compliment is to meme an idea and to to let it spread and so Peter's helpful with that he's um what are some of the other things like do you remember I mean even at the beginning one thing I I kind of Wonder is you've been around a bunch of special people Peter teal Elon Musk all this stuff is it clear in early like in the early days like do you remember the moment where you're like oh this person's kind of different they are that five standard deviations yeah in intelligence or conviction or whatever one of the I mean we all try to like set strategies for ourselves and goals and whatnot and like I remember in college I thought wow this is a really good opportunity at Stanford to reach out to a bunch of successful people and kind of learn from them see who I see who I admire who I want to be like and you know I I've met some of the legends of global macro Finance who I'm still in touch with I met a bunch of other big business people and Run 4 500 companies and to me had by far the most interesting intellect he was he was clearly just one of the smartest people I'd ever met and he was interested in some of the same things I was interested in he he taken some of the logic farther than I ever had so so so I always learned the most from conversations with him so that that that to me was one of the reasons he was the most attractive to try to work with and try to build with and so before you start M multiple other companies you do clarium which is his hedge fund I guess is the way Global macro fund yeah it's like the most fun part of Finance there's all there's lots of parts of Finance Finance is like all sorts of areas Global macro is looking from like the highest possible perspective that everything going on in finance it's like the the bond yields around the world the flows of money around the world how equities are being valued they basically it's like just from very top down like what is happening in the world of finance and how do you map it out how and you look at relationships you understand you of course like you know the Australian currency is going to be really correlated with the price of metals and there's different ways in which they can get way off and you can create a regression trading system if they're way too far off where you can make money based on the reversion right but then you say oh normally I would trade this but actually this is happening because because China just like you know invaded this thing over here so actually it's not a good time to do it and it's just it's just really really fun map of the world and we we were really interested in like long dated oil prices what was happening with oil we're very interested in how uh Fanny man and Freddy Mack which are the two big giant housing groups they'd gotten to be much much bigger in the US in early 2000s and and they they're they had these giant mortgage back security portfolios that are worth trillions of dollars and they had to hedge these portfolios basically I won't go into all the details just a little bit esoteric but based on how they were hedging their portfolios was completely changing the global fixed income Market it's completely changing the pricing of bonds we found some really interesting ways to do things there my f my favorite story though I'll give you is just to give so so we're working at the hedge fund the Market's open we're San Francisco we're in 555 California right it's that big building downtown like after after 911 I think Peter had a parachute in his room I always told him he should have parachutes for us too but anyway there one parachute okay that was just a joke but it's probably anywhere but uh no so it's like school office on the 4 second floor and and and the Market's open at 6:30 so the Traders are supposed to be in at 6:30 except the first Friday of every month you had to come in at 5:30 because the non-farm payrolls come out still now the first Friday of every month at 8:30 a.m. on the east coast and it turns out this is a very important number because it shows you what's going on in job growth in the whole economy uh you know based on the bureau Labor Statistics numbers and and what was really cool is Kevin Harrington was our head of research this like genius crazy physics biology interesting guy's he's end up being on the National Security Council later like super interesting smart guy and he like had mapped out this thing i' helped him with where we realized that they were adjusting the numbers wrong uh based on seasonal adjustments and so we were able to predict whether the number would hit or miss and and this thing would move Bond markets like crazy like like hundreds of billions of dollars and move around based on this number and we figured out they're systematically Miss MISD dooing it this is totally legal you're allowed to do this in finance so we figured okay this is a mistake 75% of the time we can make money trading this and then we can adjust it to make it even better based on where the market was positioning so if the Market's going to be surprise and we can kind of tell there's a good chance it might be we take a big position right like the night before or whatever and then like make a ton of money morning when it worked and it was at 4:30 in the morning about 75% chance and so if you do it enough you're going to do it well over time and it was the most fun thing cuz we take these like giant positions on this thing and you'd be there with like Peter and Kevin is this just like the highest highest sck Game of Poker you it's the most fun game of poker and you're like literally personally have like a few million dollars running on it at a time as ear my 20s these guys you know Peter probably had hundred million dollars running on every time and and and and you're like high-fiving if it goes right or you're depressed if it goes wrong it's the most it it's most fun high STI is he sweating or what's his uh everyone's like everyone's like what's going to happen it's like so exciting and then and you're like I remember so many like celebrations we' all like go to like our favorite breakfast place afterwards if it worked out it was it was pretty cool what you do if it didn't work out yeah sometimes we go there anyway but but for some reason my mind this is maybe who I am I remember all these times it worked out I barely can remember the times it didn't I know it didn't sometimes but like maybe this is like a Serial entrepreneur sort of thing where you just see how the good memories you know right so it's like but I remember it was it was it was a fun time that's a entrepreneur survival uh tactic yeah all the traumas too cuz if you know if you remember how hard something is you're very L much less likely to started again or do another thing way I would have built all these companies if I have to force myself to like think about that too much you know you the way you just described like the global macr fund you're pretty young when you're doing this and that's not what you were doing just before so it's not like you had tons of experience my little brother got me reading like a bunch of economics and finance stuff when I was young so I kind of had a weird both computer science and finance background so and I had opinions about it so I think so weird those are like my two things so so you know so I knew that world pretty well and yeah you learn a lot being in it you just do you just have to be in it to do it but it's I mean credit to them for betting on you to be able to to do that ver you know they could have hired somebody who's been doing that for 20 years in this we talk about lessons from Peter teal I think one of the most important ones I've seen from him that I've definitely taken to Heart in what I've done is I'd much rather hire hire I'd much rather hire for talent and ambition and hard work than hire for expertise so almost and there's exceptions right right so if if you have a company that's already really working and already really scaling and there's like a machine that has to be run you want to hire the guy who knows how to run the machine that's fine that's like that's like that's the operator who knows what they're doing already but when you before you've actually built the machine or when you're doing something with a group in like Got High Finance or whatever you want to hire for ra IQ and hard work and just iterating and figuring it out and that's that's a different skill set than the people who run the machines hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database it's totally free if you just click the link in the description below you can go download a collection of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated and so uh what are you waiting for go download it it's free check it out it's in the description below all right back to the show what's your way of filtering for that IQ well you know how do you interview or what are the signals you look for this is like super hard I think you start hard math problems at people what are you doing we used to do that at Claren we had these really hard problems I remember uh my friend suio run a Dropbox one of his Partners there at his new his new Ventures chenel was like the highest scorer on on this tests I gave smart smart smart guy I uh yeah we had a really hard tests but you know once I already had around me a bunch of people who are really top talent it's like they knew people like oh who is the smartest guy in your physics PhD and MIT who is know things like that so it's it's like you kind of you kind of get a network it's already really solid and then you go out from there and so let's go more on that so uh two things one Ben told me something that like there's some number I don't know the exact number 20 30 people who have worked at your companies that have then gone on to start like unicorn companies dud what is that what is that number roughly oh gosh you know I don't actually keep track of the official number but there's over 20 people who've worked directly for me who've started huge companies and it's something I'm really proud of is that we've had a lot of super talented people and you know in some ways it's like I like to like back my mind like oh yeah I'm a great guy I take credit for shaping them but in some ways it's like they were already really amazing and and you know and so I was maybe I'm just good at convincing them to have work with me ahead of time you know so it's like there's there a nature nurture thing right so yeah there's there's some of both I do like to think that we've given them useful Frameworks just like I learned from Peter they might have learned some of these things from me too but but uh I mean one of the one you know not all of them I've even backed like some of them I backed some of them went off and then did it themselves and right you know which you know usually they let me back them yeah yeah that's the worst when when you don't you didn't get the call you actually I'm still proud I'm still I'm still proud of like I'll tell you like the guy who came right out of school to help out of par with me and and and I was like he was became president of the company super talented guy and uh I did not know what I was doing uh even though I just already done paler there's all these mistakes I was making because there's like things I didn't realize I had Advantage as a paler and you know out Parts a multibillion dollar company now it's great but there's things that took longer there's mistakes but there's also Obviously good things we did because the company worked out really well and I think he had he had like one off on his own and he had like uh you know his own tough time or whatever for a little while afterwards and then he ended up partnering with someone and he started a company that became worth $3 billion in like four years and he sold it wow which I'm like oh wow that's pretty [ __ ] cool so but I was like and you know I and I and I he didn't have they didn't bring anyone else into that company but I was still really proud of the fact that I'd work with this guy and then he'd gone on and had like crazy success I mean it's a cool feeling you know right but for the record it's always I'm more proud if I got to invest too right I know come on take care of your buddies yeah exactly no most of like the 95% of them it's like people will bring me in and I'll still like help them coach and work with them together so let's do uh big hit number two at a par um you explain like explain the layman's terms what even is adapar and then I I have some questions for it but let's first through the the explain like I'm 5 years old what is adapar so adapar is uh is the leading wealth management technology company in the US and so there's people who work at what are called raas registered investment advisers there's tens of thousands of these and they will help you or your parents or whoever kind of manage their wealth they'll give you reports they'll do your trusts in estate they'll just do everything around kind of the wealth planning man it was really freaking hard we built all this stuff and we like hooked up to Schwab and fideli CU those are like two of the biggest everyone's heard of those right the biggest custodians and we had all this wrong data in the reports like what are we doing wrong and it turned out the data coming from Schwab and velli was oftentimes wrong I'm like what is wrong with this space it's like the whole thing's a mess so it was it was a hard company to build took about three or four years before we really got to the point where it was useful to people and so you didn't give up though during that time um oh no that's like the last like you have to have a personality where you're not going to give up I mean I'll give up if it turns out someone else has already solved it perfectly like if adapar already existed it would have been a stupid thing to do then I little than that then then maybe you give up and pivot but the fact that there's a hard problem you're not going to give up you're just going to like double down and like fix it you know interesting so you're you're uh you you don't give up if it's too hard too Bessy it's like that's better that means once I do solve it it's going to have this giant moat like adapar has the biggest freaking Mo we were talking earlier about guys like rocket internet will like go around copying things and annoy people like good luck if you want to try to copy that you got take a billion dollars in 10 years you know like no chance no chance you talk about hard work I when I was doing research for this I I called somebody works on your team and I said tell me about it what's he like what's it like to work with him one of the things I said was like he's always on I've never seen him just go like go dark go off or just like turn his brain off or be like I just want to chill on the beach and just drink my ties and not do anything is that well this is like accurate for you this is like my game though I mean I think you have to love what you're doing right so like you shouldn't play games you don't you don't like you know if you're not playing you're not enjoying the game you got to switch it up yeah so this is this is this is this this is what I'm doing this because I really enjoy it it's really fun I'm really good I think one of the you know Aristotle would talk about how like one of highest Pleasures is like is like using your mind in its highest capacity right so let you explain like you actually enjoy chess more than Checkers if you're good at both because chess is has more levels to it it's a more complicated game and so you you want your mind to be engaged in interesting complex useful things that are getting things done it's it's like a positive part I think it's it's how you manity works right how do you still um recharge or just get clarity of thought because one of the challenges is if you're always on uh you might not have that chance to step back and reassess you do need open time for creative I've noticed when I over schedu myself I'm not nearly as creative then and I think the cold plunge help right I don't know mind that was a quick you in there for a little 51 second reset we had I think I stayed in for the phone yeah you you you actually did two plunders that was pretty good what is this typical schedule like uh what's a day in the life because you got your fund you got companies you got all kinds of stuff you got your podcast yeah my number one my number one is ATC and hvc has a build program which is my favorite part of it a third of our money now goes towards building new companies so my favorite thing is like the strategy for recruiting talent and then strategy sessions with with you know to figure out what we're going to build right and so when you you said strategy for talent what was the other one strategy for building the company is that yeah you're basically when you're the way I look at the way I look at opportunities for new businesses is you're looking for conceptual gaps in the world you're saying like here's here's where this industry is now like here's how this thing is working here's how this process is done in the economy and here's where it could be if it was using like the right new technology or the right new incentives or this or this right effective cultures or what whatever it is that like could be better about it and the question is not just it's actually very easy to find conceptual gaps in World I'll put forward if you spend some time with like a few smart friends and you like study industry and talk to people you're like you usually will find oh wow this thing could be done this way and so the the harder question is not just what it could be done but like what's the path to get there what could we put in place that would allow us to get it there how do we build this thing how much is it going to cost how do we how do we make the people want so there's a lot of things for example in like healthcare and hospitals that are done completely wrong but it makes hospitals more money so so so so it's like so even though it's like clearly not the right way of doing things they're not going to just fix it you have to find some way to get from here to there with the actors being willing to do it right know so let's do an example so um give me an example either maybe something that you're that's top of mind because you're thinking about it right now maybe it's not all figured out or a recent one yeah so a gap and a path that you kind of figured out 100% so uh it turns out that there's tens of thousands of loading yards around the country in logistics these are places where trucks come they get in line they drop things off they move things around they they you pick things up and it's it's a pretty interesting area and like the biggest warehouse company in the country is prist and it turns out the founders investor with me is based in based in you know near by in California we're back there and then it turns out there's like a handful of the biggest carrier companies like Ryder you've probably heard of and others and we actually sold a company to Ryder so we're close to those guys too and so so because we knew a bunch of these guys we started analyzing what can we do with AI to make your yards better and what we figured out is that if you put just a couple cameras in at first we thought we need six but just a couple cameras you can kind of watch and map out where everything is is map out how efficient the gate is map out the processes create accountability incentives people to go faster uh create ways of peeing the carriers if it's backed up to like to use the other loading ARS nearby just like basic little ways and the margins of like making these things work better and and and timing them and creting because you want a little bit of competition people always respond well you know if you do it properly and so we've mapped this out and we ended up founding a company with a really strong AI team uh and and we ended up kind of co-founding it with the this these like you know the warehouse companies the carriers and others based on their needs and really cool because the way we built it with them is we have like a few hundred million Revenue already built in that we can scale up into their into their yards they already own and then we can have something all the other yards want to use as well let's do more detail So you you're already kind of in adjacent to that world because you've done stuff but how does the brainstorm work inside your office or where like where when does somebody ask the question hey could you use AI for these loading yards like how how do like take me all the way to that like where does a question like that even come from where does the Nugget of insight come from so my partner Jake's in charge of logistics and supply chain he's he's the kind of biggest driver here and he's you know done some strategy sessions with you know our our friends running these different companies we're close to we'll get together I have a Vineyard in in Napa Valley and we like bring every year like the 100 Top Logistic CEOs and you know drink and strategize and hang out you know it's like good way and you kind of asking them questions to try to find their pay what your problems what works what you spending money on what are you seeing we'll bring like new entrepreneurs and we're backing and like get their take on things and we'll bring what are called eirs entrepreneurs and residents you know who will talk with them and iterate on the idea right so kind of new Lo loading yards is a big thing let's go talk and it an ideas as what we could do to apply new things to it and uh you know in this case there's a really strong AI team that happens to be in the UK that we'd met through other friends that like had worked on some really cool visual problems we thought was very very good for this and ended up recruiting them as co-founders which which worked out really well so we're constantly on the lookout for like separately for like napkin math you're like okay so if we can improve the loading yards by this that's the size of the prize and then that kind of clears a hurdle for you yeah this this is this is and and you know the other thing here which I I don't love but is definitely help ful is California had some new regulatory rules about things you had to actually map out as well so they're going to have to do something anyway but why not create more value based on then but then like be the thing they they put in when they're going to have to do it anyway in the next year right yeah the rules coming up there's like you know Logistics has had a few of these things there had some rule on telematics where you had to like I think for purposes of not making people drive too long you had to like record things differently which was kind of an insertion point for a couple TX companies we help back as well which is the thing tracks the trucks and stuff so there's things like that where the regulatory thing is helpful too and then yeah you just you sit down you map it out know you've known the people for a long time I mean the the one of the unfair secrets of business is the more success you have the more it's like a platform for a bigger thing you can do next time and that's just the way it is you just got to keep in the game because like it's like the I think when I was really young I used to think oh I could start a business and make a lot of money and then go to the beach and then that would be like fun and that's like that's not nearly as fun as the fact that once you've already started successful once now you get to do like bigger things more easily right so it's like it's like that's why like I think when you're young partner with someone else who already has an unfair Advantage help them use their unfair Advantage build something with them now you have all these extra unfair advantages you could do it again so this this is like there's like this naive thing where like you're like this Lan business founder I think you can do that but it's so hard right why play the game on hard mode yeah why play the game on hard mode why not why not find there's so many places in the world where there's unfair advantages and like an unfair Advantage what I mean by that is like every time you have a success you now have the respect and attention and understanding of all these people who will then help you do the next thing right and once you prove your confident once then you know there's you I have a bunch more things I could be doing now if I had more competent like young people around me who wanted to be entrepreneur and partner with me we have a bunch of them but we always need more because there's the thing we lack we don't lack ideas we don't like money we lack really talented hardworking people with persistence you know I love that um those so good can I come back for seconds can we do another example another Gap or another origin story of of one of these uh ideas that that I think is it makes I'll I'll give you another crazy guy I mean these These are these are I'm taking big swings right now so these are going to sound a little crazy but like I was pretty bullish on China like 15 years ago a lot of us were I like I thought I was opening up a lot of my friends there were reading Milton Freeman and free economy stuff I'm like this is going to be great there's so many smart people there so we start making bets there we start working there doing a bunch of stuff and then this guy shiin ping takes over and then like I'm told by all these different senior people there like Joe yeah none of the stuff that you want to work on here is gonna be allowed it can't be foreign like oh that's too bad so so I just stopped working there as much and then I kind of hear from them like terrible things are happening and then a couple of them disappear then I hear he's making all these Engineers work on defense like okay this is pretty effed up I'm kind I'm kind of nervous about this now and we M start mapping it out at the same time you we done paler started in 2003 so this is now like 2015 2016 and I wasn't I'm not running paler anymore but I'm still an advisor watching it and like a few of my guys there are noticing that defense the defense world in the US has gotten to be like a lot more dysfunctional a lot more broken there hasn't really been so what happened in defense is all these companies Consolidated the 1990s after the Cold War spending went down so they all merged and became like these giant primes and these Prime started acting a lot more like government agencies themselves like not super Nimble not super adaptive kind of like the way they get the contracts is by having the right lobbyists not necessarily but they have to they have to convince con we call it Innovation theater they have to pretend they're innovating but they're not necessarily great at innovating because that's not because they're so big they have no competition and so we're like oh this is kind of scary all this stuff like none of the best Engineers are going into these primes their stuff's getting worse meanwhile China has the best Engineers they're getting better this is we better do something and so so three of my best EX paler guys they partner with Palmer of course start andrel you've talked to him before so so I backed them early along with Peter and I'm like okay guys we're back in defense let's figure out what the hell else to do here so we so we basically mapped out like what are 20 new possibilities in defense I I want to find 20 from just to see and then we're going to choose what's the most important one and by the way is that something you tell your team like come to the table I want to hear 20 ideas yeah well put you have to have like a guy whose job it is you have to have the guy who's helping them you have to have like advisor who are able to like get them into the right places to talk and explore but let's yeah let's talk to our let's talk to our smartest friends in the space let's talk to our Network I want to hear you know down here you know about 20 ideas of new things like and I want to see where we think gaps might be and we come back and there's like eight or nine pretty good answers a few things that I thought are bad answers but but you know find some interesting stuff and one of the areas that's pretty cool is it looks like there might be new possibilities in uh in in EMP in electromagnetic pulse space and it's really directed EMP of course you don't just want to set one of these off and screw up all yourself but but this does what an EMP does is it Fries electronics right and so it turns out that if you can direct these what it is is you're taking microwave energy and you're shooting it in a blast you can actually turn things off and the government has spent billions of dollars on this stuff but they hadn't really applied any of the new uh any of new Chips basically at all and you want that to protect against like drones for example that's that's one of the really good ways of doing it so basically you can have a chip you can you can basically control Power on very small time scills you could take you know take you know the G nitride emitters and you could build this correctly with a top talent there turns out there's like a co-founder who's a friend of a friend of mine from Stanford who's just a genius who helped figure a lot of this out also and and and you could shoot down things like 10 times farther away and and and you know theoretically you could use this against missiles and turning their guidance Systems off you could use it against a truck coming to your base really fast you just blast it you know it might be that the truck has a terrorist coming to shoot you and you want us to turn it off it might be there's a pregnant lady they're trying to get to the base to get birth like you don't want to necessarily have blown it up right so it's by blast it and you're not turning the truck off you're not killing the person so pretty cool like non-lethal way of like stopping stuff that's giving you trouble right and and long story short we were able to put together a money put together a prototype and you know with about with less than 30 million doar in this in the second round we got to the point where we were we were we fought our way into a contest against the other primes and so so basically one of the key things in government is like we're always trying to get them to have contest the primes do not want contest how do we compete on Merit not on longevity relationship I'm not going to be better at playing golf with the senator but if you can let me into the contest then maybe we can win right how do you convince them to do the contest that you push the the Congress so make make laws to allow competition you have there's competent generals there's competent Admirals like you know thanks to paler and SpaceX people had seen Outsiders massively outperforming and they're they're more open to the ideas so we're we're pushing things in the right direction got and and so they do this contest like they didn't really take us seriously because the other guys had really spent billions of dollars on this like what can you kids do right that's kind of like the old mindset in the US in the 1950s 60s is like Innovation is expensive Outsiders aren going to be able to do it and that was true 50 60 years ago but long story short uh we ended up shooting down the Harden drones nine and a half times further away than than the other guys they actually had to used had use binoculars to like watch us like shooting them down really far away and and people were just like Flow gas like everybody was lined up and it's like okay we'll see who who performs he like you're going to need binoculars to see ours cuz it's going to be out of range compared to whatever else is I I think and there people are just totally shocked and and yeah is that the name of the company Eis Eis is a cool nameis was a name in Legend of the bow of thesias Theus started Athens and his bow had infinite arrows and so this is kind of like a bow with infinite arrows because you can keep firing the pulses that's cool they're 10,000 was paler like a a Lord of the Rings reference paler was Lord of the Rings so epis is more is more more real mythology paler is more in the fake mythology world but no I we have quite a few things named after Toki and stuff as inspiring story the idea with paler paler is aing crystals right and in the story this is super dorky but in the story they're built by like the L's of the uttermost West and they're basically this thing created for the humans to get rid of the bad guys but then 2,000 years later a bad guy takes over the technology right and is using it for evil and so the idea with paler is we thought we're very civil liberties obsessed so we wanted to build it in a way that would like go after the bad guys but then you got be to watch the Watchers and be really careful about how the technology is used because it's very obvious if you're doing something kill the bad guys that a bad guy could use this for something horrible right and so it is a dangerous area we believed it was a necessary thing to create and we you know we end up Ling thousands of terrorists so we we're happy with the results so what's fascinating to me is that not only have you had multiple hits but they're in areas that are different but also just hard areas where I don't even those are not even ideal I don't think about these like uh the logistics yards or EMP pulse technology like these are so in different domains I'm curious ious um is that uh is that intentional meaning do you like cuz most of the entrepreneurs around me Silicon Valley were like oh BB sass you know what's a problem oh let's make a to-do list app because I know that problem I'm so familiar with it is it a strategy for you to go where to fish whether people not fishing or is that just what happened no I think it's definitely definitely a strategy of sorts where you don't want to build like yet another like restaurant app or yet another to-do list app because it's like that's what every other 21y old is thinking about like this probably why I miss strip early Hest been a PayPal and I had to like see every payment app there's like literally hundreds of payment apps I was like oh God you know because it's like CU Peter would make me take the meetings after I didn't want to do anymore so it's like now you want to listen there's there's parts of the world that are big parts of the economy that are very important that that are not as exposed to technology cultures and so you want to kind of take your our our advantage is we have a really tough technology culture and let's figure out how to expose it to something that's that's not likely to to seen that before and then find ways to work together to fix problems and what are some other ideas either um I want to either hear ideas that um you're not doing just because you can only do so many things at once or it might be that would work but it's too small for me or it's it's not like kind of using my my current platform can do bigger things but this happens to me all the time I see ideas that somebody could do that I'm tempted to do it because it's so clear to me but it's like that would be not the right game for me to be playing right now there there's so many things if I had the right Talent I'd be doing more um you know I do a lot in the wealth management world I think that the process of starting a trust and like the actual legal work around this stuff could be very automated with AI you could have like a smart lawyer and like a few smart Engineers you could like have a whole new Trust Company and a whole new like Estate Management Company we we have SAS software for estate stuff you'd plug into I have a lot of distribution for this ready but I would need like the right engineers and AI people and I'm not sure if it's bigger than a billion dollar or two billion dollar business but it's like it's still worth it you know and it saves a lot of time so but I I'll give you a really big one I want to do but I don't have the right people around me um local government so we just sold open gov for $ 1.8 billion and and local government there's a lot of lessons from this company a lot of mistakes it took us 12 years Zach Bookman the CEO my co-founder great job um we learned that you only can really do things they already have a budget for there's about 90 things local governments pay money for software to do and open govern has about 40 of them so we learn this Bas really well like this big right is the law processes and and anyway the idea is that there's trillions of dollars spent by local governments and a lot of them can't find the right staff for certain processes and a lot of them have people are retiring soon too so I think I think a b a business process outsourc thing for certain tasks for local government uh that is augmented by AI could be like just a huge business to basically help them with this and I right now it's not a standard way they work but I could see if you do it really well it could become a standard way and that's the kind of area where you can make tens of billions of Revenue before anyone even notices you because it's such a big part of the economy so I know that's that's another so what would the first like six to 12 months of that company look like you'd basically have to find early Partners willing to trust you and work with you on Outsourcing some one of those 90 processes and it be it'd be something like where you like augment their ability to do licensing and permitting faster or you're augmenting some of their grunt work on tracking their assets and asset management or you're doing something for their budget for them automatically it's way faster CFO doesn't have to hire three people they can only hire one person which is you or something like that like but you'd have to go in and figure out what processes are cities even willing to let you do and it's it's a very unnatural thing because it's not how they work right now but it's one of those things where there's like a secular Trend towards like you know local government not having enough money so if you can find ways to save the mass amounts of money and make it higher quality service there could be something there right all right I want to play a little agree or disagree game so I want to say a statement and I want to hear you agree or disagree with it um so the first one is on on this idea of big swings that are solving like huge problems Mission oriented things uh versus like getting just getting your first win uh under your belt a guy came on the podcast and he said my theory is you first you go get your nut and then you work on your Noble Mission and he's like you know you go and you develop your skills you get make a few million bucks you get personal autonomy and then you should pick a noble Mission a noble Quest and go on that agree or disagree with that philosophy I I agree in general I think it's a really good thing to do you want to have a solid base before you do something that's like a huge crazy risky Quest you don't want to be like poor for 12 years while you're while you're doing something if you can help it I mean I'm not saying that's going to be the path for everyone but if you can do what he said that's a really great way to do it okay another one um a lot of people say that ideas are cheap ideas are a dime a dozen execution is everything and I agree that execution is very important but I think ideas really matter too I think that project selection picking the right Market to go after is a um is a huge lever so I think that the execution is everything philosophy is BS agree or disagree that's a tough one because I've seen a lot of good ideas with they actually aren't worth that much because they couldn't actually bring together the talent to do them so you you it's necessary but not sufficient you do need both right the execution is the harder part but you're right you can have amazing execution and I've seen and people going after the stupidest ideas and and it's not going to yield something so you need both but the ideas by themselves are not that valuable okay that's what I'd say another one um focus is a superpower and I would say that like we were talking about this earlier you you recognize the value of focus and just compounding one thing um but you've also done a variety of things agree or disagree that you know focus is the way to go focus should be the strategy focus is clearly the right strategy for the most successful people in the world if you look at the wealthiest people in the world they nearly all focused and compounded over a very long length of time uh if you look at pal and adapar are the two companies where I focus full-time on them they're my two of my most important companies it's uh I I think when you're having impact on the world in different ways sometimes it's okay to to do different things I think I think philanthropically I think for me coaching entrepreneurs something I enjoy I I think I'm I think I'm obviously creating a lot of value right now but I think I think as an entrepreneur as a business person in general it's you you especially if you haven't already had like a giant win you should just focus and get that giant win in compound um you're friends with Elon what um what's something you've learned from him or something you admire about him uh maybe that the rest of us don't know by you know who only know him from the outside yeah I I mean I guess I'd say I really admire his boldness and his like obviously it's it's he's really good at Focus he's really good just saying no even to friends about anything is just not like tied to what he's like really passionate about and focused on to win and he's just really really bold at like clearing like nonsense out of the way and clearing mess out of the way and just like going right for the thing that that matters right for the substance so I think I think most people in my life would be think I'm maybe too bold or too direct or too extreme and elon's like a whole step further which I think is great to see like okay I could do better at this there's more here yeah I could be I could be more myself in that direction and I'd be more successful if I would you know I'm obviously done very well but but but I think he's a whole another level of bold and that's something that it's good to see that for me because it reminds me that that's like a that's a good direction for entrepreneurship um you know is he focused though because he's got like five things you know he's got Twitter he's got SpaceX he's got Tesla he's got neuralink he's got boring company he's got so many things um what is how do you square that is that is it Focus or is it I mean I think he was insanely focused for a very long time on on the things he he was doing and on scaling them and I guess yes sure there were two companies for a very long time after doing one company for a very long time and uh you know he's at a level of success again societally there's things that really matter for society that only he can do so it makes sense if he would expand that I think I told you uh earlier you know my partners are allowed to work up to six things at once and I think when you're like coaching and like managing things and stuff I think it's about the right am right amount I think if you're just operating you want to do like one or two at most right yeah uh last question because I think we got to go but what the whole s my whole thing when I come to an interview like this is what's the one question that really matters like forget the hour like what's the one question that really matters and all the questions I've asked you have been beating around the bush of this one thing so now I'm going to ask you it directly which is you have now created at by my account at least four billion dollar companies directly probably more than that I call that the entrepreneurs Grand Slam um you have done something that anybody who wants to make one successful company would be would be envious of how wow how does he do it you know you see also a lot of other Founders you meet them through your fund or just people who probably come up to you what would you say you are are doing different than the average good founder so this I have some unfair advantages right and it's it's actually not that hard once you've been really sucessful to like to do it again rout it for the first time um but what am I doing differently uh I have a m huge Talent apparatus so we have people at like dozens of universities we have all sorts of you know things we do to what do that mean you have people at universities what who what are they doing it's like you'll have fellows who apply you have people who run your program there you'll host parties and meet talents you'll you have a certain Playbook we've built since paler of knowing how to show up you have like a scouting Department yeah you have like a huge Talent skyting department and works in different ways different places and and and really talented people we spend a lot of time and each of our partners and I that's our job is to scout for talent and to use our Network and the more wins you have with smart people the more you get to meet their smart friends and so so we have a huge advantage in Talent first of all because that's really key we have a huge advantage of like knowing the people who run a lot of big Industries and like having good relationships with them having them as advisers having them as being part of things we've done where we can like understand what's happening in those Industries get quick feedback and iterate on ideas like like one of the biggest mistakes Founders make is they have an idea and they afraid someone's going to copy it they're afraid the idea is valuable it's really dangerous to think ideas are too valuable because then you just don't share them you think that they're yours and so one of our advantages is that is that one of the Peter till thought experiments was imagine there's five Founders who each have an idea and like four of them are like secretly working on it and uh and one of them is like talking to everyone and iterating like which of the five is going to win right so it's clearly the guy who's iterating a ton and five people the same idea we able to have that same idea and then like iterate faster than anyone else because we know everyone running everything and we know how to back back you know how know how to get to the right answer much much more quickly so not only we have the best talent but we able to iterate ideas with people who respect us with people being involved and then whenever we start a company maybe this is a mistake because maybe I could have had a lot more money but I've always been like a minority owner of my companies I've always been like someone who might have like like when we started out the build program our fund might take 20% and our and when my team and I might take 10% so we might have 30 total and like maybe 35 or 40 but but like but we have something where it's less than half and we're very generous with the founders with the early employees with the advisers with the partners so like when we start these things like just even from the beginning I don't have to wake up in the morning being the only one worried about this thing there's like there's another 30 smart people waking up who that's their focus and and they're on it and that's such a big advantage to like have other people like obsess over this thing and are people who truly feel like co-founders by the way I think it's one of the Big M you're like I'm the founder and you guys are the people working like like what are you getting from that other than other than your ego like I'd much rather there's so many companies than people don't even know I'm the founder of and and the people and that's way better because first they're not going to harass me about stuff and and like there's people who are proud Founders who get to be out in the Press doing it and uh and and they're what they're going to sleep worried about it because this is their reputation and their focus in the intro I'm going to say something like this guy has started more billion dollar companies than anybody in America which I think is an amazing claim to fame uh but forget about aill million let's talk about a million the name of the podcast is my first million and I went and read a quora answer that you did somebody said if I want to make a million dollars how should I invest my money M and you said something like this you said I'll pull it up you go if you want to make a million dollars it's not about how you invest your money it's about how you invest your time and you said uh it's about how disciplined you are with investing your time um how should somebody who wants to make a million dollars invest their time you know it's yeah it's right you can't just make a million dollars from investing if you're probably the average person maybe you can over like 50 years or something my my grandma passed away to 103 last year and she was a multi-millionaire having grown up in the depression just from saving money and cutting coupons and that could that could work for 100 years being Thrifty being Thrifty like that that is a thing like over a very long time Horizon I think You' said like she bought one stock or something also like she my grandfather worked for Abbot and she held it for like 60 years I happen to work really well great you know really good for my for my cousins and their inheritance but you know she was a wonderful lady but you know in general that's not probably how you want to make make money you want to make money especially these days I mean gosh going back back to then it was probably a lot harder but these days there's so many places with your time you can learn how to help build things how to help create things how to help be useful to other people and like that's what you want to be doing you want to be finding what are you passionate about what are you good at you have to figure out what you're good at there's you have to be will to say this is what I'm not good at this is what I'm good at and then who else is good at this too who I could maybe learn from who I could be like and spend your time try to find find a way to help those people try to find way to learn how their businesses work be part of a business and growing it and that's that's how you see how everything works and you know if you're talented enough then that the people you succeed with they're probably going to be able to help you do something new later and that's what happened to you right that's how you spent your time uh my understanding if we if we walk back in the journey it's you're in college you go to Stanford and you um you end up working at PayPal you become an intern at PayPal I tried a couple times they rejected me the first time I appli actually what happened why did they reject you as a freshman at Stanford and I remember being at a white board with Max levchin and I just remember this he was the co-founder with Peter on the tech side arguing about some tech thing was PayPal already a big deal is that why you wanted to work there it wasn't that much of a big deal yet like Peter tal wasn't who he was Elon Musk wasn't who he was like those you know their companies combined to start it um but I saw like all the smartest people all these people I admire and all these kind of iconic class going there like people who thought differently you know and so you you try one year rejected try again the second year you're in what's your job you're an intern at PayPal what are you doing that was not very glamorous at all they basically had me setting up the people soft instance which is terrible but I you know I sat next to this guy we were in like so rolloff who's now like Star partner So Co was a CFO and we were kind of in his domain at first and I sat next to this guy who was managing all the money on on Bloomberg like a treasury thing so I got to learn finance and Treasury and then and then what was happening is is the Big Challenge in the companies we were going bankrupt because the Chinese and Russian mafia were stealing all of our money at the time and so I ended up like hanging out after work and with these all these guys who were like working on how do you stop the bad guys cuz PayPal's like a Honeypot it's got all the money so like you go to 7-Eleven and the clerk there is like maybe having a maybe having a bad year and you know angry at capitalism who knows and so they're writing down secretly the numbers on the credit cards and they write down 500 of these numbers they can sell them each online for five or 10 bucks the Russian mafia is buying them up and then all of a sudden you get a charge back that says $200 uh on PayPal to something and you're like I didn't do that so so you you charge it back and then PayPal's left with the bill right and this was like costing PayPal several million dollars a month and a lot of our competitors went bankrupt and so we got to learn at the time how to basically stop the bad guys which was a kind of fun problem too and so I like what you did there which is uh one of the pieces of advice I give in on the Pod is you got to work on the A+ problem at any company so regardless of what your role is you should try to at least know what is the A+ problem the real problem and then try to be helpful on that that's like cuz that's the needle mover and that's where you're going to get the most learning the most action and and I didn't necessarily do this on purpose I actually wanted to quit at first because the people soft thing was so dumb and so horrible and I couldn't figure it out and my dad convin me don't quit just like do what you can to be helpful otherwise there so that was a good dad advice 18-year-old yeah you uh I almost quit college for the same reason and my dad was like cuz I was like you know I'm pretty mediocre here I was like I'm used to being good then you go to a good like you go to a top school you didn't feel like you one of the best now I'm just these are all the best high school kids now I'm kind of in the middle so I was like you know too expensive maybe I shouldn't be here he's like that's exactly why you should be there challenge you want to be surrounded by people who are better than you so one of the things Alex karp had an Insight on my co-founder palent here who was really good is you can't really appreciate a talent unless you're within two stering deviations of it so you think of talent as being on a normal curve for any typal typical skill could be for math could be for podcasts whatever it is and like so you kind of have a natural level of talent you could shift slightly and so the very best people in the world at something might be fourth or fifth standard deviation but if you yourself are second or third standard deviation you can le start to appreciate that whereas if if if if let's say you're not great at physics I don't know if you me like Albert Einstein versus a top figs Professor you're gonna have no idea which one's Einstein right so it's the same thing in any other area differentiate exactly but once you can recognize that town that lets you then harness it for things you're building and doing so so it actually is very useful to be very good at something even if you're not the best right okay cuz you can notice what that this is actually the five standard deviation talent I was good enough at computer science like I got able to get a pluses a Stanford I had friends who were way smarter than me at computer science but I was good enough to know who those kids were and how to harness them and how to hire them right so there's things like that that's interesting so now you the next thing you do you go and you start paler which yeah well well actually I worked for Peter's family office for a while and he was the first investor in Facebook which is his family office there's tons of crazy [ __ ] going on it was really fun it was like you know a really expensive restaurant they went bankrupt there was like a Spam company someone was starting there was there's all sorts of crazy [ __ ] and I was there and like Peter's a genius but he's not really a manager so I started like I was like you okay I'll just I'll take charge here so I started hiring people with him and and kind of helping him run things and some of the older guys like who the [ __ ] is this 21 year old kid so we ended up working on a project that summer to map out like what have we taken all the stuff we did at PayPal FR anti fraud and we and we generalized it to like for the intelligence Community what would that look like and and my roommate Stephan and I from Stanford at the time were like sketching up all these cool products and we were building prototypes and that was kind of the the Genesis of Palance here oh interesting okay so you guys you basically had the PayPal showed you a bit of a bit of the problem like they like show us a solution to a problem they're like wait a second because basically what happened is I got to know all these guys at PayPal they're in the Secret Service in FBI those are the two groups that are in charge anti fraud of like arresting the mafia guys and these guys would come to us and ask us for advice on other things because it was like you know it's kind of fun it's cops and robbers like every I know every young man likes this but you know Intel world of course you want to help gets a bad guys so like so like we were teaching him about fraud or whatever you call internet fraud in 2000 2001 and they start coming to us and then 9/11 happened and then the government started spending billions of dollars on like supposed solutions to catching bad guys watching what's going on and we knew these guys and we watched what they were spending money on and we were like oh my God this is stupid like this is way behind Silicon Valley not that like I'm so smart but Silicon Valley itself had gotten way ahead just because it brought Talent from all over the world so whatever was being done what we call like the the Beltway basically in DC with the old integrators they're still doing stuff from 20 years ago and we're like oh my gosh this is like our nation's under attack uh and we're wasting billions of dollars on stupid [ __ ] so that's that's when we said okay what let's get together let's draw up like what we could actually be doing here if they did it better what happens next so like walk us through because okay we see today I think I looked this morning it's a $50 billion market cap company that's amazing but it's also 20 years later so if we rewind the clock to where most of the people who are going to listen to this are early stage trying to figure things out unclear which pathway to go unclear if this is even going to work take me back back to that what what did you do to what was it like and how did you figure out like the first few steps well there's lots of different ways to build successful companies right so I don't I don't ever want to be like this is the path but our path was we were kind of watching all these companies come out of PayPal so I was very lucky to be sitting there seeing like these guys you know doing iron report and Linkedin and YouTube and Yelp and Etc so like watching these and the ones that I could tell were more successful uh was were obvious of the time were the ones that are attracting the very best Engineers is almost like Engineers were lined up trying to get into these companies right so you think a lot of times people have a business idea you're like how do I hire an engineer and like and like it's the opposite it's like the ones that are crushing it it's like a nightclub where the engineers wish they could follow those people in and and and just those culture something about them it's just the whole it was just so Dynamic it was like they're able to try 10 times as much really quickly you can just kind of tell like wow like you can be really smart at business but like if you could try like 10 times as many things like you can be like slightly less smart business and still succeed right because you get iterate so we like okay we need to build somehow a really top engineering culture like that was like one of our core principles early on is how do we we used to say the engineer is King like how do you how do you have a culture that that attracts the very very best and and respects them and like makes them partially in charge of the company you know with with you and so we spent a lot of time on that um it's a little bit chicken and egg we obviously I was lucky to have a bunch of my friends from growing up who are National math and chess Champions all smart guys and like so we bring this really core culture together convince some of these really top phds from what was your pitch to them like what's what was the quick version that was getting them excited uh uh it's because you need a magnet something to bring the talent in the government's spending tens of billions of dollars in this area they're way behind what we figured out how to do in Silicon Valley it's clear there's going to be a multi-billion dollar company that solves this problem and you describe the problem to this very hard technical thing that if we have the best Engineers we're going to be able to do it and and we're iterating closely you know with National Intelligence with defense agencies and you get to go and solve this problem and if we succeed we're going to save thousands of lives and and we're going to protect Liberties that was that was that was a high it's like you know it's it's a fun big mission one of those things you said is we're working closely with these agencies like how easy was it to work with them because you know you're young how do they even take you seriously you're young and you're different right you have a different approach yeah so so so maybe it wasn't entirely the case that they're iterating as closely as as I'd like them to be with us for the first year or two so Alex karp was very good at this Alex was Alex was at first just an adviser to us helping us and then and then and then Peter uh kept trying to get us to hire a CEO cuz Stephan and I were 20 and you you couldn't really have a 21y old running something working with like senators and the defense department but Like These Guys these generals or former Admirals would come in and they just did not understand Tech culture and I'm sure they were great guys they just wouldn't have fit at all with us and so finally Alex carp had been like helping Peter raise money for things their friends from law school and you know he was uh he was a PhD in philosophy in Germany and in in Europe a lot of the billionaires like to pretend they're philosophers is like the high status thing to do kind of like here they like to pretend their podcasters or something I don't know but so basically basically like he knew all these wealthy people until he started advising us how to talk to them how to meet them how to think about how institutions worked and he had all his like casting things in terms of like how you got to approach people to take you seriously which what do you mean by that I I don't understand like if we show up and we're like these like quirky 21y olds from Silicon Valley that's like that's like that's the wrong casting whereas if you show up and you walk in the door with you the for ah head of the CIA and and and Peter tals made the intro after being a PayPal and another one of his friends who senior has like has explained to them that this is a project that they're helping that it's going to help in this way based on this big advancement made in Silicon Valley and they've been and that they've already been talking to a bunch of people the FBI and Etc and they want your feedback like that's like a that's like a high status way to come in the room right whereas if I come in the room be like look how smart I am look how right this is this is better than what you're doing like look at how smart it is while you're wearing a hoodie exactly they're like they're like I guess I a lot of young people maybe underestimate the substance is important but it's you can't lead with substance because substance is not taken seriously so you have to have the substance to win but you have to have all the trappings of why they're taking it seriously and why they're comfortable doing it and why they're you know why it makes sense so so anyway there's these things like this about how the world world works and and who to talk to in institution who to get your help so Alex just had like this wisdom about like people and institutions and how to navigate that like the rest of us we had the best tech culture we didn't have that and so we actually convinced him to pretend to be CEO for a few years so that so that Peter would stop trying to hire like a really like senior like military guy but then he was such a good CEO then he actually he actually was he's still CEO 20 years later right so it worked out and you mentioned Peter Peter was not active day-to-day necessarily no but he was critical for the company he critical what was he doing Peter was like first of all he's a financial support the no one would give us crazy kids like I told you there's always crazy projects going on like a lot of people around him are like this is the craziest thing you're doing like it's one thing to waste money on a restaurant but that you're sing these kids that pretend to be spies and build things and tell like what are you thinking there's no such thing as a company that does this so so like you have to give him credit for like being will to bet on a crazy idea he put a lot of money into it right like it it was several million dollars early on which to the which is like and and then and then we had then this find start putting things alongside others but I mean yeah that's that's a huge amount of money for like crazy kids is what are we doing and and then like Peter was really good for strategy he was really key on I think one of the most important things is he stopped us from a couple early Partnerships this is one thing that people screw up a lot with startups a lot of startups when you're getting going you want to like you get really excited about some partnership on the table and you think it's going to really help you but but a lot of Partnerships will cap your upside a lot of Partnerships will limit your ability to iterate and to try other things and I think because he had the experience and he was going for multibillion dollar win he was really able to like steer us away from a lot of big mistakes early on like what would have been a a partnership that would have been maybe like we would have like spent like all of our time selling our interface in Europe to give them all the rights to it and we would had to fly over there and support things they were doing or just like random things that like sounded really good cuz I when you're getting going you're desperate for that first 500,000 million revenue and stuff and like but you have to make sure you get it in a way that's going to actually scale into something much bigger that's not like a mess it's GNA distract you right right and um Peter is he's an interesting guy for sure he you said restaurant curious like I mean there's everything I think so this is this is like not unique to Peter by the way this is a really common rule is that whenever someone becomes very successful for the first time um they usually become more expansive if they're an entrepreneur I mean all of us we like to build things right we like to create things and so it's once you have success you're like okay I'm really good at that I probably could be really good at these six things as well and then I think we all forget the reason I was really good at this first thing is because I was like obsessively working on it for 80 or 90 hours a week and I brought like 30 of my smartest friends into it and we all iterated like crazy and we almost died multiple times so we barely made it work you kind of forget that part and you're just like oh yeah oh I did this and you so you do all these things Snap My Fingers exactly like we're GNA do this this this this it's like it's like playing rist you know where you're conquering and like it turns out that's not that's not a good way but this is what I've seen almost everyone go through this like unless I I'm lucky to watched multiple other friends go through it so I I still made the mistake in different ways but you but so so there was very expansive and there were some things maybe didn't make as much sense and and and then then of course but you know he's so freaking smart that some of them did make a lot of sense the first check to Facebook at that time so I mean give me a break you know you can you can I mean everyone in Venture is not going to have 100% hit rate and so so so you learn from your mistakes were you around when he wrote that check into Facebook yeah I mean I I'd get no credit for it and like at the time did it seem like a big deal or was it just like one of many things he was doing it was unclear that that was a that that was F it was one of it was one of many things they seemed particularly smart and interesting and you know I was I can't say I thought it was going to be as big as it was I don't think anyone realized that but but it was it was clear they're really smart really interesting guys who are very aggressive and and so it was it was a fun to be exposed to I think one of my good friends who actually helped Peter write the check is played in the movie by by an African-American guy I think which he jokes about but it's like it was a good it it was a good time to be there it was fun he's like a five4 white guy exactly he's a little Jewish guy that's the ultimate compliment sorry James no credit for you if anyone out there wants to rewrite me as like a super handsome black guy I would love that thank you for doing this awesome give you the highest compliment which is I learned a lot today uh that's my goal with all these is what are some of the things that you know couple of golden nuggets that that that come out of this so thank you so much for doing it's fun getting to know you yeah I know [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
uh really here's here's the the hook okay so this is my Billy of the week we used to have a billy of the week theme song I don't know if we still have we should dig one up or get AI to make a bil of the week jingle for [Applause] [Music] us million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollar okay so I let me tell you how I got hooked on this I read this story in the information and I don't really read the information normally in fact I can't read I don't buy the I don't pay for the information but you like it gives you the the preview and then it starts to fade you're saying by the way the information.com yeah and it and it fades and it totally gets you hooked it gets me hooked but I'm reading the fading part and the as it's fading away there's a line that just caught my attention it goes it's like residents of the small town in Idaho were complaining because suddenly dozens if know like you know dozens of private jets were suddenly flying into this private airport and you know like basically like armored vehicles were showing up and they're wondering what is going on they called the mayor and like did something happen and they're like oh it's just Thomas tll who's that exactly who's that and then it faded out I was like oh I have to ask my friend who's got an information account to Bootleg me a copy of this story and so he did so this guy is I think kind of a legend he is a stealthy billionaire he starts off his career in lrom mats shout out to Cody Sanchez then shifts to auto repair shops then shifts to uh buying small accounting practices and does basically a rollup and ends up with 500 worldwide locations for his accounting thing that he put He put it all under one Banner like American Financial Services or some [ __ ] like that and no like private Equity background just like a blue collar he had he had worked he he first was Blue Collar then at some point he gets I don't know he he did have a like a stint in private Equity he learned a little bit about the private Equity business either as an internship or something else um but I'm pretty sure he quit college or just like was Moonlighting while he's at College doing the laundromat thing uh you know grows up single mom uh you know doesn't have a lot of money so he's he's basically like I need to fill a need so he's like okay I'll start with launder mats okay this is not a very good business but like gets me going and he's the whole time he's kind of a data nerd so even with the lrat business he um start starts buying these washing machines that can do surge pricing so it's like when there's more demand the cost goes up he's like why wouldn't it do that uh all the rush comes in at one period of a time that's why I need to make money and so you know he's a little bit of a data nerd and he ends up becoming famous because he takes that same data philosophy and he applies it to a business that never had it which is the movie business and so he does what's called Moneyball for movies so the Moneyball strategy that was famous for uh in baseball to find undervalued assets and to build a team construct a team with like you know sort of the using data as an edge rather than these old school Scouts that are you know spitting sunflower seeds and looking at a prospect and being like I like his ass you know like let's he's going to he's got something I always trust a guy with a big ass you know like it's like what what are you talking about um you see he gets on base a lot like no he's too fat never they'll never make it they're like I don't know seems like got some strong loins yeah or be like he's got a strong jaw I think he's got star potential it's like okay he'll be a leader in the clubhouse all right great and so Moneyball was basically like forget that side of thing the qualitative let's focus on the quantitative so this guy does that for movies and he creates legendary ENT M which is the movie production company the movie financing company that financed and produced movies like The Batman series so the Dark Knight all that stuff Batman Begins 300 The Hangover on and on and on now recently Dune um and so he builds this thing up sells it for $3.5 billion do to the richest man in China and um this guy's just like fascinating so like the whole journey from laundr mats auto repair shops tax firms then has a dinner with a guy who's like I think he's a movie exec and he's complaining about film financing and he's like how does it work there and it was basically like the old um you know the baseball scouting thing like oh this actor um you know we like this plot blah blah blah and he's like do you guys do any like data analysis and he's he realized like they don't have the money ball side but they also don't have just private equity and he's like move the movie business is the largest industry that doesn't really have like a private Equity focused firm and that's what I'm going to do I'm just going to bring the capital I'm not going to be the I'm not going to have the full production system I'm not going to have the distribution rights I'll just bring the capital and so what he did was he partnered with Warner Brothers so he he to start this business he raises $500 million which he's like this is the hardest thing I ever done was Raising $500 million for this thing wow and he's he goes in and he partners with Warner Brothers he cuts a deal like we're gonna co-finance 30 movies with you but here's the deal we're gonna basically build up a data team that's going to figure out which movies we should bet on and which ones we shouldn't um and more importantly how we promote them so I thought this was interesting because in most of the articles I read about this guy they're just like it's like the handwavy thing it's like and then he started legendary entertainment and sells it for $4 billion like what how did this guy with no background in the movie business create this company how did they produce these hits and like what was he doing differently and do you know what he was doing differently no no keep going so so there was two or three insights so the first Insight he had was bigger is actually better so there's this romantic idea in the movie business about like Indie indie films and like let's go back to Quality just like real just genuine scripts and all this stuff and he's like most of the movies that fail are these like mid-market movies that kind of cost like a medium amount of money but they don't have like guaranteed slam dunk people will watch for this one reason like it's got this superhero it's got this A-list actor whatever and he's like they're making the plot too complicated that it only appeals to like an intellectual person he's like we need to have movies that have like Commercial Appeal it should still be elevated like he did Inception and he did Dark Knight like they're still great movies but like Dark Knight is still like Batman and Inception still has Leonardo DiCaprio right so he's like he's like yeah I'm gonna have some things that I could take to the bank to actually underwrite these films better so that was the first thing was like they need I need to go for bigger budget films that um have like a headline reason that people will have to go and pay for to to go watch this movie so he leaned heavily into IP so like license IP um he also leaned heavily into like mainstream actors and directors and he did a a ton of great stuff Straight Out of Compton the but Dune one and two Inception uh The Hangover which was huge Watchman Dark Knight just by the way great movies still a hard business I think they they only they've only ever had two consecutive years of profitability or something like that like in the like 10-year run it's not like every year just year after year they were heading bangers but the movie business it's a hit business so when they hit they hit really big in those years that they hit and other years they might lose 50 or100 million but then when they hit they hit 500 million or or billion dollars of of net gain and so you know anyway sells the business one of his first movies was uh was Beerfest you're telling me that wasn't a hit yeah so uh you know the big thing was they they they found Christopher Nolan pretty ear like he turned out to be like one of the best directors period and like he was kind of unproven at the time so you know it's not all not all easy second thing he did though was he's like China how do we make movies that have international appeal specifically appeal in China and he's like China's a big market and there's like a lack there's like a lot of demand there's not a lot of supply of American films that can cross over and so he's like we're going to be International and that's going to be one of our edges so he's like all right I'm gonna I need a simple-minded plot so I need a a it could be well done but the plot needs to be simple good guy bad guy right um he's like for most of these I need something that will transfer into China past the language barrier and just have like simple appeal like Batman uh has simple appeal and so and then he partnered with a Chinese company he did a joint venture with China film which is like a government own public State company for films and he's like we're goingon to bring the movies and we'll do a 50-50 JV with you over there and so he cuts the right deal there and it has the right distribution there then so that was the second good thing it did the third is the data analysis the Moneyball side of things so I didn't fully realize this but in both video games and movies you might if it says like you know this movie had a $200 million budget that's the that's the amount they might have spent on um making the film but then guess how much they'll spend on marketing the film I have no idea another 30% more another 100% more 150% more so if they spend 150 million on the movie they'll spend another 150 million or 200 million on the marketing of the movie so each movie each movie is like a like a meaningful size company that lasts for 3 years well sometimes longer right if it gets syndicated if it has like longterm like gets going I mean the actual work the the work of making it and marketing I mean it's almost it's it's like a presidential election same thing with Grand Theft Auto they'll spend like $500 million marketing Grand Theft Grand Theft Auto that's insane it's crazy that's insane big video games the triaa like video games they'll spend hundreds of Millions on their Market um so they'll usually like double the the amount they spent on making the thing and so you know what else spends that much money on marketing every DDC brand and what he realized in the same way that like what DC Brands did was they took the Moneyball approach and said hm if uh practor and gambles just like doing these like random like just sponsor the Super Bowl and like let's just take tide and then or let's take you know um whatever Old Spice and we'll just run funny TV commercials and like is it working I don't know right the old adage with TV commercials was um half my budget does nothing and half performs problem is I don't I don't know which half and um you know that's how brand adver in worked and then what happened is that guys like Moyes came in and built native deodorant and they're like [ __ ] the Old Spice model I don't have enough money to do TV anyways I have to do the Moneyball approach I need Performance Marketing where I can measure every dollar and attribute every single purchase to which ad I ran and how much I spent on that ad and that will tell me if I should do more of that ad or less of that ad or tweak it and then that's how he builds you know a really fast growing deodorant company on the back of Facebook and so what Thomas did was the same thing with movie marketing what's a direct response version for a movie that's what these guys do they run Facebook ads they run YouTube ads they run to buy a ticket to the movie to get yeah to get you to not exactly like go online and buy the ticket right away but to get you to be like oh yeah I heard that movie's coming out oh it looked good so they'll do [ __ ] let me just tell you some of the [ __ ] that they do so I thought this was pretty cool they'll take trailers so they're like the trailer is the ad creative right the trailer is the thing that needs to get you to say oh I want to see that that movie looks really good and so they'll do like AB test they'll do like 50 versions of a trailer and they'll do they'll take an audience of you know they'll take a hundred people they'll put them in a movie theater they'll play the trailer and they have a scanner on the seat in front of you that'll take like a facial biometric reading of you and they have they have you wearing a a heart rate monitor and they're trying to see like in a movie or a trailer or or whatever yeah like they're trying to see like do you react and what part do you react to does your heart rate Elevate does it Quicken now I don't know if this is just PR by because the guy who was talking about this was their head of analytics um and they basically poach this guy so there's some guy that was he built a sports analytics company in the Moneyball era sold it and then he gets a call from Thomas and says hey do you want to do Moneyball for movies he's like I'm in and so he became the head of analytics and he's like we have a 50 person applied analytics team like applied sciences team he goes that's 49 more than every other movie producer he's like he's like we have like 50 Engineers data scientists like the all of these people are like hardcore data computer science engineering type folks and he's like nobody else even has this department he's like or at least they didn't when when we started do you think they make movies dep like you know how sometimes when we create content we think headline first or thumbnail first or whatever do you think they think of the trailer as what's a good movie that could be an awesome trailer I think 100% they do in fact one of the films that flopped was this thing called The Great Wall or something like that I I don't know I never saw it but it's like they did the joint venture with the CH uh the Chinese company and they're like oh let's let's make a American movie but it's about the Great Wall it's like imagine if the Great Wall was actually built to keep aliens out and that's what they discovered the purpose was something like that Matt Damon's in it and uh movie flops China didn't love it America didn't love it it was like kind of neither it was they tried to make something for everybody it didn't work it was something for nobody and what he the analytics guy is like gonna die on this hill he's like he's like I don't know man the data showed that Matt Damon was he's like we we were under indexed on Matt Damon in China I was like I don't even know what that means but he's basically like the price for Matt Damon versus the cache Matt Damon has with that audience it was a good trade and he's like no that was a good trade and people like the movie flopped dude he's like all right but that was right that one part was right which insane and so why does he have why is he showing up to Idaho with armored vehicles so now he's shifted into so he sells legendary uh to the richest man in China and then he he still owns I think like 10 or 20% um but like you can't own 10 or 20% of a Chinese company as an American like that that's a big Chinese company and so he they give him like Phantom stock so he gets like only a profit share uh he can't like own any equity in the thing but now what he does is he took that money and he's investing heavily in defense Tech so he invested in anduril he invested in some Shield AI like a bunch of Defense Tech so that meeting was basically a meeting of the minds of entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley who are building defense tech people from Washington who are like you know the lobbyist the the people that they Lobby they know the whoever the Senators Congressman whoever those people are and um the generals and the defense contractor like a meeting on the minds of all those people and they were just like you know probably get together and be like China we got to we got to stop these guys you know like and he's got this flywheel right because the flywheel is so amazing the flywheel is you start a defense company you then Lobby and Lobby for increased defense spending so they increase defense spending which goes to your companies right and so like that flywheel of like whining and dining Washington while then funding the companies that will win the contracts is just a very very lucrative model I'm not saying he's doing it in any any malicious or nefarious way not I don't mean that at all I just mean it's very it's interesting how that can work right it's smart if that's your model which is you you can actually influence the spend through PR through whatnot so you'll see like a guy like Joe Lonsdale and I think he believes this by the way he's got defense tech companies right he started paler um he also started a company called epis he's starting some like you know underwater drone company like he's starting a bunch of deep Tech defense tech companies but then he also spends a lot of time building relationships with you know public officials and and those folks and he'll go on CNBC and he'll be like we got to stop Tik Tock and like I I don't think he's doing it you know just for his dollar I don't think that's why he's doing it I think he's doing them all from a sense of purpose like he genuinely thinks that we shouldn't have Tik Tock kind of brainwashing the American like population while being owned or controlled or the data siphoned off to you know the CCP so like I think he genuinely believes that but it also happens to be a very strong flywheel where if you could shift the public perception or the government the government's perception to increase the funding in this that will also benefit the companies that you started to serve that that need dude and Thomas tol looks like a movie villain if you Google and and look at he has a cameo in Batman he is actually uh like in the owner's box you know that scene where Bane like blows up the football stadium he's in he's because he he owns a piece of the pittsbur Steelers too so the team the team playing in the movie is the Steelers he's in the owner box he is a partial owner and he gives himself a little Cameo this guy looks like a Steeler he he's huge he's like a big guy a former college football player I think this guy's impressive hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show let me tell you a couple other random things one he's like I don't live in LA so he built a Hollywood company without living in La he's like he's like I he had a great line he's like I just want to make great movies uh that people love I don't want to figure out you know like I don't want to make sure I have a dinner table at spago tonight like he's like I don't want the Hollywood status stuff like I just want to make great movies and so that's why I don't live there I I just do my thing from far away where's he based is is it Pittsburgh is he based I'm not sure so at one point he bought like 150 acres of farmland and was like I'm gonna live off this land he's like and what he did was he's like I want to use this to learn all of the advanced farming robotics companies and we'll use this land to to try those and he's like I want to learn the tech and try to see if are rebuilding the future of food and I want to be living in a self- sustainable way and like I'm going to try I'm going to try that for a period I don't know how long he lives there or if he does it full-time but this guy's pretty fascinating man he um I don't know he's just done a lot of things in a lot of different places and the through line for all of it was this Like Money Ball for X which I thought was pretty fascinating great fine this was that was really good this guy's so fascinating we should get this guy on does he do interviews or is he really he's pretty stealthy but he went on Lex and he also went on far Street back in the day and so I'd love to have him on to talk CU you could tell he's like a you know like he's a business guy he's very like practical like he's just I don't know he comes across very real I watch some of his interviews he comes across very very real very straightforward he's like well I just I just thought you know like I just thought X like he like that's it like and and then I just did it and he's like well you know for example he invested in the some company doing Gene Tech editing and these guys like are trying to bring back the woolly mammoth have you heard about this yeah I mean I've read about in headlines they're St there stated mission is to bring back the willly mammoth but I loved how we talked about him because it was very real and he was like which company what's that called I don't remember their name like Colossus I think colossal or Colossus something like that okay and so he's like they're like you invest in this company that's bringing back the woolly mammoth right it's like a very Buzzy thing to talk about yeah and he's like well like he's like look I thought they were doing really interesting things with like studying you know the genome and Gene editing crisper he's like I think the willly mammoth thing makes for great PR like he's like he was basically just like I don't give a [ __ ] about bringing back the woolly mammoth I'm not doing this as some like weird billionaire like fetish thing that billionaires do and they're just like oh I need to like you know resurrect you know I need to summon a god he's like the will thing is interesting but it's like it's like a headline he's like you know what I like is that he's like I met these sign these guys and they're really smart scientists and I just thought these guys are so smart I need to be around them and they're going to do really interesting things so I'll back them and if they want to work on this will M thing okay great he's like but I just think the science they're doing is really fascinating and he goes also I like their ethics because he goes when I the more I met with them it was clear that okay these guys are in the top 0.1% of intelligence but there's people like that in China and all around the world he's like but they don't all have the same ethical code that these guys do we're like they're going to use this for good and they're not just going to like be cloning random [ __ ] or editing things like in a Pretty Reckless way and he's like so I just thought it was good these guys needed the backing because like I I I [ __ ] with their moral code basically and so I don't know I like this guy I always find it almost romantic but like very intoxicating when I read about people who don't have uh a ton of education but dominate a certain area so for him the fact that I don't know what entirely what his back around is so I could be off here but it seems like he's sort of a blue cery guy who kind of kicked ass at at finance and deal making and but he doesn't have that traditional New York City you know big Bank background he didn't buy auto repair shops because he's like oh I can do a PE roll up and get leverage and raise prices and he was just like he's like well I live in Pittsburgh and I lived in a part of Pittsburgh a lot of money people aren't buying new cars so it's like you got a car if your car breaks you don't you can't really buy a new car so the auto shops were a good bet because they were goingon to try to fix it it's like uh if I can get like another year out of this beater I'm gonna do it so he's like I just realized like Auto Repair is gonna like be a thing here because that's what the community needs that's how we discovered the defense Tech stuff so he was like he was doing movies and he's like oh dude I want the like the fight scenes in the military scenes to be realistic so he's like let's bring in advisers from the actual military to tell us like what is the Weaponry what would what would be cool what would be the The Cutting Ed stuff that if we put in the movie that would be interesting and he's talking to them and he's kind of like damn they really don't have like as much Cutting Edge Tech as I thought like the Navy and the Marines like they kind of wished that they could do XYZ but they couldn't and that's when he started funding more defense Tech he's like sounds like there's actually just a need for this um and so like you know obviously you don't know how much of this is like reverse PR where you go back and you make up a nice wholesome sounding story but I don't know I I bought it which I I usually I'm pretty skeptical about that stuff but I bought it here I also like people so and this is really easy to read about and to think about but basically all right so you explained his idea I'm going to do Moneyball for movies and you think about it and you go okay cool that I guess that makes sense even at the time you could be like that's neat that's interesting but to have the courage to in confidence to believe that you are right even though you don't really know too much about something you're a total Outsider to have the courage to do it and to go that big I find incredibly intoxicating and inspirational because you I mean how many people do you think have told him like you have no idea about this industry we've done it this way for a hundred years what are you talking about that's not how it's done but just to be like look it makes sense that it's this this and this and this like Warren Buffett has that a lot of great I mean anyone who's great typically has that where it's like they they believe in their own logic and their own reasoning and they believe that their decision is the right decision even though most everyone is like that's insane I have so much love for people who are that courageous and confident in their own decisions I think that's very MB yeah conviction is attractive um you know one of the things that they talked about with the the Moneyball thing it's like cool like you can set you can read you can have an analogy like Moneyball for movies and then you sit down you're like cool so what are we going to Moneyball like in sports all of the data is public it's all there everyone's stats are there every is filmed on TV so even if you didn't have a stat you could go back and create it like what are you going to do for the movies it's like not the same thing and so what do you what are you actually going to do and so one of the things they did they were like the analytics guy had a great statement he goes I take this population of people he's like on the left side of the bell curve there's people who are never going to watch the movie no matter what we do we don't want to spend a dollar marketing to them that's my goal with that population is don't spend $1 dollar on one impression for those people who are never going to watch it's like then you have the people that are going to watch no matter what I also don't want to spend a dollar on them like they just they are Dune Fanatics they got a dune poster in their in their in their bedroom they grew up watching the reading the books they're going to watch doe no matter what I do so then there's the people in the middle and the people in the middle they're like our swing voters and they might watch it and I need to figure out then I start slicing and dicing that audience and I figure out this mom is going to watch because she loves that actor and this guy's going to watch because he loves a badass action scene so we need two different trailers that we're going to run in Social ads at each of those he's like and then we need a data set that tells us who actually goes to the movies and like basically need a map between the the email addresses that we're advertising to and the email addresses that are used that to buy tickets and we need to create these clusters and try to figure out like what's actually converting movie folks weren't doing this I guess not not in a serious way I don't know maybe maybe there's other producers that are like you know like kicking the wall right now being like God damn it we all do this like that's not special I don't know I don't know the business well enough these guys told the story best better than anybody else so seems to have worked this is awesome I mean the track record's also there too right like they had they just like I mean they built a really big thing in a really small amount of time coming in as a complete Outsider so you know that's pretty pretty impressive this guy's fascinating I want to learn more about this guy yeah he's cool one one other point on this it's interesting to think about where else Moneyball for X could be implemented so I don't know if you've read about Obama's data team or well I've read about Trump's uh Trump's i' I've read a lot about trumps and it is getting into election season coming up uh and I hate it because they they get I get so many texts and emails I mean they are intense about their marketing and I know that Jared Kushner kind of hired a bunch of tech guys and they crushed it even before Trump Obama raised something like a billion and a half dollars and they spent most of that I would imagine on marketing uh I mean what these what the politicians do in basically a year and a half it's pretty phenomenal in terms of like deploying money for marketing and they're Savage about it dude the presidential election is a marketing contest between two agencies and they each get to pick their their front man and then they run a marketing Blitz and they spend 500 million to a billion dollars marketing over the course mons and and like that's it so it got two pres the last two presidents elected was the money ball for X they used it in politics it helped the Red Sox win the World Series uh you know worked in baseball it built tons of DC Brands the Moneyball approach also is you know in finance with all the quants Quant funds or hedge funds that are using using this or Renaissance um so it's pretty interesting to see how you can use Moneyball in a in a IND any industry that is still like not data first so not data driven and if you asked you know how do you guys make decisions and it's basically some version of gut uh gut eyeball you know taste uh there's probably a Moneyball like variant there I know a guy who uh is doing it in with HVAC he has an HVAC business doing like 150 million a year in revenue and he tells me constantly all the data stuff that they're doing and he's like no one people don't do this uh in our industry no one is doing this where uh it's as simple as you know we're looking at the data of what can we send and how many emails can we send to get more Google reviews but they just like Chang their their data is it's like they're running it like a tech company a little bit where they have a small data analytics team and he says that very rarely is anyone else in the HVAC industry doing something like this dude uh Sam I gotta ask you I already know the answer to this question but I gotta ask you did you watch UFC 300 on Saturday the full five hours or six hours yeah set the whole time it was amazing did you make like a seven layer nacho dip and just sit there for seven hours watching it I I watched the entire thing I think it started at 6 o'clock and it ended at 1 o'cl my time so I want to talk about it because a we're both UFC fans uh and it was amazing but B there's actually a great business CEO lesson in it that I want to I want to go to but first can we just explain for for anybody what Max Holloway did because I think the max Holloway thing alone if you don't even watch the fights you need to know that this happened well let's explain UFC 300 so UFC's been around since the '90s uh they've done thousands of events but the major events they number them UFC 1 2 3 4 5 this past weekend was UFC 300 typically what they do is a card has five main fights and then before the five main fights there's 10 prelims which are no-name fights that up are up up incomers this time they didn't have they had 15 fights but all of them were famous great people and so it created like 5 hours of epic fight cards right yeah it was crazy and um one of the fights was for a madeup title called the bad mother effer belt the BMF title and it was two guys who are popular but they're currently not at the tippy top of their thing so one guy this guy's name is Max Holloway and he's fighting this guy Justin gatei and they're fighting and Justin G is a big favorite coming into the fight people think he's going to win Max Holloway has kind of gotten he's he's kind of looks like he's on the back end of his prime or maybe on the decline a little bit and um so two things happen One Max H starts to win okay that itself was cool remarkable but nothing compared to what happened at the end so the guy the way UFC fight works is five rounds let's say and basically what happens is if you're winning you each round gets scored if you're winning each of the rounds you have it locked up so what happens is let's say you are winning three rounds to two or four rounds to one your corner tells you hey you're way ahead just play it safe just the only way this other guy can win is if he knocks you out don't you just play it smart right that's n times out of 10 however this is fighting entertainment and some Fighters understand that and some Fighters don't Max Holloway understands that so what he did was he wins all five rounds so he's not even up 32 four one he wins all five rounds and at the end of the fifth round he's basically broken this guy's nose he's got this guy kind of uh batter and bruis the only thing this one guy can do and this guy's a power puncher the only thing this guy can do is knock him out Max Holloway decides in the last 10 seconds where most guys kind of just circle around raise their hands try to tell the judges they won he points to the middle of the Ring it points down and he's like stand right here neither one of us backs down and just let's swing as hard as we can and try to knock each other out for the last 10 seconds now this sounds very Savage what this actually just say is incredibly courageous and brave and entertaining and Reckless and stupid all at the same time rolled into one and they both start just swinging absolute Haymakers at each other and then he and the last second of the fight knocks the other guy out cold I feel like I can't even do it justice if you if you watch the fight you already know what happened if you don't want you probably don't care about this but it was remarkable to watch it was probably the best UFC moment I've ever seen maybe for sure top for sure top three probably number one and I would actually say it was one of the best moments in sports that I've ever seen exactly it was like I felt so much adrenaline watching this I was like it was in the middle of the night my baby was sleeping and I yelled like as loud as I could I was in awe it was so adrenaline inducing it was amazing it would be like in basketball if LeBron James was about to win the NBA finals and normally they're just trying to hold the ball you know stall let the clock run out and instead he handed the ball to his opponent said no come here you have the ball come to the middle of the Court everybody get off the court oneon-one right now for the game for the championship for the glory and uh and then somehow also if he risked getting knocked out in the process uh so pretty insane moment Mark Zer by the way was sitting Ringside at every fighter would run up to him and start pointing at him and talking to him it was awesome it was so exciting by the way don't you think that Zuck should lean in more to this I feel like this is the best PR that Mark zucker's ever had is his own his own um you know heel turn into becoming a fighter being at the UFC Court uh ringside hanging out there and all the fighters really loving going into the tough man sport right basically and he looked cool he looked cool he had like a little afro and he had a white T-shirt on like baggy white he looked like a cool guy he did yeah he has like the oversized tea now he got like he like went on Tik Tok shops and bought like the oversized tea from some like 18-year-old who was doing a dance video and his wife looked cool too this it's called mob Chic what she was wearing it was like all black she looked cool they both looked cool Google that I I Google it I read a Business Insider article I learned that word mob Chic so you know what he should do by the way this is a little PR lesson for him I think think that um he should create his own Zuckerberg bonus so he should have the Zuck like idea the Zuck 500 and he just gives 500,000 to whoever had the most badass performance so it should have just been like Max Hollow it's like whoever just really put it all on the line win or lose doesn't matter somebody who showed the most heart like the underdog bonus and because these guys don't get paid and Zuck has all of the money so if he just did that for every pay-per-view I feel like that would be its own storyline he'd get so much good that you literally real Gladiator stuff you couldn't buy it yeah um by the way the singer Saia CIA she does this for Survivor so the winner of Survivor wins a million dollars and C is a super fan of Survivor and she just called into the reunion one time and was like Hey I just love that guy he didn't even come close to winning but I want to give him 50 Grand and so it became the the sea bonus of like whoever won her heart gets like extra money at the end it's it's pretty genius dude that's so funny that's awesome um all right and so Max Max knocks out the guy what happens what what what's the business angle here the press conference at the end is is always entertaining Dana White is a very unfiltered guy Dana please come on the Pod he goes on the press conference and somebody asks him they were like Dana you know on a night like this UFC 300 you try to build a car but after that it's out of your hands you know then it's up to the fighters and like how happy are you that it just turned out that way like such a moment um and such a great great overall night and Dana goes you know people ask me what I do for a living I don't he's like I don't organize fights I sell holy [ __ ] moments and tonight I sold a I sold millions of holy [ __ ] moments basically he's like I sold a holy [ __ ] moment to millions of people and I thought it's a great little lesson which is what are you really selling what are you really selling in your business is he selling a mixed martial arts contests is he selling an event is he sell he says I'm selling holy [ __ ] moments and I thought about this and I you know marketers for a long time have known this which is there's levels to marketing and I want to give you my five levels to marketing based on the Dana White principle of selling holy [ __ ] moments okay you ready for this level one you sell a product and this is every shitty startup website you go to it and it just says we are a um Healthcare CRM using AI they're just describing some product and it's not compelling because I don't give a [ __ ] about your product I give a [ __ ] about myself and uh your product is some abstract you know we're a blockchainbased um you know web 3 arcade sidescroller it's like what uh you know and if you go to most product websites to be honest they're just selling a product that's level one this is what failing companies do okay um level two level two is you don't sell a product you sell a solution and this is effective but it's competitive this is um like Head and Shoulders Head and Shoulders says hey you're retire having that dandruff on your shoulder use Head and Shoulders it gets rid of the dandruff okay so selling a solution to a paino and this is where I would say okay if 50% of companies just do sell a product another 45% are going to sell the solution to a pain Point okay now we get into the championship rounds where we're going to have more interesting ways of doing things so the next one level three you sell a lifestyle this is Lululemon this is slack so if you've ever if you don't believe me go read the Stuart Butterfield who's the CEO of slack go read his post called we don't sell Saddles here and I'll spoil it for you which is he says imagine you're a saddle company you make saddles we could just describe the product the Saddles we could describe some solution like oh your butt won't be sore on our saddle or we could sell the lifestyle the joy of horseback riding and get people to want to be on Horseback to feel free to have the wind blowing through their hair you make that lifestyle aspirational and then when they're like I got to do that now they're super motivated and they say well what do I need you're like well you need a saddle and ours are the best and so he says that this is how the yoga companies Lululemon and whatnot this is how they got popular too is they didn't say here we have the best yoga pants which was a small Market of people looking for yoga pants they got people into the idea of doing yoga and once you get into doing yoga and the benefits of yoga you're going to want to invest in buying better gear as you go and L lemon will say well we have the best gear and so you this is how you create a category or you just want to make your your ass look dope but the lifestyle of being a big booty queen and if that's a lifestyle you want to be a part of we are the pants for you yeah yeah the MFM merch store will soon have uh soon have fat margin bottoms and the real bottom lines that's pretty good all right and four and five four is where I thought we stop there's actually five but four is where I thought we stopped this is the Dana White level you sell a feeling and I'll tell you that that line that somebody told me once I hired this consultant and I was talking about my content I did the lamest thing I hired a consultant for my personal brand just to know what do these guys know I didn't ever end up implementing really anything but I did take away this one thing he said he goes I go you've worked with all the big names you've worked with uh you know who I don't want to out him I guess but he he's works with a bunch of big names I said what do they do differently than what I'm doing and he goes you make content they give out a feeling I said what he goes as any content creator you are The Merchant of feelings you g if you give someone a feeling more consistently and more powerfully than anybody else that's What Makes You box office and I was like man I love using the word box office that's great and um this is what Dana White was saying right we sell holy [ __ ] moments we give you that feeling that you can't really get anywhere else like in your life can you really get like there's a reason you love UFC my buddy Julian Shapiro loves the UFC like none other like and he's like I can't watch other sports he's like I can't watch TV or movies if UFC has ruined it for me well Dana White said something amazing he goes he goes think about this you're at the you're at the Super Bowl It's the final down it's the greatest moment in in Sp in NFL history and a fight breaks out a few rows down from you what are you GNA do you're gonna stop you're gonna stop watching football and you're going to go and pay attention to the fight that's what people do and that's the business that I'm in that's why I knew this was going to be the greatest sport ever exactly and so the greatest Brands let's say uh Disney Disney's amazing at this Disney doesn't say come to our theme park um we have the fastest rides or we have the shortest Lines no they they tell you about the magical family experience right this is going to be a lifetime memory for you um this is going to give your kids a magical feeling a magical moment all of their movies are the same way right you watch a Pixar movie because it's going to give you this feel-good moment right that's the and they give you feel-good moments more consistently than anybody else um so the breast bar do this Louis vuon Louis Vuitton gives you a feeling of status of importance UFC gives you the holy [ __ ] feeling Nike gives you a feeling that you know uh of the feeling of greatness when they advertise their shoes they don't advertise the rubber shoes they basically show you someone's striving for greatness and it's that inspiration that motivation that they sell okay so now level five level five I realized is the highest one you didn't sell a product you didn't sell a solution you didn't sell a lifestyle you didn't sell a you sell an identity and this is what the religions do this is what political parties do they basically give you a a tribe they give you a label they give you a purpose uh they give you a sense of belonging it's almost like buying a a Subway franchise they're like here wear this uniform put this logo up here's the packaging here's a here's a portrait of bread put that on your wall you now have an identity we gave you a brand for you to have because you didn't have one on your own we gave you a purpose we gave you something to do it's an identity in a box I think that is the highest level of what um of what you can do is you you sell an identity to people first of all very good I'm this you've you this was a really good monologue you tied in some of my favorite stuff congratulations second of all were you just watching the UFC taking notes on this stuff and just like no I heard him say that in the I heard him say that in the press conference and I go that's exactly what he does that's why I watch because I can't get that holy [ __ ] feeling from anything what else is as real as that and once you know the the stories of the fighters right that's really what works right if you're personally invested and you understand the stakes you understand what's in it for each guy there's like you know it's it's pretty hard to compare that to really any of sport maybe boxing is is the other one uh no boxing doesn't even come close to what these guys do like they're they're in A League of Their Own in terms of giving me a feeling like I wore I wore a heart rate monitor one time to see what would happen cuz I I noticed going into the fight I was so anxious because I was so emotional invested my heart rate went up like 20 beats per minute like before this fight like it it was insane I get so into this that I find myself like tired the next day it's one of the very few times that I felt this in sports it's the best I feel a little bit in the Olympics because I get into that but no I mean what he has done and what the UFC has done in terms of uh what did you say selling emotions it's the best I mean if you go go look at the old cigarette ads if you want to see this so if you go look at old cigarette ad obviously not selling the product they're not selling a solution to a pain point they're not saying a hey your lungs need a little more tar in them you know like they're not doing that um they it's all about a feeling and an identity right so they're giving you a feeling of uh of Greater you know self-importance a cool self-image right so all of the marketing around cigarettes was a cool self-image it's a cool guy and in his cool moment he takes out the Sig and he lights it up or the woman doing the same thing the go watch the desis commercial right the most interesting man in the world sitting in a bar surrounded by women but not paying them any attention looking at you dead in the camera making eye contact he's a man's man he's done this he's done that he's done this and when he drinks beer he Dr do dois right it's he trying to give you a a cool self-image that's what a lot of luxury products and a lot of commodity products have to do and so once you realize that you're like oh and I love this because in our world the tech world the business world most people are like absolute rookie white belts at real marketing and um and like even the best inclass is just saying sell a solution to a paino just tell the benefit not the feature and that's like level two and they just stopped there nobody really goes beyond that and um and so I like taking what is what does the best-in class look like when it comes to like you know marketing and brand and and and actually doing something that gets people to to move and take action um and you know how do I bring that into our world because then then you're you know you have an unfair advantage and it's not always around violent so if you're listening to this and you don't know anything about the UFC go to YouTube and type in UFC Rose I'm the best one of the best uh moments from UFC is also this young woman named Rose Nunes and she's about to fight and she clearly is scared and you see her Ming to herself I'm the best I'm the best I'm the best and I remember distinctly where I was she looks like your little sister and the person across the ring from her looks like the Terminator and so you could you can just put yourself in in that person's shoes oh man they're about to fight somebody who's clearly just bigger stronger faster everything and she's mouthing to herself I'm the best to kind of like it's like she's walking into the lion's den and she's got to believe this otherwise she doesn't stand a chance and she knocks her out she knocks her out in the first round or something like that and it was one of the it was another great sporting moment so the two other moments first of all there was two Chinese women fighting uh which is uh the first time that's ever happened uh for the championship and one of the ladies chokes out another woman and she goes unconscious right when the bell rings so she they're able to keep fighting she doesn't really wake up until she gets punched again on the second round which was like just epic and then the third thing that happened was in the last fight Alex Pereira gets kicked in the gro the ref goes to stop it he waves him off and then 10 seconds later knocks out the other guy it was just full of badass moments where this whole thing it was just it was epic it was an epic event and by the way to just tie this principal back by the way um I did this with the podcast so I was like what is what are we really selling here on the podcast is it ideas do people show up because they want a business idea that's kind of lame like sure it's fun to hear ideas fun to talk about ideas but if you're really like you know what to be successful I'm going to go to this YouTube channel and find a business idea that these random guys are gonna say Allah like that's like honestly that's a bad plan like it might happen but don't don't do it for that reason um and the same reason like you know we might talk about the UFC or something else like that's probably not the most effective thing for to do every day so it's not our product it's not a pain point so what one thing that I figured out was like I and when I talked to a bunch of people and I I tweeted this out I go what is this what is something you remember and what's the reason you actually listen to the Pod regularly like what what keep keeps you hooked and the number one word that kept coming up was oh man I feel so inspired after I listen and they're like not in a Cheesy way but they're like literally if I'm driving and I'm listening I sometimes will pull over because I'm I got to write something down right you guys said one phrase that really stuck with me and that was like oh that's going to be an unlock for me either personally or in my marketing or whatever or it's I heard about this idea I'm not going to go do that idea but I'm inspired by that idea or you tell the story of some Billy of the week some guy who's really crushed it or some business that's under the radar that's crushing it and all of a sudden I feel like you know success is abundant I'm inspired to go go make my [ __ ] happen I'm not going to do what they did but I'm gonna go make my [ __ ] happen and so we sell inspiration that's the first thing we actually sell one secondary thing which is have you ever seen that Meme of the kid eating cereal next to his TV box it's like three there's three friends on the TV box and he's just like cozied up next to it it's like me and my four friends but it's just like oh that's awesome one's a photo and it's basically like companionship and and people have posted before like this is me when I listen to podcasts it's like kind of like you're hanging out with your friends except for they're not there but it feels that way um and so that's the other thing is like for a lot of people who listen what what I learned was that even more than the the inspiration the ones that are super sticky it's companionship it's basically my real life friends aren't as nerdy about business business as I am or I live in the middle of nowhere Iowa or I'm in Biz or I'm in you know wherever and I don't know six other people that I can hang out with twice a week and just nerd out about business with and so you guys are basically my substitute for what I what I don't have or don't have the time for in my my day-to-day life this was an a A+ segment good job I dig that let me tell you uh let me tell you let me tell you about something so I I launched something a couple weeks ago or uh a week ago and I think there's only a 30% chance of it working but I thought I could like reveal some of the numbers behind it so I launched this thing called Sam's list it's samslist doco did you see when I when I shared that online the other day yeah I did all right so let me explain the background so I was at the airport in January and I had just gotten an email from my accountant and it pissed me off that they didn't catch an air that they I thought they should have caught it or caught and so I tweeted out who has an accountant that they love I got about 300 responses and I noticed that tons of people were bookmarking that tweet as if they're going to come back and hire an accountant which was on the tweet and so I thought you know I think I could make a thing out of this and so I hired a developer who works on Bubble do you know what bubble is have you ever used bubble yeah the website builder yeah man it's awesome it's like a whole app builder and so we built this website where we got it was basically I wanted to create like a Yelp for accountants uh like a place where you can identify an accountant that's good based off of your friends and I thought like this could be a good idea because when you hire an accountant you don't really have a place to see reviews you mostly hear about an accountant through word of mouth and if you hire the wrong accountant it's basically like a year that you have to stay with them before you find out that they kind of stink so I was like all right I'm going to create this thing it's called Sam's list we're going to build this out it's going to be awesome I spent about $15,000 to build it out and so here's what I did I got 300 replies to that tweet I called all of them so I got most of them on the phone or some of them via email and I asked them all types of questions I asked them how much do they charge who the perfect client is who's the not perfect client what services are their Specialties things like that as if I was going to hire them I think you had told me one time when you went to hire an account and you created like your own data room and you like sent it to people and you're like yeah who can handle this best well I I kind of did like a thing like that I put them all on this website on Sam's list and I it took me a few weeks to get it going and then I shared it and I want this thing to work I don't think it's going to why are you saying that is that like some weird humble like are you just doing some reverse thing where it's like if only the community would rally and you like what are you doing here is this reverse psychology it's not reverse psychology I'll explain why this will be hard to work and so here was here here was my math my math was basically if I can get 500,000 people a month to come to this website 3% of them would answer the or would contact an accountant somehow I could charge the accountants $100 per person I sent to them per lead that I sent to them and if that were the case that would be something like $1.5 million a month in sales I figured that would take years to get to but like if I could get to that that's like an interesting thing well I shared it online in the first week I got 13,000 visits we made this really cool quiz where you could like say like how much revenue you have do you want this for your business or personal whatever and then we would recommend three or four accountants that you like or that could fit your needs we had 6,000 people answer the quiz um and we also created this feature where you could schedule a meeting right there on the website with that with those accountants that we referred you to very few people scheduled appointments and very few people even submitted their information to the accountants what's very few so we had 6,000 people take the quiz in one week I think we had like a 100 or 200 people like submit information to the account and but that's not the issue the issue isn't the user the issue is accountants are not clamoring for these leads like like my big learning was that there's a massive and this is for someone can go and solve this problem there's a massive shortage of accountants there's not a uh shortage of people looking for an accountant there's a huge shortage of people who are becoming accountants not only that the people who are accountants they don't really want to like grow their business to be that large um and I thought that they'd be dying to get more customers they're really not which shocked me that was like a really big shocker and when I launched this business I basically copied or I didn't copy I use have you ever heard of smartasset.com um no so smartasset.com I bet you've seen them if you've Googled like what's California's taxes or California tax calculator well the reason why they have all that stuff is they're actually doing well I'm doing what they're doing but they're doing what what I'm doing for uh CFA so certified financial planners um or advisers and what they do is you take this quiz and they tell you all like you answer these questions about you know how old you are if you're retired if you're not retired what you're trying to do with your money are you trying to invest it or just live off it whatever and then they recommend like three or four people who might fit your needs but what I found on that website is if you click around they have to tell you how much they're paying per person per lead and so they actually say if a person has between a million and five million assets this adviser is paying $700 per lead if it's over 5 million they're paying uh 250 to or it gives you like a range per like uh per cost per lead per net worth and it like tells you all like how they do their business I thought I could just replicate it turns out CPAs aren't like dying for business and so the it's the exact opposite they're actually overwhelmed with business um and so that's why I don't think this is actually going to make a lot of money uh I think you're wrong I think there's a need for this I think that it will do well I also think you know that and I think you're no I don't I'm to I think you're playing us just G to put it out there I'm G to shut it down on May 30th no I went Trump on you for a second that was good if it doesn't work if I I'm losing money right now on this if it doesn't start working by May 30th I'm shutting it down like I'm not going to invest more money on it dog just give it to me I'll make this work this is so easy uh you're just being impatient and it's going to fail because you're you have a much better business that you're busy with called Hampton and uh you should focus on that that's why this is going to fail and that's why this is a bad idea but otherwise it's a good idea let me point out a couple of the product details that I like and I'm tell you some of the things that you should do differently so we can screen share this all right I love when I go to the site and it pops up the uh so I go to the site and it pops up and it basically like normally where there's an email pop up but it's like no email no BS know something like let's go I was like okay already I think you should just actually call that out a little more and be like you know we want to help you we don't need your email address and then just have a button that says thank God and then you know they thank God it takes them down the funnel you I love this part that you did where you you WR read this first and you wrote I have this many Twitter followers I asked if they have a CPA account if they that they love then I called all them I asked them how much they charge blah blah blah why would I do this because I'm a nerd and I needed an accountant I thought well how about I make this useful for others blah blah blah that's great I love how you do that I love how you put everybody's Twitter profile attached to their name nice touch uh like your name here every accountant you can go see their Twitter which for our Market is actually a good idea you know most people for us it's cool um you should put the prices on the front thing because I think that's like makes it a lot more value add to the person coming in it's like oh good these people already went and found what the rates are for these and you also said like I asked them who their sweet spot customer is and blah blah blah like what I can't tell is like you know when um you know when you go to cars and bids and Doug deorro has the Doug speech bubble and Doug's like here's what I think um I think you kind of need to lean into that I agree that's a good idea I don't trust reviews I trust review and I really just trust you and so the question is like can you you know not just call them but call like you know 10 of their clients and be like tell me everything and then end up with one speech bubble that's Sam saying talk to them talk to their clients here's roughly what they charge and like you know this is like you know people are screaming endorsing or they're like yeah it's pretty good and like you know so I think they're solid and they seem to specifically help out this type of customer I think that would make it better I think that's a good idea the reason why we haven't I haven't done that yet is I would have to hire someone to help me call those people and I was like I need to figure out does this thing even make money in the first place in order to like justify all this work the dreams baby if you build it they will come did you see uh so a few things the design I liked our design I just ripped it off it's we made it looked like old Microsoft and then the image is I just copied clippy you remember clippy from Microsoft Words this because it doesn't make any sense it's Ai and on the calculator face it's only four digits it's a two it's a five it's a nine and a q uh yeah putting the Q in as the last letter is the AI knows something we don't yeah and so uh anyway I I thought I'd fill people in on this I I think I it's hard I don't want to be in the business of selling leads to small accountants and having like hundreds and hundreds of different clients paying me versus is I think in order to make this work you actually what you do is you get someone's information and then in order to do lead gen you usually only have a small amount of very large companies who pay you a large sum per month for a certain amount of leads versus one off you know what I mean um so I'm still trying to figure this [ __ ] out but uh we'll see if it works out all right uh you got anything else are we done no I'm uh you did great you that was good two two bangers that's what I'm tell my wife when I go downstairs how is the Pod double Banger double Banger um all right that's the pod [Music]

billionaire is a state of mind because first of all it's so unless it's either you have this in cash or it's your shares in a public company it's always a complete matter of taste like well my company would be worth a billion if it were to sell and even in public companies it's not even real cuz most of the time if you own a ton of the public company if you were to dump it all it would massively drop the price it's more like this mimetic label once you get labeled a billionaire it kind of just sticks people use it as a way to describe someone who is in a certain class I actually think it's more of a class marker than anything lives a certain lifestyle he hangs out with a certain people he's like a billionaire it really has nothing to do with whether or not you actually have a billion dollars or you own something worth a billion dollars the other is Cash liquidity is so crazy the amount of people when you're like okay could you wire me a 100 Grand tomorrow the answer is no I've been shocked by this

by the way this episode where's the camera this is this episode's not for you this episode's for me I've been listening to this guy for a long time I read his books I I used to gift your your book was one of the most gifted books I had for like a long time maybe the first 10 years of my my career and I would say you're about to I'm giving you the 4H hour fever like it's called the four hour work week I said you're going to read this and then for four hours you're going to question everything in your life I call that the four hour fever it's normal don't worry call a doctor last beyond four hours [Music] and so today I have like a bunch of things that I think maybe the audience wants to know honestly I don't give a [ __ ] I just wanted to ask you the questions that I want to know I think that's the key to a good podcast exactly so um one of the things I wanted to know is you talked about this space where you're like I'm thinking about what's next I've been there I sold my company what's next I have a lot of friends that are spot yeah and what's the what's the approach because it can be paralyzing to have a thousand options yeah especially when you have a track record you have a track record of success now that almost adds some difficulty to the to the to the answer of what's next because it's got to be good can't be can't be something tiny right how does Tim Ferris approach the what's next question yeah I think it can be tiny in a sense right I mean let's just I'll answer your question but let's just note that the podcast started as I'm going to try this for six episodes that's tiny so did this podcast by the way this is this is a tiny so I think that to quote uh Seth Goden who is really wise Beyond even what people would expect I mean and he walks the walk he's a real operator who has authored a contrarian that's not contrarian it's an unorthodox life for himself and I have a lot of respect for Seth and you know he said big things the Big Dreams changing the world those are easy to hide behind he's like but doing the smallest thing possible the next action you can't hide behind that right it's it's a it's a pass fail say that again so big dreams are easy to hide behind yeah but when you make something small six episodes right if you don't do six episodes you fail to do six episodes but it's like I'm Gonna Change the World and do this and blah blah blah great like you know not to not to like quote everybody in the world but like kind of David Allen GTD style like okay great what's the next physical action right okay now you have a report card right that I can give you because you've just made yourself accountable to me in a way to like do this thing that is very discreet and so this I I don't underestimate the small things I think the big Visions can be helpful at times and I could give examples of that where it's been helpful for me but to answer your question in terms of choosing the next thing I'll say up front I don't know what my next thing is right now but how do you approach that how do you approach figure well there yeah there a few ways so the first is I make I suppose a menu of things I would like to try okay which is often a thing a list of things I would like to learn like I just returned from three days overseas with a game designer prototyping games nice and board games or yeah yeah sweet and that's something I'm trying right we'll see and the there's a lot that goes into even choosing the things on that list but and do you have a box on the menu like the part of the menu where it's like and we have like see urin that's you know do you have the weird box where you're like let me think of some non-obvious oh I try to do weird stuff right no no because there's tons of stuff that I could do that would be straightforward or predictable or reliably profitable that's the that's the most seductive right um and I'm not saying they're bad options but like I could make a course yeah I could I'm I I know I could execute that and make it do really well right I I know that uh I know I could potentially create some type of membership platform or Mastermind or something like that and I think I would enjoy some of these things right um however let me come back to the criteria so whether I'm coming up with my list I go for weird if there's something weird that is a huge plus kind of yeah that's like a turbo boost for inclusion right you're not bending to the social expectations or Norms right those are the weird things that's why they seem weird and chances are if those end up on your list either they're easier for you than they are for other people or you're going to have the enthusiasm and therefore endurance to do it longer right harder more intensely with greater purpose than other people those are all huge competitive advantages not that this not that all of life is a competition but to stand out in a crowd right you need the weird ones are like the immigrants it's like you got here if you made it here you already have shown some amount of there must be some strength that got you onto this list oh totally because you had a negative filter associated with it you yeah or you just come from better like more resilient or risk-taking genetic stock like yeah if I could invest in like first or second generation immigrants if I could just choose a if I could only choose certain filters that would be very high I've said that I've been like I love Mormons I love if you're from the Ukraine I'm listen if your name is Dimitri love it tell me more what what's your idea come closer so so the the the short synopsis of how I choose projects is I look for projects that can be successes for me longterm even if they fail shortterm what that means is projects where by any external measurement or perception they can be a failure however in the process of pursuing those things I develop or deepen relationships or develop or deepen skills that are durable right and those something like that those Snowball right right because if I do like four projects they all fail but I am developing relationships with the type of people I want to develop relationships with I'm developing new skills and then I start to bridge all those things and I'm paying attention I'm taking good notes my experience is eventually you win right whatever that happens to me that's kind of it honestly outside of that I would say these days so I'm getting getting old as [ __ ] and all that is energy and energy out like does this do I have more energy doing this or do I have substantially less right and that's a product also not just of what you're doing where you are who you're interacting with I pay attention to that stuff because I could do something that people might see as frivolous archery or something I I could pick a whole ton of them that seem like wastes of time but that's like plugging my phone into the wall it's like oh now I have 100% charge instead of 20% charge there's a lot more that I can do with this phone right and just because I plugged it into the charger in the circus Funhouse doesn't mean I have to use it for the circus Funhouse right you get to transfer it to other things so that's that's also something as a fundamental currency that I pay a lot of attention to right I'll tell you two related things on that last night I was at dinner with I think a mutual friend Joe G founder of airnb and he was saying he's like oh what are you in town for I was like I'm doing a couple podcasts and we were talking about he's like okay so what's like what's like a win you know like why why do you do that you fly into town you leave your kids you make an effort what are you looking for out of these and I said well I just want to leave with more energy than I came and really I want the guest to feel that way too like at the end of the day like what is the only way I can guarantee a success out of this is if you walk out of here feeling energized rather than drained from this conversation and if that's so I've been using that heris and it's so powerful to and am I the people is you want to mutal that way the second thing he said was that I thought you'd find interesting I was like um we were going through this exercise I do called the perfect Tuesday so I was like life is not really about these Peak experiences like yes those like going and seeing like there's the total eclipse happening go and see this total eclipse apparently it's like a totally emotional experience if you're there I think it's happening in Dallas this weekend or whatever there are those moments but they're few and far between most of your life is just like Tuesdays just normal Tuesdays over and over again and to put a lot of effort into thinking like what's a dream average day for me and then try to live that dream and so we were talking about it and I asked him I said like how close are you to your perfect Tuesday he's got all the resources in the world right s Airbnb they went public it's it's a super success and one of the things he said he goes that's a great question I go to the gym for my physical my to get my like to physically fulfill myself and then I work which is great and I feel productive and useful to the world and I have my family which is love he's like but I don't really make time for creativity anymore he's like he's a designer by by trade and he's like I need like a creative gym he's like I I feel like if I if I sat down and I started sketching it would almost feel like I'm wasting time like it's like what am I doing here I found that really interesting and I feel like you do a good job of kind of making time for the things even if they're not societal norms for what people do I try yeah I try to do it for sure do you have your version of a creative gym yeah I mean I was like playing the drums earlier today so from a like Financial perspective that could be waste of time with the financial stuff we can talk about it it's very useful for certain things I mean money only has a certain utility it's kind of like yeah you can eat until you're full and then you can eat until you're stuffed and then you can eat until you're sick but like at what point do you stop eating like there's a point Beyond which food ceases to serve any positive function right and then like things in excess kind of become their opposite so you have to be very careful with money and other things you know alcohol power Fame they they can distort a lot of things how do you keep that in check it's hard to keep some of those things in check I mean I just know too many rich people now to think that money fixes the inner game or the most problematic kind of psychological challenges that people have it doesn't at all it can fix a lot like money can fix money problems but that's just one category right of issue and and it's incredibly useful as a vehicle for other things uh but I find a lot of folks very uncreative about how they use money uh so I do I would say make time for the creative gym more so in the last handful of years but time with concept artists doing concept pushes building fictional worlds playing the drums earlier today had an art teacher uh Stan proo Peno uh who runs proko.com amazing teacher came out and we worked on a whole bunch of different aspects of drawing and live charcoal sketching and shading and so on one could make the argument that isn't entirely off base that must be nice great you have all this time you can kind of do what you want to do but I will say also that when I have been at levels of Peak Performance professionally I usually have a creative Outlet of some type it may not take the form of charcoal drawing that's a bit on the nose as far as creativity goes but like Jiu-Jitsu is creative right it's like going to the Jiu-Jitsu gym and learning how to operate in that free flowing environment that's very creative right so if if you're working on anything that requires a level of extreme present State awareness and improvisation and experimentation like you're in the creativity game right so there are a lot of ways to do that I got a book recommendation from you oh yeah I haven't seen that book this few decades yeah I never heard of this book old book this book is called uh toughness training for sports and it's by Jim lore um do you remember anything from this book you probably read this a long time ago I mean I read that when I was probably 15 or 16 and I do remember that there is an inventory there's an assessment in there it's two or three pages long and you're intended to give that to your coaches peers teachers people around you effectively for like a three what I would call now a 360 review of different factors that affect mental toughness yeah and I did that when I was 15 or 16 so this one right oh there you go yeah there we go so the competitive adjective profile yeah so there's there's I found this book incredibly helpful and later had Jim lair on the podcast did some training with him and a and a tennis pro with tennis and having that 360 review from a mental toughness perspective was incredibly helpful to me it it provided me with a level of awareness that I I I couldn't have developed on my own right and one of the things it talks about is basically if you haven't read the book it's like there's Talent you're born with there's skills which everybody else understands you practice and then there's performance yep and there's a gap between talent and skill that Gap is called practice there's a gap between skills and performance and that's basically your toughness training it's the and he calls it I think the ideal performance State and it's like if you ever played Sports you know this which is like some games you're off oh I just wasn't fully locked in I was I just wasn't I didn't play up to my potential so like what causes that versus those days when you get in Flow State or you're just totally dialed in and you you kick butt out there and it's like well that's because you were in your ideal performance State this is not just for sports obviously like this can be for you know how you show up as a dad at home it could be show for work it could be for this podcast how do I show up in my ideal performance state do you do things to be in your kind of Ideal performance state do I do I would say that also just to highlight a few other things in here I haven't looked at this in a very long time 20 plus years but it discusses at length stress and recovery and D loing phases and periodization and awareness and there are all of these different checklists and assessments different assessments that you might use after a given training session and stress valuations and so on all of which helped me to become more aware of cause and effect in what I was doing so I had a I had a fantastic I mean my best season by far after reading this book and there were other factors that played into it hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show in terms of Ideal performance States I I've become less focused on optimization right overall would say just because so much of it just does not [ __ ] matter at all and the amount of breaking news Tim Ferris optimization yeah I mean there's a place for it who needs it there's a place for it there's a place for it but it's like are you taking a taxi from the the the start to the finish line of a marathon because it's efficient I mean like you know speed reading poetry it's like there's there's a there's a suppose a cult of optimization that is appealing on a lot of levels but it ends up being a hammer looking for nails and it gets applied to everything and I think that that misses the force for the trees sometimes and I'm I've been guilty of that for sure so but in terms of optimization I would say that let's take today as an example so I had a great day today today was pretty uncrowded I had a few team calls meaning employee calls earlier today uh typically those are on Tuesday but it got shifted forward because I was traveling yesterday beautiful day outside here in Austin which helps of course went for a walk got a cold brew coffee had a phone call with a friend came back did a bit of work knocked off a few emails or a couple of pending Angel Investments and Deals of that type and I had to get back to some lawyers and so on that took 15 20 minutes printed out some documents to prepare for a podcast that I recorded earlier today and then did a 7even minute I guess there was about a 7 minute cold Plunge at 40¬∞ which is pretty chilly that'll we 7 Minutes continuous yeah that that'll wake you up and I use that in part because I knew that we would be recording this late and I didn't want to consume too much caffeine early in the day and then consume way too much caffeine throughout the day and end up not being able to sleep since we're recording this at night and also then had a little bit of titration with like a light green tea before recording my own podcast after walking a bit had some synthetic ketones so beta hydroxy butyrate which does help cognitive performance quite a bit so it can act as a standin for me for more caffeine this has a blended let's just say like tail end of the Cold Brew green tea about 30 minutes prior and then also the synthetic ketones about 30 minutes prior and light meals so very light meals if I have a lot of mental lifting to do then I I generally eat pretty lightly mostly protein a little bit of fat small amount of carbohydrate and here we are that's the day right I got a great night's sleep last night which isn't always the case but was the case last night and for me that is an optimize day there's not a lot crammed into it I'm not executing this sophisticated time management Tetris to be as efficient as possible but I'm keeping the main thing the main thing like the main things were team one-on-one calls being physiologically and just literally I guess prepared in terms of documentation and research for podcasts that I recorded and then being in a good state for having this conversation that's it right it's like you don't have to do a lot every day yeah I think that's effect versus efficiency right Effectiveness over efficiency efficiency would be more like maximum output per unit of time regardless on what the output is directed towards is that right yeah yeah it's if you think of Effectiveness is what you do effect efficiency is how you do any given thing but doing something really well doesn't make it important so yeah I'm a Tony Robbins guy he calls it majoring in minor things yeah majoring in minor things not a great way to go yeah and I also Fritter away time and lose days to [ __ ] or I don't sleep and then I'm grumpy and I have too much caffeine and I have a shitty night at sleep like I I suffer from all that stuff yeah human I make mistakes but if you're thinking about projects as experiments using the criteria that I laid out before and you're doing your best you're going to falter you're going to make mistakes but to keep the main thing the main thing and you have a good rationale for why that main thing is the main thing over time you tend to you tend to perform pretty well and just ship a lot more than most people even if you go a month without doing anything right if you get [ __ ] all done for a month sometimes that happens to me but I I try I would almost rather do that and I guess my version of doing [ __ ] all might not look like [ __ ] all but I would rather do that than rush into committing to something that doesn't meet my criteria because I'm uncomfortable not being busy right because that's how you end up overc committing to things that longitudinally eat up years said you're comfortable not being busy yeah yeah that's a big one yeah just I mean like the best way to get what the outcome of busyness should be which is right like big effects of some type or it could just be more joy whatever is is not by engaging in Non-Stop action all right it's by in a sense it's similar to my my my startup investing it's like having very tight very tight parameters a lot of constraints and not breaking your rules right it's like the equivalent of like blowing your bankroll in poker blackjack or in startup investing would be you have no you have no real thinking around portfolio constructions you you don't have enough positive constraints so you get over enthused about a ton of things you put out all these bets too quickly and then you lose all your money or you just can't play the game very long because you were never playing the long game to begin with and in life like that bank rolls your time and uh that's nonrenewable you can always make more money I've heard you say something like uh people who are on 24/7 or they're just like hustle hustle hustle grind grind grind uh you you're like that's actually a dangerous form of laziness yeah indiscriminate action indiscriminate action is a form of laziness yeah when people are like I need to do X and then like first I'm going to do research or make a long list it's like that's fancy procrastination like uh yeah shouldn't you just you don't need a list of H 100 prospects just call one let's start with that yeah yeah and we all have our our our favorite pet forms of procrastination like reading is one of mine right I have to be very cautious about reading love reading and no one's going to say you should stop reading like oh so diligent doing so much homework but so sophisticated he is so sophisticated um I want to ask you about your book thing in a second but before we do that teach you said teaching teach me uh about the art of podcasting you've been doing this for 10 years now yeah you've done many a high stakes interview whether it's pick your favorite famous person or maybe person you admire what can you teach me about the first five minutes of a podcast first five minutes maybe 5 seconds I don't know beginning of a podcast yeah I mean the most important five minutes are the conversation I have before I start recording with someone okay so that would be putting them at ease to the extent possible Right my job is to make you look as good as possible every guest has Final Cut MH so let it all hang out and we can cut whatever you want to cut you'll get a transcript nothing's going to get published before you give it the okay put the walls down a little bit yeah put the walls down General housekeeping so they don't get distracted like if you need to take water break bathroom break pause stop you want to start a story over again that's all totally fine I'll keep an eye out for things that I think we might want to cut like if you accidentally mention your kids' names or something like that so they're like oh this guy's a done it a lot B is actually looking out for me see has actually sat in my seat interviewee seat a lot and I always ask and like nobody almost nobody asks this it's it's such an easy layup in terms of differen yourself ask interviewees what what a success would be like what would you look back at this I asked my inter interviewee this this morning about this I said six months from now you look back and you say I'm so glad I did that why like what does success look like and even if they don't have an answer they're just so unaccustomed to being asked anything like that they're like huh and it's like being a good boyfriend it's like he cares it doesn't even matter if he brought me the water I doesn't even I could have got the water myself but the fact that he did he's thinking about me he cares yeah so there I would say that that pre-record conversation is something I don't see very often right like when I get I didn't do it today well yeah I mean and and and sometimes that's fine right it's like I'm comfortable in this environment right and we've had contact before yeah but but it's not always going to be the case it could also be the the case that somebody's very experienced but they're rushed right they got like an argument with their husband or wife the night before and their publicist is frazzled and off their meds or whatever and they're just running from thing to thing to thing and then boom they get plopped in front of a mic or they get plopped in front of a computer and they're like okay go yeah you're talking to this guy named Tim okay you need to give them an onramp if you can to decompress a little bit from that experience doesn't always work but it's it's worth the investment in my experience so that's even if I have to give up five 10 minutes of the interview right let's just say they have a hard stop at 90 minutes or 60 minutes I will still give up that time so that's that's one in the first five minutes I would say it depends a lot on the the profile of the person and I don't mean Fame I mean have they been interviewed a thousand times in a case where someone's been interviewed a thousand times I want to ask them a question that shows I've done an inordinate amount of research right so I'll ask them something that for instance I'll very frequently dig up like a deep cut I've noticed you do this yeah third grade teacher or a mentor that helped them when they were at one school when they were transitioning from one place to another that got mentioned in passing and a pro file in the New Yorker eight years ago I'll be like who was so and so right tell me about so and so and they're like huh okay and that can get them off of autopilot whether someone's been interviewed a lot or very little I will often ask them beforehand because there's a lot of prep that goes into it uh if there any Greatest Hits stories I'm like what are stories people respond really well to that stick with them that people have brought up with you a year later two years later and they could be an academic right academics talk to people they just not necessarily Tony Robbins or Edward Norton but they're in front of people so they'll they should have probably some examples or anecdotes or studies things that really stick with people okay great and I will then figure out a question or a cue or I might even ask them to suggest one to prompt talking about that and I will lead with that for two reasons first is that I'm starting with something that my audience is likely to resonate with number two I'm giving them a win right fast I'm giving them a win upfront and that is helpful oftentimes when someone doesn't know where the conversation's going to go to that point I always try to tell people where I am likely to start and that's part of the preon conversation I'll say I'm thinking about starting with this right because I don't want to cause anyone to stumble out of the gate or for us to get caught on our heels this is probably where I'm going to start do you think that's a decent place to start and if they're like well I don't like some random thing I read on the internet that isn't true I want to know that before we start and if they're like oh yeah yeah that'll work great now I've planted that seed their brains working on that while we're doing the housekeeping while we're talking about everything else and then we start and it's usually pretty smooth at least you know running out of the blocks so those be a few things that come to mind for the first five minutes that's a great answer very helpful to me because we usually do the show it's me and Sam yeah and it's that's the core of the show is me and Sam hanging out and our Dynamic is very simple it's uh dude have you seen this like a random show like you do the random show we do our it's that's very much like the core of our show and we usually if we have guests on it's because we want them to do that with us yeah but then occasionally there's guests where actually it's us scratching our own itch I want I really want to meet this person I want to get to what they're really like and I want to ask them the questions that I don't feel like I've heard from them in the same way that like some people say you should write the book you you wish you could just read you wish you could read if somebody else had written it you wouldn't write the book that's the way I feel about when I do an interview like this it's like what is the question that I haven't heard in addition to the greatest hits because you want to you know explore those a little bit together as well and it also depends on what you mean by good podcast right so there's good for you or me personally and then there's good for the audience whatever the audience is right depending on the show and uh I've gone back and forth on that right so sometimes I'll do a show for the audience every once in a while right I'll have a couple of Scooby snacks for myself but I'll do something that is is really for the audience that is a risky approach seems safer but it's actually probably riskier you can get shaped by your audience and then become a bit of a like domesticated oxen getting driven by what you perceive to be the preferences of your audience but I have the Henry Ford Maxim in mind which is and I'm paraphrasing here but effectively people don't really know what they want or need which includes you and me by the way but for that reason rather than playing the speculation game follow your own interest and the risk there is that you end up playing inside baseball and really doing something that is not necessarily transferable to your audience as far as I'm concerned and maybe I just have the luxury of being an relatively early mover in podcasting but if your goal is to do this for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of episodes or that's not the goal at all but if your if your goal is to continue to continuing to have this amazing ridiculous job which is just absurd like this is a job then you got to play the long game and part of the long game is right it's like training and recovery so if you need to take a couple episodes as recovery that are purely self-interested just for you that's what you do and I don't have any compunction about that and the personal is the most universal also so if depends on your audience size of course but with with the size of my audience if something is bothering me if something is really peing my curiosity if something's in my head at night and just won't go away chances are they're at least I don't know few thousand few tens of thousands of people who have the same thing going on right I heard this great quote from my buddy how much has the world benefited that Tim Ferris decided not to just keep selling supplements and to do like to do other things like what would the world have been like had that not happened I think that's a very a great compliment very huge compliment very kind if you go from selling supplements which makes a lot of money it's like a very clear direct payoff and you could do good at it to being an author that's like you know not usually a good it's not usually an upward career move let's say so why'd you do it well there there are a few things I would say so the first is that I didn't end up selling the supplement company until 2009 so whenever possible I have things running in parallel I do not view myself as a risk taker like if anything I would be risk reducer risk reducer like risk mitigator for sure like I'm very good at capping downside risk and in this particular case I already knew that from a from a from an intellectual perspective that sounds too pompus but I'm struggling to find a better modifier let me put it a different way my learning curve with the Sports Nutrition supplement world had flattened largely I I understood the basic mechanics I understood distribution it wasn't that interesting to me and it was also an industry that was and still is marred by a lot of bad behavior right and unbelievable tactics and in some cases just outright deception I mean legal and illegal that I I really struggled being associated with and if we really flash back and look at what I thought I might end up doing as an adult I always wanted to be a teacher in part because I had these amazing teachers that had a huge impact on my life kind of saved my life in a bunch of ways I think I could have gone in a really bad set of directions and they helped prevent that so I thought when I get enough experience in life which is not now at that age 29 but eventually it'd be really nice to be a teacher and have that kind of impact so I thought nth or tth grade teacher still haven't done that I mean I've done some volunteer teaching but I had been going back I want to say since 2003 to Princeton to teach this guest lecture right I was invited to come back and speak I've tried to find these on many times by the way they're not online I wish you had uploaded them yeah they're not online I don't think I recorded them I might have recorded one or two I'm not sure but if I could find them I'd be curious to see that I'm sure I would the book kind of grew out of that right like you basically presented your lifestyle yeah the notes from that because every time I spoke it was twice a year Ed sha the professor Hightech entrepreneurship invited me back because I had the hair brand idea of doing everything bootstrapped and all the other guest speakers had these venture-backed companies and some of them were huge I was small fries by comparison but I was doing it my way I was taking a different approach so I came back and twice a year a lot happened in my life at that point I mean it was trench warfare dog years right it's like if you ask anyone who's had the manic depressive experience of being involved with crypto it's like what does the last year felt like and they're like 17 years years yeah exactly and it's similar I think when you're running a company in the early stages it's like you know months ago was like a lifetime ago like Obama when he left office went from black to gray hair exactly years I mean look at me right no hair so uh I would say that that desire to teach and the the positive feedback really positive feedback I got from workshopping the lessons and principles and so on in this class led me to conclude a few things number one I really enjoyed teaching number two teaching in that format in front of 20 30 40 students didn't scale now I think scale can be a dirty word and dangerous and overly seductive for a lot of folks but it it wasn't going to enable me to reach a lot of people and then I was done from an identity perspective with the supplements so looking for something new and I had uh an author friend of mine this is a shortened story that could be really long but effectively say you should write a book and start introducing me to agents and editors even though I didn't want that right right I was just looking for feedback and suddenly I had all these intros and so I was like ah okay well let me start having these conversations I'd also at that point returned from a year and a half or about a year and a half of this Global walk about which I Chronicle some of in the book right Argentina and this that and the other thing and I came back and I was like okay what next right I'm not motivated to really go into hyper growth mode with this company this isn't going to be my thing for 10 years 20 years so what next and that coincided with these intros you know the book was eventually accepted and there was an offer made but a lot went into it right 20 some odd 26 29 rejections from Publishers and so on but I knew the material worked right I had the confidence because I'd workshopped it I knew with a live crowd which is over and over and over and over again I knew it worked right and I I frankly love experiments that's the way I I model my whole life so I viewed the book as an experiment I was like at the very least it's like an NBA it's like all right it's like a a break from whatever I was doing that looks acceptable like on a resume SL like like career trajector it's like all right let me try it and it's a great mask for unemployed right it's like I'm writing a book great I'm getting an NBA yeah great mask for unemployed and and then everything went bananas uh well you did the podcast that way too right experiment you were like I'm going to record I forgot six episodes and like you you you built yourself a golden bridge if you wanted to retreat you're like hey I'm going to try this I'll do six it's either going to be a wonderful six episode series or it's going to be the next thing but like I'm going to just portion off this experiment versus a huge commitment yeah give yourself a Grace flexing I mean framing it for yourself but also to other people whatever you do as an experiment gives you a graceful accent right it's so simple but it's such a psychological it's such a strong form of psychological leverage that I think very few people use right they're like my next thing is this and I'm like oh totally I felt that before I felt that pressure to have an answer yeah I want to ask you about a different a couple of your like principle core principles that I found very useful and I want you to unpack them one is the law of category can you explain what is the law of category and maybe how you used it sure the law of category is is taken directly from a book called The 22 immutable laws of marketing the law of category in brief is a description of the power of creating new categories so rather than trying to be the best in a crowded category trying to be the only in a new category that's where amstell light comes in like the the first light imported beer okay there you go or in the US let's just say lowcost lines Southwest right and there are a million examples that you could find the the law of category is also I would say an encapsulation of something that might be called the Blue Ocean strategy versus the red Ocean strategy so there's a book called The the Blue Ocean strategy I would also recommend that people read in combination with this chapter from the 22 immutable laws of marketing the law category I think I put it in either tools of Titans or tribe mentors I liked it that much I went to I went through all the brain damage of getting permissions to include it and they those two pair well with an article you can find for free you can read it in 15 minutes called 1,000 true fans by Kevin Kelly on kk.org you can find that and they're all driving at the same thing which is positioning and differentiation and trying to figure out how you can be the first something now some sometimes that turns into a bunch of handwavy smoke and mirrors nonsense like we did like we discussed earlier but at least as an exercise it's it's worth considering because for instance one of the questions I was going to ask you which you can you can answer or we can just use it as a sample question was when a DI hard fan of your show is talking to someone who does not know the show how would you ideally like them to describe the show right and that is a question of positioning because branding it gets turned into this huge process with flowcharts and tons of agencies and companies and this and that and sure I'm sure there are people are very sophisticated with their approach but at the end of the day for me brand is what people consistently associate x with X could be you X could be the show right how do they describe it right that's it that's your brand I mean just like a brand like where does the term brand come from like brand on cattle right so from that perspective I I I think it's very useful when you're considering doing a new project it's not how can I be the best competing in the same way against people doing the same thing that is not the frame and even if you end up emulating other people or borrowing best practices I think it makes sense to start with examining the law of category and thinking about blue ocean approaches which is why for instance with my podcast we're now at the 10th anniversary and I don't I don't really see a viable path forward for me that is heavily video focused even though I think they're going to be some significant taxes to pay for that podcasts have a huge discoverability problem yes and a huge long-term uh surface disability problem and YouTube offers a solution in the form of what is it the second largest English language search engine in the world and I understand why it makes sense for a lot of people to harness that as one engine for growth makes a lot of sense but it's crowded it's really crowded by anyone's definition would be a red ocean and it's definitely going to get redder and for that reason maybe I make the decision in six months you know what [ __ ] it I'm G to go Whole Hog let's see what happens right right but I don't have I don't have a really high degree of enthusiasm for that right now and enthusiasm is important right I'm which means I'm not going to have the endurance compared to someone like Chris right uh Williamson if people are like who is this Chris and and furthermore I feel life the threads of Life pulling me in other directions so doing it halfast would be the worst thing I could do like doing it six out of 10 would consume resources and not be particularly effective right so I'm trying to decide if I want to take a barbell approach with podcasting on some level which I've experimented with explain that what's the barbell approach in this baral approach could be applied I mean this is a term I I'm borrowing I don't know if he originated it from yeah Nim TB when he talks about investing right like super risky stuff and then really boring let's just say fixed income or S&P 500 or something right like super boring stuff and really risky stuff where you have a cap downside but potentially huge upside in his set of games it would probably be some type of like Black Swan option right position and then nothing in between that's it right and you could apply that to exercise you could apply that to many different things as I'm applying it I would say with in the format of podcasting you would have no video whatsoever that would be on one end of the spectrum and I've done that I've experimented with Walkin talks where I have a headset on and I'm recording with someone and we are talking and getting exercise and it's great I feel better because I'm not sitting down for three or four hours or whatever the the amount of time might be and I love it I love doing it so I think that there's a possibility doing that with a lot of enthusiasm and joy and curiosity I might be able to make up for the lack of video with those elements and I would probably do higher frequency also because of that and then on the opposite end of the spectrum I might actually for instance tomorrow like we'll have a nice video setup tomorrow and I have effectively a studio it's no wraparound immersive Avatar LED screen but it is it's a nice Studio setup it's what used to be considered really nice until we saw the craziness yeah yeah I wouldn't call it cinematic but it's high quality video right and probably shy away from stuff in between and we'll see this barbell principle applies to so much right investing you talking about it with the project how I could approach a project we me and Ben have been talking a lot about how we do this with our Network I was like man we're meeting so many people but like death by death by a thousand Zoom calls like I just I'm not going to do it yeah so what am I going do not talk to these people like No And so we decided there's a barbell approach like a bunch of random texts where there's no obligation for either side to reply it's just like hey thinking about you or hey check this out that's it quick text spend a half day or full day together I'll fly to you let's have a good time and we started doing this and oh my God it's like yeah I feel like I've cracked the cheat code of the relationship building that that that was otherwise felt very draining and overwhelming yeah the the barbell approach can be applied to a lot I apply it all over the place another example would be say speaking engagements where I very rarely do speaking engagements but it's either free where I would maybe even pay to be in front of the audience because the event in the audience is so interesting could also be a pro bono thing or Ultra Premium Ultra Premium high high water mark like what whatever company or organization paid me the most I've ever been paid that's my new minimum right like whoever is going to meet or exceed that that's it and I will do probably two to six engagements a year that's it you you did this early on I remember you had like your blog or I think it was is blog days and you did you were like everything's free I'm G to give everything away for free I'm not going to be a kind of online course Slinger like most people who once you get a little bit of following it's like hey would you like half a million bucks would you like a million you could just sell this course and then you you were like I'm either going to be all free or I'm going to be Ultra Premium I remember you did this like what was it called the uh opening the kimono the kimono yeah open the kimono like a $110,000 thing but like a lot of us were happy you'd be happy to pay that because it's like oh man I've gotten so much free value and I have the means and you're like cool I only need a small number of people which might make it a more enjoyable event for me was that the kind of calculus there yeah it's free it's free or Ultra Premium generally I mean that's how I try to approach things also because Ultra Premium gives you a lot more margin for error so you can afford to experiment right so it's it's a virtuous set of conditions that you can set in the beginning and it also poses a creative problem that I enjoy like setting the price I set the price before I figured out the content of the I was like all right let me figure out the price and then I want to figure out and it was it was wasn't just 10,000 it was like 10,000 if you apply and are accepted in the first like 6 hours or something and then it got more expensive then it went to like 12250 then it went to 15,000 and then my creative challenge was okay how do I make this event it's a two or three day event and I was done more than a decade ago it was a long time ago I've only done that one event as far as paid events goes right and I was like how do I make this event worth that amount of money like how do I exceed the cost of this event in the first two hours of the event and then the rest is just gravy powerful question that's a great question yeah and that was that was the challenge and part of the answer was I'm going to give people my actual book proposals for the first two books that lay out everything like the marketing plans all the nitty-gritty the sales pitch and all sorts of detail is because people were there for I guess what we would call now content marketing right right they wanted to know how to launch Books they wanted to know how I had launched these books I like okay let me just skip the skip the conceptual overlay I'm just going to show you exactly what I did open the kimono boom opening the kimono and and then I did I did an exercise this was also to answer that question very simple where we had something like 120 people I mean we had tons of people apply and we were trying to vet for [ __ ] to Omit them right so we had questions that were bear traps for [ __ ] well we wanted to make sure I have an audience I have a very enthusiastic audience and the last thing I would want is someone to take out a second mortgage or max out their credit cards to come to some event right so first off it was like why are transfers only we're not accepting credit cards right and I had had a it's going to sound weird but like a warning SL lecture in text which is like I do not want you to go into Deb for this right this has to represent I can't remember what the percentage was but like no more than x% of your current savings right excluding your retirement accounts and you gave them a Stern talking to yeah and so I had I had a couple of questions about finances right because I really didn't want to have the guilt on my conscience of knowing that somebody after the fact you knowing after the fact that somebody went into the red or put themselves into a really compromised position to come to this event and I do have fans who would do that I remember one guy in response to one of the finance questions he said well I appreciate you being my financial Nanny but if you want to and if you want to come onto the tarac to look at my jet when I come you're welcome to and I was like and you're out yeah thanks for that you have done exactly the fin qualifier yeah but you failed the second test I was like you you fell into the exact bear trap that I was setting for you thank you for disqualifying yourself we do not need you in a small event Financial nanny is good though I like that maybe a good service we can have have for people so so clever yeah Financial nanny.com so we had something like let's call it 100 people we had 100 people in the room and there was an attendee book with very short bios maybe not even bios and I think there were bios for everybody and we had every single person stand up in the room and I was like this is going to take a little time but like bear with me folks I think this could be interesting and I'd never done this before so I didn't know how it was going to turn out I said everybody's going to stand up they're going to say their name they're going to have a brag which is give them permission yeah like don't give me some fluffy [ __ ] humble thing right right this is not the time or the place don't be like yeah I write books sometimes and it's like a 10 times New York Time Best like don't pull that stuff get up brag I'm giving you permission I'm actually giving you a requirement then you have an Ask make an Ask of the audience and then you have a give it's like something that you're really good at or could be anything so get up and it's like a brag and ask a give and I was like everyone else is active this whole time you are listening and you're writing this stuff down if somebody has an ask that you can help with write their name down and if there's a give that you want to discuss with someone write their name down and just doing those few things the proposals and then everybody standing up and like by the end of that day people are like okay this is already 10x right what I spent this is amazing and then it was just gravy from there yeah I think the easy thing to gloss over in that it's like cool it's like cool story obviously but the takeaway for me and for anybody listening is that that question of or the technique of first I'm going to set the price then I will ask myself how I can overd deliver on that value or deliver in the first two hours where that was a no-brainer transaction for them to do MH that question LED you to such a different result than if you had just said what event should I do yeah average question common question and I feel like you have a lot of these powerful questions and you've said something that questions are like a pickaxe for the brain y it's how you dig the gold out of the brain and I love that metaphor I've I'm a collector of questions I got a swipe file of like a 100 questions mostly not interiew people think it's interview questions no these are questions that I need to ask myself to get my brain to ask a better question get a better answer one of my other favorites of yours is what would this look like if it was easy used it today for this interview I was like oh I great I got to do great interview today all right oh man this gu could be difficult there's so much content what would this look like if it was easy and what was your answer what would it look like if this was easy is me being genuinely enthusiastic and excited to meet you you feeling that from me and you walking out of here being like Oh I actually had an interesting conversation he didn't just ask me 10 questions but maybe Sean said two or three interesting things that got me got me like because I know like what does Tim want out of a out of an experience if he learned something it's probably a good experience yeah or if he heard one or two provocative things that he might think about later that's like a useful use of an hour for you and so I thought well I'm good at that so let me just like not withhold those mhm which would be common in a podcast where I'm only going to ask you questions I'll mute myself to make sure that you have the the time but in this case given that you have a platform you've been so vocal in the past I thought oh maybe I'll let myself do that because I think if I give Tim one or two nuggets that are interesting he'll walk out of here feeling like it's a great experience yeah totally so what other what what other questions do you have on that list that you use a lot that maybe I haven't heard okay I'll give you a couple of them am I leaning in to to my absolute strengths and unfair Advantage as much as I could be and what this really is is I call it the theoretical Max I had a friend who had an app one time and his developer his product managers were saying like oh the the response rate on our push notifications is like 10% and he's like guys if we just got that to 15% then like the rest of our funnel looks great and they're like ah we we tried a bunch of ab test didn't work he goes go in there right now and just write your Uber is arriving and this app was not Uber and they send out and like 50% of people open he goes That's now the theoretical Max don't ever do that again but like don't give me the BS that like because before that they were like people don't have them on people just got people are too num there's too many apps too many notifications they had all kinds of stories yeah and he's like actually let me just torch that BS real quick and so the theoretical Max question is basically we am I leaning in to my superpower or my unfair advantage to its theoretical Max and so like I'd ask you that like what is your unfair Advantage I ask that question to myself a lot I try to Edge into it a few different ways I'll ask friends of mine when have you seen me at my best that's one or what do you see me do that is easier for me than for other people right uh I think my unfair Advantage is at this point I have a lot just in terms of audience and platform and so on but if we're talking about just what I can take with me right what I can walk out of here with I would say it is an ability to ask unusual questions also ask the dumb questions when I'm trying to learn something from someone from a book from a video it doesn't matter I'm always asking these questions these various questions and then I can take whatever I learn and I suppose I could try to deconstruct this but I consider myself a fast learner at this point and if I can get to pointx in six months which is going to be usually pretty pretty good sometimes super impressive sometimes not depends on the thing but overall on average I'm going to learn things very quickly because I have a method at this point I can if it takes me six months to get to point x I can get almost anyone to that same point in three months or less mhm because I realize I I I also had so many false starts and I tried so many things that didn't quite work I tried a lot of things that were common that turns out should be removed from the learning process entirely I'd say those those are what come to mind yeah by first first reaction I said if I was Tim Ferris what would I say I think my first reaction would be I can get first it was I can get any guest on my podcast really that I want I mean every guest is Within Reach and you said well that doesn't really need to be about the podcast necessarily yeah anybody I want to talk to is Within Reach yeah that's interesting that's not true for most people and even if you are booking tons of guests or you're meeting cool people like you probably aren't at the theoretical Max you're not at the your Uber is arriving level of like leaning into that superpower for good reason your mom is dead text message theoretical Max exactly and so but then even further is not only can you get in touch with them okay that's easy but like you can go in and you can get people to open up the kimona because you're reputation is I'm Tim Ferris I learn things I've interviewed people I deconstruct the things that they're great at I ask them questions people will come to you in an interview ready to open up the kimona totally so that's interesting another interesting thing is like you you said you went to go visit the game designer in Europe for three days that's cool that's kind of like throwing your weight around into your your unfair advantages like you could probably pick up the phone and if somebody is the best game designer in the world you could they would be honored to say that oh di Ferris wants to come and learn my stuff from me fantastic please I I'll block I'll block out three days that's cool and how many more times can do that so I would start to to have a little bit of a brainstorm around that there's another question I find really really valuable and that is what is what is the silly story I'm telling myself and it immediately puts you on the defensive because you're like why would I tell myself a silly story but we all are constantly telling yourself silly stories why we can't do this why that's going to be hard why why that's not going to work for me why that will take forever why this person is not responding to my thing it's because of ABC no actually it's probably not right and so identifying the silly stories it's like I'm a Harry Potter guy I don't know if you read Harry Potter but like there's the the B right the the thing that will present itself as the thing you fear and the way to get rid of is the the spell is ridiculous you make it you basically if you're scared of spiders you put the spider on skates and then it can't walk and then it's actually becomes funny instead of scary the same thing can be done with what are the silly stories in my life as soon as you start to point them out it's typically things that you've made real but when you when you sit down and you interrogate that that story turns out it was just as fictional as like an easily replaceable story that might be might be better for you and so that's one that I ask quite often because it's the one that I hate it's the question that I hate that like that's the one I need yeah yeah I suppose if if I could choose one question the only question I could ask it' probably be some version of that yeah would you have it in mind what it would be or no uh no I mean we're just we're constantly I mean the my favorite answer to the question that I ask most guests at some point what would you put on a billboard favorite answer I've ever had was from a hospice care physician named BJ Miller who's helped thousands of people to die and helped them to die help them well he didn't yeah he didn't euthanize them but he's midwifing them through the transition to death if they have terminal cancer or something like that and his answer he actually confessed to me he got from a bumper sticker somewhere but the the his answer was don't believe everything you think that's it don't believe everything that you think and you having some method for cross-examining those beliefs right these thoughts we take to be true is is really really critical so that's a good one yeah I like that I want to leave with one thing which is Naval your friends with nval he's a fascinating guy to me never met him in person only chatted online and whatnot really respect the guy really admire a lot of things about him do you have any stories about Naval anything that you early on or a moment You observe kind of like the wisdom or the the the sort of the insightfulness that that he has no is one of my fair people he's he's he's very very smart and hilarious and does not suffer fools gladly at all which I like you don't have to guess what Nal is thinking which I I deeply appreciate and uh the first thing that came to mind is probably not the kind of example that you would expect but it's actually the first time I met Nal so the first time I met Nal I went into a coffee shop in the mission in San Francisco and I ordered a coffee and I'm waiting at the counter and there's this very attractive uh girl standing next to me and she's very friendly and she smiles and I start talking to her and I'm kind of chatting her up you know hitting on her hoping to ask her for her number and take her out and who knows you know maybe dinner maybe drink who knows and then I see Nal walk up with this huge grin on his face and he's like I see you met my girlfriend and I was like oh D and he's like nval and he just had this huge grin on his face was just like wow what a good way to to address it like totally calm and then we we then we started talking and like and we hit it off and that was probably God knows when that was I don't know 2008 or something you're like a man crush actually move out of the way face face palm yeah and and uh and that was it I I I just I admire nvol for his ability to speak truth and ask uncomfortable questions and he doesn't go out of his way to be rude but he's he's he's I think less inclined he is less inclined to the type of people pleasing that i' say many people are predisposed to myself included like there are definitely times when I'm maybe too polite or tell White Lies to make people feel good or what like normal human social lubrication right nothing major but it's like you know if my girlfriend's put on a few pounds she's like do I look fat I'm like no you know like I'm not going to say yeah you look really fat uh not to say that Nal would say that uh but he's he's Direct in a way that cuts through the noise and is very refreshing to me have you been able to uh pick up or uh learn anything from him in in terms of whether it's you know tactical stuff on the investing side or tons of stuff on the investing side I mean uh I think the site was way back in the day Venture hacks oh yeah that he and nivy co-authored and I mean that was basically the kind of Wikipedia Bible of Angel Investing and Advising for for and inside game on venture capital I mean nval is Jedi level when it comes to early stage investing very technical uh he just ends up in every deal you would ever want to be in it's it's like you know the sort of you know pinky in the brain meets like forced Gump meets you know sidarta you're just like how is he in every cap table right uh he's he's incredibly skilled as an angel investor uh yeah we don't even have enough time even be hours and hours and hours uh of of conversation to even begin to describe what I've learned from him there and he's very curious he's very interested and it's not at all limited to business so uh if it's you know David Deutsch or other thinkers he introduces me to a lot of eclectic thinkers from different disciplines and his his explor is certainly not limited as it is with a lot of people to say the sport of business or Finance or investing a lot of people are onetick ponies that way he is not a onetick pony uh so I I admire that as well I have a funny of all story which is I have a buddy who was doing some like when Facebook launched its platform my buddy made an app and it was like one of the silly apps I don't remember back then it was like people throwing sheep at each other and stuff like that he was doing one of the like silly apps but it was clear that oh Facebook platform that's like an opportunity and so smart Silicon Valley people were interested my friend sitting in Georgia and nal's in San Francisco and he gets an email from from nval basically you know found the contact us page or whatever and was like hey I'd love to meet with you sometime you know talk about your app I'm a venture capist here in in San Francisco friend doesn't know who Deval is doesn't know what venture capital is but it's like okay sounds interesting he's like oh you know like sure I mean you know I'm open to that next email is a plane ticket like here's a plane ticket goes out tomorrow so friends like okay go gets on a plane flies out here meets nval meets him in his office nval asked him he's like he asked me questions for like 30 minutes and he's like I had no idea what the what the right answer should have been but I'm saying whatever's this my honest answers and Nal was like hold on goes into the other room comes back has printed out like a term sheet and says like here uh you know I'll give you whatever half a million bucks or something whatever it is like some amount of money for you know some percentage of your company and my friend who's like 23 or something like that is just like I don't know who this Indian guy is I don't know what the I don't know any of the words on this page my app is stupid I don't know why he wants to invest in it uh I don't really understand this so he's like uh I just don't feel comfortable right now and he's like and nval at the time was like you know he's very he's like I think Facebook is going to be you know huge I think it's going to be the platform where you do lots of things you're not just going to talk to friends on there you're going to be able to do XYZ that's my thesis that's why I want to invest in this because my friend was like honestly this is kind of a stupid idea why you this is not a business and so he gave him that that pitch my friend was like wow that sounds awesome I didn't even realize all that I had stumbled into this gold potentially so he's like listen man I just uh I don't understand what this thing is I just need to think about and I was like no problem and so he's like I go and then by the way that same week he meets Keith R boy Max Le and a bunch of other people who are ALS giving him the same pitch but in different flavors like Keith R boy was like you should come work for us he's like I don't want a job he's like see all those people right there all those programmers they're going to put you out of business like you know tomorrow and he was like this is a stupid app it's not a business to do it waste your time doing this you're going to put me out of business that isn't a business I live in my mom's bedroom like what are you talking about and so then I he said he goes you know the great thing about Nal though is that he's like like 15 years later now my friend's very a very successful Tech entrepreneur he's like I actually dug up that old term sheet he's like it was so fair he's like he could have taken advantage of me and I didn't know anything and he's like it was incredibly founder friendly and fair and he's like that told me a lot about Naval uh that at that time when a lot of people were in the Heat of the Moment about this kind of gold rush in that Facebook app days and I was clearly a novice um he he operated with very high integrity and I thought that that said a lot about him yeah that matches with my experience I've always seen that in noal yeah for sure right on well Tim thanks for doing this man I really I really appreciate it yeah my pleasure man thanks for taking the time yeah mission accomplished I hope [Music]

Sean uh I want to show you three things things that I've read in the past week or two that have inspired me you want me to start with the I'm going to start with the strangest one I'm going to get it out out the [Music] way do you listen to Theo Von's podcast uh not the full I listen to Clips do you listen to the full thing I listen to the full thing sometimes and there was one that happened the other day that I sat and watched the entire thing I think it was 2 hours long you're going to laugh when I tell you who it is but his episode with Kid Rock was awesome so do you know anything about Kid Rock I'm gonna say I don't know anywhere near as much as you know about Kid Rock I could safely assume that hands down I bet my life savings on that I have been a fan of Kid Rocks forever I've been a Kid Rock fan for a very long time and Kid Rock is a very fascinating guy so he's like born in Detroit had this whole like rap thing it kind of rap whatever it was whatever you want to call that genre uh but the reason he's fascinating is the guys who sold a lot of Records in the late 90s are some of the richest musicians out there because CDs were like $22 how much how much were CDs when we were kids like 20 bucks right yeah CDs were like really expensive really expensive and they cost like a dollar they cost like a dollar to make and so Kid Rock has sold something like 40 million albums which is a shitload of albums and he went on Theo's Theo Von's podcast and about halfway through he start talking he starts talking all about business and he's done some amazing things so let me tell you a few amazing things that Kid Rock has done Kid Rock at this point he's kind of like Nickleback where people make fun of him or they make fun of you for even kind of liking him and it's kind of a joke dude he's a super Savvy guy so listen to a listen to a few things that he's done have you ever heard of the uh Kid Rock Cruise no so Kid Rock has a cruise that he does every year and you pay like you pay like $3,000 and you go on a cruise for like four or five days and he goes on the cruise with you and he plays music every day for the cruise it's an amazing like thing you butchered the name it's the Kid Rock chilling the most Cruise you needed to say that it's so funny what he does and so he's been doing this for like 10 years now or 15 years now I think since the 2010 or so and so that kills it listen to a few other things he's got going on he has the Kid Rock Rodeo that's his new thing and so do you know anything about Rodeo I mean you're just embarrassing me at this point no I don't know anything about I don't know anything about Kid Rock I don't know about his cruise I don't know about his Rodeo you could you could skip the questions of do I know about Kid Rock's extensive business portfolio I do not you've never been to a rodeo but you've never been I lived in Texas for 10 years and I did not go I used to go to them in California at the the the Cow Palace you remember the Cow Palace outside frco by the way dude the Cow Palace is this Vue like literally two miles outside of the city of San Francisco and you go just two miles outside of San Francisco and you're at the rodeo for the night and you're in Redneck Heaven and so I used to go there go to it all the time it's so fun I used to go to dog shows there they have dog shows I used to go and watch like the the dog shows and just look at all the Swiss mountain dogs and [ __ ] it was so fun and so anyway Kid Rock now has the Kid Rock Rodeo which freaking kills it because Rodeo is up and coming you know who owns the PBR it's the same company that owns Endeavor because it kills it well Kid Rock has started his own rodeo and it has like uh teams which is like kind of a new aspect of rodeo and it's also killing it and I and he starts talking about the business of this Rodeo this guy is super super Savvy he talks about how a owner came to him and was like Hey we're gonna start this new Rodeo do you want to buy a team it costs $20 million to buy into the into the league and just start a rodeo team and he goes no I don't want to do that but what if I just help you start the whole league and I own the league with you and that's what he's done and now he has the Kid Rock Rodeo where he goes and he performs at the rodeo it's very very fascinating and then finally have you ever been to Nashville nope okay four four so on in Nashville in downtown Nashville where I used to live there's a street called called Broadway and that's where all of The Honky tons are honky talks are basically Ally like these kind of crappy dirty bars with bright lights and they call it Nash Vegas it like looks like it's Las Vegas I us we used to go on Saturday and Sunday nights and try to like meet all the bachelorette parties it was like a thing when you're in college and so Kid Rock about 10 years ago started this thing called uh the Kid Rock Honky Tonk and at this point that bar it sells something like 15,000 beers a night yes yes I don't know how many beers in normal bars sales but that number sounds like a lot it's a huge amount man and uh the business is doing I I was reading about it the business does something like this one bar this one location $30 million a year in Revenue it's insane this one it's it's a one it's a it's like a three-story bar in this main strip of Nashville is Kid Rock our Billy of the week actually dude Kid Rock is so fascinating and on this podcast he breaks down a bunch of the businesses and he's like a lot of people think that I'm partying stuff like that he goes I don't I don't even drink that much I wake up at 4:00 a.m. I do a cold plunge I do a sauna I do a workout I swear to God this is what kid rock is saying he goes like I write my morning gratitude Journal he's like then I do the next thing dude he's so much more put together than a lot of people give him credit to give him credit for and this podcast with theovon with Kid Rock it's so good you have to listen to it it's hilarious does he talk about all these business things on the Pod or you look those up no he talks about a bunch of of him he talks about he's like a really Savvy business guy in Austin Reef our friend Austin Reef Kid Rock and is like I guess he has a family office if I had to guess I bet you Kid Rock is worth about $300 million Austin Reef went to Kid Rock's house in Nashville because he was organizing a thing for startup entrepreneurs because he wants to find cool companies to invest in listen to this his home his home in Tennessee is a replica of the White House this guy it's basically like a redneck with all this money doing exactly what they want to do it's hilarious and he talks about his White House home on uh in Nashville and I'll tell you one last thing so I'm such a Kid Rock fan that I heard a rumor that his when I went to Belmont University from 2008 to 2012 I heard a rumor that his son went there and so I did a little Googling and I find out what his son looks like and so I spent months on the campus just looking for Bobby Jr that was his name uh because Kid Rock's name is Bob Bobby Jr and I I months I'm like I got to find this kid what as soon as I see him I'm going to go up and I'm just going to shake his head and tell him hi just the most the lamest thing you could imagine well I finally see him on a Friday night when I'm just blackout drunk like I barely remember it and I see him I go Bobby huge fan and I'm slurring my words I love your father I put my arm on his like shoulder and I go here take my number and I grab his phone and I and I type my number in his phone and I text myself and then I just try to like forced myself to on this kid to be his friend I think I was like a junior he was a freshman and I just look like the biggest [ __ ] and I just try to forc myself on him and shockingly it didn't work but I've been a big I've been a big kid big kid rock fan for years and this podcast was awesome with theovon you have to listen to it okay that was a great sales pitch also I like take my number I think take my number is just uh very underutilized way of of forcing a connection with anybody here here here do you have a phone take my number it's because I grabbed his phone so I could text myself to make sure that I got his yeah the real number yeah it was so embarrassing that I did this but yeah that's my kid rock story um all right amazing I'm tempted to just send the podcast right there and uh and just go try to book Kid Rock as a guest but I I'll give you a couple things that I'm I'm into nowhere near as entertaining as that right now but you you know my understanding was kind of like what you're saying is I'm watching some different content weird content new info diet and I want to tell you some of the things I'm doing with my info diet so I'm going to give you the the chapter titles of this and then you get to pick which one you want me to explain so here's the chapter titles of how how I'm consuming content number one older is better number two uh look to the left number three more with less and number four oh actually have five four pay for Learning and five early Arbitrage exploit which one do you want me to talk about number one number five number four all right number one is older is better okay so older is better uh in general I'm trying to get away from the news feed right the news feed is in many ways like the actual like news I don't watch the news for for the same reason which is you know the news is a entertainment program designed to basically just like find random problems in the world and then just shove them in your face and Twitter Facebook Instagram these are all kind of the same way where people are here here's my life and you just throw you know here's what I'm thinking right right now and it's useful to a degree but it's more addictive than it is useful and um my solution is not to just go detox and be like oh I just put my phone on silent and leave it in the other room and I just you know enjoy nature that's not really me either I got to substitute it with something else right and so my substitute is I found uh I was like what do I want to read that's shorter than a book that's as informational as like you know reading an annual um like a S1 or like a annual report for some company like like an investor would like a Warren Buffett would but still has some juice still has some story and I found that annual letters annual shareholder letters or annual reviews of people is just a really fascinating place to go look I get what's the difference between an annual review and an annual letter so one is typically when you have shareholders or LPS that's when you're writing an annual shareholder letter right because you have your your investors or you have your shareholders that you are looking out for so this is like Buffett's letters Jeff Bezos letters I'll give you a really good one that I found the Nick sleep letters you've probably never heard of this guy who's this guy fascinating guy uh when I when I did the podcast with Mish P he mentioned Nick sleep and like I don't know the full story I just started looking because I found like 10 years of this guy's annual letters but the short story is him and his him and his buddy basically started buying stocks started uh investing on behalf of other people did so well over like a 10 to 15 year period that they ended up just like you know retiring and his portfolio at the end was like Amazon Costco and Berkshire hathway had three stocks by the end and I just love somebody who can absolutely crush the market he absolutely crushed in terms of performance and did it without like going like working really hard or going into some obscure Rabbit Hole he just identified correctly early on that Amazon Costco and Berkshire were good bets to be in and he just stay with those rode those ponies till the end pretty pretty insane he did other things but like that was where he ended I found that fascinating how big was the portfolio dude these guys got filthy right I don't know exactly how much uh how much an asset they have off the top of my head but um you know basically in a in a very short period of time you know got Filthy Rich so I'm ju I just started these letters I just read the first one uh last night so I'm pretty into fresh right now that's cool I like Nick sleep when you Google him the first thing that comes up by the way is uh his legendary letters exactly the letter is what and I think some people have like maybe bound it into a Kindle book as well like and you know whenever it's something like that like the last time it was like this it was the Boron letters yeah it's like who's the Bor on letters well this guy was like one of the best copywriters he wrote a bunch of letters from jail to his son it's like dude I'm in this sounds like you know season two of Prison Break mixed with you know my copyrighting course I'm in you know like give give me that and so I I'm really into these annual shareholders or or annual reviews so we have a few friends um s balky does this every year he posts a annual review on his blog and he just goes back and he just says here's what I did this year here's some of the highlights here's some of the low lights whatever Nathan Barry from convertkit does the same thing he po post this on his blog he'll be like uh you know thing one my family thing two convert kit thing three I bought some airbnbs here's the occupancy of my airbnbs here's how much money I made oh bad but this was a pain in the ass and I just feel like people who are sharing that type of information is just very interesting to me and it's a very quick read and to me I'm like I'd rather spend 30 minutes reading that than 30 minutes aimless scrolling on Twitter so that's my older is better that was my number one all right what's number you said the last one early Arbitrage exploit so I tried to put all my power words in there to hook you because I wanted to talk about this have you seen air chat uh I don't know exactly what it is so all I know is that nval has some type of new social media thing and it's invite only that's all I know it's not invite only anymore so as of I don't know two days ago they just opened it up to everybody and they pivoted it it they've had a kind of air chat in beta for a few months um I checked it out I was like this is okay it wasn't super engaging like it was kind of confusing ux and it was just a little bit slow to consume um is it like Twitter but better okay so the new one I'll tell you about the new one because forget the old one it's gone anyways the new one is basically like imagine Twitter but it's voice first so you to post you just talk into your phone right so you don't type you just talk but it autot transcribes it using Ai and it speeds it up like 1.3x or something like that so when you like when you're scrolling the timeline it just starts to play Somebody's audio or you could read it but it plays it a little bit faster so it's actually PR it's like you're almost listening as fast as you could read in a way which is kind of interesting and you get to hear their voice and then people reply or whatever so it's the the generous version of it would be oh this is a really cool new like social media format and new formats are interesting right Twitter was a short form format um Tik Tok was a you know or Vine was a six-second looping format Tik Tok was a different short video format like formats mean things um and that's where the big the big breakthroughs come from so maybe it's one of those the other side of it is like it's kind of like if you turned on um accessibility mode on your phone and then open Twitter it's like hey can you just voice a text like can you just read me my timeline which is not great so I'm not sure if it's going to be a hit or not but here's what I do know just like in the early days of Clubhouse when an interesting person in Silicon Valley starts a new interesting thing and they invite only their interesting friends that place is a very interesting place for like the first 90 days for the first 90 days who knows if it's gonna be successful or not you get a call option on that and so I'm like [ __ ] it I'm all in on air chat for the next like seven days let me just go let me just throw full force let me completely ignore Twitter completely ignore YouTube podcasting Etc and let me just air chat the hell out of myself why because it's naval's friends which is probably the most interesting group of human beings um in my world in the business and Tech world that's who's using it um so all the content is interesting because the people are interesting and there's not that many people on there so if I'm even remotely interesting I'm like in the top 0.1% of interesting people on this app and the same thing happened when Clubhouse came out I didn't think Clubhouse was going to be there forever but I had told my buddy Jason who I always thought Jason's an interesting guy and I was like Jason quit your job and just be on clubhouse like 10 hours a day for the next 30 days watch you're going to build your company we had gotten acquired so I was like just check out you're at twitch just check out now who cares no nobody will nobody will know trust me uh there 2,000 people in this place nobody does anything uh just stop doing work and just get on clubhouse 247 and he's like well you know like I gotta no no no trust me you'll get more value out of this than you will your job and that's exactly what happened he went there he was on it all the time he's an interesting guy so he made a bunch of friends he ended up raising like a$ million crypto fund out of it made a couple million bucks doing it returned their money and like none of that would have been possible like he raised money from a bunch of Clubhouse friends and he made like you know lifelong friends they go on trips together in real life now and it's these early arbitrages when somebody awesome curates something in many ways Hampton was like this you're an interesting guy you had an interesting idea and then you curated an early group of people and you were like hellbent like I'm gonna make this a great experience for them and so that those first 100 days were going to be like the best hundred days of this whole product forever just because of what H that early day exploit well I hope not I mean no it's okay it's just like in dating like there is a honeymoon period for products for people for relationships where uh you know let me get that door for you let me take let me take out the trash for you let me it's Wednesday let me send you a little gift right you behave a little bit differently at the beginning of a relationship than you do seven years in you think air chat's going to be better than Clubhouse and it's actually going to work too early to say I've been only been on it for like two hours so uh let me let me not do a hot take conclusion just yet but um it's interesting for sure hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database it's totally free if you just click the link in the description below you can go download a collection of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated and so uh what are you waiting for go download it it's free check it out it's in the description below all right back to the show what's the four thing pay for learning I don't know if I said this one pay for learning so this is instead of me going out there and trying to get smarter about something in this case AI I was like wait uh why is it that as as adults we don't ever go to school go to class or have tutors and so I told you this before I hired an AI tutor yeah and the guy you know people were like what what is an AI tutor and I was like dude AI is changing so fast literally every three weeks there's a new mind-blowing paradigm shift in AI okay great there's thousands of companies getting funded I can't even keep track of them there's new models being released there's a new talk that drops a new interview that drops where Sam Alman says this interesting thing I couldn't possibly keep up with it it's a full-time job to keep up with it so one way is you go read a newsletter or you join maybe a group chat or something like that that's good um but what I decided to do was like how do I use how do I spend money in an interesting way here how do I I basically pay this guy 500 bucks an hour and I say your job is every week you're going to come to the table and you're going to tell me here's the four most interesting things that blew my I live in AI world he lives in AI World he's has to bring to me three or four of the most interesting things he's seen and then I usually ask him a question like hey I saw people talking about this what is it or chamath said this thing I didn't even really understand it what the hell is he talking about or um hey in my business I have this problem is there an AI tool that could actually solve this and then he'll go do the research and he'll come back to me and he'll he'll answer it and so this has been just like such a hack to be smart about AI but shave my time commitment like you know yes I'm paying this guy $500 for one hour of his time but I'm kind of saving eight to 10 hours of my time because I now literally don't have to think about it I put it out of my brain I'm gonna have a focus 60 to 90 minutes with him and he'll tell me everything I need to know have you ever used GLG do you know what GLG is I know what GLG is yeah I was I was on G I was on the other side of GLG as you're an expert I did it too I remember uh basically GLG originally was started because it was like Bankers who were going to either take a company public or uh wanted to invest a large sum into like uh let's just say let's just say MailChimp MailChimp is going to get acquired by into it and they're hearing rumors about it so they go they would go and find people like me who use MailChimp like services and ask us questions like if MailChimp raised the prices what would you do right uh how would you react just so they can get like an idea for the market well there's GLG now there's T there's also intro and I also have been an expert on those and you could charge like two or three or sometimes $5,000 an hour like crazy amounts of money to be an expert dude I've been using it on the other end where I've been paying money to like get insights yeah it it kind of feels like it's cheating so like you can you can tell GLG or Tes or whoever that you want to talk to your competitor or someone who works at or worked at your competitor and you can get so much information from them I read this I think I told you about Steve Cohen I read this book about Stevie Cohen he basically is one of the largest uh hedge fund guys out there and one of his guys went to jail went to prison for many years because what they would do is they would use GLG so much that they would befriend the experts and fly out to The Experts home and get them to reveal a bunch of confidential information that they weren't allowed to reveal and then they would go and trade assets on that information which is insider trading it's so powerful that I've been able to do this it it's like been really amazing to be on the other end of paying these people I'm shocked I haven't done this for years have you ever paid money I had never done I've never done it on one of those networks because to me I'm like paying somebody $2,000 an hour right like it makes sense for most of those customers because they're making very large investment decisions so if I can get better Alpha better information for you know 2,000 5,000 10,000 $20,000 doesn't matter when I'm taking A10 million position or $80 million position on a company I've never been in that that position where I needed to do that that's not what I it's not what I do it's scale I play at so like how do you justify paying you know for yourself like what are you what are you paying for and how how are you justifying paying that much money I'll give you an example so uh let's just say that uh uh let's just say all right so Hampton Hampton's a peer business a community business there's like five competitors out there a couple of them are quite huge I'm curious how they're acquiring users so you could just sign up and say I want to talk to the director of marketing at this company and they go and find a former marketing executive or marketing leader at these companies and be like so you know how and you don't have to you don't tell them your background or what you're doing and you be like so how are you guys how are you guys acquiring customers like could you just do LinkedIn ads oh LinkedIn ads didn't really work so instead we did X Y and Z and you can just ask all these questions and hopefully save yourself a year of time of making the same mistakes at other people in your industry so for Ecom you could be like um well I'm not well versed at Ecom but I guess it could be like you know what about uh shipping from your own Warehouse versus hiring another person's Warehouse you know things like that uh you could just ask them all these questions and it's made my life so much easier right yeah I think it's more of like a scalpel than it is like a blunt force Hammer where it's like you really it's a it's a very precise instrument you only want to use it for very specific types of questions where the the tradeoff makes sense and there's many jobs where that make sense and then there's many like in the Ecom example you'd almost never do that realistically as an Ecom person but if you are like I've been on there and people would be like hey um you use triple wh and uh we're looking to talk to an expert who uses triple wh and we want to know did you evaluate three or four other competitors and why did you choose Triple L over the competitors and it's like yep I did that I used triple I evaluated the competitors here's here's the difference blah blah blah they really couldn't do that because they're not an operator so when they're making a big investment decision they have to they want they want to go in with like real information versus random theories on their side where they they weren't actually an operator in the space right um all right let's do another one you have anything else I've got a book that I I think you should read so I read this book years ago and I just recently reread it because it's so good and I bet you've never heard of this person I'm gonna ask but I know the answer is no Kurt Koran that doesn't ring a bell kurk Koran does it that kind of does ring about who is Kirk Koran all right so Kirk aoran he's born in the early 1900s like 1920 or something he's an AR Armenian immigrant or born into an Armenian family where he like he's born in Fresno California but spoke Armenian didn't even speak English he eventually drops out of like eighth grade so he's like this like you know he's not the riches yet but he's the rags part of the story where he's comes from nothing I think his parents were like Farmers or something grew up poor learns how to fly a plane because World War II is coming up and he doesn't want to be uh shooting guns so he goes into the Air Force and learns how to fly planes and he spends the war flying planes after the war he's able to save up enough money to buy a Cessna one plane for $5,000 I think he saved up like $2,000 he buys a plane and his first business is flying people from California to Las Vegas this is in the 50s and 60s Las Vegas is like not really a thing yet but gambling is legal there and all these rich Hollywood folks want to go to Vegas for the weekend he's their guy he flies them out there so he flies him out there and he starts getting into gambling while he's there as well and so through his gambling as well as his very small business of flying people out there he starts buying more and more planes and over the course of like 15 years he kind of has a meaningful business to the point point where he's like 43 or 44 years old and he's making the equivalent of like $2 million a year in profit and so he's got a good business well he sells this Airline business for $10 million which is like the equivalent of $90 million today he sells it in his 40s and that's really where things start taking off with that money he buys a plot of land and he turns it into the uh Pink Flamingo Hotel which is one of the first big epic gambling hotels in Las Vegas then you the what's what's so funny just the flamingo I just that's hilarious yeah that's his thing uh and by the way while there one of the waiters who worked for him has a son and Kirk always treated this waiter really nicely and so he eventually names his son Kirk aasy his first name being Andre so Andre Kirk Agassi uh the famous tennis player is named after yeah is Kirk Koran because he's known as like a he's a good employer he's a good guy takes his uh small little Casino parlays it and keeps on grow and by the time he's in his 50s and 60s he starts buying other companies so he buys MGM which at the time was a lot it was it was a a Production Studio Movie Studio and then after years and years of doing this he just parlays all of this to eventually he's like 85 years old and he buys 10% of GM and then at 88 years old he tries to buy the entire Chrysler company and he almost gets it done at like $30 billion but what's interesting about this guy Kirk aoran never had formal education so so he's I guess he's a a Wall Street guy who's not actually on Wall Street he's a banker type but he buys all these companies with no education he's very private so there's like three or four interviews ever about this guy and he's got balls of steel he just like he's a nice guy but he's a hard negotiator and he's just puts his money where his mouth is and he does this until the age of like 94 when he dies to the day he's die till the day he dies he's making deals and he's really low-key but he dies with like a net worth of like5 billion doar and if you like you know you and I have been kind of been into the whole Capital allocation type of thing this is the guy and he's done it without any background no pedigree very fascinating guy I have to apologize to Kid Rock I thought you were the Billy of the week actually it's this guy this guy is the Billy of the week wow this is incredible story The Andre Agy thing just was the cherry on top for me I got to say uh thank you for adding that one in it seems almost impossible to me when by the way I'm clearly wrong but it seems almost impossible that a guy could just like start chartering flights for people he's like a pilot pilot turned billionaire that sounds so like the amount of capital he had to amass to end up owning 10% of GM tried to buy chryler for five billion dollars like how the hell did this guy compound at that rate for that long that's so insane the book is called The Gambler it's a really good book but basically he's like I'm a gambler at heart I love gambling he's like I'm in it for the thrill but basically he caught a couple Trends the first being obviously Airlines weren't popular and so like his airline was kind of Ricky Dink and he just kind of bootstrapped it for like 15 years and so it's kind of inspiring he started the airline when he was like 32 right when he got out of the war it wasn't really a hit until 44 and it wasn't that big of a hit it was a good business but it wasn't like some epic epic thing but he sells it for 10 million and then two years later he buys it back runs it for three more years and then sells it again this time for a 100 million and the the trend that he caught was that Airlines just weren't a thing and so they were kind of bootstrapped things they weren't they didn't have these massive barrier to entries like you would think of today where you have to have tens of billions of dollars I mean starting an airline today seems just like insane it wasn't like that and then the same thing with Las Vegas where gambling it wasn't exactly like that where uh it wasn't like that big of a thing Las Vegas was I think he the plot of land he paid for I think it was $800,000 and then he spent another like couple million dollars to build the Pink Flamingo and he just got these hits early on where he caught these Trends you know Vegas Airlines things like that and he caught them all early on but here's the inspirational part in my opinion he wasn't really a baller until his mid to upper 40s um and he was in the game for literally 95 years when he died yeah I think the uh you know Mish P when I was talking to him he was like you know there's three variables that matter uh when it comes to wealth he's like it's all about compounding so he's like it's either the rate that you're compounding so the percentage gain every year it's the length of the runway or it's the amount you started with and you could pull any of those three levers you either start with a huge amount then you don't have to have a high rate or a long time if you start with a low amount which is where most people start then you need a high rate and a long time um or you need to like exposive high rate and not that long time right those are your variables to play with and you know if you look at Buffett Buffett's thing is that he compounded for the longest time so he basically you know bought his first stock when he was 11 years old and yes at 95 now he's you know if he hadn't given his money away he'd be the wealthiest man in the world um or you know what number one number two number three somewhere up there and it's because he had an 80-year Runway so it's not that his rate was that absurd it's that the rate was consistent and it was 80 years and and so it's like you know one of those things for compounding is like how how long of a Runway do you get and for most people you know like for Buffett and for others it's like the bulk of their wealth is always kind of in the last the last two or three turns compounding because that's just how compounding works if you're doubling every 10 years then doubling you know when from 70 to 90 is going to be doubling a huge number at that stage and people say that and and you're right when you say that but it almost discredits Buffett if you read his biography or read any of his early reports or his annual letters man even when he was like 35 or 38 he had something like $50 million in assets and people are like well he didn't actually make he he the billions didn't come until his 50s or 60s he was killing it for a long time like like he started both can be true right 50 million is still killing it and 50 million is not the same thing as 90 billion yeah yeah yeah that's for sure but if you like read about him he was like I think he said when he graduated college I think he had $100,000 of his own portfolio which in the 40s that's like having like $2 million and he was killing it from a like a really early age and then his early compounding was like 30 to 50% for like six or eight years in a row I mean he was kind of the man from the beginning if you ever read about him when that episode comes out you'll like it that monish is basically like a buffet historian and AER historian he knows year by year what he was doing what he was investing in how much he had he like has charted it out he gave me like an oral history of Warren Buffett in a way that I've really never seen and I loved it because I've met a lot of people who are super successful and then they it's like they're not kind of like students of the game in the same way that I am where I'm like oh did you ever go back and read all the letters and kind of deconstruct them they're like no I was just doing my thing um right or like I know great invest I'm like do you do like detailed kind of models or like do you write memos that like did you go back and review them and you track your hit rate like nerdy stuff that I like to do and often very often I would say more often than not the answer is actually no I don't do any of that [ __ ] I just like I just focus on what's in front of me and I just do that thing so it's really nice when I see somebody who wins with the same play style I have where they they kind of are a nerd about it and they do like to go back and kind of chart things out and break things down and and kind of analyze it a little bit themselves and other people and and try to use that to kind of reverse engineer you know some lessons um so it was pretty cool to see that what was your takeaway uh after he said that like I said I think it was reassuring in a way it sounds silly to say but it's true like whenever I meet a more successful person than me who does things the way I do them I feel good inside right like I I feel a little reassured like oh that's cool like this person like it reassures me that my method can work right I already believed it could work why why why else would I be doing it but it's even more conviction that this works I don't need to shift what I'm doing in order to make it work when you see somebody who's very similar to you maybe similar demeanor similar philosophy similar approach similar work habits um you know I I like finding people who who have a match because it's very hard for me to change my nature or to change my workstyle or change my habits so it's actually better for me to double down make them super strengths and find other people who've won use with those same strengths and look and learn from them and what they do versus try to become some different guy playing some other play style that I'm not familiar with that I'm not good at that I haven't done for 15 years already let me wrap up by telling you one last thing and this one is going to be short because I'm not terribly well versed on it you would know this guy better than I would actually uh what's his name Mike no uh novag gots the crypto gu what's his name Mike novag grats novag grats so I think he started or helped start Fortress which is a massive hedge fun right yeah he's got this new podcast called business Untitled right now on YouTube I think it has 3,000 subscribers even though they're like 30 or 15 episodes in his podcast is so good it's him dude it's so good it's him and this other guy named Mike Barry Mike Barry I believe is a real estate guy and he owns a chain of hotels or something like that really highend hot HS it's sort of like the Allin podcast where it's like billionaires talking about stuff and that's one of the reasons why it's exciting but these guys have like a little like Allin is not even remotely I wouldn't even use the word blue collar at all to describe those guys uh or what they think of themselves this podcast they kind of do have that Vibe where they're like born they weren't born wealthy and they still remember where they came from and they're talking like they're small business owners except the numbers are absolutely massive it's a beautiful wonderful podcast you got to listen to a few episodes I'm so jealous of this thumbnail style oh man I see this and I just wish this was our thumbnail style this is so is like dollar bills it's just [ __ ] awesome dude it's great man it's a really I wish you hadn't said this I wish I could just steal I wish I could have just you could have just shown this to me and I'd be like let's steal this because this is so so damn good of a of a thumbnail style well they only have like three or 4,000 subscribers how many subscribers do they have on their YouTube I think it's like 3800 or something like that yeah so you're saying we can steal it nobody will yeah we can steal it it's really good podcast is so good like and they have amazing guests like they even had they've had Snoop Dogg on recently or they'll have the founder of uh Equinox or uh a bunch of like really big names and they just shoot the [ __ ] and it's wonderful it's so good and they tell stories about starting Fortress capital and uh I guess Wes Eden who started Fortress I think he eventually like bought railroads or something like that and they tell the stories but they have this weird Blue Collar downto Earth kind of style that I've been digging it's really good all right that's a big uh big endorsement I like that um I got to ask you what do you think about the fact that so many people have podcasts like uh it's pretty remarkable when we started this was four years ago um roughly four years ago I think and we were not early to the podcasting game we were like a decade plus late to the game felt late felt late at the time but I would say since we started it's now like incredibly common if you're anybody like the number of people who start a podcast is is that are kind of like interesting people from other other walks of life right like Investors Business people athletes whatever um it's kind of amazing like one of the content one I was going to talk about is Jay reck has a new pod with LeBron James you SE this I saw that it's awesome right it's like LeBron is podcasting this is amazing what the hell is going on I love the athlete ones a lot of the UFC guys are doing them now too Kamar Usman has one I love them so what's your take on this like what what where does this kind of like where does do this go or like what what do you think is going to happen with like everybody starting a podcast now a I love it as a fan like I enjoy listening to them B I don't think they're going to lasts that long I think it's a lot harder than people realize to do it for a really long time um I think when you and I or when you first started this the common thing was you guys are G to run out of stuff to say I hadn't really felt like that much there's some times where I'm like what else can we talk about but in general that's that's only happened 10% of the time and I don't think they're going to run out of things to say but I do think that it's it could be a lot harder work I mean you're signing up for something I'm shocked that Tim Ferris has done it for 10 10 years I think that it's it's a lot harder to do it for many years than people understand do you agree with that yes and no I think that I think there's a problem with it I don't think that's the problem I'll tell you what it is but but on the running out of things to say I think most people will choose interview which is a kind of infinite Runway format it's like oh you just bring somebody on then you talk to them then you ask them questions then you bring another person ask them what we do when we don't have guest on is a lot harder for to to have longevity with because it's like how many interesting things are me and Sam going to be able to say of original content versus an interview or reacting to news so I think reacting to news an interview or reacting to TV shows like that's always going to be a format that has like infinite runways I think most people will do those and they won't run out of content I think the problem is that how many podcasts on average are you listening to at any given month five and you're you're a power user of podcasts that's funny yeah I mean maybe less three to five right not not a lot the Shelf space is just really goddamn small I don't think I don't think most people realize this I I think they think it I don't even think it's a discovery problem I think it's a discovery problem because people cannot consume that many podcasts so for example I think what a lot of people do is they're like oh yeah I use Twitter I use Instagram oh Tik Tok comes out I I'll use Tik Tok like they kind of think everything's social media and your if your experience before was well if I'm just interested like people can people will follow me but it's like I can follow literally like 5,000 people on Instagram I can scroll through in one instagram sitting and I could see content from 200 people in that like you know that 30 minutes but my sh so the Shelf space is huge on every other social media but the Shelf space is Tiny on podcast people listen to One Two Three on average in rotation and so the question is can you break into enough people's top one two or three podcasts and you're going up against a habit they might have had with other podcasts for five years the hope would be they expand the the market that new people start listening to podcast and I'm sure that's going to happen to some extent but I think just like the supply demand is so off the demand is so small of the number of podcast somebody will regularly listen to that it doesn't matter how many new people create a podcast it's going to be very hard because the Shelf space is too small but you do realize that it's over two times the amount of people listen to radio than podcasts I mean if you you go to where I'm from and you talk to some certain people they they're like what's a podcast like it's still listening to music dude yeah but it's not like AM radio but there's still a lot of Market penetration for podcasts particularly amongst like a general population like someone who cares about LeBron like I bet a an athlete will get significantly more new but what what I'm saying is I think P the best podcasts in every category are gonna grow like you're saying like there's still 10x more Headroom for them to grow let's say however it's just that there's all like the number of winners is very small in podcasting versus on Instagram there's so many winners so many people who have followings either small like just enough to keep you hooked enough to keep you engaged it's very hard to be a winner in any category like let's say I want to start a true crime podcast or a business podcast or a sports podcast the W the ones at the top are going to keep getting more and more and more more and more downloads because like you you have an audience now so it's easier for you to do it to do it from scratch when you don't have an audience I think it's basically impossible yeah even people who have an audience look at like even people who are or successful or have some audience it's very hard to to boot a boot a podcast up I don't know I think I think it's the Shelf space problem is my my take of like what what the limiting factor here is it's just that there's only so many number humans who listen to podcast that number is growing but the number that's not growing is how many different podcasts they're going to regularly listen to because they only have so much ear time that they're going to dedicate to ear entertainment right is it good the JJ and LeBron one I would say it's amazing and I mean that in the literal definition of the word not like the content is amazing it's just like I am amazed that this is happening I am amazed that LeBron James is sitting down and explaining to me like the the marching Gortat screen it's like oh what's the Gortat screen and he's explaining what this is what how it works whatever I think they really need to work on getting the uh like like they need overlay it's like way too X's and O's like they need the overlays where you're going to be able to see an actual clip of what they're talking about because it's like so abstract that the average person is not going to be able to follow um the other thing is I think it's going to be hard for them to resist so what's what's happening now already you could see is the clips where he it's just LeBron talking about the turning point where he you know when they before winning his first championship it's a story time with LeBron Story Time with LeBron is always going to get 10 to 100x more views than LeBron and JJ reick explaining this defensive coverage and how to how to how they make adjustments to it right because it's like one is just a juicy story and the other is like really hard math that you need to learn the B the basketball basketball equivalent of math and so I think what's gonna be hard is their editors gonna be like all right cool we should just like hey uh ask LeBron like if he thinks he's better than Jordan because that's gonna get 10 million views like it's just so there for them and it's gonna be interesting to me to see do they stick to the spirit of what they wanted to start with which is X's and O's real basketball talk no hot takes no no it's not an interview with LeBron James which would always do well it's like them talking about you know um spacing on the wing you know like random like basketball X's and O's tactics it'll be very interesting to me to see like six months from now what's happening but you know what even if it's just a minseries even if they just did like 12 of these still phenomenal amazing for J.J reick amazing for LeBron's brand because I watch this I'm like oh [ __ ] I get why they say this guy's got crazy basketball IQ like JJ reic will bring up some play that happened four years ago and LeBron's I remember man too right he he's such a he's so good uh but he'll bring up something and LeBron will have like perfect photographic memory recall of the play four years ago on a Tuesday night in Orlando and that's just kind of amazing so for his brand it's like what the Last Dance kind of did for Jordan where it's like oh man Jordan just amazing LeBron is also like playing the Legacy game where he's building his brand of like dude LeBron just knows his [ __ ] man his basketball IQ was the greatest of all time he's trying to be the greatest of all time in other ways and so even if they only do 10 episodes and never do it again mission accomplished dude but what I liked about Jordan was that he didn't give a [ __ ] like he cared like you know if you asked Jordan to come on the podcast he'd be like dog that's beneath me like not not a chance and I kind of like that podcast weren't good at the time he went on Oprah and he's smiling and he's you know giving away stuff on Oprah like he did the things that were the equivalent of podcast at the time right like he was very image conscious you know the great quote about Jordan the the the uh they're like will you take a stand politically like you know who do you support for this election and he said Republicans buy shoes too yeah and so he's like I'm not going to comment jack [ __ ] about this because I'm I'm here to sell sneakers it's like all right you know the guy was very image conscious I don't give a [ __ ] about sports but anything LeBron is part of honestly I would listen to it I appreciate like the best talking um exactly there's appreciate greatness also it's just fascinating to see oh that's interesting what would you do if you got the A-list A++ are in their still active in their game to sit down and do a podcast with you what would you do and how would you do it how would you set the vibe oh they're popping wine they're drinking wine because they're both into that but that gives a different casual feel they film in in a certain way as a Content nerd there's a lot to pull from it who's producing it do they own it uh Tommy alter and Jason Gallagher I think is the the producer of it yeah they uh it's like a collab between JJ's media company that he does with Tommy and LeBron's Media Company uninterrupted and so they came together to to create the I mean that's a huge Poll for JJ right oh dude that's like yeah it's like Travis galy dating Taylor Swift or something it's like TR K is great you're one of the great tight ends JJ re was a great basketball player but God damn that's a great pull still yeah that's a good pull um all right is that it is that the Pod yeah that's the Pod all right that's the [Music] pod for

the cold email has done well for you if everyone cold email the ARB would go away but it's just too scary or whatever that people don't do it it's still a huge opportunity I will say like the addendum to that advice is you got to have the goods when you show up for the meeting or the call or whatever the second part is you got to be really good when you show up but if you're good it's just this incredible hidden secret which is there's always a scarcity of talent no matter who you are and how much money you're worth or whatever there's a scarcity of really awesome people and so everyone has an infinite appetite to meet people who are interested talented have a unique view on things and if you can present that you will really go a long way and the downside I can't even remember I'm sure I've sent hundreds that have never been responded to I've never got a bad response it's usually just no response I don't even remember the non-responses but the ones that I've got responses from have been amazing

learned this episode is different now we're asking him if I was doing tiny today how would I do it how can I do the same thing that they did what what businesses would I buy what trends what opportunities does he see and he tells us the same single best investment opportunity he sees today and why he's putting his money behind that so this is a fascinating episode part two with jeremyc Giffin [Music] enjoy so I want to ask you about opportunities so what business opportunities Trends um or ideas do you have that people who are listening can kind of expand their their scope right I remember when I was trying to be on r preneur one of the big big problems I had was I only thought the world was this big tiny little circle and I was only looking for opportunities in inside my tiny Circle and it was only when I listened to podcast and I kind of wish MFM is the podcast I wish existed at the time but it's like only when I would listen to certain people talk or hang out out of dinner I would hear some idea that was not something I'd ever considered so my circle got bigger and bigger and bigger and then the more that Circle got bigger the more opportunities I saw so I want to go through a couple of Trends or opportunities you see so if I told you um what are the juiciest opportunities that you see right now that somebody could uh could do or that you know you think a smart person could go go for the like second most interesting opportunity I what I'd be doing if I wasn't if I wasn't um raising a fund to to do these these buyouts it would be finding people with audiences and either buying businesses for them or building businesses for them so I think that I think it's like a anomaly like a the business is in its toddler stage that the way most people with audiences monetized is through ad reads or sponsorships I think it's kind of like Hollywood when you you know if you're a big star you'd get paid to to hold up a a glass of Coca-Cola or something and I think every um person with an audience will eventually the money that they make from equity in a business that they own will massively dwarf the money that they make from ad rates uh or or sponsorship reads but the big problem here is like generally if you're a great podcaster or content creator the last thing you want to do is buy a business for one like that's risking capital that's hard or even start and run a business and so I think there's a big opportunity to basically build a business around someone with an audience and come to them and say look like I will be the CEO of this thing I think like you know um this is the perfect product for you guys to like really organically use and like and talk about for a long time and I will run it and you know we'll split the equity or something like that um you know Joe Rogan did this with on it and sold that company for for a lot of money and there's other examples Doug deiro with his um cars and bids and people are starting to do this but it's still very early and I think that like if I was just going to start a business denovo I would say okay what's who are content creators that I really like and what is the perfect product for them and then just like make it easy you know it's a pretty lowrisk proposition for you guys for example um but if you do it right like even of an like with an audience of your size you can have nine figure exits you know over four or five years and that'll obviously dwarf all the money you make from advertising if anyone wants to do this Sean sha.com feel free to hit me up by the way this is how Tiny's doing this matina which is the the um the drink they're doing with huberman they bought a yerba mate company and then they he's he loves mate and he's been drinking it for a long time it's the perfect type of product so they did that for him where if huberman was like and now I'm gonna take a break from my science stuff to go become a Searcher and go find a business a PE deal to do like that'd be crazy for him but but tiny doing it makes sense they also did it with James Clear they built the habits right um so so you know another app versus ad read type of thing so I think they're executing on it well this is also how Congo Brands built Prime so they they did Alani new and then they were like okay cool we're going to do Prime they went and pitched Logan Paul and KSI and they were like hey you guys are going to be the promotion engine of this you get Equity um you know significant equity in this and we're going to be the operational back end for this and we know we know how to do this we can build a in their case what's probably going to be A1 Billion Dollar Plus company off that that brand yeah it's it's definitely starting but I think and like the turn group has been very good at it with um you know they did Doug nirro and um Stephen re re Rella with the the hunting stuff and it's definitely starting to happen but I I think like a more you know this is a little bit exaggerated but I think most people in a YC batch could find a podcaster and just say okay you're going to be the audience co-founder for this thing and we're going to give you 30% or something and we're going to work with you and it's going to be a product that you can sell very or organically um and because the broad thesis is that these audiences are still super underpriced basically um that the equity you're giving up is you'll be more than compensative for and I think that'll last for for for quite a long time and the longtail is really good too right like you could do it with a very Niche YouTuber um and and still sell a more expensive product or or or do it multiple times or whatever and I I basically just think everyone with an audience will eventually have some really tightly integrated organic product to sell love it all right so that's a great opportunity which is go find a content creator who's got a like a great audience High trust and basically buy or build the perfect business for them and have them be your audience co-founder I think that's a it's basically really unfair distribution Advantage you could generate for yourself by doing that all right love that what's what's another one one other Trend that I'm just really bullish on is um basically the idea that everything in the modern world is like poison and toxic I live in New York like the air is making me Dumber the water is like ruining my hormones uh all the food that I eat at any restaurant is like full of seed oils and you know everything that I eat is like some combination of soy corn and wheat and the wheat is all sprayed and glycate like just everything is really bad for you but it's like this huge and I'm kind of a freak about it like I have water filters and air filters and buy all the specific food and stuff but it's a it's a really mentally taxing um and I really wish I think it could even just take the form of like the wire cutter but for you know these are products that are not going to kill you and and the thing is it's such a nefarious problem that like it runs the gamut it's like clothes that isn't made out of polyester bedding that isn't bad for you cleaning products like you could do every single thing in the house I would love to have a wire cutter kind of thing which is a great business for just like this is the version of this thing that is not going to kill you um dude check this out so uh go to live- oasis.com I found this website the other day uh my co-workers sent it to me and they say uh do you know what's in your water 90% of the water sources contain toxins microplastics and other contaminants and then they rank which water as in uh the cities but also which water bottles have the water the water brand I see one that I used to have uh it's very bad it says out of 100 it's in the very bad P well that's the thing right even you try you think you've done it and then it turns out the thing you bought doesn't even work like it's very complicated well I and I go to this said like I'm scared because I also see the thing that I have and it says bad and then you click it and they make you pay $5 and this is uh definitely a thing that I purchased recently I'm like [ __ ] I got to see which water bottles like you click one it's like sad horrible I just want like okay like I need a shampoo what is the one that like huberman and AA and Ronda Patrick all agree on and I'll just buy that one you know yeah and that can I think that can exist for almost every every single thing in your house ask Sean why he's drinking that water I know why yeah we we hosted this event this Camp MFM event and it's we do it at Mr Beast house so we're in like remote North Carolina somewhere and we all show up and this billionaire shows up he's got like you know his security guard with him or whatever and I'm just fast I'm like oh how does this guy travel he flew in private he's got a security guard but then the thing that really stood out is he had security guard carries this case of waters so we had Fiji bottles of water which was like it's in plastic and you probably got that cuz you thought being fancy you you wanted to make a good impression be so impressed with my choice here a Fiji like I went I went for it and instead he's got his own like aquapa glass bottles and he was just he'd always be drinking he didn't say anything but I was like hey what are you doing that except except he made the noise whenever you when he when he saw you drinking out of that Jo what you I switched to aquapa for my drinking water for my family I bought an apina showerhead filter so because the other thing is like oh you're drinking one thing but then you'll go shower and bathe your naked body in tap in like the dirtiest tap water with like a 30-year-old you know showerhead in my house and so if afi.com uh I bought a showerhead from there this like filters that water and so I'm just like one by one replacing different parts of my my house to try to try to get rid of some of the the bad stuff yeah the traveling with a crate of mineral water that's a that's a good that's a good way to spend money I like that all right so two good ones I like I like the wire cutter for product don't kill you by the way it's like it's just wire cutter is kind of like value based yeah and in this case it's Health based and I think that's just like a such a simple model that somebody could do it's probably like 10 years of awesome execution and real like love and care like only the right person should start this business it's not like anybody could do it but I do wish somebody did it I mean examine did it really well for supplements like it it certainly can be done it's just I would know I would use it every day hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database or spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show let's do a couple more Trends and opportunities uh you had talked I I asked you a question when we were hanging out uh yesterday which was what are what's a business type that you really love maybe you guys didn't even make an acquisition in the space but like what are categories that you really loved and you mentioned I don't know like a regulation compliance type of category can you explain that one yeah for sure so like anytime a government anywhere introduces some kind of Arcane rule you have to follow like if you don't follow you go to jail it's like the ultimate kind of motivation to buy right and uh sometimes it can be really difficult so you know we looked at a bunch of examples one one was um there's this great company software company in Italy that just did banking regulation for all make sure all the banks are compliant with all these things and that's like an amazing business because first of all you're going long Italian regulation which is probably a great trade in of itself like in the future Italy is going to have more rules than it does today and then aside from that like a bank is not going to rip that out ever and it's you know it hits that golden criteria which is it's relatively cheap but Mission critical that's like a really great one um and there's a bunch of these there's all these you know for buying a house for um for vetting tenants for um kyc and AML um uh if you if you start looking for it dayto day you see it a lot like I just rented a car and there's like a process there where they check my license against some database and I'm sure that's a piece of software like those are great because I love it because it's like a low lift and the downside is super high and you don't really want to mess with it once you've got it working um and the other interesting thing about them is that exists for every country at least every Western Country and so you can go find the software that does that for you know Europe or or one specific country or whatever and there's going to be multiple versions of those even Canada like Canada has different rules than America and so it's either it's you know two different software products or two different companies so love I love those those businesses as well and they're also like fairly AI resilient I think because it's really again it's like medical stuff it's really high downside so you don't want to like trust it with AI and then it turns out you weren't in compliance and you're gonna get a huge fine or go to prison or something yeah I uh I made a bet recently in the regul a Regulatory Compliance uh type of space and I was like you know we have this thing on the Pod that we talk about one chart businesses which is like a business that you don't need a full business plan for you could just put one chart up on the screen and you say that's why I'm doing this and um the one in this case was basically that regulation only goes in One Direction it only goes up and the right nobody ever rolls back any of these needs it's only going to increase and so if you could become you know maybe the go-to provider or like a keys piece of software in a space like that is it is just such a bet such a bet you want to make because you know that regulation only goes up you know that like these compliance compliance requirements they don't just say yeah you know what forget them we don't need all that compliance stuff anymore like this is never going to happen it's only going to go in One Direction and like you said you do it or you don't get customers or you get go to jail it's like well it's a pretty strong motivator so like you know I think people are going to want to either get customers or avoid jail and um it's just like the right type of space to be and it's the type of space that 24y old me would not have known or appreciated that that's a better business to go into than what I was doing at that time which was like dating app social network like cool new sexy you know thing and uh now I'm like it's kind of like what's sexy now is like a knee length skirt it's like uh you know show me a compliance business and I I'll show you my interest the other big opportunity for someone who who's wanting to start a business is like you can front run these things right you can see what's gonna pass you can see what's just passed and you can be the first provider for that and have a huge leg up especially if it's a fairly Niche thing you could very well be the only option for a couple of years which is a huge Advantage right why don't you start these things instead of just investing in them I don't uh I don't like operating businesses I'm not I don't think I'm very good at it and it's not what I enjoy doing and so I think everyone should try and do like really stay in their zone of Genius as much as they can I think that it's like personally very good and also good for the world if that happens and so I'd rather like be allocate Capital to the because I think I'm good at allocating Capital to the person who maybe needs capital and is really excited about building something all right two more things on here the first I I actually don't have context on this but I'm very interested just because the title The Boy versus the guy yeah so the boy versus the guy so um it could go a bunch of ways it could go a bunch of ways yeah there and and there are a lot of different readings especially depending on what Co Coast you're on um yeah basically it's it's like it's the idea of uh being a lieutenant or being like a Proteg√© effectively would be the the the classier way to say it I guess um and so you know in generally there's like there's the trusted Lieutenant who is um you know just the solid number two really important but their whole identity is being like a lieutenant to the number one person and then there's this other genre which is like um on the west coast it takes shape as a chief of staff a lot um where it's just you're kind of this like you're this young Rising Superstar there's the sense of like you're really gunning for number one um and and the idea like the the what made me notice this um originally was especially in the valley every like billionaire has one or two really young smart boys generally who just kind of like float around them and there's this kind of task agreement of like you come work for me for two three years you Shadow me you you you're my apprentice and then I will back you and like open doors for you um and it was kind of funny like at at some point you know I was in like social situations where it's like oh like it's kind of like flying under the the flag of a lord or something like everyone is you know the everyone is like you know going on the private jets of these principles or whatever and they themselves are probably broke but like they very much live this lifestyle because they're like under the protection of a lord um and so I think it's like there there's another a new kind of piece of information that I've figured out about this is it's also an age Gap thing so if you're within 20 years of the founder or the number one person in the organization you're almost always going to be a guy um and if you think of like all the great firms or even you know companies where someone has become the new number one there's almost always at least a 20-year gap between the person just because otherwise you're too close and so I think that dictates it a lot as well um but it's these two different things of the other way to put it would be that like the principal really sees something in this young person and wants to you know can tell they're like on a rocket ship they're not going to be an employee forever or whatever but it's like you give me two or three years and I can really accelerate things for you and I think like that pairs very nicely with the cold email thing which is um you know I generally think like if you want to start a company you should just start a company don't go like work somewhere to get experience or whatever but I think this might be the sole exception which it can really open doors of either investment or vouching or connections or whatever and you know there's lots of examples of this like um uh I know like Ben cocha like very wrote very publicly about being Reed Hoffman's Chief of Staff um you know Blake masters with Peter teal um uh you know Sam Alman was this to Paul Graham like there's there's kind of all these examples of it um that I think are are really instructive I just recorded an episode with Joe lale who was this for Peter teal like yeah it was basically Peter Teal's prote and now has started I don't know more billion dollar companies than anyone else um in the country and I think you know he's a fascinating guy because when he was 18 1920 he was an intern at PayPal he then he was at Peter's family office then he started paler with him and then you know then eventually you know went on to do his own thing and Joe's done this for a bunch of people um one of my close friends was was his his chief one of his chief of staffs and it's an amazing launching pad and if anyone out there I'm looking for a boy uh never thought I'd say that but under this context I am sure sure enough looking for a young boy so we need to start a we need to start a community we'll call it a weed weed them boys uh I don't know you know this but I've had four people who are kind of in bucket I I hired them when they're let's say between the ages of 16 to 20 and uh that have gone on to either become you know that have gone on to become Millionaires and in some cases Millionaires and like successful content creator podcaster type of folks as well and it's happened four times already so I'm looking for my fifth yeah I think apprenticing is really underrated you know you think about it in the context of being like a blacksmith or a carpenter or something but I think for a lot of these things it's the single best way to learn hey I've got a question I noticed that you studied do you study philosophy at Columbia yeah that so I remembered as a kid I I saw this crazy stat that um I think it was the majority of people who scored really high on uh not the bar but the test to get into law school um they actually most of them uh the elsat most of them were uh they studied philosophy that was their their undergraduate degree and then I saw you studied philosophy and that's kind of an interesting way to go because now you're raising this massive 100 million plus fund um did that what did you learn in philosophy that you think is going to help you make a good business person yeah I don't know it's it's uh there's a big it's a big Club you know uh leave it to a philosophy major I know every philosophy major but um there's tons of names you know Reed Hoffman Peter teal Peter Fenton um Stuart Butterfield it's like this weirdly over represented thing my favorite stat about philosophy ma Majors is that um it's something like in the top 10% of earners they're the highest earning of all people so if you take the top 10% of every major they're the highest earning and General they're not the highest earning but like there's that kind of like group at the far end I don't know exactly what it is I mean I I can speak to my own experience I think it's just like if you're gonna spend four years thinking about a set of questions thinking about the most fundamental questions is just really appealing that's certainly what it was to me I don't think I really learned anything um that's super it's it's funny like you know uh I'm Canadian I had to get a visa to be in America and uh a big thing thing with visas is like is what you studied relevant to what you're working on and you know the answer for philosophy as far as the US government is concerned is no it's not relevant to anything but I'm always like well no it's relevant to everything it's like how should I live what should I you know what should I hope for what can I know these are relevant to every field um and I I think maybe the other way maybe the other cut at it is it's just like being interested in the most fundamental and the most abstract versus like learning uh you know something more applied something about that just kind of draws these very kind of curious uh I I guess like intellectual and I don't really mean that in a complimentary way just like people who think like to think a lot um but there's also a big difference between people who study philosophy and undergrad and then move on and people who study Philosophy for their whole lives like those people are really people who just like they thought they they think like you know what I actually want to think about like what is a good way to live for the rest of my life and I think that's a little crazy right like at some point you want to go okay I've like explored this now it's time to go go move on I wanted to ask you about um hold codes which seem to be the new trend or people buying businesses I think a lot of them take inspiration from Tiny and what you guys did what's your take on you know the hold code Trend or influencers out there who are like I own 500 businesses you know like what what's your take on all that bragging about how many businesses you own is really weird and probably like a contra signal to how good you are um and by the way like anyone who owns a lot of businesses will will and should tell you that like I know Andrew would certainly if you know if he could have tiny with one business that would be much better um and so it's always a weird thing to say like oh I've acquired 100 businesses or whatever um I guess unless you're like um a constellation or Shore Capital or something where the whole point of it is that you like buy a million businesses um because yeah it's always better if you could have the results from one company that would be way better than than having to own a bunch of them and that leads to the point about holding companies which is the thing that people don't understand about holding companies there's two like there's two real reasons why you would start a holding company versus a fund or some other structure one is because you want to hold everything forever and I think that's a fairly faulty premise so usually when people think because so people look at generally they're looking at two places when they think about the merits of holding everything forever they look at Buffett or they look at Venture capis um you know you don't want to be the person who sold Google at the IPO or whatever and and bu famously owns everything although that's not actually true Buffett sells stuff all the time um to your point Sam about him being a little bit different than his public Persona um but like okay so both of those groups Buffett is talking about railroads and insurance companies and energy companies these are companies that ostensibly will exist for 50 or 100 years and Venture capitalists even more than that they are looking specifically to find the one in a thousand company that will be a 50-year company but most companies are not 50-year companies especially not $5 million software companies you know like it's it's kind of crazy to buy a chrome plugin and say like yeah I need to own this thing for 40 years it's like no it's first of all like software is really difficult my kids will inherit this chrome plugin yeah you're not buying one of two railroads in Canada you know like you're you're buying a chrome plugin and so um first of all just thinking like oh I need to hold this forever I think is a bit flawed and then second of all if you get the chance to sell it for a great price like that is probably the way that you maximize returns um if you're actually interested in just making the most money and so that's one thing with holding companies um the other is that I think when the more investory type start them they really don't appreciate a holding company is part of it is your Holdings the other half is a company like you just run a big operating business you know tiny has I can't remember it's like north of 1,00 employees across the portfolio like that's a big business that you're running and for most inv s that is a completely Contra skill like if you're a good investor the last thing you should be doing when you meet a great investor you're not thinking oh you'd be a great as the CEO of a 1200 person company you know like generally those are very far apart and so what can end up happening is you spend a ton of your time actually just operating a business and you're not able to invest which is the thing that you're probably the best at and so yeah in general I think they're quite they're quite overrated and you also actually said you're like most Harvard guys who are trying to buy a plumbing business they shouldn't buy a plumbing business they should just go and start a plumbing business business yeah this one always cracks me up it's like your resume is you know Harvard Goldman Sachs Harvard Business School Bridgewater and then it's like Ohio plumbing company and you're always I always think like I get it I I you know the math works it can be lucrative whatever but I always think like imagine if you had you know you're This brilliant young person if you had just moved to Ohio when you were 18 and started a plumbing company you'd probably control all the plumbing in the state you know what I mean like you just wipe the floor with them and it's always weird that people want to go through all these Loops I think a lot of it is just to make themselves feel very fancy like oh you know I set up this deal this acquisition these investors and stuff but a lot of these businesses I think if you just started them you could really wipe the floor with with the existing competition uh you have one more thing that you're known for which is something like the pre and postf I don't know what this is can you explain this somebody texted me this they go oh you got to ask them about pre and postf fall so I Define fall it's like a pseudo biblical idea but I really Define it as like a period in your life where you've really been brought to your knees by whatever it could be a death or a breakup or you know a health scare or or or bankruptcy or all these kinds of things that like really just kind of humble you um truly not like how most people say humbled which is like oh I just got on the cover of Forbes I'm so humble it's like no it's actually the exact opposite um but like truly truly humbled uh and I really think that that changes someone um for the rest of their life and I think it happens to everyone I think it happens totally at random times it could be early in life it could be late in life um but you can just kind of see it of you know the the the extreme example of this would be like a a veteran who's been in a lot of combat like nothing is really gonna shake someone who's been in a bunch of firefights you know and um and I think that applies too as if you've been through really hard really dark experiences I think a lot of entrepreneurs they have their fall while they're building business you know it can get really difficult and hard and lonely and um yeah the best way to describe it is like after when someone's postf you can just kind of see it in their eyes that they've been through worse and so they're not gonna it's just not going to shake them that much versus someone who's pre-fall and by the way you can become very successful you can be late in life but nothing bad has ever really happened to you and and I view that as kind of a liability in some sense of if you're going to partner or work with them of like boy like when something goes off the rails here this might be a really big blow up because of course like you know if you're a broke kid it's one thing but if you're like a high-flying person the way in which you can blow up is far more spectacular and um and yeah it's really just like have you really been humbled by life in like a true way and uh and I think when you look at it that way it's quite evident that you know people either have or haven't and I think it makes a big difference do you want to talk about the special situations distressed Venture stuff or uh or do you want to to save that uh yeah we can we can talk about that okay tell us what what is the what is what is the opportunity here yeah so the opportunity is this is like really combines a lot of the factors that I love which is effectively there's this whole class of venture back companies where they rais too much money um in especially in 20 and 21 and so you get this like strange phenomenon where you can have a business that's doing $10 million a year of Revenue and growing 30% a year but maybe it raised or $50 million and um such that like the founder is probably not going to make any money because the pref sack is so high and then the the other part is the investor is really not going to make any money not in the sense that they want to so a venture investor they like they want a good investment to return the fund um generally and so it's like this weird thing where you have this great asset you know if if if you guys owned a business that was doing 10 million of Revenue growing 30% a year you'd be very happy with that but if it's owned by Venture investor and run by a Founder who's got this pref stack the founder is not going to make any money The Venture investor doesn't really care about it so it's kind of this like in some sense it's actually a worthless asset and so um you know we've done these deals at tiny before and and what I'm really interested in is doing a lot more of them personally and so I've been talking to a lot of Founders and talking to a lot of GPS about this and there's just this huge opportunity and the opportunity is really um to take a business that's because of its cap table it's just broken it's not working for anyone and turn it into a business that works so like say the founder owns 10% and you know the prep stack is 50 million turn it into a business where they own 30% and they can run it profitably and it can be like a great business a question that I always ask Founders is what would you do if you just bootstrap this thing or if you own the whole thing and generally that's a different answer than if they were in their current situation um and it's a service for the G uh Venture investors as well because they you know they have to be responsible for these things they got to go on the board they got to audit them they got to think about them a lot of these companies take up a lot of their time and they're not the ones that are going to drive returns and so it's just this weird kind of vestage of the fact that Venture returns have been so high that there's all this waste like there's these 10 20 $30 million year companies that are not really making money for anyone and this this weird situation right because um there's nothing wrong with the business but you can get them for cheaper than you would otherwise because there's this like weird second and third order incentive set normally a distressed business the business is broken yeah exactly it's that the cap table is broken that the the goals of the investors don't line up with the realities of the business is that right exactly exactly is that what you're going to do yeah that's um I love special situations I like all different types you know I think when tiny when tiny started bootstrap businesses were kind of a special situation um and now it's way more popular and I view this a special situation is a really nice way to I love a good special situation I mean that's that's a better way totally special situations has a lot nicer to distress asset yeah yeah yeah yeah for for sure but it's it's like it's like this idea of oh there's all these people that want different things and if you can just like arrange the bricks so to speak that everyone gets what they want you can like unlock this puzzle and like with what I'm doing everyone is better off the VCS are happy the founder is happy like everyone's better off um and I love those I love those situations when you can do them and then it also to go back to our like initial thing it's a very specific thing so you're going to come to me because you know that's what I do and I'm going to get stuff that other people don't get because I'm doing this very specific thing and I I for my particular form of laziness I love it when people just know what I offer and then they just come to me it makes things so much so much easier than having to go to them and convince them to do something you know it seems like you are like me which I love because I like people like me but it's also it's also rare you remind me of myself I I think that's why I love you you're great cuz I see part of me and you but um it's the opposite of what most people come on the podcast and say most people come on the podcast and say you got to work super hard hard work is everything and both me and you were like we asked a different question which like how can I be lazy and win the most and uh we're like yeah I I take pride in a certain form of laziness I'm going to be super active in one area but I I absolutely reject a certain type of sweat um that's how I think about it do you think about it the same way yeah totally I I another like archetype I have of this is like you can divide the world into the um into the you know the Arnold Schwarzenegger kind of type and then maybe the the Sam Alman type and it's not to say that Sam Alman doesn't work hard and Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't smart they are both examples of doing both of course but like you know Schwarzenegger it's all literally like in the biography it's about like laying more bricks like lifting more days more hours it's just grinding and when he becomes an actor it's like more auditions more movies more practice versus maybe someone who like Alman who like found this big opportunity and like was really early on it was really clever about how he set it up and everything and it's more about making these like moves and probably like Yan like I I find there's a certain Elegance in um in doing things with like the least amount of moves and other people aren't like that like Sam I I bet you're probably more like people who work really hard grind it out like put in the hours I know you love Shackleton I think shackleton's a lot like this like just like out work everyone else and you're acting like you don't likee you looked around like I don't know but you are like that you're like hard equals good because hard means I'm hard whereas I'm like easy equals good because it means that I'm clever right uh it's like you admire a different attribute no yeah I mean there's value I think in just sweating sometimes like uh you know I think that sometimes because a thing is hard therefore it is good for you I definitely believe that but I mean I only work like 40 hours a week I work a normal Work Week um but uh yeah I mean I I fall a little bit in the middle I do think that like just doing a hard thing for the sake of it being hard there is like some type of like Divine goodness within that yeah and you got to do both like there there's you know for the lazy person there's periods of really hard work and and vice versa but uh but I think when people say they don't work hard and they still like achieve greatness I think they're full of [ __ ] like Sean you say that you are lazy dude you'll he'll he'll text me a paragraph like a book at like 10 p.m. like you're still doing [ __ ] you're just laying on the couch while your wife is watching TV and you're on your phone uh you know you're not at a desk I view laziness as not that you don't do anything it's that you don't do things you don't want to do um I just do all the things I want to do at full force because that's how I because I like them I want to do them I just don't do a lot of things that I don't want to do I I I'm very selective or um cheap about how much effort I'm willing to put into things that I don't actually want to do and I'm willing to be lazy on those right it's kind of like the definition of work versus play work is you know work is how do you define work one way of defining work is it's the stuff that you don't want to do voluntarily uh and play is the stuff that you do want to do voluntarily and I just opt into a lot more of play than I think most people do um and I'm I'm I have a lower tolerance for work that I don't want to do than I would say the the average successful person and the reason I like Jeremy coming on is because it's cool to see examples of a different play style because we've seen a bunch of the other play style because it gets a lot of it sounds amazing the David goggin they work harder grind more show up early leave late you know like that I get that that's a cool play style it's just not what everybody wants to do it's so I like hearing other play Styles yeah I mean Sam you're you're definitely right like I'm sure I I do a bunch of stuff that I'm not even just that I'm working a lot harder than other people because it it just feels innate but I think like another way to look at it is there's certainly type of person who the way you soothe yourself so like some people will just soothe themselves by putting in way more hours like you know working on that like diminishing marginal return piece of like oh I just put in a few more hours on this and other people I think it's like I just got to figure out the exact right thing to do here like what is the exact right move and you spend all your time thinking about that you guys want to do a 50- mile race with me in August dude I've been training for this thing and I had to run 10 miles on Sunday and I haven't ran that far in forever and I'm just like depleted so you want to come work hard come come join this race with me yeah that's probably a good one everyone who loves like the super endurance stuff is probably a grinder at heart because it's just like about if I do so much of this it'll just be better than everyone else it sucks I just dude so when we were in Austin last week we were hanging out with um do you know Isaiah photo you know who that is Sam no no I don't he's a YouTuber who lives in Austin and he's got probably like 10 Mill million YouTube subscribers and um if you go look at like what are his popular videos or like what kind of was his break he would do stuff like these Challenge videos these kind of like grind videos counting to 100,000 like that he's like how I will lick this jawbreaker as many times it takes till the jawbreaker disappears how many licks does it take uh he'll hold a lighter on and he'll be like how long till this lighter just goes out like how much lighter food is in this how long does that last it's like 100 million views or whatever people love this [ __ ] uh it's like you know to his credit he found what people wanted and he gives it to him at the same time I'm like oh man I'd shoot myself if I had to do that because that's not that's not a path that's very appealing to me but that same personality I'm like oh what do you do for fun outside of youtubing um and he was like oh I love running same thing I'm like oh God what's the deal with you Runners he's like oh yeah I really want to run I want to start a run Club I love running and I'm like if somebody told me yo you got to run today they just said Sean you got a bad day today and I'm not trying to be a runner but there's so many successful people that love love running and that that there's like a really high correlation there on the other hand I went did a podcast with um monish PAB Jeremy I assume you know him because yeah Andrew told me he's like he was my first value investing man crush and um this episod was great monish is that the first time you've done that when's the last time you did that that years ago when I met my wife it sounds like you've got practice Yeah EX exactly um and he was like yeah I take a nap every day he's like a good year is I make one or two Investments which is like literally clicking a button it's not even like he runs a company he's like buying a public stock and he's not even buying he's not day trading he's not analyzing everything he's like one or two good investments in a year would be a fantastic year and he reads and he chills and I was like man the both guys I would say are winning they're winning at their craft like to have 10 million YouTube subscribers is phenomenal he's built a wonderful life for himself and the other guy you know is a phenomenal value investor but the lifestyle and the the things that they value are so different um you know one guy maybe has a stomach losing $75 million of net worth in a day and he's got to be cool with that and the other guy's got a stomach waking up tomorrow and being like how do I come up with the next crazy video and it was really remarkable to see that so you know I think Jeremy you were talking about like you know you sort of pick your prison in a way yeah um I'm assuming you've sort of seen these different games that people play and decided which one is appealing to you it's funny I guys like monish are like I call them the nap room guys like there's a whole set of value investers that have a like a room he showed me he's like this is my nap room he opened it up I was like this is amazing is that a thing nap room guys yeah there I I've met at least like three or four different value investors like that who like they have a place to nap I want to ask you about that same idea but in a different way um so I'm going to give you my observation and I want you to I I want to know if you have any specific story that that line up with this so my observation we we talked about does Andrew grind uh right he comes on here he acts super Zen super calm super philosophical he wants to be like Warren Buffett he's playing bridge half the day he's reading and then once or twice a year he just blesses us with a beautiful investment right um but you know one thing I have seen Andrew do is he may not work super super hard but he works very fast he is incredible at sniffing out opportunities he is incredible at fast follow-ups um he moves really quickly when he's excited about something that's the first thing I noticed um the second thing I noticed about Andrew is not only does he move really fast when he's excited about an opportunity he'll just keep texting you about it or he'll keep prodding until he finds out more information he'll he'll fly to meet you right away but he also will will be persistent so like I think with some of the businesses it's like yeah I used to I love that business so I emailed him every month for like five years and then finally one month they were like yeah I willing to sell the business um and I think that was the case for maybe letter box or dribble where he was just emailing the founder continuously Aro press same thing he was just emailing the guy like hey yeah have you thought about selling this month hey have you thought about selling this month some version of that question hanging around the hoop in fact when we sold the milk Road same thing happened we tried to sell the business we walked away from these guys at the last minute and if I'm them I'm like oh hate the you know hate those guys screw them well let's let's kill those guys and instead they were super professional about it they were like okay no problem like sounds like you have you want to go different direction they hung around the hoop a month later he says hey I didn't see any announcement like No Deal went through um and we were like no you know we decided not to do it for this and this reason he's like well we're still interested and he I was like wow that was so different than how I I would I would have done that so we made it a practice for us whenever we're buying businesses it's like uh a don't get personally offended when it happens and B we schedule the automated reminder a month or three months later let's just follow back up and just make sure that we check in and say hey is there still an opportunity here we still like the business we liked it then we like it more now you know like if there's if there's still an opportunity to let us know that that idea of hanging around the hoop are there any other stories either on Andrews moving fast and or being persistent and just following up over and over again that you remember yeah I mean on the fast thing it it's annoying but it's true the the most successful people in the world respond instantly I cannot believe it's kind of infuriating how true it is but uh when you email the billionaire CEO it's like a 30- second response and when you email his vice president it's you know it can be a week or something that is just so true and um I I I really try and force myself to respond fast I I wrote this little script for for Gmail that um it archives my email every 24 hours so I like have to respond or it just disappears and I feel like it's a really good nudge of like just send send the simpler text message like response um and Andrew is like super super high paced really energetic uh the thing that comes to mind is when you're at you know lunch or whatever with him if he thinks of someone you should meet he will pull out his phone and like send the intro email before you've even like finished the sentence and um it's good and bad like sometimes you're like wait like I don't want to meet that person or whatever but but it's also just this like if you think about in terms of iterations it's so many more iterations of just making something happen and also like movement especially when you're an operator movement creates information like you learn more by doing more things and so it's a really powerful combo and then yeah in terms of following up um I think just being a little Andrew used to call it like being Dennis the Menace like just after just being a little bit more willing to just kind of like poke your head in even when it might be a little like um you know go or or whatever can be really can really be really powerful it's kind of that just like hey like you still interested in selling you still interested in selling you still interested in selling that Den to Menace bit that's a good one that's a good one that's a good one and he's willing to be the Menace more than most people like he's he is willing to he does menace like people do say You're menacing me stop it but it also like really pays off because just like uh you know it's and if you think about it it's like okay fine like who's that guy who emails me every three months like maybe you had a bad day or you're done with the business or whatever and you're like all right I guess I'll like see what that guy has to say you know um and uh yeah it's it's incredibly it's incredibly powerful and and more people should do it and just generally be less afraid of like I learned this doing a lot of cold email for sales um you know if you send out a thousand cold emails you're going to get one or two responses that are just someone's going ballistic like if you email me again I'll sue you or whatever you know but the other 998 it's like either positive or no response or neutral and it's just like all upside basically all right so I want to shift gears to what I call the spicy hot take Section the semi-rs opinion section if this was if we were in a club right now this is that part where the DJ starts like the Beats about to drop and we all know things are about to get a little little crazy a little fun uh that's what's about to happen in this podcast okay so here's the first prompt I'm just gonna prompt you and then I want you to kind of give us your rant on it first prompt is about Mr Beast which is that Mr Beast shouldn't be selling chocolate bars uh what should Mr Beast be doing instead of selling chocolate bars yeah I mean I think it's a testament to how valuable audiences are that all the most valuable businesses that have been created are like the worst businesses chocolate bars supplements um merch that kind of stuff like these are really bad businesses um and so I I always think okay what happens if feals is the most successful like Creator brand what happens when that is um you know a really good business uh a bank or like a great software tool or something like that explain why is chocolate bars or Prime from Logan Paul why are those bad businesses because somebody might say oh they're doing hundreds of millions of Revenue or they're they're going to sell for a billion dollars like but but you're saying bad business as a characteristic uh like the underlying fundamentals of that category so explain that yeah there the reason like you can still be to be clear you can still be very successful selling chocolate bars like Hugh kitchen is one of my favorite companies and Jason karp is like chocolate and I know he's very successful with that but it's it's it's kind of that thing of like you know is it a restaurant or is it a uh you know a SAS company like there's levels of difficulty basically and so you know there's just business businesses like if you contrast extremes so a chocolate bar low margin not a repeat customer uh not a like super um necessary product or anything like that versus say you know something really low on the stack like uh home insurance or property insurance or something or or um or Visa or Mastercard or like something that you need every day like there's just better qualities of businesses and then the other way you can think about it is what would be the like enduring Enterprise value of the business without the person so Feast Vols is going to have a way harder time without Mr Beast than you know um if he built a bank right if the bank had hundreds of thousands of customers or whatever ostensibly he could go away from that it might make the business grow slow or whatever but it's still like a really great great business and so I actually view it as very like it's very bullish for the creators it's very bullish for the space it's kind of like you're making it work on hard mode and and I wonder what it looks like when it's kind of on easy mode all right next one net worth is a silly metric so why is net worth silly and what's a a better metric instead you told me something about like kind of personal cash flow or something like that is is a better metric yeah yeah I mean so my like my other line on this is billionaire is a state of mind because the amount of billionaires first of all it's like it's so [ __ ] because it's it's always unless it's either like you have this in cash or it's your shares in a public company it's always a complete matter of taste you know it's like well my company would be worse a billion if it were to sell um and and even in public companies it's not even real because most of the time if you own a ton of the public company if you were to dump it all it would massively you know drop the price and so I really think like it's kind of this thing one it's more like this mimic label once you get labeled a billionaire it kind of just sticks and people just refer to it like I see this a lot also people people use it as a way to describe someone who just kind of H is in a certain class I actually think it's more of a class marker than anything like you know lives a certain lifestyle he hangs out with a certain people he's like a billionaire it really has nothing to do with with whether or not you actually have a billion dollars or you own something worth a billion dollars and the other um the other is yeah like cash like liquidity is so crazy the amount of people billionaires i' that when you're like okay could you wire me a 100 Grand tomorrow the answer is no like it's like I've been shocked by this over and over and over wait explain that more what do you mean so people who you have read about saying no because they don't want to wire you $100,000 it's it's it's definitely it's definitely is that the can you wire me a 100 no no it broke but no like people people don't keep a lot of cash uh and and it it really is like one way to look at this uh is in like a party seed round or whatever I'm always shocked by like who doesn't wire the money or you have to chase them down or whatever and or they have to wire it in tranches or anything like that like and I think it's just that cash flow is so far from net worth um and then and and so like and you had like you had sorry go ahead Sean what Sam we have a funny experience with this we were at a lunch with somebody and you were asking them you're like what level of money made a difference like what's the next level of unlock and like he said company for this much like you know you said a number that was like a net worth number and he's like yeah that was a good number um you know when I was doing that every year then blah blah you were like wait annual link you were like annual cash flow was that because I was kind of saying the whole net worth and he and he was like yeah that's what I was doing in annual cash flow and it was very clear that if you had that much an annual cash flow you essentially had infinite money yeah well it was like uh we were like I think 25 is like a good number and he goes yeah I agree having that come in every year is awesome and I was like oh yeah I literally like in the booth of the restaurant just down to the bottom I was under the table and I was just like oh what's down here I me you and and did I read that you tried to create some kind of like equivalent uh like like a chart of cash flow to Networth yeah yeah I thought a lot about this so so part of that is is talking about one like weird thing about tiny is I've probably talked to three or 4 thousand bootstrapped entrepreneurs and um The Vibes that they give off like I don't know I've met a handful of billion dollar net worth Founders and The Vibes between them and someone who makes you know $10 million a year from their Chrome Plug-In or whatever very different um and and there's something about like just how free they feel when they have that cash flow coming in because there's two things one is like maybe the net worth never actually translates into Cash um a very funny thing is like all the all the Silicon Valley guys are really when like behind closed doors are really um envious of the New York hedge fund guys cuz they're so liquid like they might not actually be as Rich per se but they're so they make so much cash that it's like it may as well be a whole different thing um how much do the hedge fund guys make in New York yeah this is another hot take which is I always when I started getting interested in making money it was like the most common thing you hear is you cannot get rich on a salary like you got to own Equity you got to own a business in New York there are lots of guys lots of guys making 510 million there's people making 100 million I've met one guy at a big head as what as like a like a portfolio manager like a bonus yeah there's there's there's at least one guy out there who like makes a billion dollars in in annual compensation um but what's normal like let's say you're you're you're hanging out with your New York Finance friends it varies it varies a lot uh but in a good year like an analyst at a big hedge fund will make three to five million do um and in a really good year it can be a lot more than that because usually it's a it's a percentage and um you know like being being a senior person at a big fund or whatever you make a lot of money and you kind of take no risk in some very real sense um and so I think like that was certainly certainly surprising to me and yeah just to like come back to the cash flow thing I certainly like Andrew was always such a cash flow person and and really like in Canada at the time like there was just no funding so you just had to live or die off cash flow and it's it's I think it's more instructive to think about money in terms of in terms of cash flow because the other thing is when you have a net worth like say you sell your business and you just have a bunch of cash even if like psychologically Sam I know you're big on the like money psychology stuff the idea that you're living off a fixed or finite amount just really changes how you view things even if it's a ton of money versus this idea of like I make you know whatever $100,000 a month or whatever just the idea that it just comes in it like well dude our um me and Sean have this good friend who sold a business and he walked away with $60 million and I go that that feels awesome he goes it feels horrible man I go why he goes I'm a brown immigrant I need cash flow if I don't have cash flow I feel broke I need money coming in every month I can't spend this I think we should wrap it up uh Jeremy where should people find you if they want to get more of you follow you become big fans of you where should they go uh Twitter Jeremy gefon my DMs are open um yeah that's the best place awesome thanks for doing it man really fun hanging than guys that's the pod [Music] come on

all right I've been chasing this guest today for six months begging him to come on the podcast because I heard him on a podcast last year and as much as this breaks my heart to say it that was my favorite business podcast of the year and it wasn't even our own but he was so good that I asked him to come on his name is Jeremy gon he is um he was the first employee at tiny which you've ever listened to the podcast we've had Andrew Wilkinson on many many times they basically turned $5 million of starting money into about $500 million of equity just by buying businesses that cash flow so they bought you know small businesses that cash flowed kept recycling recycling recycling over 10 years turned into 500 million so I wanted to ask him uh what was it like in the early days what were those first deals like he was there before they even had a name before they were even called tiny so we asked him about his best deals his worst deals the weirdest deals he's ever done negotiating T tactics he learned this episode is amazing it's a 10 out of 10 for me um enjoy this episode with Jeremy what's up Jeremy welcome to the show we figure we've uh we've had your mentor on enough times now Andrew he's probably the the most popular guest on the show uh enough of Andrew we got to go to his Pro we got to go to the Young Gun who was there from the beginning and uh and have you on welcome to welcome to the show man thanks for having me guys let's put tiny into context because I think maybe somebody listening to this doesn't doesn't actually appreciate what we're talking about tiny the simple story of tiny is um they had a Services business an agency and then they had excess profits and I think you can correct me if I'm wrong but I think the numbers were something like they took five or six million dollar of initial initial equity and they put that into tiny and we're like okay we're going to go try to buy a business with this and they've ended up turning five or six million of initial startup Capital into roughly A500 $600 million public company where they own you know tiny owns maybe a portfolio of 30 businesses or something like that over over roughly uh 10ish year yeah eighty year period so kind of amazing in eight years turn $5 million into $500 million like okay I'm I'm doing round math here fuzzy fuzzy numbers but first of all is that the is that the right math is that roughly the right story and um and then you know walk us through the beginning days of that because you were there at the very beginning at 19 20 years old employee kind of number one there uh walk us through that yeah so I I knew Andrew because when he was starting metalab and I was working on another startup um we shared the same studio apartment our office was in a studio apartment and uh he was in like the bedroom area and we were in the the kitchen and we would keep a keep a blowup mattress in case the fire guy came around and we would just say oh you know Andrew lives here but just have a lot of friends over uh you know working on stuff um and yeah I mean effectively like metalab the store the short version is metal lab you know was throwing off a fair amount of free cash flow I think it was in that range of you know low Millions a year year and the idea was just to go use that free cash flow to buy buy a business and you know um that's the thing with agencies right like there's not a lot of reinvestment so you got to do something with the cash and if you're not going to put in the S&P like that's too boring or whatever then you got to figure out something to do with it um and so that's that's kind of what we did it's funny like people a lot of people hold codes and stuff are really popular now and people you know a lot of people ask how do I build tiny effectively and the first step is like well you know bootstrap a business that makes millions of dollars of free cash flow and then like get back to me the the rest is like pretty easy and that's the first start and you said it took eight years in reality I think metalab uh the agency that was already eight years older I don't I don't know what it was but it yeah that's right metalab was probably 15 16 years old now so it was a long a long slug I mean Andrew just started really young it was also one thing that's really helpful is Andrew and Chris and myself I mean we were all big users and fans of dribble um and uh and we Andrew really had that company in mine for a long time which I think is another really nice thing to have like it's very good to start with a deal even when like even when you're fundraising or whatever to to actually have a concrete thing that you want to go do and use that as the jumping off point for you know building whatever it is I think it's always so much better to have that than to kind of be like abstractly Oh I'm gonna start a fund or I'm gonna start a holding company or whatever um and so it was like dribble is really cool uh we would love to we would be the right owners for that uh Andrew knew the co-founders there and maybe we could buy that and that would be a starting off point and it's all very like real and concrete versus the we're going to build a holding company of Technology businesses or something like that now you're three guys who've never bought a business before take me back to you're sitting in the the kitchen or whatever of your apartment sloff hangout Lounge uh are you guys like hey can we like buy like buying Businesses for Dummies like how did you even figure out how to do it and also if this was a good idea because it's a big risk right I think you know probably four five million bucks of equity went into that deal that's like kind of like that's a big deal that's not like a couple hundred grand uh at that stage so like what were those conversations like at the beginning as much as best as you can remember yeah I mean it was you know like anything there's generally one way that you can categorize sellers it's people who care about what happens to the business after they sell it and people who don't and um certainly for people who care it's a lot about it's this huge trust exercise of you know are you going to screw up my baby like in their case they've been working on it for a really long time their names were very attached to it there was a big community community businesses are really difficult you know the community can really turn on you fast um and so yeah there's that whole piece and then mechanically yeah it was literally like I don't think we even had a book we just looked it up online like I would literally go on legal Depot and like get a Loi off there and edit it and you know for the first few deals like you know I was 1920 and Andrew would be like can you go get a Loi for this and I didn't know what that was we just go download one and write it up and it's interesting because one thing that we didn't like this is an example of just the benefit of not having a lot of experience typically when you do an Loi it's pretty far along in the process um and we would just fire them out because we read them and in an Loi the only thing that's binding usually is the exclusivity and nothing else not the price or anything else and so we thought okay like this is a totally non-binding thing so let's just like Chuck it out there it's nice to have something on a piece of paper it's kind of like a term sheet um although even term sheets like um socially are more binding and we didn't realize that oh in private equity and Loi is like a pretty sturdy commitment or whatever and you know that was for better and For Worse on one hand it let us move really fast on the other hand we learned quite quickly that okay you're not supposed to go back on like what you Chang in an Loi and that kind of stuff and we and and so there's all those little things where just not being familiar with the process really kind of let us move fast it let us be friendlier and that was the whole point like we had both had these kind of bad experiences with uh with with Buyers um and we thought you know there's got to be like a better service to be done there basically I had a handyman come over yesterday and he comes to my front door and he's like show me what you need done whatever and I said great that's what I need done and he goes here before we start I need you to do something and he pulls out a notebook and he wrotes and he writes my rate is $50 one hour per one hour and he hands it to me he goes sign this for me and I just I go okay cool I'm aware that he's like that way spits in his hand shakes it he's like this is no official and I was like I I appreciate I appr appreciate your style that's that that was like the tiny Loi hey real quick you know one of the cool Parts about what we're doing is that people have reached out and told me that they've built actual million-dollar businesses made their first million off an idea they heard on the show that is crazy that's wild that's why we want to do the show and we want to see more of that one of the questions we get asked over and over again is is there some kind of idea database spreadsheet where we list out all the different business ideas that we've talked about well the answer is finally yes to find Folks at HubSpot have dug through the archive and pulled out 50 plus business ideas and put them into a business idea database it's totally free you can click the link in the description below and get the database for you all right now back to the show so at the time was dribble like an Obviously good business because it turned out to be an amazing investment probably like a I don't know what is it like a 50x on your money there right like it's yeah more than that more than a 50x amazing what did you guys like try to underwrite the deal were you like in Excel like dragging some like you know 10% growth like dragging it over 20 columns like how did you guys what did the deal look like and what what did you expect again it was it was pretty obvious that it was a great business and I think Andrews told this story before but there was some immediate day one levers around like a big part of the business was advertising and we could find better advertising providers and things like that so there was levers you could pull on day one that were going to improve the business um but yeah it just felt like this big opportunity it was a top 10,000 website it had millions of active users it was very important you know when it launched like I think I bought my dribble invite on eBay or something like that it was really hot for a while and it it was just this kind of like cool thing that didn't really exist you know there's not a lot of independent social networks that have millions of users um and you know we we we negotiated a pretty fair deal I think like you know the other Buffet line is price is my due diligence and that helps a lot but no never thought we never thought any of the deals could be you know 50 plus X's um we were always just like you know can we make 20 or 30% cash per year from this business and that would be great and anything after that is just kind of kind of upside um you know I I think and and yeah regarding models you know Andrew used to make me do discounted cash flows because it was kind of like the thing that you felt investors ought to do and then at some point I was like here is your stry but I'm just making up all the assumptions in this spreadsheet and I think it was like so many of these things are just like um comfort blankets or whatever you just like it makes you it's this big scary thing that you're doing and it makes you feel better that you have it so you can look at it and be like yeah like we've modeled this out you know but it's like it's [ __ ] you're just you're just making it up you also had a great quote you were like uh you you said something to me you go the more quantitative analysis so the more numbers number numerical analysis you're doing about a business the more you're commoditized in your analysis what does that what does that mean unack that one yeah my my favorite anecdote here is in the Facebook IPO Barkley's put out this research report where you know they say what they think the business is going to be worth and um the way they do that is through a discounted cash flow and and a part of that calculation is like what is the terminal growth what is this thing going to grow out forever and they put it at 3% which is what most companies are and so that got them to a $200 billion do valuation now the next 10 years it grew 30% a year and it's A2 trillion dollar company and it's just an example of like you know you do all this modeling and this research report and you're just so off like you you're an order of magnitude off and so like what was the point of doing any of that it would have been better to think really hard about how actually how much can Facebook grow like just kind of this first principal stuff right of what percentage of the planet could use this like a lot more basic um and yeah that's a lot of the quantitative stuff also a lot of the quantum stuff is totally commodified right so people like know how to do this you can learn how to do this in school and therefore maybe it's like a useful table Stakes thing but you're not going to get any Edge that way because everyone can do it and where the edge is in quantitive stuff is you know in the two sigmas and Jane streets and the MIT phds and you're not going to be doing that either and so you're not going to like do a better model on a company than than the next guy and somehow get some Edge there so then when you're looking at a deal when you're trying to for like a small bootstrap business a business doing anywhere from a million to 30 million in Revenue what are you looking at to spot the opportunity if it's not the if it I mean are you how much do the financials and the the cash flow statements actually even factor into that or you just thinking I can make this bigger I mean what what part of the numbers actually matter to you yeah it's pretty basic right it's like okay let's you know let's make up numbers it's doing $5 million a year of Revenue a million dollars of earnings and you think okay on day one I could you know raise the prices by 30% I could um reduce headamp I could launch this new product whatever uh would you pay you know would you pay a million dollars for that yeah of course would you pay $3 million yeah probably and then you you can just kind of go and I think where modeling gets important is when you're like at the very edge of that you're like would you pay $10 million for that and then it's like well a lot of things would have to go right maybe or whatever but there's some number there where it's like yeah you know i' pay $3 million for business making a million dollars and so then the trick becomes okay can you get the business for $3 million and that's where it's like you know tiny was in a lot of bids with other other folks and I don't think we were ever the highest actual price but we often won deals because we could offer other things so that comes back to like why you on the deal you know it's because like the very common thing that would happen is we'd get pretty far with the seller and then they'd say Hey you know we like you guys but we've got this offer for 25% more so we're going to go take it and you know very often be like great like go explore that and then turns out that offer was not as real as you thought or it was six months of whatever uh there's more debt or they didn't have the financing and then you actually figure out that oh there there is like other things in the deal that are important like the ability to get it done the ability to be honest to be trustworthy to do things fast like all those other soft things um and so it's more like are you able to get a price that's really a no-brainer at least that's how I look at it versus I really think I'm smarter than everyone else and I can pay slightly more I mean that works for people people do do that but it's just like a totally different game I'm always fascinated by the people Behind These businesses what can I learn you know tiny is a great business but it was created by people it was created by Andrew by Chris by you and I'm like what do how do they think about things what do they know about what they're doing what worked for them what are their ultimately what are their superpowers and I asked you what's Chris's superpower because forget Andrew everybody knows Andrew he's popular he's out there he talks he's got a big following almost nobody knows Chris I had dinner with Chris and I was like I [ __ ] love this guy this guy's he's dynamic he's really engaging he asks great questions and so I've only known him for a couple hours of my life you've known him for a lot longer than that what is Chris's superpower that that he brought to Tiny I mean Chris's superpower is just being able to Andrew is so high pace and so high energy that Chris is just able to modulate that and kind of be the sober second thought you know we're not going to do this or that's way too much or or whatever um you know a very interesting piece of the tiny partnership um at least at the beginning that I thought was really quite unique and interesting is that you know Chris and Andrew had tiny as this vehicle that they would share together but then they could also do things on their own you know Investments businesses and that actually like I don't even know if it was intentional but that provides this great release valve of okay like all the time you know Andrew would come up with some you know cocky motion about some restaurant or whatever and he would just say I'm going to go do that on my own and Chris could have the same thing like Chris was great at investing in public equities and he could go do that on his own and I um I know that doesn't directly answer about Chris's superpower but it is this like interesting structure I think one thing that can really go wrong in Partnerships is if it's like you're dedicating your whole life to this thing and everything you do is going to be be through it it can really turn into this prison if you don't share the same taste as as your co-founder and so having this like release valve and being aware of that is is really nice people normally pick Partners who are like them right but they but Andrew and Chris are not like that you know I guess is that a what what did you learn from that yeah I mean I would also say like Andrew is really good at sales and kind of creating this new vision and then Chris is really good at being kind of the negotiator and actually like getting a good deal and structuring it well and everything um you know there's all kinds of things about about negotiation like one thing that would be like structurally another interesting thing is you know I would I would be kind of the the front guy on a lot of deals and would come back to them and they would kind of be quarterbacking it and what was nice is like I would throw it an offer that I thought was really aggressive and it was kind of the most that I could like emotionally stomach aggressively High aggressively high low you know really low really low and so this is I I want to be clear this was back like in the early days when we had no money and we were really trying to like be Scrappy um tiny is not really like this anymore but and then I would say okay like I've really got this down uh you know and then they would just look at me and because they' never talk to the the the seller and just say I think you can do like 25% Le at less and like sometimes I feel like I want to throw up you know talk through that when you have to present a [ __ ] offer to someone I I imagine some a lot of times maybe not a lot 10 15% of times they're like okay yeah more than that and actually what's even rarer is at least I I always have this fear that they're just going to lose it you know like dare face and that almost never happens it happens sometimes but it almost never happens and another nice Dynamic there is you can always say well hey like I'm on your side like I you know it's the old uh car salesman gamut of like my manager's killing me it's the same exact setup right um and that's that's super helpful and you know uh Chris shared all kinds of tricks with me like um one great one is it's always best to just kind of when you float an offer to just not say anything else people will immediately start negotiating against themselves and so one trick that you can use if you're on I guess it probably doesn't work on Zoom but um if you're on just a call is you can like say your offer and then hit mute and then you can like be like you can start saying oh you know whatever but they'll just hear the science silence and um that's a big thing as well because oftentimes you just need to let it float and sit out there but it's like too uncomfortable for you to actually do that dude I've got this friend who works in the CIA and I was talking to him uh and he has to negotiate with people you know basically his job is to convince people to become spies so if he goes to the Middle East he has to convince a guy who's loyal to some country in the Middle East to be commit treason and when he like goes to these negotiations his tactic because he said the same thing he goes I say what I want and what I want to happen and then I shut up and uh I we we his other cooworker was there and he was like who's not uh who's not part of that he's like dude they do this to me all the time just at work I'll notice they say something and I just want to fill the silence and I want to keep talking and it because makes me uncomfortable and I end up just talking talking talking and they sit back not saying a thing and they always get their way yeah totally I mean one one very cynical way of looking at negotiation um is that it's just who can bear to be uncomfortable longer um and and like that's certainly true you can do that in a retail setting you know Sean does that all the time Sean I think we when he negotiates the king of the awkward silence yeah he's the he's very comfortable I have a condo on Awkward Island yeah he's he's the mayor of of that area where he's just very comfortable being uncomfortable in a conversation Jeremy you told me something else that Chris taught you that is less about kind of the the kind of the gamesmanship I think when we when we think about negotiation we often think about the gamesmanship what do I say and I think you already said one interesting thing is which is a lot of times is what you don't say it's to stop talking and let them talk but another piece you had mentioned to me was like it's not you vers them can you explain that like how taught you it's not you vers them the the way that I like to frame it the more kind of mature the way that you can really do I think for your entire life and not kind of get you know be known as this like bastard who's just Relentless to NE negotiate against it's kind of I love this idea of in a traditional negotiation you're sitting across the table from one another and the way that I really like to reframe it is um you're both sitting on the same side and what's on the other side of the table is the problem and the problem can be you want 50 million for the business I want to pay 20 but it's still this like okay this is a problem let's work together to figure this out and it's this very subtle thing but it makes a huge difference and that's I think that's how you start to unearth okay maybe like it's actually not it's cash and something else that's more important for you why do you want 50 what is it that's 50 but so important and why can I feel like I only can pay 20 or whatever and that works really well I use that every day you can use it in like a relationship problems and everything of kind of like making the problem other and then putting it out there and being like let's work together on solving this thing and there's just something so much better about that than the kind of like I'm going to hit mute and stare at you and like break you you know like well see Jeremy the problem that we're trying to solve is I want the money in your bank account to be in my bank account uh yeah exactly I want that I want that Chase account to say 5 zero yeah no it it is true though uh uh you know one of the things my dad taught me one of the best things my dad ever taught me he's like when you go into a negotiation it's not same thing it's not us vers them he goes make a table of your needs and your like basically your needs and then your gives so like what do you have to offer and then what do you what do you need back and then what do they have to offer what do you need back and they're never like perfectly symmetrical it's not like and so for example some of the things they need are very easy for me to give cost me nothing or I'm totally comfortable giving that and it's actually Their Fear or their their big sticking point was something that's not so hard for me to to to give on or maybe I could go out of my way to give more even than they're than they're they're expecting in that area and in this other area I need something and then they they're happy to give it and so that's usually the the better way to do it my my favorite question is what would need to be true so it's like okay you want to sell your business for $100 million what would need to be true for me to pay $100 million for it and you can just lay it out like like what would make this a no-brainer and you can do that in any situation and you know sometimes it's impossible but oftentimes it's far more possible than you think when everyone actually lays that out because usually there's some sticking point that you don't realize or or or you know it's something that is kind of outside of the scope of things you've already talked about and I'm always amazed by how much that works that works like as I've been fundraising it works there like what would need to be true for you to be like oh it's easy for to give you money or um you know uh for for a trip like what would need to be true for everyone to be excited about going on this trip like it's just such a good question and it it really sets that up as like let's collaborate on this that was my pickup line what's a guy like me got to do to be with a girl like you and then she was like do you have a friend what's his name you have this other thing on here where you talk about how um what do you say uh a cold email is the most asymmetrical trade um and that you've actually cold emailed a bunch of people there's one guy in particular who you listed that I want to ask you about but uh it sounds like the cold email has done well for you explain more yeah I think um it's funny I've been saying this a lot more like publicly into groups and stuff um and it's still like if everyone called email the ARB would go away but I think it's just too scary or whatever that people don't do it it's still a huge opportunity I will say like the the addendum to that advice is you got to have the goods when you show up for the meeting or the call or whatever I think like I think I don't know maybe it's just like anecdotally because I talk about this a lot I get a lot of cold Outreach and you also like the second part is you got to be really good when you show when you show up um but if you're good uh when you show up up like it's just this incredible incredible kind of hidden secret which is there's always a scarcity of talent like no matter who you are and you know how much money you're worth or whatever there's a scarcity of really awesome people um and so everyone has an infinite appetite to meet people who are interesting talented have a unique view on things whatever and if you can present that like you you will really kind of go a long way and and the downside I can't even remember I'm sure I've sent hundreds that have been responded to I've never got a bad response it's usually just no response and I don't even remember the non-responses but the ones that I've got responses from have been amazing you know and so I think um I definitely think more people should do it especially if you're young or you're a student that that alone can be enough of a hook um that like most people will meet with a student if they seem switched on and and interested and yeah I I'm still amazed that people people don't do it but I've started to see people do it and then they show up and like they don't have anything to say or they don't have questions for verett or whatever and that can be really bad we already know your first deal but that was the first one but I want to know first deal worst deal best deal weirdest deal it's like the [ __ ] murder Mary of uh what we did we did first deal dribble which might also be best deal uh what's what's the worst deal that comes to mind what's the big mistake you made the worst deal and name names and list their email address and social media handles yeah the the worst deal is actually the one that I can say the least of about which should indicate how bad of a deal it was the abstract wor yeah the the the worst one was just that uh the person was dishonest and I should have known and I didn't and I ignored it for for greed reasons uh because I was just thought this was such a good deal I could look past these things when you say I should have known I ignored it what what are some things people could look out for what what can I learn from that yeah it was it was not this deal but there was um a friend of mine uh who buys some types of companies did a did a deal where they flew in the uh the founders to meet them in person and the first night the founders wanted to know where they could get drugs and you know that is like in of itself is not a strong signal but in that context in that situation it's like kind of what more do you need to know and it turned out that they were doing a bunch of stuff that they didn't disclose or whatever it's always stuff like that like someone who's really flashy is almost always a bad sign um all these little things and you know even like in the casee of this deal I introduced the person to a bunch of different uh friends and and you know um experts and they were all like this guy is really something you know like you I don't really know why you're dealing with this person and it's it is funny how you just get the blinders on when something is so good and I think we've all all made that mistake um and so yeah that that one it just turned out that there was a bunch of things that we didn't know about and it went very badly and we lost all our money it was a really small small check fortunately that was like the one upside but um that one was was pretty pretty rough um what's the most unique or weird deal the the best one I mean it's kind of too early to tell one one one that I really I really really love is this company called meal lime it's a um meal planning app that tiny bought in 2018 meal planning made easy so four four four and a half million people it says on the website use this app and what do you do use say uh what ingredients you have and it gives you like uh a bunch of recipes to cook and lines them out for breakfast lunch and dinner but it was just this really awesome app and it was made by this really amazing technical guy who had just built this really great product like I remember the the moment that sold me is like they you know how the iPhone turns off when you put it close to your head um he realized that you could use that sensor if your hands are dirty while you're cooking you could wave your hands over that sensor to like go to the next part of the recipe or stuff all just these little things and they have these huge butterfly flexs like turns out when you do that Apple thinks that's really cool and then they feature you in the App Store and like you there's all these small details um and we bought that business and it grew a lot we got all of our money back in the first couple of years and then this was the only business tiny as um as sold to date that uh we so we a ma two major grocery retailers came along and I guess like in a boardroom somewhere they had just decided you know we need an app um and so they both became interested and it was kind of funny because um I you know the company that I was at before tiny we had sold the company to workday and it was a pretty difficult um uh experience and so I kind of viewed it as like my chance to get another go at selling a company to a public business and really kind of it was going to be my turn to like get a good deal and um and then we sold it we sold it for you know a huge Revenue multiple made a lot of money you know up excess of 25 times of our money and um and it's still today it's like if you look up it's still used it's this great thing I think the original team is still there they were very happy with the outcome um I just love that because it was like it was this kind of perfect little situation and this great little almost like um like craft app like just someone who cared a lot about making great product and and I love those and the weirdest deal it was basically this company a big Fortune 500 tech company bought a business and the business had two business units and the big Fortune 500 only wanted one of those units and um they basically had to divest of it very quickly and so we were able to buy it for it was doing $10 million of recurring revenue and it was shrinking the business was shrinking because it was built on top of another platform that was becoming less popular over time and um and we were basically able to buy it for so little that we borrowed all the money and then paid back the loan in like three or four months and so we basically got it for free we were able to we bought this out of the tiny fund and we we could write this great update to our investors saying hey uh you know we didn't call any Capital but you now own this new business we're going to do a distribution soon and it was like small dollars but it's cool to pay nothing for a business um and then the interesting part is like we also got a domain that's probably worth a million or two million dollars depending on how fast we wanted to sell it and so it was kind of this like fun little deal of like can you actually do a business for can you buy a company for no money down and um you know it won't be a business it will not be a 20 a and it's not going to grow for 10 years but we'll make many multiples of our money on it um and it's fun like in the actual fun statement that like KPMG does they have to list the cost and so the the accountants uh listed as like a $36 cost basis which is I guess like the actual money that went into the deal and um those are cool like you can be really really creative you don't have to put a lot of money down how did they find you or you them we in that case we knew a board member um and it was the situation where again we made a bid there and they didn't like the bid and they went and tried and shopped it around and turns out like there's a very limited set of buyers for that kind of thing and especially ones who can do a deal really really fast um and so it was kind of this we understood why we had the right to win this this deal we understood that money was not the most important thing here um and so we were able to get it for this this great price that's it for part one we actually kept talking to Jeremy and it was so good that we're going to turn it into a two-parter the second part is actually all about what he would do today so the first part was kind of like how they how they built tiny the deals the lessons learned that was the past and now I asked them basically if I was going to do tiny today what would I do what deals would you be looking at what businesses do you think are great buys what opportunities do you see and he tells us the single best investment opportunity he sees today in this next part uh enjoy that's coming out tomorrow [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
he's showing us around his house he's like that's my nap room and I was like you're a nap guy I'm a nap guy and he's like oh yeah nap been I take a nap every day for the last do you want a nap [Music] together all right you're back from Austin you were there for seven days how was it it was great dude I had uh one conversation I got to ask you this I got put on the spot so I was talking to I did an episode with Tim Ferris and he said something in the middle of the interview he goes if goes I wanted to ask you this what do you say what what do you think is the um the brand of your podcast he goes what I mean is if you're not in the room and someone was just telling their friend about it how would they describe it it ideally to you how would they describe it you actually did this before and I actually thought it was great you said hey look we're doing these meetups and if you are the type of person who goes to a restaurant and you wonder how could they make this a little bit more efficient or how much money do they make per meal or how much profit do they make and how can they expand this and you also like to joke around you're perfect for MFM and that's sort of the person who I would describe is into it I would say that we're this weird combination of making silly dumb jokes and deconstructing interesting companies and pointing out different Trends okay that's pretty yeah I like the restaurant thing where it's like if you went to a Resturant with four friends and three of them would be looking at the menu trying to figure out what to order and you'd be looking around counting the tabletops and trying to figure out how much money this place makes that's us we are that friend why what did you say on the air well luckily he let me off the hook because he asked it he's like I want to ask you this you don't have to answer but you can do this and he just kind of kept going and in my head I was like okay the master of podcasting asking me what is my podcast about and it's not sort of like you know if Leonardo Caprio comes up to you and he asks you what your name is and you're like I have one I just don't know what it is right now you know the Panic ensues I had to go out of town so it was a weird timing I wasn't able to make it but you interviewed four or three people but you hung out with a ton of people how how was how was Tim for one you you also interview interviewed Joe linale how were these guys so I took notes I always take notes when I go I take a little journal with me and basically I'm not taking notes on what happened I'm only taking notes on what are the new epiphanies what are the new golden nuggets what's the one phrase somebody said that I'm going to remember and um I'm looking for a high rate of Revelation I think that's also by the way a good move for the podcast what is the rate of Revelation per minute how many interesting things are are coming out to you RPM baby RPM yeah yeah exactly this is a very high RPM uh uh trip for me I wrote down a bunch of names on our Dock and for each one I had one one big Revelation and so I you can prompt me and go for whichever one looks interesting to you not an order person so Manish from what I know he is a uh what's his book called the dond uh investor uh ba basically what I know about him is that he started maybe in the 80s investing in companies because I think he made some money uh through his own business and then he's sort of like a Indian Warren Buffett and he's got this huge following and uh he seems really fascinating type of guy yeah so exactly I wanted to talk to him because my mentors consider him a mentor right like if you like this podcast and you like uh you know either Andrew Wilkinson or Sayed balky like both of them look up to and learn from Manish when I when I was going out there I texted Andrew I was like hey what should I ask him I was like you you know him right and he's like dude he was my first value investing man crush and and like you know somebody who whose brain you got really attracted to because he has very interesting philosophies and thoughts if you Google his netw worth it says like you know almost two billion um I don't know you know Googling net worth is not not exact science but he's up there more like a be than an m and um he's an interesting guy like his story is basically he's working at a company his dad is like son it's time to quit and he's like his dad was an entrepreneur he's like Dad I don't want to do what you did man your your life was crazy like uh was ups and downs don't you remember as a kid we were being brought into the living room when we were 12 13 years old trying to figure out how to like let the business survive one more day he's like I'm traumatized for that I just want to work here save uh money my 401k every year and in 35 years I'll be set and his dad was like okay you're not wrong but you took the long wrong lesson away from from what you learned what you you actually got a crash course in how to do business and how to not do business maybe you should just take that and actually learn from it and do it right do it better than I could do it he told him he's like you know at this company there's 2,000 people here you're just a cog in the machine like you could die tomorrow and no one would even know and so he's like you know you're you'll never reach your potential just sitting there so he's like all right [ __ ] he's right goes starts a company it was an it like consulting company so this was like during the dotc boom runup when the internet was really exciting computers were really exciting he creates a a an IT consulting business and so it's crazy Mark uh Mark cubin also had an IT services business that he sold for 6 million I bet around the same time so it was enough to be comfortable but not enough to do nothing exactly exactly and so what he did was um he takes that money and he starts investing his own money and he compounds his own money his own money turns like whatever I think at first he had sold a million dollars a secondary he turns a million dollars into $13 million so he knew the Indian tech scene pretty well because he had his his consulting company had uh you know overseas staff so he's paying attention to it so he invested in one and it was 40x and so he's like wow that's insane I should get out he pulled out like a million or two million bucks from that that's how he made his first million million bucks and he just reinvested and along the way of you know he's giving his friends like stock tips he's like yeah I'm buying this for this reason I'm buying this for this reason they're doing really well but they're like M like you know we can't just listen to your tips because you're not telling us when to sell we don't know what you're not telling us can we just give you the money and so he he takes a he takes a million bucks from his friends he's like okay I'll just if I'm investing in my [ __ ] I'll just put their money in the same thing but he's like that was the side thing he's like I had 13 million that was 1 million I didn't really care about it he proceeds to basically over the last whatever 20 years 30 years whatever run that million dollar up he now has like about just under a billion dollars of assets under management of the compounding of that plus people bringing more Assets in obviously along the way so okay that's a long story about Manish but that's not what was interesting about him what's interesting about him is I call him the relaxed billionaire because I go to this guy's house he's just chilling he's just there he's in his bath s shorts no no shoes just walking around he's like all right um sup like and we because I went the day before to hang out with him I was like we're going to do the podcast tomorrow but I want to get to know you a little bit let's hang let's can I swing by for you know let's just have some some some uh some tea so I go over to have have a tea at his house he calls it chai with PAB and he's like uh he's like yeah I do this from time to time I just have uh I make I make a really good chai I'll just have it with random interesting people one out of every 10 proves to be like someone really compelling I want to hang out with more and uh you know nine out of 10 no no problem I just had some chai and he just moved to Austin right uh he's been there for a little bit yeah um so he he relocated from I think or something so I was like so what are you doing today CU like he's hanging out with us for like an hour and I was like what's you don't there's nobody here where's your team where's your schedule where's your assistant coming tapping you be like you have a call and he's like I don't have any of those things he told me a couple interesting he goes investing is not a team sport he goes I uh I have a few folks analyst type people and they'll they'll do specific things that I need them to do but they don't make decisions uh they don't make investment decisions I make the investment decisions he goes why he goes to be a great investor you need to make a contrar and bet meaning you have to believe something's good when other people believe that it's bad fundamentally that's how it works right if you think it's good but everybody thinks it's good you'll never make any money the price is too high um if it's bad and you think it's good you'll never make it m only way to make money is you think it's good and other people think it's bad he calls it I look for things that are hated and unloved he's like last year I made one big bet or whatever last two years like on coal Coal he's like man Cole nothing is more hated and unloved than coal he's like and before that it was this before that it was this um and so he's like I look for the hat and and love things he goes if you have a team everybody just centers around the safe picks that uh we can all agree on and he's like you know you'll never find the truly truly contrarian hated and unloved things if you if you invest as a team he goes it's not a team sport number two he goes he's like he's showing us around his house he's like that's my nap room and I was like you're a nap guy I'm a nap guy uh and he's like oh yeah nap been I take a nap every day for the last 30 years do you want a nap together yeah he's like he's like every 30 years he's for 30 years I've been napping every day he's like I love it just knock out in the afternoon 20 30 minutes an hour whatever it is he's like it's good for my brain he's like I don't make good decisions if I'm not if I'm not well well rested he's like I don't need did you guys like high high five and hug over there yeah I was like finally this guy's my people and he's like oh yeah he's like I used to live in Dubai that's how they do it's too hot during the day you just nap and he's like uh it's it's a no-brainer but overall he was like you know I have a clear schedule I spend my time I read I think maybe I'll go teach or talk to somebody he goes I teach not because I want to be a teacher he goes because if I want to learn something the best way is to go try to teach it where does he teach at like a school or online yeah he'll go give a talk at a university or like to some group of you know aspiring investors or whatever um and so I was just fascinated by this guy I was like this is the relax building I love this guy's style I love his Mo I go to his Library he's got just thousands of books and he's like yeah this is my like biology and science section this is my investing book section this is my business book section and uh he's like you know just recommending different books to me I thought it was pretty fascinating to see this guy because it's high contrast to all the other people I met on this trip who are like go go go you know hey real quick as you know we're big on ideas here we love bringing new ideas business ideas brainstorming ideas for the podcast well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas can we go find them is there a list somewhere the great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database it's totally free if you just click the link in the description below you can go download a collection of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated and so uh what are you waiting for go download it it's free check it out it's in the description below all right back to the show so I've heard this so often where people say for one people will say like Warren Buffett they're like I just I read like 500 pages a day and then I'll talk talked to our friend Andrew Wilkinson and a few others he goes I just want to read all day and in my head I'm like okay reading does that like like I I just read this like awesome like science fiction book about like aliens like is that counting like what what do they read I wonder all day like is it only work related is it like the equivalent of you and I skimming Twitter no no I think it's less Twitter uh but I do think it's you know some percentage of that is company's annual reports uh right like going in and in and looking at a company or looking at an industry trying to understand it some of it is understanding the macro the psychology of humans and about business and about whatever and he's got business books psychology books all that some of it's about science and he's reading about that and some of it's just for fun just to kind of like expand the brain like science fiction is actually quite quite interesting as an example because a lot of the things that are happening today were predicted by science fiction you know 20 30 years ago everything from cryptocurrency to you know video calls to things like that that at the time seemed farfetched you know predicting video calls where you don't even have a cell phone right it's like uh it took took some took some thinking there so so yeah I do think it's a it's a wider breath it's not just reading you know 10 Q's yeah that's what I was wondering I'm like is he just reading is he just is he just reading those all day 10ks I think by the way we don't want to look like a total fool I'll give you a couple of takeaways from Joe lale so for those people who don't know Joe created paler he's the co-founder of paler which is a $50 billion doll company but his actual claim to fame when I was talking to him he said something he goes I've created more billion doll companies than anyone else in America that's a good bold and I was like cool cool cool I got a podcast what's up uh I've created more episodes than than most podcasters uh I thought that was a really amazing amazing you know achievement and it's true he's done like at least five billion dollar companies and those were all like in the last you know like short period of time his background is I think he went to stamp and he somehow got into Peter Teal's orbit when Joe was just like 21 or 20 or still in college he kind of like right-hand Peter and was almost prot yeah was his Proteg√© intern whatever at his hedge fund I I think but the story is really hilarious because he's like uh somebody asked him in an interview when I was doing my research they they were like what were you like as a kid and everybody like if I asked you successful person gets asked what it was like growing up what's the typical response selling stuff it's usually humble origins of some kind I like I grew up middle class um you know maybe I I had a reading impediment but that led me to you know really working on something there's usually some Rags to Riches the guy asked Joe and he goes yeah grew up had great parents great family um I was I just stuff came pretty easy to me I was uh basically I just was really good I just aced all my tests I was 99 percentile math 99 percentile science I was a programmer um he's like you know there were smarter kids than me but like you know school was pretty easy I focused on it I did well I got into to Stanford it's like that was his story which I found to be hilariously candid um because there of course that exists but most people don't want to say that they're so busy virtue signaling that they'll like they'll try to bend their awesome upbringing to be to focus on some one bad thing where he's like no my parents love me and they really put me in a position to succeed and I was super competitive and I [ __ ] won that was his story and then he you know he got in Peter Teal's orbit and he did he was probably was wildly successful just as an employee at PayPal but then he spun off and they created paler together and then off the backs of that or off the success of that he created like eight or six other companies right that he like quote co-founded which I don't understand what co-founded means uh with in his case because he's done it so often that I don't even understand the logistics of how like he has time to do that yeah he like seeds them basically so he's like okay I have you know the idea I'll bring the team together I'll have the initial strategy I'll recruit the initial Talent I'll recruit the initial capital and then you know over time he either is CEO or not CEO of these different companies so he's done adapar he did paler he's done epis he's done like a whole bunch of different things in different spaces one is financial you know software for wealth managers another one one is like software for spies for the government another one is you know um it's like androll they're making like a weapon uh for the government you know like they they do different things uh in totally different spaces like Trucking and Logistics they've done all kinds of [ __ ] let me show the the the viewer if you're on iTunes or whatever go to YouTube to see this I get this text message from Ben um all right so Joe has I don't know what his home is like but the room that he's in is elaborate it when you think of like old money and like the boys club of men smoking cigars and like you're just surrounded by encyclopedias there's a picture of Joe and he's sitting there he's got a a suit with a high collar he looks like a hedge fun guy looks like the president and we had an awesome awesome interview he he was like that was the best podcast I think I've I've ever done um he said that he said that his his rightand man who's like his media guy said that I don't know if they're just being nice but I'll take it either way what did he what was like the one Revelation you got from him I'll I'll give you five points I'm just going to read them fast number one um some people actually just want to save the world so I am very very suspicious when people talk about you know they want to just really help people they want to improve Society they want to fix America all those things Joe is that guy uh he actually is that guy that is actually what drives him um I went back and read his like early blog post and qual post stuff you know 10 years ago uh 15 years ago stuff he wrote when he was in school um he's been saying the same thing the whole time and that's usually the the giveaway is not somebody who's um you know changing their tune once they make it but somebody who's saying that before they make it and um and I think he looks through everything through that lens of like what are the biggest gaps and then how I filled up when we were on our way out it was like oh dude we've been hanging out all day like we hung out we went there in the morning which was my my hack we went and did his workout did a workout with him at 8 AM and then we was he fit yeah of course uh he's super fit and so we we worked out together we cold plun together we got breakfast together we hung out then we did the interview so by the time we do the interview we were totally like you know in high Rapport I guess and so I'm hanging out I'm like dude I could hang here all day uh but I could tell like I think it's my time to leave now after this thing is done he's got to go do other [ __ ] today and um we're walking out and freaking Elon Musk is walking in that's that's what was going on in that moment so pretty insane and all right what were the other number two um he's still wrestling with the idea of focus so one of the things he said I thought was really interesting he's like I said he's created more billion dollar companies than anyone else that uh in America let's say I I'll take his claim at face value um and he brought up honestly he was like you know but I'm not sure if that was right he goes one of the lessons I learned from Peter teal is that you should be really really careful putting effort into new things almost always it's a better idea to put money into your main compounding thing that's got a lot more room to run like there's more area under the curve to kind of like fill um of of something that's really working than to go take that same unit of effort onto something that's a starting from zero and he's like honestly I probably if I had just done one of those companies I probably would have built a bigger thing than all five combined or all six combined or whatever it is which I thought is a pretty interesting thought and that makes me feel good to know that people I admire or look up to or who are ahead of me uh struggle with the same stuff that everyone else struggles with I think he was at peace with it because he was like but at the same time that would be if I was optimizing just for money and valuation but that's not what I'm optimizing for like I thought these companies needed to exist so I built them I'm glad I did it's more fun to do multiple things and those were problems that needed to be solved so like I'm glad I did it but just do the math here for a second so it's F paler now $50 billion company market cap wise even if take adapar which I think A3 billion company or open goov which he just sold for 1.8 billion it's like those are let's say those two together each one took you know seven eight years 10 years to to kind of build um let's say um average company let's say take seven years to do and he even if he totally wins and he gets to a three billion doll uh outcome or2 billion doll outcome if he had just put that same energy into paler like taking paler from 50 billion to 53 billion is a hell of a lot easier and he probably would have taken it to 70 or 80 billion if he had put all of his same entrepreneu energy into that versus starting these new things I think he's actually kind of right on the math but I think he's also right in how he decided to do it he had an interesting rule which he's like I only do six things and that was like his definition of focus he's like I can only do six things uh he's like and he's like they're not all equal I have like my main one or two things like 8 VC and and starting you know one company but he's like I um I can only do six he's like I think for his his like team his like general managers or his Partners in his company um like the high level exec people like they Al there's like some number where like they're only allowed to have three or they're only allowed to have six things on their plate at any given time and um I think three was the number for them and six was the number for him because he's not he's not operational as the CEO by the way his rule was if you're the CEO you have one thing and it's your company that's it this is awesome I'm so you know he's only 41 this guy's a so prolific he's a machine I'm so excited to listen to that also by the way just Next Level awesome in terms of Lifestyle like baller house full staff Chef all the good all the good [ __ ] all the [ __ ] you would want like for me as somebody who's like you know you do play the money game it's interesting to see like what does the final level of the money game look like for these people like oh that's interesting it's cool to it's cool to get to sample it what do you think was worth it of what he spent on he's got a basketball court in his house thought that was pretty awesome he's got uh a uh a he likes he's like oh I like gaming so I got a game like a gaming room like a land room where he's got like six computers and it's like me and my cousins all come here and play or whatever um and I think like I've always been a big proponent of like a chef like I think uh it's the to me it's the number one wealth luxury is to have a private Chef because of the amount of time it saves the health benefits for you and your family and the taste like all three it's a win-win win and so yeah I thought that was pretty cool too and then you got to hang out with Nick Gray Nick Gray is one of my favorite people on Earth and you got to see his magic uh what he does with his parties that it's pretty cool right yeah so when we the end here is uh you know we do all the interviews we do all the one-on-one meetings and at the end was like dude there's like a list of 100 people that are interesting in Austin we we could we would want to hang out with but you know there's just no time so we were like let's just do a small house party so we did like a small 15 person house party and we asked Nick to organize so I got to see Nick Gray the legend run one of his famous two-hour cocktail parties go by his book uh 2hour cocktail party this guy is so he is such a leg in just his Vibe it's awesome right he makes you feel good I got to tell you this hilarious story so he does all the normal Nick Gray things I walk in he puts a name tag on my shirt the name tag is yellow so that after we all do our kind of intro he's like we're just chatting and you know like normally you're just kind of chatting you're mixing and mingling and like everybody our own social prowess is is somewhat limited some people really good at it some people feel awkward you don't know how to exit conversations Nick makes that easy because he'll be like great Harmon he plays his harmonica like we're going to do a structured activity look at the color of your name tag join that group and I want you to talk to those people now and so he like mix he like he like will stir the pot basically to mix you mix you up so he's doing his thing and then he's like um at the end he's like we're trying to leave and he's like um he's like hey uh Sean can you call my phone I want to do a gag and I'm like you what what do you want to do he's like I have a gag call my phone and I call his phone and he reaches into his bag and he pulls pulls out this giant like handle of a butcher knife but it's a phone case and his phone is on the other end of it he he's like hello this is my gag I thought this was really funny and I was like Not only was that funny I've never heard someone say hey hold on I want to do a gag that is just so dude he's great right Nick's a special person and he makes the he he makes his parties fun did you guys like do the introductions and then he like Cuts people off if they talk for more than 10 seconds yeah he's he's awesome we did a thing at the end where I guess he had been just like sling around the party to like listen for interesting things so he pulls out his note notebook he's like gets every in a circle he's like all right Sean you were saying you discovered this amazing hack for your you know business and it was just like it was so effective what was that and it gets you to share the thing it's like you mentioned you were doing an art show can you tell us about the art show you had four or five people just like do a thing it's it's definitely like I feel like I'm in second grade and my teacher's like it's you know put up your bunny ear and like you know just everybody quiet now we're going to do a structured activity but honestly it's such a relief because I hate social gatherings I don't even leave my house most times and when I do it's kind of an exhausting thing but he's uh he's really got this [ __ ] down to a science I kind of love it but your takeaway in Austin it's it's a pretty special place isn't it fishing for a compliment yeah sure it's a very special place it's it's cool it's like there's there's there there's a lot of cool people there and you I didn't know you this you hung out with one other person Hassan uh Hassan minhaj dude I do not like hanging out with him because he is so smart and so funny that I get in I get intimidated being around him do you not feel that way no I had the opposite reaction I walked away and I was like dude Ben like that is one of my favorite people on Earth to hang out with like if you said hey and it was perfect it was like a breakfast before I caught my flight uh I basically missed my flight because I was having so much fun at the breakfast I was like [ __ ] it it's worth it um like it was he is so great and I'll give you the the kind of three reasons why what stood out to me number one obviously humor like it's unfair he's a ringer like hanging out with anybody who's funny is great but hanging out with a professional comedian it's sort of like you know he brought a brought a gun to a knife fight it's intimidating when you hang out with him or when I hang out with him because like he just makes little small comments and I'm like you're just so much you're so much quicker and funnier than me's so much quicker dude he's so much quicker he's so fast he's so fast it's like a JV athlete hanging out with a pro where it's like I don't even want to play with you this isn't this isn't fun that's how fast he is I love seeing it it was amazing he's so quick and then uh number two present uh he is so present when you hang out which is great like not looking at his phone not thinking about what to do next not you know eyeing the room fully locked in fully present which I thought was really great and the other thing is uh he asked a ton of questions so we had a different hangout with a we did a breakfast thing with um a different billionaire type of guy nice guy had a great time but I [ __ ] you not dude this guy literally asked one question in a two and a half hour hangout and um it was it was not difficult because like I had tons of questions for him so it was no no problem but it was difficult to sit there and be like is this person just really just doesn't give a [ __ ] about being here like do they not want to be here because they could leave I don't need to do this if they just don't want to be here here's what I think it is I think that so when you and I host like MFM meetups I go there and I'm like I'm just going to get peppered with questions and I'm going to ask other people questions to be cordial and everything but I I feel like you know there's like a status like game here they're here to see me so I'm going to be answering the questions and then you go hang out with someone who's above you in status and it's like I'm I'm the one who's the the mentee in this situation I'm going to be asking you all the questions and I think when you're as successful as this person who you went and hung out with you're just used to being the the I don't know not particularly wise one but you're the one that's supposed to have a lot more answers and you have what others are seeking and so you're used to just being the one who's I'm going to be an open book I'm going to answer uh what do you got you know what I mean and that that that shift it's like an alpha shift it is kind of it it is really uncomfortable but totally understandable um but I also think you know I kind of wish I almost wish I had said it but like I kind of wish people are aware what that makes the other person feel like it's a good reminder to self of like never make other people feel that way I think husten was the opposite where he asked so many questions his cup is not full right like he's he's here and he's like pour some water into me like give me some something to think about something to learn something to whatever and he's asking tons of questions and I think that's such an attractive trait in people and it was just a good reminder of that like uh on this trip I was you know got to be in both positions some some places where you know the the status game was sort of shifted one way and others where was totally shifted the other way it was a great reminder of what it feels like and how easy it is to just make somebody feel amazing like um I think husin does that you know really really well um I have a couple others can I give you two others real quick yeah do you know this guy the peachy babies guy no you have met this guy okay so he's an awestin I thought you might have met him his name's Tyler so there's this company called peachy babies and they sell slime on the internet not just a little slime on the internet they sell a lot of slimy on the internet tens of millions of dollars worth of slime gets sold from these guys they got like if you go to their Tik Tok they have 10 million followers on Tik Tock and the reason why is because they create awesome content the content drives sales it's just this like great engine so anyways I was pretty fascinated I'm talking to this guy and I'm like he was at the house party so I was like uh what's the story and he told me a pretty fascinating story he's like well um I uh he's like I was he's like before doing this I was a poker player Pro poker player I was looking to transition out and he's before I was po poker player I was the best Yu-Gi-Oh player in the country so he's he goes from the top like Yu-Gi-Oh player to one of the top poker players what's Yu-Gi-Oh is Yu-Gi-Oh like Pokemon yeah it's like a Pokemon type thing and then um then he comes he meets this this girl and she's telling him about this slime business she used to have but she shut down and as he asked some questions he was like um hm that actually sounds kind of promising what if we revive that which I thought was just like a pretty impressive to take a business that somebody else shut down and be like I don't know seems like there might be legs there let's try it and they tried it and they ended up you know crushing with it and um the only takeaway I have from this guy was he totally pattern matches to what I've been saying so many times on this podcast which is that people who have a background as a competitive either gamer or in some competitive Niche spelling be Yu-Gi-Oh poker whatever um those people who know who learn how to win that game learn how to win at League of Legends or you know they're the number one sneaker flipper in California or [ __ ] like that as soon as they just pick a better game they're going to win that too and that really gets me to like something I really want to do and it's a call to action I have for anybody that's in the audience is I really want to organize some kind of event that pulls together the people that are young and doing those types of things the mathletes the the best Pokemon players best League of Legends players you know whatever best fortnite players cuz it's just a matter of time till they get the spark to shift their game and I want to do two things I want to invite other people who have that background for example Joe Londale he was a competitive mathlete and that's what he was doing right super dork uh at that age but like those types of people are always going to make it like you know the founder of this company called traba he's the spelling be kid right we talked about that uh on the pomp episode as soon as they decide to play a better game they have a great ability to do you know like e excellent things I'm sure some percentage them never shift games they they kind of stick in that world too long or they just become a coach in that world they never really start to apply it to the world of business but if they did they would do phenomenal so I want to organize some event what's that Channel or the show you like uh something 100 phal 100 exactly you you what what the the unphysical 100 the laptop 100 yeah and so what are you going to do you're going to like host like a like so I need a name and a frame right like uh I need a name in a frame for the thing and then I want somebody to organize it I'll put up 100 Grand to like pay for all the event stuff and I um I just really want to for those people I want to give them exposure to hey here's 20 people who have the same background as you that then shifted their game and now do amazing things in the world so I want to I want to have them meet and then I want to scout that talent and be like hey whenever you're ready to go do something new I'll be your first investor and so that's what I want to create you can get like a like a cargo short company as a sponsor or like a risk guard uh company as a this be yeah yeah you make fun of these these nerds Watch Sam watch you'll be graveling to them years from now I hey I acknowledge that they're all going to be the the the big shots but I'm still going to tease them what was the last person all right I'll give you a quick one and then I have a little bit longer one so quick one is a little lesson so I was talking to a guy who also is doing you know tens of millions um this year on on Tik Tok shops and um so they're crushing on Tik Tok not not a game I play but it's a it's a very lucrative game for those who who cracked it and I said something in passing I was like oh yeah I saw this Tik Tok that had this hook the hook being like you know the first three seconds of the video I was like Oh I thought that was a great hook and like i' had been talking to this guy for three hours I thought I thought I had said 50 interesting things by then he didn't make a he didn't Flinch at any of the 49 but on this 50th one he immediately goes wait wait what was that again and he takes out his notebook and he writes it down he's like and he goes um he's like did you tell your friend that they should do this you should definitely tell your friend that they should do this and um and I was like no I I just I don't know I just thought it was just a silly Tik Tok and he's like no no no that's not a silly Tik Tok he goes one hook like that can make your whole company and I it was a great lesson that I actually I saw five times during the trip which was when you f when you meet a really interesting or successful person pay attention to what they pay attention to so like he leaned into that and you know maybe monish would not have leaned into that but he would have leaned into something else that I said and if you start to pay attention to what people lean into it teaches you a lot about what matters in their game and in their world and how their brain works and maybe something to you just looks like you know rubbish but to them it's gold and um so it just was a good reminder of pay attention to what other people pay attention to like if somebody was talking to you what would they see you whip out your phone to write down or notes that you would want to take that's a good question um well something related to my current business but uh yeah like like like you know if someone says something about retention or something or how how to create a breakthrough amongst a group of people who don't know each other right right or before for you it might have been something in writing oh I love the way he phrased that it's like yeah or like a a really good ad for uh acquiring newsletter subscribers you had a note or a doc that was like you a swipe file of awesome ways that people phrase things beautiful writing little phrases most people don't pay attention to those things they don't collect those well it makes sense that you ended up being a guy who's known for writing and wrote a newsletter that millions of people read right is it kind of like makes sense once you add add once you connect the two and so I just thought that was really really indicative uh last one I got to watch Ben cook so Ben levy my business partner who um is the the secret to my to anything that I'm able to do Ben's superpower is connecting with people and I want to to just share with you one little thing that he he does so every time we would go to a meeting CU like imagine our schedule is basically like we we meet with somebody for let's say two hours there's like a 10-minute Uber ride before we're going to meet somebody else and we were just doing that non-stop for four days and you know I I got to feel like the president because i'' be like who are we meeting now I don't even know the schedule and he'd be like we're meeting this guy and he's like and then he would always have his one thing and I'm like because I'd be like oh what are we going to talk about oh maybe we tell them about what we're doing about this but Ben's Focus was always what's the one thing we could connect with them on and so um he was just really good at this any time we go meet with somebody Ben would have his like one thing that he would bring up and the person would immediately crack open like you know a pistachio shell and it'd be like all of a sudden they're excited they're talking and like it would open it up and Ben probably wouldn't even say anything else for the rest of the meeting it's like Ben talks less than 10% of the time when we go to these things but it's the one thing he says which like cracks the person open so what's an example of one thing so um we will meet with somebody who's known for X let's say they're a YouTuber with 10 million subscribers but what Ben knows is that they started this side Channel that's just starting and it's getting it's not that popular yet but it's about one thing uh you know like the their their hobby their interest in this one area he'll be like oh you're really into that right and he won't even phrase it as some like profound question uh but he'll just ask them he'll just try to connect with them about the one thing where clearly their passion is they have some passion around it but it's not the thing they're famous for I noticed he would do that over and over again oh you know we we um we hung out with Joe gabat and he's known because he's the creator of Airbnb and so we're hanging out and instead of asking about Airbnb he would say um you're really into like microplastics right like aren't you like really trying to figure out a way to not have you know micro what's that about and then all of a sudden Joe who told the Airbnb story a million times and every time I was asking about Airbnb was like I'm forcing him to play his Greatest Hits all of a sudden he lights up because he's like really into this right now he's learning things it's like more of a more of an area he's really into right now so he would just find that one thing and then afterwards he had his one thing too which was after the meeting I'm like okay where are we gonna go eat like that's where my brain goes whereas Ben's like oh we should connect him with this one person or we should send him a link to this or we should send him that example we have of the thing he said he wanted to do um or like oh you have you've talked about that you should send him a note about that thing and really I was like what are you doing and he's like I'm just trying to be useful and then when we talked to Manish he talked about you know he was really good friends with Charlie Munger he said when Charlie Munger died I think on his Tombstone it is written or he wanted to have it written like you know Charlie merer you know he tried to be useful and to me I'm like that's what Ben does he just tries to be useful for people like oh we can help them with this per we can help this person with this one little thing he just keeps doing that and then that's how he builds these amazing connections with people just by trying to be useful to them in a way that I am so bad at it Ben has this other quality to him which is he's always like mostly happy uh I've never seen Ben not like I've never really seen him in a bad mood you know he's and so when he ask these things it's uh he sometimes he'll ask me that are like pretty private but because he's always so happy about it I'm like well yeah whatever we can talk you know this is a safe space he is a safe space um the last thing that's hilarious when he does is he never turns it off like we will be playing in a pickup basketball game and it's like we're going to 11 it's 109 it's game point and and he'll be guarding some guy and he'll be like he'll just be like so what was Revenue last month or he just like be asking him questions like oh I heard you I saw you Tweeting about this thing and the guy's like so thrown off like dude what now still and like it's just like so endearing he's like dude he's just so curious he just can't turn it off he's always he never turns it off even mid game which is so funny to me I was with Ben at a family's birthday party and he and he he was it was in on mode and I was like Ben let's ask this freaking 12-year-old we with we were with a friend who was dating a new woman and she brought her daughter around and I go Ben ask the daughter like about school or something I was like I don't know like engage the kid don't I'm not talking about my Revenue in front of this new lady it so funny it was like it like so what's churn like how much money how much money do you have I'm like Ben well it's not always personal like sometimes it's just like um how was Austin right but it's like dude now's not the time for the how was Austin conversation it's like it's not even that it's always personal questions it's just that the Curiosity there is no you go he was in on mode there's no off mode I've never seen him in off mode I hang out with the guy 247 it's amazing all right you had a good trip I mean I'm I could actually listen to these stories all day and I'm GNA listen to the podcast I never listen to our podcast I don't know if you do or you or or what you do when I'm when I'm not on it I'll I'll listen to it yeah I do listen to I I listen to yours as well but if I'm on it I will never listen to it I'm incredibly excited about Joe Lonsdale I know you talked to Tim Ferris uh I know him a little bit so I'm less excited about that just because I know him already but I'm excited about monish uh I'm excited about his and and Joe lale so I'm happy that you got to hang out with them it seemed pretty good for for you personally to be able to experience that yeah the funny thing is it's like most things in life you think the payoff is over here but actually it's over here like I think every time I go into these episodes I think the payoff is oh I'm going to make a great episode but it's like by the time I've done the research on these Fascinating People gotten to know them gotten to hang out with them at their house like that was all the value the episode itself is gravy for me and I hope they turn out great and you know I think that that these ones did but the reality is like and I think is a principle of most things in life like you you have some goal you have some idea you think is the reason you should do it but it's like you know something along the journey is actually the valuable thing you just couldn't have known that you just have to go go pursue it with full force and then then it happen so hopefully this episode was me sharing some of the random nuggets along the way um besides the episodes that you'll get to see when they come out all right that's the [Music] p

there's this new podcast that I've been listening to that's fantastic it's called rain makers it's this guy out in LA and basically he's like trying to find investors that no one's ever heard of before one of the guys that he profiled was Philip Antz he owned a bunch of real estate oil and gas railroads and there's like a tie through of this guy's career where he basically tried to find Value no one understood so he would buy up railroad companies not for the railroads but he'd buy it because there was oil underneath the ground or he bought up like a bunch of local sports teams because he figured out a Playbook of how he could get the stadiums for free but the one I loved was he bought Regal Cinema the movie theater chain when all of the movie theaters were crashing and everyone was like oh this is a horrible business you can't make money on tickets and food and what he realized was for 20 minutes before the movie starts you have a captured audience that are just sitting there looking at the screen and so he started to sell ads and he made the movie theater an ad business and then all of a sudden he completely changed the unit economics and was able to like save Regal Cinema became this huge thing sold it Etc

if you want to reverse engineer things you have to have a model with economies of scale that gets you to $300 to $400,000 per employee or your model is not real it is not [Music] scalable what's going on man how are you I'm so excited to be here uh and talk about all my first Millions um talk about the millions I lost uh few learnings on scaling and whatever you want Sam it's great to be here I love you for many reasons one of them is like you're so catchy and you're so good at summarizing important things but explain it in a very simple to way in simple to understand ways but before we get into that I need to like talk about background because we have to to the OG software guys you are the guy so like if we talk to like the founders of HubSpot or uh I mean like guys who run multi or tens of billions of dollars companies they say if you want to learn about software Jason's the guy but we have a bunch of like sometimes 20-year-old uh kids listening to this and I want to like give a little background and so we don't I don't want to spend too much time on this but basically what I know about you is you started a few software companies including echoine which you sold for nine figures I don't know the exact amount but you've said nine figures then you've been investing in in startups as a VC for like since 2013 which you said I think you said you 10ex your fund or something like that is that right that is about that is about right um and then what else did you do besides Echo sign before that um before that I had a a startup where I made my first million um uh between when the internet died for a while I actually founded a startup making implantable batteries from nanomaterials which I knew nothing about which is interesting and we sold it for 50 million after 12 and a half months it is kind of an MFM story and I learned a lot from it what was that company called it it was called nanogram devices and we did something that was thought to be impossible um and we got bought by our competitor it was a classic buyout after 12 and a half months when we took away one of our largest customers did you raise funding we did and it was hard it was I'm dating myself this was one of the crummiest points we raised 9 million in our seed round and sold 70% of the company in our first round and that was the deal that was the deal that there was no choice there was no negotiation it was a different time and that meant that meant what what you and the founder you and your other partners I don't know how many you had had 15 million left over to share after the 50 the $50 million exit I'd say it was more like about10 million or maybe even 8 million to share so it was enough interesting for the first million it was just enough to not work for the man I have worked harder I worked even harder on the next startup on echosign which Adobe bought so echosign was that basically like um what DocuSign is now you guys just sold earlier yeah a lot of learnings Yeah we actually DocuSign believe I mean I'm really dating myself DocuSign was basically a printer driver company when we started we were the first web solution I wrote it all myself in PowerPoint and crappy wireframe frames and we built it um and we got to a million dollar a month burning 4 million so we got to 12 million ARR uh growing 100% with 110% Revenue retention and cash flow positive so if we and we sold it in 2011 and 2011 was a long time ago uh in Internet time and in real time it was just before we understood the metrics around recurring Revenue businesses and so even my board my investors didn't like they weren't sure had a good business if I said to you today Sam I've got a business doing a million bucks a month growing 100% with 110% Revenue retention and profitable you would say that's the that's the ticket that's the ticket now DocuSign was bigger um we had about 36% market share um but we were cash flow positive and growing 100% um so you know we only raised four million so when you sell your company to make your second Millions sometimes the second one is is um there's a certain logic in it and the logic actually in its own way can be stressful right it can it can be stressful it's a comp that that was a very complicated decision because it made sense on paper given the the team wanted to do it in part of the team wanted to do it and given how little we'd raised right but uh in my gut I knew it was uh emotionally I knew it was the wrong thing to do Scott Galloway came out a while ago and I didn't get to talk to him about this but he had this awesome presentation you and Scott are similar and that you're you're just you have beautiful language that's what I that's what I describe these types of people they pick their words beautifully Scott has this thing so Scott sold L2 I don't know how much I think one to 200 million I forget the exact amount but nice nice exit and he was like well I wanted to have a nine figure exit and I wanted to do it in this data business because that's what I knew and so I worked backwards and I sort to rever reverse engineer it and he said something like he was like I you I was like I knew I needed to have an international presence I needed to I I knew I needed to charge at least F uh 50,000 a year for a service and then like he lists all these things and then he spent eight years along building it and I love that because I love reverse engineering and it's what I tell a lot of people I'm like they want to create this amazing stuff and I'm like yeah that's cool and sometimes that works but you can actually kind of reverse engineer a bunch of stuff to figure out what's the rules of the game that I need to play and then you optimize for the rules and I wanted to have you on to basically like reverse engineer what it takes to get like either 100 million in revenue or or even 100 million in outcome because I actually think those rules are actually the same I was like Jason I want to talk about this like reverse engineering thing and you like banged out this like five or eight point thing you said that a lot of startups right now because they raised money in a zero interest environment they're it's like a 100 Grand in Revenue per employee and you said no the new minimum needs to be 300 to 400,000 is that right it is if if you're trying to reverse engineer whether your business model makes sense like this is one thing to reverse engineer certain business models have economies of scale and some don't and if you want to go really big you want to business with economies of scale and if you step back in the old days of software the old Adobes Microsoft ints made a million dollars in Revenue per employee a million dollars okay you'd have a bunch of Engineers they'd go they'd go off in their offices everyone used to have a private office to code you'd spend two years building a piece of software a small team you'd put it on a DVD ROM that or CD ROM that cost 50 cents and then you package it up that cost 50 cents for a dollar and then someone would sell it for you between $50 and $400 this was a really good business there were 9 % margins and the classic Adobe Microsoft into it 50 cents of every dollar went straight to cash flow 50 cents we don't see this anymore in in companies go public it was so profitable so that was a million and then things just derer or whatever you want to call it it got crazy and we reached a low in 2021 of a 100,000 in Revenue per employee for all these unicorns a 100,000 so we got we only were 10% as efficient as we used to be now the pendulum swung back so we historically we're at a million per employee the low point was a 100,000 per employee um when employees in the Bay Area probably cost you $250,000 fully burdened with insurance benefits this and that so you're losing 150,000 per employee now every public company at least public SAS software company is at 300 to 400,000 hubs spots at 310 which we talked about Cloud flares at 400 that's where you have to be and so but when when do you have to be there so one way to think of if you're lucky enough or unlucky enough depending on how you look at it to raise Capital Angel Money Venture Capital whatever it it Bridges the Gap it Bridges the Gap to get you to3 to $400,000 per employee but you're G to have to get there and if your product isn't profitable enough if your gross margins are too low if it doesn't make sense make some changes right you have to have a a model if you want to reverse engineer things you have to have a model with economies of scale that gets you to three to $400,000 per employee or your model is not real it is not scalable and then you another Point here you say um going multiproduct and you say it's a huge issue of how when and where to figure out when to go to multiproduct but did you say at like 10 million or in Revenue you want to go what did you say for going multiproduct by the time you get to 10,000 customers you better have a second product that and this is this is the nonobvious thing that can be bigger than the first this one took me a while to figure out to be bigger than the first for HubSpot CRM in two years will be bigger than marketing Automation and HubSpot for years was a marketing company in two years CRM its sales product will be bigger than its marketing product it has to be you you want to be there by 10,000 customers this is the same for Ecom businesses too like they sell a handful of SKS and then they reach like uh some type of critical mass and then like all right we need to create more stuff so like we made deodorant now we need to make toothpaste or shampoo or something like that um but the second one has to be bigger this is the one to think this is the mistake Founders make if the second what's easiest Sam is to add a product extension okay we sell shampoo in e-commerce okay let's sell shampoo and conditioner that's the easiest thing because our customers already know us if they bought shampoo they'll buy shampoo and conditioner but the problem is if you if you if if the second product isn't bigger than the first and the first one's still growing you never catch up It's never enough right if you're selling aund 50 million of shampoo and you're growing 20% a year you're adding 10 million a year right and you launch shampoo and conditioner and it does a million it's first year it's great but it'll never get there the second one has to be bigger than the first and this is It's too we all default to the easy second product and you actually have to do the harder one that's uh interesting so at the hustle so we had I don't remember a million and a half subscribers I think we were doing a million a month in revenue and like a media company is basically you build an audience and then you launch multiple businesses to that audience so whether it's advertising conferences software whatever that's kind of typically how media companies are weird it's usually a collection of small businesses and or or different businesses and um I think we were at a million a month I forget I think about that and I wanted to create a a a a subscription service called Trends and it was like we like and dude I [ __ ] it up so bad because I charged $300 uh a year which is so stupid it should have been $30,000 a year it should have been way more expensive I think in the first month we did I don't remember exactly but in the first month we did did almost a million in sales and then it was a pain in the ass to but by the end I think when we sold I think we were at five like maybe 10 months later we were at five million a year in sales with it but it only had like four or five people running it which so was profitable but the mistake I made was the thing of not making it bigger than the first thing and I so like intimately know that mistake and it's really hard because I'm like well this is like a clear extension just do this then this but it it just because it's also like a a psychological thing of like why pay attention to this thing just put money back into the main thing this is an advantage to hiring a VP a sales for example Founders underprice their products usually they underprice them we're so wor because we know what's more is it more important to get the product off the ground and get a 100 customers than to optimize pricing as Founders we're always going medium or long right so we almost always leave money on the table so that we can make people happy and get them going dude I underpriced everything I've done I've underpriced yeah and and so have I and so have 80% of Founders not all but it's it's a I hate this term but it's a feature not a bug because as painful as it is you can fix pricing later at least for new customers it's harder to fix it for grandfathered customers right but for new customers then just double it to 600 and 1,200 and 1,00 like it is it's hard I think it's like rooted in like impostor syndrome of like I don't know if this is good enough and but then you talk to if you talk to a good salesp person person you're like dude like I could like just put a zero behind that I'll sell it you know what I mean like if you talk to a good salesperson can can get it done a good one will not rip people off but a good one will will get the full value for your product in a way as a Founder you almost never can you you almost never can right that's why a lot of the ear classic saster contents about hiring to VP a sales because that's why in in the first quarter the first nine days you should see a lift from a good vpa sales at least because they can run this Playbook with the same leads the same customers the same Dynamics for Trends or something else someone with the confidence to ask 30,000 for Trends knowing it's cheap compared to Gartner or forest or whatever uh they'll take that off your plate if they're good and you'll see a 30 to 100% Revenue lift from someone that's great right yeah someone that's mediocre will rip your customers off and never understand your product and misspell Trends and never read it and not know what it is a mediocre one will actually see a revenue decline from founder Le sales but a good one will will solve will will solve that piece right so um I think the other thing you know you just didn't give it enough time either I sold the company at four and a half years um but that was like I was okay I don't regret that at all because I wanted to get some Financial Freedom um and I was broke I I think I paid myself the first two years my salary was 20 grand the third year maybe a hundred and then the fourth year I think I paid myself a few $100,000 but I was like I was [ __ ] poor and and so I I was impatient and what you talk about all the time the worst thing is a tired CEO and I was a tired I was I was tired of being poor uh basically and that was a huge mistake by the way uh pay yourself way more if you can uh is what I've learned as soon as you can afford it pay yourself Market is the learning is the learning always as soon as you can afford it and you had this other thing on here you talked about um you want 30% of your Revenue to be outside of North America that's very intimidating that's probably the most intimidating thing here is going global um at least in my opinion I think it's a very intimidating thing obviously some businesses this doesn't really work right if you're highly regulated it can take a long time for example right if you're very specific um but at scale at scale the average public software leader gets about a third of their revenue outside of the US hubspot's now a majority the majority of hubspot's customers small businesses are outside of North America the majority um and so if you so let's back in terms of reverse engineering right if you there's a couple things if you don't lean into them you're going to have less Revenue than you otherwise would um International and partners are two of them if you try to only sell direct is an issue too um and so how do you do this how do you learn how to sell in France right Germany and Milan and London um it's not as complicated as it sounds um what you do is build your business build your brand right um be find a niche where you are one of the top two or three folks you don't have to be you don't have to beat HubSpot everywhere but find a little segment where you're better your little area and watch who wants to buy you and if you're in software what will happen is Australia New Zealand UK some parts of France and others are very used to buying from us companies they will find you if you are the best vendor they will find you you don't actually have to find them um now traditional Industries won't find you right it's going to be Tech focused folks it's going to be early adopters it's going to be cool kids but they will find you and as soon as you cross 5% of your Revenue in in an area then invest in it just invest in it as soon as you see a cluster in England or New Zealand or somewhere you didn't expect Chile or Brazil like support it um and then the cheat code this sounds obvious okay the one one is just support it like make your product open right this the the the one that takes work is also um localize your product earlier um and most of your engineers don't want to do this they don't want to loiz the product into Spanish and Portuguese turn turn it into 30 languages not super complicated engineering task but 95% of Engineers just don't want to do it for a variety of reasons so you know you can you can get going in the English is countries and even in Europe right but you're not going to penetrate certain areas if you don't actually localize your product but that that's the second cheat code the first one is just be be welcome to it you don't have to go hunt customers in Japan if you have zero like you don't have time as Founders going to Japan is like the worst place ever to go because the culture is so different and there's been so many failures of Japanese companies wanting to come to America and America to Japanese because the culture is like wildly different because I actually looked at uh a one of the ways that I researched cool company ideas is I like to look at Japanese publicly traded companies there's this one called uh usab base have you heard of usab Base so usab base is a it's a media company in Japan they own three products one of them was sort of like CB insights and it was doing 30 or 50 million in Revenue the second one was a news app called newsp that was doing another 30 million and then I think they had one more thing and I remember going and trying to download their app and it was all in Japanese and I couldn't really figure it out but I eventually like translated it and I was like I'm going to make this app in America and I'm gonna do it at the hustle and so I built out this like whole thing and I was going to launch it and everything and the culture of what they what they were trying to do it required users to leave feedback and opinions on news which which is like not so common here and I remember like [ __ ] why is this Japanese idea not working and then I realized I was just like reading Wikipedia or whatever and there's this whole term to describe the failure of American companies trying to break into Japan because the culture is so different and it scared me like hell to like do anything involving uh Asian cultures because our cultures are so different I'm like I can't never crack that whereas Germany France it's like mostly similar but uh yeah the whole Japanese thing freaks me out I'll give you two examples but like Salesforce got got had 10% of their revenue in Japan in the early days 10% now they didn't if you you can you can Google it you can see what Mark benof said they didn't plan it they got dragged into Japan and some of it was through Partnerships and others but my point is that wasn't on their day Zero plan okay but it took off there I was just talking with Howard lurman who um he's got a new company called Rome but he founded yex and took it up to a billion um and they were hug in Japan and we were talking about how he's going to do Japan the next time but they got dragged into Japan for small businesses they got dragged in so my point is don't don't show up to Japan with no traction asking asking for a tour in the city but if you if somehow in your first hundred customers first 500 you've got five in Japan don't don't don't dismiss them don't be snarky like some folks are don't say it doesn't matter in fact say oh my God we got five customers for Japan in our products not even in Japanese we've got something good here like let's take a pause and let's figure out what the heck is going on like Salesforce did and get 10% of our revenue from Japan that's how you do it is there a sweet spot for how much you charge I think with a lot of people starting out like what I did um like well my business was uh too prong in that we had users and then we had advertisers our advertisers were spending six figures a year but I had to acquire [ __ ] 4 million subscribers in order to like make it work and it was really hard um yeah and and so is there like a price point where you're like you want your average customer to be paying 50,000 a year I think that pricing is overd discussed and I'll tell you why there are we have all now bought 200 at least most businesses have bought over 200 SAS apps okay it's too many 200 pieces of business software and we all kind of know what stuff should cost like we know what notion should cost we know what HubSpot should cost we're on Riverside I don't know what Riverside is what do you guys pay 300 bucks a month okay like okay let's say you pay 300 bucks for bucks a month now if someone else has a better version of Riverside and they want 50,000 you're gonna like a month you're going to kind of B right but what if someone had something that was better than Riverside it was $30 a month it would seem too cheap right it would seem too cheap so my point is there are organic price points and what you want to do is anchor around them go figure out the couple of products out there that are most similar to yours and charge the exact same way and either charge the same pricing or if you're nervous charge a smidge lower 10% lower 20% lower um if you charge too much lower you're telling the market you're not as valuable as Riverside right or you're not as valuable as HubSpot and you can actually customers will bounce off you if you're too cheap if you're too cheap they will get confused um so anchor around the comps if you're truly 10 times more valuable than Riverside okay and Riverside's very good we're using it to record the session if you're 10 times more valuable maybe charge twice as much because you're telling the market we're 10 times more valuable than the leader right we're 10 times more valuable but whatever you do founders that say there's no one like us there's no comp try harder try harder it doesn't have to be the same as you just it feels the same it feels a similar amount of value a similar type of utilization do I use it eight hours a day do I use it once a month um do I use it as an API is it metered is it per seat just there's hundreds of apps like you and if you price similar to similar value apps you remove friction you remove friction from the sales process and that's what you want to do until you're really big you and this is why we also underpriced as Founders because you want to remove friction we want every deal to close in the early days don't we we want every deal to close and so your job as a Founder if you want to scale if you want to reverse engineer things your job because no one else in your company will do this your job is every day to relentlessly remove friction from your customer acquisition process remove friction and people add it at scale the classic one is contact me you know you go to a website you're all excited to buy on your own and I got to talk to a rep well they yeah there's a couple reasons one reason is they've gotten to hundreds of millions in revenue and they actually want to add friction to the sales process right but you don't want to do that until you're at tens of millions of Revenue you want to every day come into work and if you can't do anything else on your company remove friction how can I make sign up easier how can I add single sign on how can I make it easier to check out from my e-commerce thing how can I make the bundle Leisure how can I make support better remove friction having support that happens automatically in seconds rather than waiting five minutes on the dumb bubble that removes friction doesn't it Whatever It Takes remove friction the last point you have is uh the the most challenging it's uh getting to net net revenue retention of 100% yes and we've you you're I don't know how you would describe yourself I think of you as you're a you're a CEO founder type but I think that you have an edge on sales and operations the churn part I think and this is maybe me be naive I think that's mostly product maybe it's it relates to who you sell to and how you position it but it's like product and it's the hardest part is like figuring out how do I make something that integrates in someone's workflow or how do I make something that's so essential to someone's life that they not only do they not want to get rid of it they're going to tell their co-workers and their co-workers are also going to have to start using it it's so freaking hard and I think it's part art part science but you said that you have to have 100% net revenue retention the good news is that a lot of the big boys sucked at first I think Brian hallan I think he told me that they were turnning out something like at one point like five to 10% or maybe even more per month and he was like it was horrible and it took us four or five years to figure it out but what do you have to say about churn and retention how do you how do you make it good if you want to reverse engineer things to your point you need need to really honestly have a path from at a product level so that you can eventually get to that 100% right and you can stage it so I don't know if hubspot's if HubSpot really was turning 5% or more in the early days let's say its Revenue retention was more like 50% in the beginning okay I think he told me there was like a quarter or two where it was like uh existential crisis bad where it was like you know it was something like that I think they were like year four where it was like this is not going to work if we don't figure this out yeah well I know from when I talked to him it was 75% from him at like 30 million Revenue which is kind of late it's they still hadn't totally figured out until they went multi-product and a bit into the midsize of of SMB but the point is like on the one end yeah their VCS were critical blah blah blah blah but they did have a plan to get there they had a plan to get there they were going a little bit up Market a little bit up Market not a lot just a little bit into bigger small businesses and to have more than one product to add value and in fact it's interesting hubot nominally has raised prices but the pro the average customer today pays 11,000 the average customer two years ago paid 11,000 the average customer four years ago paid 10,000 okay so what HubSpot has done which a lot of folks don't do they get it wrong and this is why HubSpot is one of the reasons it's so suful is they're adding more value for the same dollar they're adding more value each year for the same doll that's software is supposed to be a service SAS software as a service we forgot about it in 2023 and late 202 became sof SAS became software as a ripoff everyone got massive price increases for no benefit right some folks will Grumble about HubSpot it has rageed prices but overall the prices haven't gone that much and now they have five times the amount of software that's 50 times more powerful right it's like 250 times better than when Brian started and that's what you've got to Aspire to as a Founder The Flip Side is here's the like if you have a high- turn business and HubSpot started there a lot of folks start in high- turn business be honest build a spreadsheet I know you and I talked a little bit about this in the hustle in the early days because you had high churn as a media business it's an inherent to immedia you had high subscriber turn okay you were stressed about this I actually wrongly wrongly challenged you to be less stressed because I thought you were you were a great founder and would figure it out but you got to put it in a spreadsheet and say look if you have churn north of 3% a month 3 four five and that is indemic to certain models look what gravity does to you around when you get to double digit Millions when you get to 10 million 15 million 20 million usually gravity weighs you down because you're losing so many customers each month it almost becomes impossible to replace that leaky bucket so we we the hustle was a daily newsletter we sent an email six days a week we were at 1 point I'm trying to remember we at 1.7 million subscribers we lost uh 50,000 subscrib or no maybe it's was 40,000 subscribers per month and we were adding like 4,000 a day or something like that it was insane can you imagine that losing 40,000 people and we're like how are we going to fix this and eventually we did but I know that like companies like I don't know what the hustle is at now I I assume I think they're close to 3 million subscribers and the turn is really low uh morning Brew is at like four and a half million subscribers and you want to know what all the newsletters do that people don't talk about so we grew organically to 100,000 subscribers I imagine many do too and once you then you do paid marketing to get to many millions and then you get a name after four or five years and then you quit advertising or you spend very little and you're just like we're just going to stay at 3.5 million three million subscribers and we're going to launch more newsletters that's the name of the the newsletter that's how you get to 100 million in revenue for newsletters it's the exact same thing as software which is you go multi-product but except unlike subscri software the churn is outrageous and but thankfully the market size is like 30 million people but it's it's like crazy high the but that that ties to the point of being very self-aware about this right and that turn so you you turned out you had like you're churning out I I'm getting that math wrong but I think you were turning out about 30% of your growth each month right in that in that phase right uh it was uh four so if we sent an email to a million people and uh if we had a million subscribers in one month and we sent six times a week times four that's 24 times uh a month we would lose roughly four and a half% of the million so that's that three to 5% churn we talked about right and on the way up it's sort of okay because the hustle is exploding and there's viral elements and it's great but eventually gravity that's the gra you got to be honest about gravity and come up with a strategy to address it right for small businesses that that that math just it it's you know and you I think you would Echo this around 10 million in Revenue you need so much growth to overcome that churn right you need like epic epic like you can't even it's not even what your gut says as a Founder you need so you need double digit growth per month here's the Insight you need double digit growth per month to overcome that churn at scale right you need double well and and you you need to understand which business you're in so you're in the conference business now I was in the conference business sort of I think my conference business was doing over the handful of years I think we probably did three million in Revenue you do 30 million in one year so we're not in the same ballpark but what I learned with the conference business is it sucks it sucks hard uh and for some reason I still love it and same with media I freaking love it but it's way harder I think and why are you in conference business if you're supposed to know all of this great stuff about software because software seems like we only we all work the same amount of hours per per week like it just seems like just start a software company why start a conference business where you're you're in kind of an uphill battle it's a good question I mean the um do you guys do you guys make a profit on 30 million yeah we do but you have but we've got to so SAS annual is our big Flagship event and so we get 12 12,000 people in the Bay Area now it's every September it costs $10 million to turn the lights on that's a stressor it costs $10 million to turn the lights on okay before you make a dollar okay so $1,000 dollar an attendee is your cost yeah about $1,000 dollar per attendee is the full the honest fully burden cost about a thousand we do we do one in Europe in June for 3500 that's much cheaper um that'll be about $300 to turn the lights well $300 per attende but it's still like a million and a half to $2 million to turn the lights on okay two Mill million and a half and 10 million what's the so you've got to get over that and then you've got to pay people right and then you've got other expenses so until you cross if if it's funny I get it is a terrible business we should talk about I literally had a VC managing 500 million in Revenue making millions and millions a year just in fees with a good track record called me the other day saying they wanted to build a conference business because investing so hard n it's like dude you still get you still get paid if there's a natural disaster or like a rainstorm that was like my whole thing I'm like dude I'm working I'm working so hard for this freaking conference and if it rains attendance is down like it just sucks like one or two one or two days of like some crazy weather or something can like change things terrible um the reason we did it was on accident we built this community around content right so we built content and then it's a community and yeah we got some newsletters and some podcasts are not quite at your scale but they have some scale um and then we just did meetups and just so many people came to the meetups in the beginning you've done them and this is a long time ago like this sounds small today but our first Meetup in 2013 we had 800 people come and these were great cosos great cosos right cosos that now are are have gone public or have nine figure businesses and they all came and that what I I didn't know it would be a business but I knew we had product Market fit so I wanted to build then I did another Meetup and the other meet up had a thousand and we had to turn people away and then then we did a one-day event just to do it I didn't it wasn't a business I outsourced the first two years I never even looked at a financial statement now the first two years I had a partner he kept all the profit or the revenue I just drove the engagement right in the content um and so this by the second year we had 3,000 people and there was demand so the real reason I got into the business Sam wasn't because I wanted to because after the second year he quit my partner quit and didn't want to do it anymore because it was too much work so I quit I had no ability to do this I had no team I had no blueprint I didn't know how the revenue or the finances worked and I had to learn for the third year from scratch and so it wasn't intentional um I felt like the a community wanted this that there was demand organic demand and um but yeah it is a terrible business once it got once it got now you can do the math in your head right once it got over 15 million in Revenue it finally generated actual profits right but that's a lot of years not fake 15 not pretending you're at 15 not not claiming Revenue that's not real but you got to really just get over 15 to clear the nut but they um so a lot of trade show businesses um on the high end can sell for 15 times earnings um but a lot of them can go for eight or 10 if it's like a B2B uh trade show there's a bunch of companies a hand or more a handful a handful yeah the best ones can go for 20 times if if it's been around for 40 years and it's an annuity at that point and for some reason it's always British companies a lot of British companies Buy trade shows there's informa there's Euro money there's a bunch of them would you ever sell yeah Hive they bought my friend Ryan dice's company I believe the traffic Summit uh yeah would you uh what could you sell saster for and would you do it we've had two folks that have approached us to buy saster over the years I wouldn't say we've ever had like a a term sheet to to to be on the table um the learning from that is it's really been based on comps I know we talk about IAH and blah blah blah but really been based on comps right and Shop talk was bought for 150 million at about our size probably under uh they got a good deal and money 2020 sold for a good deal it sold for 100 million when it was only doing 10 million Revenue but both were like iconic dude let's talk about that let's talk about that uh the guy who started those companies in is in Hampton I've got to know him that guy is amazing um what what off the charts and then he sold he sold another company for 30 million but listen these guys started a Google these guys started a tech company I believe like a payment company they sold it to Google for $100 million they went and started a conference it kicked ass they sold it for something like 50 or 100 I foret sold money 2020 for 100 million and now it's doing 100 million then they did it again with shop talk which is like a trade show for d d Toc now I for what's the other Founders name there's a it's a white guy and an Indian guy the white guy has a new one Nam um it's called Health okay that I don't know that I don't know I I know an Neil I know a little bit I know Neil a little bit Yeah HL T you got to look at this because here's what these guys do they it's the website is all the same yeah um it's like the same avatars for and it's like the same graphic design is it looks just like shop talk or money 2020 it's the same thing again and again they do the same thing and he's and he's done this like four times I I think this is their fourth time that they've created a new trade show I should have known it I see it now yeah have you so I think this is significantly larger than shop talk and 2020 and so health is like a it's they do these trade shows where they get all it's B what a trade show basically is what a lot of people don't realize it's basically a u Marketplace that lasts for three days and so you get a combination of buyers and sellers and you hope that you create some type of transaction and what he does is he charges people so you can go for free but you have to offer up a 30 minutes of your time to be pitched I believe to set up a meeting um or you could pay money to set up a meeting with a yeah they're they're 800 bucks per per 10-minute meeting now at shop talk so I don't know what they are at Health they're $800 for a quick meeting and these guys pick a variety of niches where they're like all right there's a bunch of buyers and sellers in this market and they scale up these trade shows faster than anyone I've ever seen I think epic and a lot of people don't know this they they run other companies the the guy I'm referring to I'll find out his name he is he's also on the board of a of a large private Equity Firm like these guys are killers and for some reason they pick trade shows as their main thing which it boggled everyone's mind was like why would a bunch of tech guys who can like make their money in significantly easier ways start a freaking trade show they've knocked it out the park it's it's like a gem of a business this study they are gems I will say I only know Anil a little bit the other co-founder of these multiple companies mondy 20120 in shop talk but it is interesting in terms of convergent evolution that he got into it by accident too how so they built money 2020 to support their fintech they didn't build money 2020 originally to be a standalone business they built it to support their startup like many of us do events to support our companies right Jonathan Wier the guy okay I don't know him I know the other one but it took off it took it took off money 2020 took off then shop talk was a that they did was was a heat seeking missile right they act like it was this was totally tactical and they even gave up on a lot of things and just did the these um paid meetings right they just did it and going back to the conversation how do you get into something sometimes you you plan it out on a whiteboard and sometimes though like these guys for these these event it found them it found them and then they then they leaned into it and became experts but I know I've I don't know Jonathan but I do know anilo but I remember talking with him the last time I saw him in person and he's like man this is a hard business so you think and he built he like us he or like me he'd built a software business um and uh it is it is hard I don't know I would just caution folks like anything everything's harder than it looks to get into I would just caution folks that there aren't aren't a lot of shortcuts and you need I'm sure that the hlth is wildly successful but you got to be it's like this is one of these businesses where if you're not in the top two you're worthless you're worthless you have no value at all nothing because they are marketplaces why you going to go why you going to go to the fourth tier event in an industry and in fact most of them died at in 2020 most of the fourth tier stuff died it it sort of stumbled around uh when we all worked together in in the office and in the Bay Area but most of them never came back only the best ones really came back after after lockdown let me ask you one last question um you are an investor so you've you've raised money for your own startups and now your latest one's bootstrapped and you're an investor you've deployed tens or hundreds of millions of dollars into companies I have a theory I think that if you are if you're if you're if Building Wealth in a five or 10 period is your number one or number two priority for starting a company company yes you should basically raise no money or very little money and you should not raise Venture Capital do you agree or disagree with that if your goal is to get the first points on the board to make your first Millions yeah I think what you call it you use the word shekels a lot or nickels if you want to get a few nickels no your first it's a lot if you want to get the money to not work for the man where we started this conversation listen all the stuff's harder than it looks it's all hard as we know but if you want to have an exit for 10 to $30 million 10 to $50 million which is still harder than it looks statistically right but north of 10 then yeah you want to raise only a fraction of that don't raise that much so ra if you raise here's a simple way to think about it if you raise a couple million dollars which is hard like it's not it looks easy on the Internet it's hard but if you raise a couple million dollars you've lost no optionality the only thing you've suffered is some delution the only thing you've suffered is some delution after a couple million the game changes after a couple in the game changes and so yeah I I I think there's something to be said for raising nothing but most people raise nothing because they can't raise anything I think there's even more to be said if you can of RA being one and done anywhere from half a million to two million whatever you conclude together and you use it to not to pay yourself that's that's what losers do you use it to hire a few good people to drisk this investment to accelerate this investment you use it to hire a few good people and get it off the ground most of us need a little help like some folks just literally they can do it on their own they're twoo great Engineers they don't need any help they can go do it on their own most of us are not those people especially if you're a a business person it's harder to do it on your own right unless you build something on WordPress or or tools it's hard to do on your you need a little bit of money but stop there you you not only do you maintain control and have less delution but then any exit works then any exit Works once you raise more than 10 million um it can be worth it but if you raise more than 10 million here's and this goes your point this people don't get this and today's world if you raise more than 10 million you're signing up for a billion dollar exit and anything less than that is a disappointment it just might not even work out like there's so many variables you may run out of money you might not get people once you start raising $10 million you get addicted to burning more money too there's lots of issues that that creep out from that but you got to commit to a billion if you don't see a billion dollar if you don't feel it in your bones then don't raise double digigit Millions just don't do it it's not it's not generally not worth it find a way to do it with less and um and everyone will be chill if you raise single digit millions or less and sell for whatever everyone will be chill everyone will be chill they're not chill once you get to the Double Digit Millions it ain't it ain't chill for a long list of reasons people start expecting a lot and too many folks these days think that um venture capital is free it has no cost um the the social contract between investors and Founders Has Broken Bren down the last three years it has broken down um I I literally just suffered my worst investing loss ever I'm 10x lifetime I suffered my worst investing loss ever worst loss ever five million of not all of my Capital some of it's mine five million out of 200 okay so it's not going to change the pace but I've never lost this much money and you know what the founder said I hard what you care it's not really your money what do you care it's not really your money what do you say that care I could honestly Sam I could I had to bring in a friend to deal with him I couldn't talk to him again I spent years of my life helping him I helped him raise all his money I put him in all of our saster events for free I promoted him constantly for years and then he says what do you care it's not your money I remember when I took a little bit of Angel money and I and I remember thinking like I am like a steward a steward of this C I was like I have to die to get a return that's how I felt though but kids don't feel that way these days I was like it's my life's Mission now I have just like because to take someone's hard ear money I felt so much stress I felt stress I remember when I hired someone who had a kid I was like oh I have a kid now and then I remember feeling the stress when I took someone's money I'm like this person just trusted me with $25,000 I better go hungry or die in order to get a return from them because if they if someone loses my money I'm gonna want to beat them up you know what I mean I was like it's like a big deal like this is someone's mortgage that I I just took from them I better make this get a good return Jason I appreciate you doing this man uh where do you where do people find you on Twitter you're you're a Twitter guide now instead of kaora even though you got famous on Kora so Kora was great for five years

be effective not efficient most people who want to be productive they think about efficiency how do I get the most done in the least amount of time I fall in that category the problem is that it's easy to mistake motion with progress and just because you do something well or fast doesn't make that thing important it is far more important to just identify what is the right thing for me to spend my energy on and I might waste an hour thinking about that thing before I even put my hands on the keyboard or try to do something I focus on effect whereas I think most people focus on efficiency

where are you keeping your to-dos or your ideas I don't have a list I have two things I have the big thing I call it my one big thing I'm doing today and the question I ask myself in the morning is what's the one outcome that I'm working on that if I just did that one thing today would be a win whereas what most people do is what are all the things I have to do today and that becomes this long checklist all to-dos are not created so I proactively try to figure out what's the one big thing I set that out and then I do that thing and then anything else I do that day is gravy

I'm like I should create this and then I looked in the mirror and I was like yeah this ain't going to work there's a reason your nickname is the vanilla gorilla okay like it wasn't going to [Music] work so Sam I got a question for you you have launched this business this year called Hampton and I love the name I love the brand I go to the website I love the website more than anything I love the idea uh me I'm jealous of this idea Andrew Wilkinson was said I'm so jealous that I didn't start this idea we I feel like you got so much right and I know that the that in doing any idea whatever you you know there's something called the idea maze you go through you wander around you try to figure out the right path and you C you if you're lucky you pop out the other side with what you did with Hampton where everything turned out right what I want to know is what were the other paths you considered but ended up saying no to along the way because nobody sees that stuff that's on The Cutting Room floor I want to know you know I love the name Hampton were there other names that you thought about and like how did you pick that one and like what was that decision process I want to know target market like you I feel like you nailed the target market and you nailed the value prop were there three other runner-ups that you consider that you didn't have I kind of want to see what goes on underneath the surface before this beautiful execution comes out well first thanks you you you you hopefully only see the good stuff obviously there's all types of bad [ __ ] that happens on the on the back end where we're like this sucks but in general it's been quite Pleasant so dude with this company it's so funny I purposely had on we had guests that ran these types of companies and I wanted to prove to everyone I'm go I'm going to do my research in front of people you left a paper trail right like you left public breadcrumbs as to exactly how you did this step by step and by the way I love that you're honest about this because you definitely had guests come on and basically explain to you what the blueprint is and then you were like cool thanks going to go execute on that blueprint and um and I didn't hide it from them I I told them I I told them before and after I'm want to launch I want to launch I'm thinking of launching something like this and let's talk about it right so there was nothing unethical or evil about this but yeah I wanted to do it publicly so people could see so the so let me tell you first so I sold the hustle I think in 22 Yeah and uh or something like that and I had about six months or eight months or 10 months I forget where I was just kind of fooling around and I was looking at different ideas the two ideas that lost I'm so thankful they lost one remember how I got super into airbnbs I was like this is the thing I could do this so I bought one and I did it and it did okay but I was like this sucks I I do not enjoy this this does this isn't in my zone of Genius it's a pain in the ass and it seems on paper like a good idea you had a you created this Facebook group of I forgot what you called like Sam's short-term rental Bros or whatever the hell you call it what was it the Str Str crew the Str Str crew shortterm rental crew and people piled in and they started explaining their blueprint they're like yo I own 40 airbnbs they make this much cash flow here's the pain points here's the plus sides this other guy's like oh I do the same thing with this angle and I was like dude this is fascinating Sam's doing his research again in public and you were wandering around the idea maze you're like maybe it's over here maybe the maybe the exit path is over here in this short-term rentals thing and it kind of seemed like a good idea uh on paper but you ended up saying no to that and and it was a good idea it wasn't a good idea for me it it is a profitable thing whatever it was cool the second thing that I thought about doing was I thought about creating I've always wanted to create a trucking business I'm I'm passionate about truckers I'm passionate about blue collar workers my family I grew up in a trucking family sort of my they work in that industry and so I was like I'm G to become a YouTuber and I'm G to create an audience of truckers and then I'm going to build a product for them and then I started like doing it and I was like no hate this not GNA do it you're like I love the idea of blue color workers yeah I like the idea of it among yeah yeah it's like getting a neck tattoo it's like the idea of it's kind of neat but I don't know if I actually want it um and so then I was like look we had this thing called trends at the hustle and I got a lot wrong and I love the business model still I think I can do this and my partner my now business partner and I uh we had like basically a Therapy Group where we would like [ __ ] and complain about everything going on and we're like I settled on that product you built a product launched it did not use your audience initially publicly you didn't use the podcast to promote it initially maybe your brand your brand name helped in private but you didn't do it publicly and you drove you you drove it to millions of dollars in Revenue um very early on so very successful thing that everybody listen podcast kind of wants that outcome so so you know you're a Walkin case study go ahead yeah so Hampton is a peer group so some people call it a community I call it a peer group basically there's three parts of the peer group so you have an eight person group that have uh like similar size or types of companies and you basically it's like a therapy crew you just complain so it takes about six months to like really like for it to like catch and be awesome but I have a six person or eight person group it's freaking awesome and you will do everything like you uh someone will make a presentation for every meeting and they'll say like here's my portfolio here's my net worth can you guys tell me am I doing something wrong am I doing something right here's how my company Works what am I doing wrong what am I doing right and so they do a presentation so that's part one part two is we have a digital Community where you can like Post in there and see what other people are saying and you could like hey I'm trying to hire Nanny um what are your guys's best uh advice for agencies to use in the Northeast things like that you can do personal stuff nonpersonal stuff the third thing is events I think we host 200 events a year at this point uh including Retreats all these types of things so um it's highly uh inspired by Chief YPO vistage these are large companies that are in the space so that's the business originally I was trying to go after Marketing Executives and then just Executives in general dude I called I did 50 to 70 meetings with people trying to convince them to join and none of them wanted it hello dear marketing executive yeah anyway how goes your marketing today no one [ __ ] wanted it I couldn't and then eventually I was like I I need to charge like around 10 grand a year in order to make this like a viable business no one [ __ ] wanted it they were willing to pay $500 and I created a group that was actually $500 and I was like dude this sucks I can't do this and then my and then we were like should we do doctors doctors would be cool um but like what the [ __ ] I don't know anything about doctors I try to get a i get in touch with ton and like no one wanted it and then I was like Fortune 500 CEOs same problem like how do I get in touch with the Fortune 500 CEO like I don't I don't know one like it is really hard and then ideas that sound good on paper but as soon as they came into contact with reality they got punched in the face and they ran homech in the face well this one really punched me in the face the next one we thought about minorities we're like uh you know my my wife is a minority and I like hear a little bit of the things that she goes through I'm like I should create this and then I look in the mirror and I was like yeah this ain't going to work I'm the opposite of a minority uh business look great on paper but yeah reflection does in the mirror yeah I remember when you told me that idea and I was like dude honestly it's a great idea I think it's an underserved Community I think they want that Career Development I think that I think that makes sense but I was like dude what are you going to do when you're like hey I was like you know are you g to have Sarah be the CEO like what are you GNA do you're G be like I am this this white man who's running this like I don't know you possible but like I don't know if you Google the word white bread you're gonna see a picture of s par like it like it it would not have worked there's a reason your nickname is the vanilla gorilla okay like it wasn't going to work and then uh my partner was like dude let's just go after CEOs and he' been saying this whole time I'm like they will never pay for this but all along some people had heard rumors I was launching this so they asked me like can you do this for us and kept saying no and then finally we're like [ __ ] it let's do it and then that obviously was the right decision but by the way I did a ton of research so I interviewed a ton of members of all these different groups and they're like I'm a tech guy but there's it's all like guys who own like 18 apartment buildings in South Florida in my group it kind of sucks like I love them but we don't like aign on business well it just sounds like it's better founder fit right like you know it's a who it's who our audience is on this podcast it's where you had a reputation it's where you knew the relatable pain points it's you knew how to you knew where to reach them because you knew where you hang out you it's like way better found it was so much easier it was way easier all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net wors and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I can see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM now let's talk about the names here's a good story about the names so the company's called Hampton a lot of people think that means the Hamptons um up until I was like 27 I didn't know what the Hamptons were I thought I had read about it in like The Great Gatsby I thought like it was like that I didn't even know what it was until I married a woman from that area and I learned about it so what I do is all of my llc's are named after streets in my neighborhood of St Louis and there's a lot of really good names for some reason and so I just usually look at the map of where I'm from and I just look at the names so let me tell you some names that I thought about naming it none of these really fit but they could fit for other things number one is Macklin I love that name so at one point I thought about having the mlin running club um the second one is sablet I've always liked sablet uh the third one was Simpson that was a street I grew up near and then the last one check this out King's Highway is Kings Highway awesome I love King's Highway I love King's Highway and then eventually we settled on Hampton because I grew up near Hampton Avenue and everyone thinks that it means the Hamptons it doesn't it means Hampton and so sometimes PE people will say like oh I love the Hamptons referring to my company and I'm like no it's Hampton so we settled on Hampton because that had a good uh that had a good sound to it by the way can you tell me in deciding a name uh is that like a one day process a one hour process a one month process for you and are bouncing it off people or are you just going into a dark room and saying what feels right in my soul like what's your what is the actual way a name gets picked for you I only ask like three people usually it's my wife my business partner and that's about it three people but actually there's only two even better did I just name two and myself the Royal we yeah um no I don't really ask too many people because I just don't care that much like I just want to like hear someone's gut opinion but um and also hampton.com I don't think I'm ever going to get you know who owns that is Marriott yeah the Hampton in yeah uh so I don't know if I'm ever gonna get that but check this out with branding if you ask me about this five or 10 years ago I never in a million years thought this was important but I actually do I hired a branding agency so I paid $155,000 right out the gate and what I did was and I sent this to you I created this document and and it says it just says one line it says Elite but cheeky and the reason I was inspired by that was have you read Felix Dennis's book yes how to get so Felix Dennis is this famous entrepreneur he he's dead now but he was a wild guy he was basically a combination of Richard Branson and MC Jagger so he had like Swagger but he was like a legit business guy um but he like was he was like Elite and that he was great at what he does but he was like a silly person and he uh wrote in a very conversational way and I love that and so when I wrote out this branding document I listed what the business is who uses it whatever and then what I did was I listed a ton of ads that I liked so there's a a bunch of adver Ms from the 70s that's one of my favorite eras for ads and I found a bunch of GQ ads Porsche ads and Rolex ads like Rolex had this famous series of ads called The Men Who Built the world wear Rolex and they would do like a really cool expose on like an astronaut and you could see the astronaut he's wearing a Rolex or Dwight Eisenhower the president of the United States he's got a Rolex and it's the men who build America are wearing a Rolex and then there's one with the Wall Street journals where it says Money Talks we translate and it's a this beautiful imagery and so I took that imagery and then I took the color British racing green you know what British racing green is I mean it's the Hampton colors but it's like a famous color from like Land Rover and jaguar it's like these British racing colors that I love and I thought that because like when I think of a Land Rover or Range Rover or Jaguar what you got there there you go that that's almost so I I freaking love that color that's my favorite color I've got motorcycles in that color I've had a car in that color it's my favorite color and I that color and I'm like we have to make the brand feel like these ads but be that color and I wrote a bunch of sentences that I would want on the website and that's how we selected The Branding and dude hiring a branding agency is like a total hack what are some things along the way of making Hampton that you could have done but you said no to and in retrospect maybe it was a good idea bad idea you don't know you don't know how it would have turned out but like what were the nose because we can only see what you said yes to we could see the the name you chose you told us what names you said no to we could see the color you chose what were the things you said no to along the way was there anything else that was like a path you considered here's two really uh big ones so Hampton gets let's just say these aren't the exact numbers but we'll use them roughly 100 people a day who apply we accept a fraction of that and my partner Joe and I we watch so in order to get into Hampton you have to interview we watch 100% of the interviews and we are the only people who click approve or deny that is it it was us too that is our job is to watch 100% of the interviews so you said no to delegating that out we said no to delegating that out and we also here's what sucks dude we turn down so many people and it's like we're turning down so much revenue and it [ __ ] kills me I'm like adding up the numbers when I now when you ask me so Chief uh cheap.com it's it's like this business I guess we're like them but they're for women Executives you know why they grew so fast they grew to 100 million in Revenue in four or five years they let in 100% of the people who apply in interview we don't and it [ __ ] kills me I see all this mis revenue and I'm like oh my God and so I'm picking in my head I'm like so a lot of people uh we've talked about this but Kingsford Charcoal was invented because Ford had all this extra wood that they used to light their furnaces and they eventually turn into charcoal that's how kings for charcoal came about and so always in my head I'm like What's the charcoal I could make from these people who we've rejected or who don't fit our criteria at the moment and but we've said no to doing any of those ideas and so we're all what we said basically we're only focusing on CEOs of this demographic uh of this type of business and we're only going to do that until we say otherwise and there's no time in the near future that we intend to say otherwise well let me tell you two things I think you could be doing so let me give you two ideas I think you maybe should have said yes to number one I think uh if I go to website right now I don't see that you say no to that many people or that it's a that there's a cur that how heavy the curation is all the things you just said to me would make me want to join because like oh they're really actually curating the community these are actually high quality people the founders watch every single interview they let they accept in less than 1% of people they have a counter on their website of how many people they've said no to or how many uh how much revenue they've said no to in order to make the community solid because that comes first and we put our money where our mouth is we turn down this much revenue I maybe maybe it's too too vulgar but like I think you could use that the second thing you got the elite part right now now now we have to make it cheeky yeah yeah exactly I just went Elite douchy so I don't know we gotta work on the other part um the other thing I don't think you did did a great job of is your story so like would do you do you value a founding story in uh or like the founder story and the founding story of the company do you think that's important or useful I think that's incredibly important and I think I made a mistake because I wanted to make this not the SAR business and I think I've screwed up I think I should have leaned into that I think the way it works I did this with the hustle you can H the founder can be the company or be the face for a period of time and you could phase it out and with this time I was like I'm not going to be it and I screwed that up yeah yeah I think you should lean into that because you the situations where you don't want the founder to be the the the face and the reason to join is when the founder has to deliver the service it's like the the law firm or the the specialty you know marketing exec it's like oh this guy's great but oh now I'm handed off to some Junior person they're doing my marketing I want that guy on my account whereas with this you don't have to be the account you you're not delivering the actual service um so I think you could use it because the true founding story is that's how we met we made a pure Group in San Francisco when we didn't know [ __ ] when we were running our companies and there was our compies could fail or succeed and in that group came a billion dollar company a100 million company a $30 million company a two failures but one best man at your wedding and a friend who you ended up investing in their thing and that came out of that and then this podcast came out of that which then has become one of the top business podcast blah blah blah like that's actually almost like your founding story as an entrepreneur and helped you when you actually sold the hustle successfully so from I remember in our peer groups it was like I'm Gonna Do the Hustle it was an events business then no no no next month no it's not an events business it's a Blog business you said something that stuck with me and it was it pissed it pissed you off no no because you weren't wrong you were right in that I couldn't build a huge company that way but you were wrong in that I don't have to build a huge company in order to achieve my goals which was you go dude you're showing up to this fight you're showing up to this knife fight with just a knife I don't even want you to have a gun you need to have a magic [ __ ] wand and I was like well you're not wrong that would be nice to have that but I but I don't and so until then we're using our fist in Sil Valley if you go pitch for investors you're basically making I promise this is going to be a billion dollar company so I was like I don't think this going to be a billion dollar company what I didn't know is you were like I'm not trying to build a billion dollar company I'm trying to build a company that makes me X millions of dollars in like and I could do it it could actually do that and that would change my life be [ __ ] awesome which is a different U pitch so you were right but where where I was wrong was I shouldn't have aimed for that in the get from the GetGo right but you were correct but so I think you know maybe using a founding story would be helpful for you because it's genuine that's actually you know the origin of I think you know a lot of this is like firsthand experience how the peer group helped you and how blah blah blah and then how it also leads to all these other thing that group became you know one guy's like you know a groomsman at your wedding another guy becomes an investment you make down the road blah blah blah like that's that's kind of how these tend to work so anyways that's my my two cents well thank you did you have you ever used a branding agency um have I used I used a guy for the milk Road not I mean he's an agency but it's like a guy one guy uh this guy which I think you actually I think you nailed that to be honest yeah I L it it was a cool experience it definitely felt so indulgent it's like and now I'm going to take a break from my zero Revenue business to go through this mood boarding process with this designer and talk about how the brand needs to feel it's like it needs to feel like there's a user and a customer and there's a definitely a part of my voice that was like shut up shut up you idiot go go build your business but what we did the the the trade-off we did was we actually with milro we wanted to do a brand right away and we said let's reward ourselves with a brand when we get to I think we said 100,000 subscribers on the on the list and I said today we're gonna make the brand and but when we get to 100,000 then we'll know like this is we can always Rebrand we can we can polish it up that's what we did to reward ourselves I think in the future I would probably use an agency if I'm confident about the idea if I uh it's also just like I don't know it's a luxury item it's not a necessity but it's a luxury I think for some things it is a necessity like if you're e-commerce brand or something you got to get your brand right and you know another thing that I thought was the dumbest thing ever but I think could be cool a naming agency I used a naming agency once I I find a lot of value in that now I think that it's like most agencies where a lot will suck but I actually think that could be quite valuable what what naming how much of the I hir this is one of my many rookie mistakes I hired a naming agency once I paid them $225,000 a lot of money and hey and they came in now let me tell you a couple things about them that's interesting one the people who work in a naming agency are actually awesome somebody who is drawn to that is a super interesting person and actually the move is to go vet branding agencies or naming agencies and then just pluck the most interesting person you have and be like you're gonna run our whole brand come over just come in house you're gonna run our whole brand that's what I should have done and just just the audacity that they think that they could just name something they think that could be the job who do you think think you are it's like that's crazy so the guy they come in and there's three of them and I'm like it takes three to do this oh my God and so the three of them come in and they sit down and they say so tell me about tell me about the company and when I tell you I've never felt as much pressure in a pitch because I'm like this isn't pitching for an investor or a customer I'm like I need to give these creative because creative people like that they're very skeptical you know they see a bunch of corporate BS it's like I need to be cool and so clear and I need to capture the essence inside this business I can't just say the surface that's what they want they were like yeah but but what is it and you're like I just told you what it is what do you mean what is it so anyways I have this conversation with them and then I'm like I want to know this guy's process and so I leave the room he comes I come back in smokes a bunch of weed style in the middle of the room he's moved our table to the side he's sitting in the floor with a white I took our whiteboard put it on the ground and he's writing long sentences and I'm like this is not names like this is like paragraphs what are you doing and he's just writing out almost in first person this was awesome actually he was writing out in first person uh I think we were doing a dating app at the time so he he was helping us with a dating app he was just writing out like from first person almost venting as the customer he's like I don't download a dating app I download dating apps all of them every single one of them it's embarrassing and he's like I've tried them all I use them all and I hate them all but I use them I I hate use them and and he's like I hate them because it's mostly me sitting there sending out messages that are not getting replies and I just and and then the next message I sent I know this is probably not going to reply that's a pretty hopeless feeling at least if I go up to a girl at a bar she rejects me to my face online cowards these women are cowards and he's like they don't even well so then he's he's just venting and he's like and he's scratching stuff out because he's like no that's not really true but it was almost like slam poetry it's like he was trying to like almost get into the feeling of the problem and then the solution and he was but he was doing it not in a business planny way but way I really actually like that process and I kind of hijacked that so I paid a very expensive 25k to learn that one process which is actually very useful as a copywriter to to like get to the essence of like what you're trying to do the name ended up sucking and like they did all these exercises where they would be like they put out these flash cards that were like Branson Elon Musk Einstein they're like pick pick two that you think fit then they'd be like Corvette Rolex Louis Vuitton blah BL blah pick two and then I'm like dude what is this personality quiz and I was just like I hated the whole process and then whatever the name was whatever it was I don't I don't even remember now the name remember the name I'm sorry this a very unsatisfying end ending to it but um how do you not remember the name that they picked that's say la that's what you should have called the [ __ ] app the app like failed by the time they gave us the name we were like this is a stupid idea we don't know how to do this app let's move on I still think it's worth it by the way uh I still think it's worth it I think that's a lot of money though 25 Grand is a lot I think I paid my branding agency 15,000 yeah it's hard though when you once you start to fall into that hole you're like well do I want the best brand or just a mediocre brand like how much is my brand going to be worth is it not worth an extra 5K it's very hard to say no dude at least for me that's ridiculous um is that the Pod well let's let's recap real quick it took you you did your research in public it took you five false starts on figuring out who is the customer and the way you did it was you had an idea that sounded good in theory and then you went and tried to contact them and be like do you want this and then you got like punched in the face five times and then one of them looked great but then like no founder fit and you settled on what was probably the obvious idea that's like the first takeaway second takeaway um your name is awesome the name is awesome but you use streets around you okay I don't know if anyone else wants to copy that mine would be uh Grand FL Boulevard which I don't think he going to make for a great startup name no s s San Francisco has a bunch of good names too well that's why I used to live when I was a kid I think show I think we should show the deck that you made for The Branding agency because you this is not what they gave you this is what you gave them to get a good output you know because you garbage in garbage out if you give the bad instructions or bad prompt you're G to get a bad result on the brand so I think that's cool to show and I think you know maybe one one other thing that I think people could take away is using a Founder story I think a Founder story is very powerful and I think I need to fix that so I just got like $25,000 worth of advice for free so that's good I appreciate that you you got my VMO um all right is that it is that the pod that's it that's the [Music] pod

all right Sean you tweeted something that has made me incredibly envious of you you said the joy of living an unscheduled life and it kind of pissed me off because I want that and I know that you got a lot of messages one of our friend emailed you and said something like dude how on Earth do you have this unscheduled life and so I actually have the same question I want to spend this episode actually asking you all about it tell me everything about this unscheduled life I need to know how you can get so much done by having nothing on your [Music] calendar [Music] well let's do a definition so what is what do I mean when I say the unscheduled life the unscheduled life all it means is this today or right now even next hour you are going to do the most important or interesting thing to you right now not what you thought might be the most important thing two weeks ago when somebody put something on your calendar because that's how I used to live right I used to wake up and look at what's on my calendar and it's like wait wa wait why is the calendar in charge and where did this even come from oh this is a meeting I agreed to two weeks ago or this is a recurring one-on-one with this person but it's not necessarily the thing that I actually think I should be investing my time and my energy into it's not where my brain is it's not what I have inspiration on it's not the most important thing so what I did was I just went to my calendar and I just clicked delete delete delete delete I just deleted everything and I just said well I'm going to live an unscheduled life meaning if you want to call me like the the text message I tweeted out yesterday somebody was like dude this is awesome we were having a good text chat and he's like this is awesome I would love to jam on this sometime maybe next week and I just said I'm free call me right now because I'm in the moment we're inspired by this right now we're both agreeing that this is really interesting and we should explore if there's something here well why would we wait a week and let that you know inspiration is perishable it's like an avocado it turns brown what were you doing when they started texting you I was at that moment I was well I was texting them but uh but in general I didn't have like a thing I had to do I have what I call blocks of time so if you've ever read the Paul gram post maker versus manager schedule it's a kind of must read for anybody who wants to build [ __ ] anybody who's a creator of any kind whether you're a content creator you're you're an engineer you're product Creator um you're a writer whatever you do maker versus manager schedule is very important I'm able to live the unscheduled life because I'm not a manager anymore I am not operational anymore but that didn't happen by accident and I I made it so that I wouldn't be that way and basically if you look at a manager schedule versus a maker schedule a manager schedule is what you described it's a zebra calendar every 30 minutes there's something that thing is usually put on there by your assistant or by an employee or a partner or somebody else a sales call that gets booked on your calendar and you just hop from thing to thing to thing and you're constantly switching and you're constantly doing and for me that was exhausting I didn't like it and I didn't I felt busier than ever and less productive than ever and I had to like shake it up I read that post and I decided to make a change and the maker schedule basically just says break your day into a couple of parts so you might have a morning Sprint an afternoon Sprint or a nighttime Sprint if you're like a creative night out and a Sprint is roughly 90 minutes to two hours you might schedule three hours because you're going to puts around a little bit you don't immediately just kind of get into the thing but in reality you're probably only going to be productive for about 90 minutes and then you you take a break um and you just work on the thing where you the thing that is the most interesting thing that's top of mind for you or the most important thing that you feel like you really want to throw your entire creative being into so that's what I do and what that leaves is a bunch of free time so when this guy was like Hey you know we're talking and it's like this is interesting I have a bunch of open space on the calor that I can fill with whatever is the most interesting thing in the moment it's kind of like a a Zen way of being present when you're doing that n 90 minute Sprint what part of your home are you sitting in and who's around you I have a place I go to my special place for me that's my office I also have just like this bedroom that I can go into if I'm like if I've been in the office let's say I just need to switch I just need to switch of some kind or a walk so going for a walk so I basically have three venues I go to each has his own purpose this office here is like creativity I got the Whiteboard I got the camera I got my big monitor if I need to do something that's a presentation or visual in some way I have the bedroom where I have a the EM lounge chair so if I if I'm doing reading I'll go there and I set a timer so like like I will time box everything that I'm doing and I'll say great in there's 90 minutes and I kind of stayed up front what I'm going to do is X what I'm going to work on is X but again the calendar has tons of open space outside of those let's say those two or three sprints on the day there's a bunch of other time that could be family time that could be exercise time that could be take a call with somebody time it could be go out to lunch with somebody it could be anything and because you have that free time um you're a you're able to actually get more stuff done even though your calendar looks less productive when where are you so a lot of times people use and I do this too I use my calendar as a to-do list so then where are you keeping your to-dos or your ideas I don't have a list um I have two things I have the big thing I call it my one big thing I'm doing today and the question I ask myself in the morning is what's the one thing that if I the one outcome that I'm working on that if I just did that one thing today would be a win part of my morning routine is I set that out I I just asked that question what is one thing that if I did I wouldn't have to do anything else for this day to still be a win whereas what most people do is what are all the things I have to do today or what's the last email last five emails I got oh I got to do that now and that becomes this long checklist and you know all to-dos are not created equal so I proactively try to figure out what's the one big thing I set that out and then I do that thing and then anything else I do that day is gravy what do you say to someone who they're like dude I just like I have to do these things or I am not in I don't have the same job as you Sean like I can't do I can't just play around all day I've got to actually do important [ __ ] that people are telling me to do well I think there's two ways to look at it so the first is are you um again are you a manager are you an operator or are you a Creator Builder producer of some kind if you're a manager of people or you're a manager of projects then more likely your schedule is going to tend towards that however I was a product manager that was my job title I had meetings I had to be in I had one-on ones I had standup meetings I had all that stuff that was like you can't just be like hey guys I'm going to create some open space like that wasn't going to be an acceptable thing but even then I knew I wanted to move towards this so the first thing is you decide how do you want your life to be and I decided I wanted my life to be this way so what I did was I first carved out a single day I said great I can have as many meetings and I have I can have a shitty calendar four out of the five days a week but on Thursdays that's my day Thursdays I keep clear Thursdays are sacred and I did it for one day then I was able to do Tuesdays and Thursdays and then I was able to say okay I'm so productive on the Tuesdays and Thursdays this I experimented this is this is a good method for me now how do I get myself into a role where this could be my default work style and then you work towards that you've set that agenda and you and you figure out okay it might not be able to be something I could just go full on 100% today but nine months from now I can work towards that and I could set it out and I could tell my boss and I could tell my my team that this is how I'm gonna organize things and I'm going to do only I'm gonna do all my meetings only on Mondays and I'm Gonna Leave the other four days of the week clear for me to do whatever's the highest impact thing where I can roll up my sleeves and dive in all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain question questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the color a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM so somebody wants to let's say um for one of your companies you're hiring someone or you have an important customer meeting that you have to go to and they say let's talk in two weeks do you say no to most things or do you do you book far out all right look if it's my company and his Revenue I say yes right if I'm if I'm the guy who does that but I don't I don't put myself in that position I'm not the sales guy in any of these companies anymore rarely rarely are there meetings where it's like I need to be the guy who's there it's scheduled a month out and I say yes but I do those when of course when it when the time comes you have to do it you do it it's just I don't default into that the way that most people do I'll tell you a simple like thing have you ever heard the Charlie merer thing where it says show me your incentives and I'll show you your outcome yeah that's good I have another version of that show me your Google calendar and I'll show you your priorities right because people will say all kinds of [ __ ] oh yeah this year I really care about getting in shape cool show me your calendar where are your workouts where's your meal plan where where is it what what are you doing where where's the thing or oh my goal is to really you know get this project off the ground awesome how are you going to do that when like 89% of your calendar is filled with other crap it's like show me your calendar and I'll tell you what your priorities are it's a very very simple test you should take you should literally take a screenshot of your Google go calendar to show it to somebody and say if all you saw was my next two weeks what would you say is this person's priorities what is this person going to accomplish if this is what their schedule looks like what type of outcomes will they get in their life and so you know I think that's a really important thing to internalize because then you say all right what's the alternative the alternative is this Sam if I said to you what are the top three most important like priorities in your life and not like the health of my family or like you know that that not like that I'm talking about like shifts or changes you're trying to make like things where you're going to need to put in new effort to get a new result what are the top three kind of of those shifts you're trying to make in your life this year uh working out early in the morning as opposed to during the day so I can just get it out the day uh get it out the way so 7: a.m. exercising uh the second one is trying to wrap up by 6 by six o'clock and so making sure I get everything done by six o'clock so I can be present with family and then the third thing would be uh focusing on content because if I grow my audience I can continue growing my company okay wonderful most people will not have the level of clarity you have like part of the reason you have the success you have is because you have that level of clarity if you ask most people what are the top three priorities change you shifts in your life that you're trying to make it's not at the tip of the tongue and if it's not at the tip of the tongue if it's not at the front of your mind it's pretty unlikely you're prioritizing it and doing and you're acting on it you're revisiting it daily the the effort you would need to make to make a change in your life change is not so easy that it'll happen without you thinking about it and I think it's normal to go through funks like the reason we talked about in this last episode uh misoji and I was like I'm obsessed with this idea of having like a really hard Challenge and the reason being is for like the last so I had a kid five months ago and basically three months leading up to the kid and then the five months after you you go through a period at least I did and many people go through different periods where you're kind of sleepwalking through life where you're just kind of like doing the same thing every day you're being a little bit less purposeful you're being a little bit more reactive and I think that a lot of people including myself at times I Sleepwalk through life and I just do whatever and so it's nice to have those priorities where you like reflect I I like to do them quarterly because if I do them annually then I I I found myself sleepwalking at month six yeah you got you got to shake yourself out of it by default you will go into autopilot it's easier to be an autopilot it's easier to not ask the hard questions of yourself of what actually matters and what am I doing and do my priorities does my calendar match my priorities and what the hell are my priorities anyways and you know am I am I living up to my word am I doing what I said I was going to do it's very like that's the effort part it is much easier to not do that um so you know if wait let me but let me ask you a question you all right you're weird because I'll text you something important and I won't hear back for like two weeks and I'll be like Sean I need to reply on this we have to make a decision it was important to you not to me well uh but we have a close enough partnership that if it's important to me a lot of times it should be important to you and I'm like dude we have to just determine like this tax thing or uh whatever or like I have to change schedules let me tell me yes or no um and then other times we'll we'll just bring up a random topic like wouldn't it be funny if we did X Y and Z and you'll type such long texts and you'll do so many of them and I'll have put my phone down for 30 minutes and I'll go and look at it and I'm like dude like what's that funny thing where it's like either I'm not going to read all this either good for you or I'm sorry it happened like like like I'm like there's so much information and it'll be a group chat sometimes with me you and a third party like Ben and you guys have already like had this massive brainstorm and made a decision I'm like oh what the [ __ ] I don't I can't read all this um do you have your texts on and your Twitter DMS on and slack and email on to where you're actually looking at it throughout the day uh text I do get notifications for not everything else um so so yeah I definitely keep the notifications off for most things it you know again part of this philosophy is offense not defense how do I if something's important to me I can throw my whole weight into it and I'm not going to be either distracted or sidetracked by other people's priorities one of the great uh quotes is about the news and like I think nval said this he goes the news's job is to make uh you know someone else's problem your problem like that's what they're trying to do they're you know today in you know in Alam there was a shoplifting at the grocery store and you're like oh my God it's like you don't live in Alam you weren't at the grocery store it doesn't affect you but the the job of the news is to sort of take this problem that's not yours and put it on your plate and so I'm very conscious of that I want to give you a few quick hitters of like little phrases that have that are very helpful to me in doing this the first is be effective not efficient most people who want to be productive they think about efficiency how do I get the most done and the least amount of time right work per unit of time I I fall in that category I think the the problem is that it's easy to mistake motion with progress and just because you do something well or fast doesn't mean you doesn't make that thing important and so it is far more important to just identify what is the right thing for me to even spend my energy on and I might waste an hour thinking about that thing before I even put my hands on the keyboard or try to do something right and so I focus on effect whereas I think most people focus on efficiency I focus on figuring out what is the thing that what is the lever even worth pulling and I don't care if I'm that efficient with it I might be inefficient I might spend three days on that thing but as long as I picked the right thing it was totally worth it and I actually had to do less things overall because I didn't worry about getting the most amount of stuff done stuff is not my my goal next thing you said something about working out the first thing in the morning I think that's another great principle the big thing is the first thing most of us when we make a to-do list we sort of procrastinate the big thing and we'll use like small things to kind of get some momentum going before we actually like do the important thing but what that means is like if you're honest about it there are many days where you didn't actually spend enough time on the thing or you didn't even get around to it and so big thing first thing that's just like a simple simple phrase you can repeat yourself all right what's the big thing that's my first thing today um that helps you because then you don't feel like you need to keep working more and more and more hours because you already got the big thing done at the very beginning of your day dude it's so much better to do it in the morning you know it's really lame and I don't ever want to admit this but I'm going to [ __ ] sahill Bloom inspired me to work out just he did you see what he posted he is he's on YouTube now and I love sahill he's a dear friend of mine and I'm but I'm always gonna make fun of him because he's a pretty boy and he kind of like has he has everything he's kind of like done good he's like I love my family and I'm grateful and we're like bro don't say that that's yeah don't say that thing man that's not cool and he's got abs and he's cool and whatever and be handsome and happy saw Hills not that's not how life works yeah you can't have it all however his YouTube videos are so good dude he's the real deal he gets up at 4 every morning and gets after it and I watch these videos and I'm like I'm So Soft this is awesome and so that's one of the reasons why I'm I'm morning not gonna lie his YouTube Vlogs did that for me too but he it was actually one thing that pushed me over the edge he tweeted something out that goes he goes I don't know any losers that work out first thing in the morning so true it's so good is there any loser who just wakes up and works out at 7: a.m. I've never met him if there is he said that on our podcast it was on our pod that he said that and he said that and like I'm sure there's some examples but dude I felt so soft when he said that because I I'm not like that right so you know but I did that I looked at my calendar I'm like oh the most important thing for me this year is rewiring my habits to be the habits of a healthy person well what are the habits of a healthy person they wake up and they work out that's a common habit if I looked at my calendar it's like here's my workout sandwiched in between you know two things at 3:00 in the afternoon when it's most people's nap time you know it's like well that's probably not the ideal time to do this why don't I just start waking it sucks um I'll give you the last thing last little last little tip of the unscheduled life what a lot of people do is they we're all looking for love but we settle for connection meaning we all want awesome relationships with other people in our life but we settle for 30 minute Zoom calls and 30-minute Zoom calls become the default because it's like the uh it's like the the atomic unit that's like an acceptable it's like an acceptable ask and it's an acceptable request to accept is okay I'll do a 30-minute Zoom call but it's like death by a th000 paper cuts it's like a death by thousand 30 minute zooms it's like this is how most people are living with other people so one shift I made I got this from my buddy John kugan is the barbell strategy he's like I have a lot of quick text messages with people where it's just a one-off text we're not even like texting all day it's just I'll text them one voice note or a random link or one you know you know three-word text about something that they did and that's it so I have a lot of text quick casual relationships and's like and then I'll just go and spend the day with somebody I'll like clear my calendar for all for the full day and I'll go spend the day with them like for example today my unscheduled life I have this one podcast that's the only thing oh I have my morning workout then I have this podcast that's the only thing I had on my calendar today done with the workout by 8:45 and podcast at 9:00 a.m. now for the rest of the day my calendar clear wait dude you only need 15 minutes between a workout and the this is why Ari he's late all the time by the way you only need 15 minutes I cannot think I need an hour of like a grace period I can't believe you do that do you really what do you do for the hour I just it like I sometimes I'll work out so hard I want to throw up I'm like I dude I can't like I need to like decompress for a second well okay I'm not that intense with I'm not like dead I'm not like absolutely dead at the end of my workouts but uh 15 minutes is more than enough to to cool down for me um do you shower I don't shower between the between the work on the Pod no can you smell me like it's okay I'm not like I'm not like a a clean I'm cool with that I just get so uncomfortable I'm just uncomfortable I'll shower after this anyways the the other thing I was to say is the rest of my day today I met this guy Luke who was awesome and I was like Luke pick any afternoon that's free for you I'd like to let's let's come like I'm gonna drive down to where you are and let's spend half a day together I want to go for a walk let's talk I was like you're fascinating to me and um I want to make time to just go deep let's let's go hang and let's like what do you like to do you like squash let's play Squash I don't I don't know anything about squash just you want to go on a date you you want a date not a date I want a half day I want a full half day with you if I could get the full day I'd take the full day but I just met this guy and so I'm like all right he'll he'll do the half day and so that's the barbell strategy a bunch of lightweight text messages but then let's spend a full day a weekend let me fly to you and let's hang out for the day and then I'll fly back like carve out time to go deep where you have a real experience with somebody and it uh you go deeper past the surface level it's much better than the 30-minute zoom and it sounds like something that's like a really expensive hang but it's truly not once you eliminate all the 30 minute zooms that come in between you know what what you could do and that so I try to do that you know about one or two times a month and we'll wrap this part up but you're you're kind of forgetting one thing and I think you're forgetting it because I think you are different than you're different than me uh which is you're not bothered easily and so for example I get I turn off my Twitter DMs I I try not to get my phone number out anymore because I get overwhelmed with inbound messages of just like people who I'm acquaintance with and they want to hang out and I get so like burnt out of saying no I feel I have immense guilt um you do something that I think you should fix which is you agree to stuff and then forget that you agree to it and so but but but that doesn't bother you that really bothers me so I just say no to everything you're quite good at just IGN at ignoring stuff which could be a huge huge pain in the ass sometimes but I actually think that it is more productive look I I agree with you there's a there is a trade-off to everything the trade-off of the unscheduled life is that that that's not compatible with other people who live a highly scheduled life the trade-off of the unscheduled life is that you're not going to reply to every message that somebody else sent you where they feel they are owed a response but it was not you didn't ask for that you didn't ask them to email you something there was a Founder in my portfolio who emailed me and was like hey I'm in town um want to get a coffee and by the way like I would happily get a coffee with this guy I like this guy but I didn't even like think about it because that week crazy my sister-in-law had a baby my father-in-law had to go to the ER like that week was like a little bit nuts for us and I was basically just like watching the kids are out a hospital most of the week but even if I wasn't uh I still didn't feel even if I wasn't I still didn't feel like just because you ask me something means I have to comply this is not a This Not My Religion that's not the way I roll but but but that's a very you thing that's a very you thing there's collateral damage with that he got pissed was like dude uh or no I emailed back I was like sorry I was like busy this week uh sounds like you're not in San Francisco anymore next time you're here would love to grab coffee he's like not GNA lie bit of a turnoff that you know you know our investor didn't want to get coffee and I was like I don't I mean I I agree that might be a turn off for you but you know that it might be a turnoff for you that's a fair that's a fair thing to say but I don't live my life that way where I have to do all the things you me to do or anybody wants me to do and there's a lot of requests of things people want me to do there is a trade-off there's a selfishness to it I personally also feel that it's selfish for other people to have to to put make their priority your priority I don't do that I agree agree I agree but it's not pract maybe it is practical but it's a challenge I I struggle with this where people message me and I I I'll go to bed at night being like [ __ ] this guy texted me and he texted me at 10: so I can act like I'm sleeping but I got to figure out what I'm gonna reply with tomorrow I'm gonna get out of this dude it you know you know the only thing that saves you charisma the only thing that could save you is charisma because it's like you're a bad boyfriend it's like oh he's such a jerk but then when he's here when I do talk to him he's totally present he he he clearly has good intentions and blah blah blah and you sort of Salvage it that's the only like Saving Grace no dude Co was awesome getting and then I got married that was awesome stuff having a kid freaking awesome Shi for your schedule it's amazing yeah all right so let me say one last thing here's the disclaimer the out of touch that works for you it wouldn't work for me disclaimer I already said this but I started doing this when I was 25 years old and I had a job where I was the low man of the to PO as a product manager it can be done in any position it's if it's important to you go read the 4-Hour Work week if you don't believe me it's like 4our work week was was around this principle um of of owning your time and using your time the way you want and delegating and automating and being remote and being free to live your life the way that you want um the second thing is there are trade-offs they're real some people don't like me some people think I'm a flake some people think I don't I'm not responsive that bothers some people I have to live with that tradeoff because I really appreciate the benefits that it gives me um and the third thing which is yes it's a privilege to be able to do that however if if it's a lifestyle you want then you should just work towards it right so you should say what type of job what type of career what type of financial Independence would I need in order to live that life and then you can decide for yourself if that's important or not I decided for myself when I was 24 25 that it was important to me I'm now 35 and it's manifested itself it's it's self-actualized now so it took a decade it probably took eight years it was a shift it was a transition over time and like again like learning how to learning how to do anything takes some you know some time but that's fine I think that's great did we I think we answer I I think you answered the [ __ ] out of that question all right all right is that it is that the pod that's it [Music] that's [Music] n

4 months ago the Bitcoin price was 37,000 today price is sitting at 69,000 in 4 months that's kind of amazing why is the Bitcoin price going up well prices go up because more people want to buy than sell that's like the simplest example if you think about what's happened in those four months the biggest thing is the Bitcoin spot ETFs got approved and in those ETFs it basically just gives a ton of people access to the asset that previously didn't have it and so historically we've seen these ETFs for certain asset classes get approved lots of money comes in the price goes up over a long period of time people are surprised at how quickly assets have come in there's over 10 billion doar that have flown into these assets and then also how quickly the price of Bitcoin has gone up and set a new all-time high

what does Nate DS say one of our favorite Fighters he goes stay ready so I don't have to get ready Nate Goes Warriors are always ready to roll right I'm a ninja n just don't warm up [Music] uh all right we're live Sean and to The Listener at the end of the this next 10 minutes little opener I have for you I'm going to need you to a promise to me and I need the listener to do the same to themselves now before I get to that promise let me tell you a little story so there's this guy named Marcus Elliot I read about him in this wonderful book called The Comfort crisis and Marcus Elliot is an interesting guy you can Google him he's like this ripped older guy now he's a doctor whatever but his story is that he got his MD from Harvard and he thinks he's going to go down this route of being a doctor but he kind of hates it he's not really into it and so he goes into sports a world you know a lot more than I uh than I do and he decides to work for the Patriots and the Patriots had an issue where they had something like 21 hamstring polls per year and they're like dude our guys keep getting hurt it's losing us millions of dollars help us out so Dr Elliot helps them out and they reduce their hamstring polls by uh to to only three per year the MLB sees this and they're like hey you're the man come and do that for us he works for the uh Major League Baseball and he helps reduce injuries significantly eventually he opens up his own facility where athletes all types of athlete basically most NBA players a lot of baseball players they go and he's got this beautiful facility where they do like 3D analytics and they look at your body and they're like you have a weakness here you have a strength here let's capitalize on this we need to fix this otherwise you're going to get hurt and so LeBron all these guys go to them and so the picture I'm trying to paint here super datadriven scientific guy he's all about the numbers whatever however there's this one thing that I read about him that didn't exactly fit with what he talked about and it got me super invigorated and this is where the promise that uh I'm going to need from you in about five minutes comes into play so there's this thing called misoji you've never heard of misoji have you I think I've been called one a misogynist or something that something else close all right so misoi is this it stems from this Japanese myth so basically there's this story in Japanese mythology of this guy who goes into the underworld to save his wife and it's this hard tumultuous physical Journey when he gets done and saves his wife he comes back to this waterfall and he cleanses himself and that's like I'm cleansing myself of this journey I just went through I'm now a new man whatever well a lot of people including one of your favorites one of my favorites Jesse ller has kind of taken this term or this myth of misoji and they've kind of changed it to this thing where it means a huge physical challenge basically something that you need to do one day out of the year but it takes 364 days out of the year in order to prepare and get ready for it and it changes the rest of your your year because of how challenging and uh you're you're preparing for it Jesse calls it kind of like his one it's like his one big annual Mission or challenge or Adventure that he's going to go on right his misogi misogi or misogi you know I've been calling it misogi but it's one of those words that you read you don't say yeah yeah this is why it's a myth it's RAR discussed and only read about and so I'm not exactly sure but Mar gets into this where uh this doctor that I'm referring to he gets super into this and he's like we have to have our guys do this and so he starts doing these Mogi so he'll do one where he'll like drive to the mountains and just the highest peak that he sees he's just like by the end of the day I'm reaching the top and I'm coming back down no matter what and he starts having his athletes do it and one athlete in particular who gets super into this is Kyle corver this is where you come in I don't know too much about Kyle corver but he's a great three-point shooter I think I don't shooters in the NBA yeah yeah know nothing about him other than uh I know that he's he's into this and basically KY cor kind of becomes like a Dr Elliott disciple and they do crazy things so here's one of the things that they do they carry an 80 pound Rock underwater for three miles so basically they're out in the Santa Barbara the ocean off of Santa Barbara and they grab there's this rock at the bottom of the ocean they got to swim like 10 feet down they got to grab it they can only carry it for like 10 seconds they drop it they come up for air and they do that for 10 hours until they complete 5,000 000 meters so 3.1 miles um it's insane another thing they do is they're apparently in Santa Barbara there's like an island 25 miles away and they're like today he Dr Elliot just calls Kyle corver he goes look get ready clear schedule todayi Day [ __ ] Day [ __ ] yeah today we are pedal boarding to this island and it takes them 15 hours to do it and it's like and it's like a thing where they're bleeding and they're like this just sucks it makes you want to quit but the point of all this is to help you live life so you're not sleep sleepwalking through life these types of challenges they make you appreciate life they make you be a little bit um disciplined they make you be uh purposeful and Dr Elliott he's got two rules for these challenges rule number one you can only have a 50% chance of actually completing the challenge and there's many examples of where he has done a challenge where he's failed the second thing this is a really easy rule don't die that's the second rule besides that there are no rules and so here's where it gets to my challenge to you you've been talking about getting abs for like the last like three months and you're doing great you look great I I've been inspired by this because I see the YouTube YouTube comments every freaking comment is about how great you look I think you need and so do our listeners you need a Moki does he list them somewhere you said he's been doing this for years what are like I need some I need I need some options cuz uh I would have never thought of carrying a rock underwater 80lb Rock underwater for three miles that's it's hard to even brainstorm does he have good ones yeah so they can be fairly random and so he actually chooses to not train a lot for them but in your case it could be like today I'm going to walk 30 miles or today I'm going to walk 20 miles and you actually don't a lot of times you don't want to plan for it too much because then that gives you too much of an edge to actually get it done or it could be like I'm going to in your case it could be I'm going to carry two 45b kettle bells for 10 miles and that will take you probably 12 hours something like that like a crazy challenge or uh you're going to ride your bike from LA to San Francisco uh just like a a crazy challenge like that that is only a 50% chance of completing it and so I need you to have one of those what about you what's yours I've picked one so this this this August I'm doing a 50 mile running race and I'm going to try and run that race at 10 minute per mile pace which is really challenging for me and the most in part is I don't even know I'm going to be able to finish this but or because I think I'm going to get hurt I think like there's a good chance I get hurt just training for but I want you to pick one let me tell you why I like this let me tell you why I like this number one anything that's like there's this Japanese word that we don't have I always love the end of those sentences so that's that's the first thing the first company I ever started was called sabii sabii Sushi and sabii is this word that the Japanese have for basically finding uh Beauty in the imperfection of things and like we just don't have that word in English and and you know so I like this anytime there's a Japanese word that we don't have the equivalent of second thing I like about this I like the way that he did it where it's not a thing you're training for all year that you know about you kind of said both ways you were like you prepare all year and then you do the thing but then you also said he he would just be like e it today clear the schedule we're doing a really hard thing I found a hard thing we're doing the really hard thing today is the day it it's not about preparation it's about guts it's about courage it's about being in a ready state of mind and a ready physical state all year so that whenever Adventure calls you can do it I kind of like that a lot more yes so Jesse ller is the one who adapted it to the 364 days he that was a a beautiful phrasing I think but it is more so uh are you ready to do this and so you have to be ready at all times what does Nate Diaz what does Nate Diaz say one of our favorite Fighters he goes stay ready so I don't have to get ready Nate Goes Warrior are always ready to roll right I'm a ninja ninjas don't warm up uh so I do like the idea of misogi I am down to do a misogi I want to kind of brainstorm what a fun one might be or I might just go the the other way which is to say sometime in the next let's call it three months I'm gonna find something I will notice something a challenge that kind of scares me and that's the day that I have to do it that's the day cancel the podcast cancel the meetings I got to do this and you know one misogi that I think everybody could take right now one mission is to go to youtube.com type in my first million And subscribe to the channel because we have crossed 400,000 subs and I got to tell you dude I'm at gymnastics yesterday and uh you know gymnastics is basically like part kids gymnastics part like fatherhood Anonymous it's like all dads in there with their daughters usually and um we're all just you know taking part so one guy he goes hey were you the guy who did that did you talk to Tony Robbins I was like oh yeah he's like dude I saw you on YouTube and I was like oh yeah that's great did you watch it he's like yeah it was awesome he's like what is that I was like oh I got this podcast next week he comes in and he goes dude I saw three more episodes really like it he goes he goes you know I'm impressed you guys got like 400 something thousand subscribers but also I feel like you should have a million I was like wow the audacity just tell me how many subscribers you but he said it in a complimenting way he was like he's like you guys are dropping gold he's like that thing about the A+ problems I love that [ __ ] man that that was good he's like I'm surprised you don't have a million subscribers and I was like I'm surprised too so to save me from future gymnastics embarrassment go to YouTube subscribe to the Channel all right that's a that's a great reason all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called h you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM all right so back to misogi so the I like the idea of the challenge I accept I will find what it's going to be um but you know what I really like about this I have avoided things like this like anytime somebody's like oh I'm doing a Ultra Ultram man race or I'm like you know doing what I don't even know what these things are called they're like a hard thing yeah I'm doing I'm doing a warrior jog it's like all right bro all right cool I I'm not big into the David gogin thing in fact I've kind of Built My Brand on the uh work smarter not harder or like hey I'm a Counterpoint to the idea that you got to work hard to achieve your dreams like I don't know I didn't work that hard I achieved my dreams right like it's it's worked pretty well for me however I do think that the real value of this is not the physical challenge it is the mental Challenge and I mean that in the the least corny way possible which is like I imagine if you do one of these it removes a one layer of feeling Limited in your life it's like well if I did that [ __ ] and that was so hard I did not think I could do it I did not think I could push through but I pushed through I did it I was scared of it and I did it anyways I acted in the face of fear I I feel like that's the value and not obviously how many miles you ran or how strong your body was to be able to do that thing that's absolutely the value the value I think that to to do a lot of these things physically I think most people could do them if they tried really hard I have a challenge back to you you gave me a challenge that's going to be very hard for me because you know I'm a lazy [ __ ] I'm a I'm a dainty guy I don't really get my I don't like getting my hands scraped up so I accept your challenge but I'm going to give you one back so you gave me what I'll call the macro challenge the big the big hard spectacle challenge right I'm going to climb this mountain with my fingernails like whatever some [ __ ] like that I'm gonna give I'm G to give you the micro the micro challenge that I've given myself many times and I've actually never completed this but I've tried many times that I'll give you because I think for people like you the hard thing honestly let's be honest is not that hard you're going to do this 50 mile thing you're going to succeed at it and you know that that's the thing about you dude you know you can do stuff like this that's why you're attracted to this just be honest I'm attracted to it because I love the glory of like getting it done and I love like proving to myself you believe you will get it done but you believe you will get it done I believe I will get it done okay agreed here's a hard one for you for the next 24 hours or for any 24-hour period I challenge you to not be bothered by anything for 24 hours a zero complaint and a zero bothered 24 hoursall see if you can do it it is so hard I have tried this for like three years and I've tried it like consciously meaning like okay today I'm going to do it probably at least 50 times and I'm over 50 but I get closer and closer each time and it really points out it's like damn I threw it all away for that just because that little thing happened and is it challenging is it so I can't complain about something mentally or or or only the thought no no no forget about saying it that's easy you can't have the thought don't be bothered do not feel bothered for 24 hours see if you can do it because obviously we all know logically we have a beautiful Charmed Life like all of us anybody who's you know healthy living in the western world like life is better than it's ever been in all of history um yet we are in our heads complainers and we are annoyed by things and we are upset by things we are frustrated by things we really shouldn't be and this is It's a micro Challenge and you get no medals for this honestly you get no glory for this but I think it's very valuable so I give you that challenge back I I think that's a great Challenge and I I want to I want to wrap this up and I'll only spend uh two minutes on this but there's three challenges that I think are interesting if if they interest you okay I don't think I don't think you could do the uh we'll see one and we got to talk about this is like a business podcast these guys have turned these into businesses the first one is called the speed project I keep seeing people talk about this but check this out it's an underground race meaning there's no website you you can't really find details about it I don't even you have to apply for it and I don't even know how you apply for it but it's a race from Santa Monica to Las Vegas you get four friends to do it and you there's no rules there's no route they they just show up at the start line they go all right go see you in Vegas and the and the organizers go to Vegas and the first group of people who arrive and you have to run the whole time and you can't go on highways those are the only two rules the first people who get it they win the second one and this is called The Adventurous of which we've talked about they do this thing called a monkey run where you're on a mini motorcycle throughout Africa and it's something like a thousand miles or something like that and it takes like uh eight days or something like that these guys are hilarious I met with the the guys with amazing website copy the amazing website copy I met with the owners they're doing millions of year in revenue and I actually think this could be a potentially much larger business than it already is I think it's a decent business let's go into this all right so website so the adventures.com it says giant adventure tiny motorcycle all righty great headline then it says the monkey run and it goes the monkey run is pretty stupid it's like a jungly mountainy deserty velvet glove of adventuring Joy so grab your sweaty hand and shove it inside there's nothing like the sensation of a monkey bike between thighs as you thunder slowly along dirt roads with absolutely no idea where you are as you glance up there staring down at you like a baby ant in a tininess competition might be some of the highest mountains on Earth imagine endless jungles lying in weight to punch your cheeky face with a fist of Adventure imagine deserts that stretch Far Beyond the Horizon at your woefully underpowered two- wheed children's toy behold the behold people the mighty monkey run that's awesome right I think it's like five grand and they do a ton of these and they're piing up steam and the last one this is the craziest one it's called the Barkley Marathon it's created by this guy who has a nickname called Lazarus Lake I don't know why but basically he started this marathon it's 100 miles in the mountains of Tennessee the reason he created it was James Earl Ray is the guy who assassinated Martin Luther King well he have one at one point escaped from prison for like three days and it took him something like or he was gone for 60 hours and he only ran 12 miles and this guy Lazarus Lake was like what a softy I I easily could have done a 100 miles to that route and so he creates this 100 mile race inspired by the route that James L Reay took and they do some crazy stuff uh basically in order to get they only allow 40 people a year to join and they get thousands of applicants to join this 100 mile race it has a 60 hour cut off so it's pretty intense in order to join the race you have to pay a doll 60 application fee for some reason dollar $160 you also have to write a letter as to why you are good enough and why like this is important to you and if you get in he sends you not a letter of acceptance he sends you a letter of condolences just says like this is the day that you might die great branding these guys are masters of branding I remember wait listen to this so and we'll talk about branding but listen to this and then once you get accepted the registration fee is you have to bring a license plate for some reason a license plate you have to bring flannels socks and underwear because that's what this lazarous late guy that's what he needs to in order to live throughout the of his year in a V of blood and the and the race starts not with a gunshot it's when Lazarus Lake lights his cigarette and that's when the race starts and and and he made a video a few years ago where he goes he was trying to it was like a clickbait video where he goes women are physically uh not capable of completing this race and he goes on to say why and he goes and if you think I'm wrong come and prove me wrong no woman has ever done it well this year a woman finally did it she's one of the I think only 18 people have ever finished this race and now she's one of them and so he does this hilarious branding stuff and Google this guy he looks like a redneck hillbilly who wears Walmart camouflage and like fluorescent Red Hats like he's going hunting and he smokes cigarettes all day and he just thinks of all these insane obstacles that he could have and so yes The Branding on these things are are amazing and it's just so it's so fun so uh to to create these things and I think there's a lot of interesting opportunities here you just have to do whatever you think is opposite of the right thing about business look at The Branding of this thing well just I'm just on this guy's Wikipedia page I've never heard of this one so um Trail Runner magazine calls him an evil genius the Leonardo da Vinci of pain so good like his icon which is him and the orange beanie lighting up the cigarette genius the kind of like you have to try so hard just to even get to the starting line like I remember we did one of those like a Spartan Race or tough mutter or whatever once and uh you have to climb a wall to get to the starting line it's like the Before the Race yeah you better get through this wall if you can't get through this wall you're not you should not even do this race you started this by talking about the Comfort crisis I think there's something to like this deep inner knowing that we've all become very very soft and um and people are willing to pay for pain which sounds insane but it also probably would have sounded insane back in the day when we all worked on like fields and did labor that we'd be like yeah you know what at some point we're all just going to sit all day for our work and so then there'll be a play place with heavy objects you'll just go voluntarily pay a membership fee and you'll go there just to lift lift heavy objects you like to to move them somewhere no it's like Well there must be crops that were lifting no no they're just metal so you just lift it then what do you do you put it down yeah you three sets of five what are you talking about and so I think uh these are just the modern day gyms right like these are the modern day gyms and the Beautiful part about this is not only do you get the pain you get a story to tell too you get to you get the social social cred uh which is the key part of all these businesses I heard this quote the other day from the CEO of a luxury brand and he goes the definition of luxury is dominating your customer and I was like that's one of the greatest things I've ever heard because if you say again dude say that again that's a MFM classic right there what who said this um I Heard It On acquired the podcast I think it's attributed to the guy who runs uh Louis Von group uh and I think what's his name um Bernard yeah and he goes uh I think uh but he says the de he goes luxury means dominating your customer and what's that mean so Ferrari in order to buy a Ferrari you have to get on a weit list if you want to sell your Ferrari after you're done with it you can't you got to like jump through all these hoops if you want to go and buy a Louis bag I believe you have in MO in many cases you have to go set up an appointment to go and um and actually purchase the thing and so I heard this quote and this has changed so much of my thinking uh and it relates to this race it relates to other things of making your customer jump through hoops in order to acquire the good makes it so much more valuable the problem is is that's really hard to pull off but if you can pull off you have the the will and discipline in order to like take this risk it's pretty badass and it creates a true cult I I think that's an awesome Insight I'd like to tell you about a luxury brand that I was going to bring up anyways now when you think of luxury typically you'll think of what like Louis Vuitton like you know these sort of uh fashion fashion brands right yeah how much does a Louis Vuitton bag cost a cheap one maybe is 2500 I imagine a really expensive one is 20 20 grand yeah let's say five grand on average for for LV bag okay five grand that's that's okay also maybe Child's Play compared to some other luxury Brands you talked about Ferrari Ferrari average price point is what like maybe 250 or 300 I don't know yeah that's what I thought okay so I have another luxury brand that costs about 200 to 250k um do you know which one I'm thinking of no Harvard Harvard colleges top top flight univers universities are part luxury brand part daycare part education part insurance policy shout out to Peter teal who first pointed this out and um I just wanted to use this to talk about a very fascinating business so there's a tweet that uh somebody put up uh this guy pointed out one of the one of the great examples of niches and riches and the niche that he chose is basically this guy is in China and opens up a college merch shop and he's like dude I walked into this merch shop it's busy as hell at all times and he's like they're just selling like Harvard sweatshirts and Yale sweatshirts and Princeton sweatshirts to Chinese people who don't go to Harvard Yale or Princeton and don't have any intention to it's just a luxury brand that is that is being uh you know promoted here uh in this here he goes I want to import American college merch in China this shop here s sells Harvard and Stanford branded hoodies and they print millions of but I saw this firstand so when I lived in China I finished high school in China and um you know how here you have like Kaplan and you have like other like kind of SAT prep courses yeah I think when I was so I went to school in Texas and then I moved to China and in Texas the number of people who were doing these SAT prep courses were kind of like who you would expect it's the kids doing AP classes on a roll type stuff maybe 20% of my school was doing it at the time I don't know if that's just my experience but that's what it was one out of every five in China it was six out of every five every single kid did SAT prep every single kid wanted to go to us universities and every single kid and their parents like revered these American University Brands and I just uh you know in America you could start you could sell these licensed college gear by the way these are not dupes these are these are like officially licensed I guess and so you could sell officially licensed college gear and it does okay it's not like the best Niche to be in but it's just a great example of like finding a niche where the market is actually bigger if like you know the market for water is bigger um in a desert than in a grocery store and Bally that's what this guy did he took the water to the desert and uh took these luxury Brands over there or I took these luxury College Brands over there and I thought this was he's doing it right now no this guy just posted about the store but I guess it's this Brandy Melville store that's doing it but I just thought this is a very smart thing that this company is doing selling this gear there and I've seen kind of like the demand for us College Elite universities as like a Louis Vuitton style uh you know symbol do you want to know a little bit of History this is very weird but I recently read a book called How how Japan saved American fashion and the story is basically after World War II America takes over Japan the Japanese are like these Americans are going to come over and crush us well uh America's rule at the time was we're going to try and be kind and hopefully they're gonna we're going to buy some Goodwill and it's going to turn out okay and they did and so these Japanese start becoming friends with the American soldiers they start learning about American culture and for some reason this guy named uh uh kuk ASI Asis do um he creates this fashion brand and he calls it Ivy Prep fashion and and so he like sees old pictures or they're not old but at the time from the 50s of like Brooks Brothers uh ads he just sees these because one of the American soldiers has it and he goes wow everyone who lives on Harvard's campus must dress like a Brooks brother magazine we're going to make this popular and at the time uh the Japanese were very conservative with their dress the prep fashion was considered a little bit less conservative and so he makes us a huge huge thing it becomes a massive company and that's one of the reasons why in in some Asian cultures this ivy league prep is popular over there it turns out very popular there but it turns out he ran this business for 10 years without ever going to America so he goes I need to finally get over there to America and see what's it's all about he goes to the campus of Harvard and he walks around he's like you guys are wearing like cargo shorts why aren't you dressed like the magazines and so have you ever like hung out with some of your like uh Asian friends who just came over and they dress a lot nicer you and they like they like wear better americ fashion that that's kind of what happened with this like whole fashion trend was like we took the American style but we cranked it up to the extreme so we're now like more American we're we're they're the American character as opposed to what they really are and Duke so Duke is kind of like these like old school like it look campus looks very much like Yale or whatever um it's like the ivy of the South they call it there was a guy named Bobo and I don't know what his real name was I think his last name was like bobadilla or something like that but everybody called him Bob and I think he was in the international dorm but this guy would always walk around dress to the nine so he had like the vest the Blazer and he was like wearing khakis he would never wear shorts he would never wear like athleisure [ __ ] and he had a rolling like briefcase that he would take with him to every single class no backpack and he had like that like kind of like the Beret type of cap and at first we all kind of laughed at him but by like week three we're like buba looks pretty fly actually like and we I think I think that's what happened this guy came over internationally was like I think this is how I'm supposed to dress that's all he had in his wardrobe it was amazing yeah and and that tends to happen I've had a bunch of Asian friends who come over and I'm like dude you are dressed as if you read an American Magazine and think that that's how we all behave and you look way better than us well this gave me an idea which was like you know how do you just how do you put a 10% remix on an idea so um I don't know if you read my 52 Tuesday thing I sent out but I had this one um picture in there do you see the McDonald's merch I put in there no so there's this guy on Twitter he's a he's a great follow he's uh I don't know how you say his name it's like the most French name I've ever seen gam Huen I don't know how you say it um he's the senior marketing director at McDonald's he's the ex- head of social he tweeted this thing out I follow this guy and he's great he just has like really great McDonald's like marketing stuff that that I like to follow and so he tweeted this thing out he goes the merch from McDonald's franch is a big Wei like a big yes and um there's this jacket that just looks so fly I'm like oh my God I want this jacket this jacket looks amazing I never wanted a McDonald's jacket until now I must have this McDonald's jacket and it kind of gave me this idea which is if you take this kind of like luxury High fashioned streetwear type of like designer but you use them on licensed IP that's usually pretty low-end casual you get kind of an interesting result so he did it with McDonald's I when I saw this college thing I was like oh you know the college gear that pretty much every store sells is the same it's sweatshirts it's hoodies it's like sweatpants and like t-shirts and nobody really takes those that same IP and does it in kind of high fashion or any kind of like luxury interesting or Street Wear yeah or Street Wear and I think that would be a good remix that you could do um I agree on this I agree it's awesome um I totally agree I actually own four or five different ivy league sweatshirts because I got so obsessed with this I took two tour of them I always tell people I toured Harvard once it's like I bought a Groupon but I I completely agree I've got my Stanford one I completely agree I'm into this I really want to do this with uh company brands so I want to create a uh like a rogue uh merch company that just does absurd merch for uh for tech companies because um for two reasons one all merch is all corporate merch is the same it's the same thing it's all hoodies t-shirts backpacks vests like the same socks like the same [ __ ] um and it all tends to be pretty cheap and I just thought it'd be interesting if you sold if you did a a a merch company called the Absurd merchandise Corporation um or the ridiculous merchandise Corporation and so I was like well what we would do is you take first you make categories that are not already made so for example um when you were at the hustle and you guys did ad sales did your sales team have a Gong yeah yeah and you bought that gong and it's kind of an unbranded gong you bought it up some yeah I think somebody should make like the sales gong the deal trophy the like seriesa ring like a class ring or an exit ring like if you sell your company you get a ring like somebody should make all categories that other merch companies don't even touch and you do limited quantities but high price points and then the other thing I think you do is you do like more unique fashion super high quality super high price point of corporate merch and that's like what like that Donald's jacket like do the equivalent of that um yeah man dude if I had if I could purchase like a really cool old Apple or mic like remember how Apple used to have the the Apple that was a rainbow or how Microsoft had the the four squares that the Retro vintage throwback stuff I I went on Etsy the other day looking for this stuff and I bought a bunch of things on Etsy of like vintage retro Tech stuff there's not a lot out there but I was inspired because I went out to dinner with our buddy Greg Eisenberg and Greg shows up I haven't seen Greg in a few years and he he's like a cool guy and Greg's very cool Greg has um Greg is like mood music like if you just hang out with Greg your your head starts to nod almost like there's music playing and you're like why am I just in a good mood why is my foot tapping it's because you're hanging it's like there's a Greg Eisenberg within 10 feet of you um so I'm hanging out with him and I'm like is that an IBM jacket have you ever seen his IBM jacket no but it was an old so he's got like a 1980s IBM windbreaker jacket that's awesome and it doesn't quite fit exactly right but I'm like I'm like where did you get this dude what is this he's like I was in Japan and I was like okay of course and so he goes I was in Japan and I'm on a a train and I'm sitting next to this guy this older guy and he's wearing this jacket and I'm like talking to him he's great we have a great conversation and at the end of the conversation he gave me his jacket I was like what most Greg Eisenberg thing to do strike up a great conversation with somebody to the point where they're just like I like you here's my jacket and so he's got this jacket what I told Greg I go dude we should just turn this into one of those like one of those things that exists in the world for no reason but is awesome which would be you should and next time you have an amazing conversation with somebody you have to give them the jacket and then they have to give the next person the jacket and let's see how far the jacket goes and so I kind of want to start this and I want to so I bought one off Etsy and I was like I'm gonna buy this jacket and I'm gonna do this the next time I have an awesome conversation I'm gonna give it to him and I'm gonna say the next time you have just a lovely conversation that just leaves you lit up with somebody who just spontaneous serendipitous not somebody you know you must give them the jacket and let's see and then when you give them the jacket I'm gonna make like a Google doc be like jacket handed to Japanese man on train you know with a date and let's just see how far this jacket you better you better buy Co stuff otherwise the person will be like no thanks I'm good you can no it's yours you can keep it um dude pick one of these other topics some of these I sound like they might be funny and I feel like laughing what do you got okay I got a funny one if you want it funny I got a funny one this is some people are going be like you shouldn't make fun of this but that's what this podcast I'm in an honest conversation amongst friends and so did you see the Merc Mayer uh new app launch no what happened oh my god dude wow this is this is insane okay so Marissa Mayer Who do you know her backstory who she is early at Google one of the first 20 go people climbed their way up gets wealthy then becomes CEO of Yahoo she created the product manager like program at Google which then trained a bunch of people who then went on to go work at Facebook whole bunch of product people it's like this long family tree so she and she's famous she's like you know tested the shade of blue on the of the Google search button you know 42 times before finding the optimal shade of blue right like you know whatever so supposed to be like you know High product chops goes and then becomes the CEO of Yahoo she's this amazing CEO apparently but then kind of like Yahoo falter so people are kind of like was she good was she bad I don't know maybe it was hard to turn that around anyways I haven't heard from her in a little little while so she comes out of nowhere and just posts a Twitter thread and it's like you ever been at a party and you uh and somebody says Hey share that photo with me and then they don't well I'm gonna solve that problem with my new app shine and all I want you to do so so look at this app so she it's 2024 she creates a photo sharing app which is like the most 2012 thing possible that you could do which is the last time anybody heard of Mera Mar it's like she was frozen in time and somebody un she somebody like thawed her out and she popped out and just made the same app you would make in 2012 when the iPhone was like you know just popping and people were doing photo sharing apps so she post this thing and you'll see that the thread has like thousands of like you know retweets and whatnot and the reason why is because some people are like oh this is cool and a lot of people like why is this the ugliest app I've ever seen look at the design of this app so so just look at the pictures I want you to give me your reaction and then I want to read you some of the funny comments that I saw on this uh she's maybe past her Prime in terms of uh knowing what's up like knowing what's cool right I think so basically the thing looks like a test flight app like everything is rectangular all the colors all the buttons are too big all the colors are too too boring the font she chose for the main thing literally like somebody retweeted this they go okay cool but why does it look like an Indian wedding invitation which is so spot on the font literally is the Aladdin font it's crazy um why is she why why is she doing so Marissa Mayer is probably I bet you if she's not a billionaire I bet you she's like yeah hundreds of millions within that that ballpark why is she doing this this seems like way beneath her I mean it's fun to build things and I think she felt this problem of like like oh it's hard to do group photo sharing at events uh you go to a party and you want to see everybody's pictures and it's not easy to do still and there was a famous app color that tried to do this way back in the day many many people have tried to do the same app and uh maybe it's time or maybe it's time to hire a designer one of the two things are true and we're gonna find out which one it is I like her I like this woman a lot I hope I hope she wins that I'll leave it at that oh did we do a good cop bad cop thing there I like that that was nice you like her too I mean she seems great I I don't know I don't know either but Wikipedia left a wonderful impression when I read it here's the thing if you are successful in famous and you put out a product and the product looks ugly it's not I my personal belief is that it's not mean to say that the app looks really ugly and I'm not the only one to say this there's a lot of people saying this I found it very funny that this was the case that's all I'm saying I wish her well and I have nothing against her personally I do not know her and uh she's obviously very smart more successful than me smarter than me and all those usual disclaimers uh all right you do one more thing well uh all right it's time for the thrill of to shill which as you know is when we shill one of our companies but before we shill we thrill you with something interesting and U all right so here's the interesting thing so me and Nick uh Huber we're part owners of Shephard but we one of the things we've done that's been pretty cool is we do these like workshops or uh you know haters will call them webinars and our fans call them workshops so we do these together and I thought going in I was like okay cool so what are we gonna do just show up and be like you Shephard and he's like no no no like let's add a bunch of value I like okay he's like so let's talk about the stuff we're doing in our companies that actually works that's not obvious and like kind of was an unlock for you as a CEO or manager like your life before you did this tactic was one way and after was better and so I'm big on that I'm like oh great I'm Gonna Shine here and we get on and Nick tells a story that's so good that I'm like where the hell did he get that from that was awesome and I had to follow that and I was like oh yeah I I do metrics and kpis uh whatever Nick's thing was so good I didn't even need to say anything else so Nick go comes in there and he starts talking about a monkey on a desk have you heard this story no okay so he tells the story and again it was so good that only recently I heard it again and I was like are they talking about Nick's thing and I realized Nick got this from Harvard Business review it is the number one or number two most sold article of the Harvard was this monkey on the desk thing I'm like oh that makes so much more sense still all credit to Nick for teaching it to me but um it it got me thinking oh wow I'm not the only one who likes this this thing is if it's a best it's like the second best seller um in all of their their their articles then that's that's pretty good so here's here's the idea so it's a it's a rookie mistake that almost everybody makes as a manager or CEO you build a company or you're you're in charge you start to hire people and you you're in your mind you're like great I hired these people now they're going to take care of all these things now my life I'm going to have less work because hired these people right but of course every kind of like first-time manager CEO kind of learns well we all pretty much suck at delegating at the beginning and so what happens is you hire somebody that person comes in they're trying to do a good job and they do he has this analogy of the monkey so the monkey is like a problem so he's like an employee walks by your office and they knock knock hey boss can I come in for a second um I just you we have this situation we got this problem and you're like oh [ __ ] let's talk about it and he's like we have this problem here's the situation this is happening what do you think we should do and you're like uh okay I it's not an easy answer so I'm not sure let me think about it I'll get back to you like let me let me think about it or send me the info I'll read it and then I'll get back to you and he's what what this guy points out is that that sounds very reasonable but what's happened is they took a monkey that was their problem that they were responsible for and now you've said let me think about it I'll come back to you with an answer or let me you know send me the materials I want to read them and then I'll come up with a decision they've given you the monkey the monkey on your desk then the next guy walks in he says hey boss you know wanted to get your opinion on this uh I'm thinking about doing this and you're like no no no I don't like that let me let me edit it let me let me fix that for you you you don't know what you're doing let me fix that for you and U and I'll I'll come back to you again monkey's off their plate it's on your plate and you know let's say you have five direct reports only five employees that report to you if even and all of them will usually have one monkey a week of like some unsolved Problem by the end of the month you have 20 monkeys crying in your office and you're like what the hell just happened I hired all these people but somehow I have more work uh than I had before right because I'm now responsible for solving a bunch of these problems and so this article is basically talks about how you should handle that situation in said like how to actually delegate it so that at the end of the day they own that problem so it's like first thing you want to be very clear with them who owns this problem you own this problem I don't own this problem right that means you're going to be responsible for uh ultimately executing it for the results of that execution and for the final decision if you need help or input you can schedule a time with me so you can't just come in and drop this problem off and now it's my problem I got to deal with this now it's like we will have scheduled time where we will talk about any way that I can help you with your monkey I can help you feed the monkey uh I can help you you know you know put the monkey to bed whatever you need to do we're going to have scheduled time you don't get to just hijack my time with whenever this problem exists right there's only rare situations where you need to break the glass and hijack my time don't do it as a default so part of it is like um you only help in scheduled times the second is making sure they understand that this is their problem not yours right you trust them with this Nick's point is he's basically like one of the things people do they're very scared to do that because what if they mess up and he's like well in the short term that is painful but in the long run it's great because what you're going to find is people will go one of two ways within the first month of doing this you're going to either find out wow this person's really capable of solving that problem like they can take care of this monkey and more monkeys I should actually promote them I should invest in them they're they're you know they're keeper and the other is you know sort of sink or swim thing like if they can't handle the monkey when you give it to them they're not the right person for the job and you can give them feedback one time of how you think they should have handled the monkey and if they don't do it the second time you kind of know well this is not not the right fit and it filters them out and so over time you only have competent people who can take care of the monkeys themselves how did he tie in shepher well he's like you know look uh you need you need to hire great people when you hire them it's not like like yes will help you find great people right that's what we do we're like in you know you need a bookkeeper you need an assistant you need a marketing manager you need somebody to do SEO for you whatever it is that you need we'll find you the person but if you're not good at actually delegating them you're not going to ultimately get what you want out of this you didn't come to us just for the hire you came to us to have your problem solved with less workload for you right to scale your business with less work for you that's actually why you come to Shephard not just to hire a person and so his big thing was like if we can help people actually learn how to Del then they're going to end up hiring more people because they're going to have successful hire after successful hire right you're going to have one gr experience and it's going to lead to the next great experience so that's kind of how we tied it in but I really like this monkey on the back um thing and I started to see it then every every time I would come to you know employee would come in with the problem I would you know quickly differentiate between do we need to talk about this now or should we just have time when we talk about things and secondly how do I make sure that they're not just giving me the problem and my instinct is a problem solver I'm a doer and I trust myself more than I trust anyone else so my instinct is just to do it myself Justice one time but that Justice one time mentality never ends doing that forever you don't catch me as a regular oneon-one meeting type of guy but are you I try not to have regular one-on-one so I think right now I probably have one uh two I have one with my assistant because I'm like hey what I do with my assistant which is great so I hired my assistant off Shepard uh that's the plug so what I tell her to do I I just created a [ __ ] filter I'm like anything you see that comes into my inbox or anything I say in passing that is non-urgent I need you to put it all together into one Dock and schedule one hour with me and we just knock them all out in that one hour of cleanups because like I hate when I have to like stop what I'm doing my big task and like just address this one little thing oh my eyeglasses prescription thing oh my my kid uh their Elementary School asked for this or um you know this person's asking for their K1 or whatever it is like random requests this person's asking for this for a laptop or whatever it is and so I said if unless it has to be addressed right now now we do them on Wednesdays we got a cleanup time and there's one Dock and we just make a game it's like how many of these can we knock out in one hour I'm just going to make decisions on the Fly and it's not going to interrupt anything else I'm doing so she helps me with that um and so I've delegated to her like the entire class of things which are stuff that has to get done but is not important it's not going to like push the ball forward on my my hopes and dreams it's just like [ __ ] that's got to get done that um I would rather put all together and knock out on one b so I have that meeting and I have one with the CMO of my Ecom business where I just we talk about how it's going those are the only two that we have by the way I um I think your deal with Shephard might end up being pretty good I mean you already knew that but did you I won't even name the names because we'll we'll we'll be a Shephard uh pod but one of your competitors just raised money at a $300 million valuation I think it was hundreds of millions and they showed how much revenue they added in the last 12 months and it was jaw-dropping jaw-dropping it was insane I had no idea these things could be as big as they are I think they had added do you know what I'm talking about yeah yeah all the competitor all all the companies that were like doing this like the companies that starting now I think are having a tough time or a much tougher time it's not really going to work out in the long run but the ones that have been doing this for like four five six seven years they're benefiting from like this like workr remote right when workr remote that was a big deal having offshore Talent is just like a smart thing to do it's just like more remote that's fine it's no no extra organizational cost to you right the second thing during the zero interest rate you know period everything was about growth growth growth nobody cared about profits now everybody cares about profits well one of the biggest costs to every business is their labor and if you can basically reduce your labor cost by even you know percentage points that all drops straight to the bottom line and so your your your EA goes up when your EB goes up the company value goes up like that that became the focus for a lot of real companies now um and I think the last thing is that I don't know people like me and others have start to talk more openly like it used to be and maybe still is I don't know kind of a douchy thing to be like my assistant or whatever like I have an assistant like it's kind of like a thing most people didn't brag about or talk about but a lot of people are now more open of like hey here's what I here's what I did here's how it's benefited me here's how here's the systems I used to set it up so that if you're in a similar position maybe that'll benefit you and that I think that gospel started to spread it was also Fringe so like for example before Co it was like this company's all remote wow that's so crazy it's almost as crazy as like a a company service lunch that's insane they have like free washer like they'll clean your clothes he doesn't wear deodorant interesting old Choice like it was it was insane and then Shepard and a couple other people actually did a really good job of kind of repositioning it uh they packaged it a lot nicer because obviously up work has been around forever but it was still considered uh low status a bit where it was like I just used Fiverr and like I can't believe it actually worked whereas now companies like Shephard you guys like like your team is your team and it doesn't matter which country they're in you know what I mean and so they've done a good job of of repositioning it to make it seem well it not make it seem because it is the same thing but just with Shephard overseas are you racist I don't know it's just an open question just putting that out there for the for the for the masses all right enough of the enough of the thrill enough of the shill all right let me tell you about something so in 2017 this guy comes to my office I was currently running the hustle we had just gotten going we are probably only a year and a half in but we had some some some hype so people started talking to us this guy named Caleb reached out to me Caleb originally was my account manager at srid which is what we were using to send emails I get lunch with him whatever I think that he's just going to upsell me on srid turns out he was like hey man I've been working on this idea I've been working on nights and weekends on it but I'm gonna make a bed for kids who have autism Down syndrome a variety of things like that because they need a special bed they need a bed that helps with some sensory issues they need a bed that has a camera that could be tracked more easily and I was like all right Caleb that sounds cool do you have a kid with autism is that what inspired you and and I think he was like no I I'm unmarried I don't have children and I was like well this is this is just kind of a weird uh like problem to solve for he's like yeah well I just think it's a good a good problem to solve um and I was like well I I just don't ever think you're going to pull that off so uh God bless you uh start a newsletter nerd uh you work at at srid well about a week ago I see this guy who joins Hampton he reaches out to me he goes hey you remember me I go Caleb of course I remember you how are you he goes well that thing you told me that was silly cubby beds it's a thing now and we bootstrapped the entire thing and he was like he sent me the website so you guys you can check it out at cubby beds.com it's amazing and I go I cannot believe you pull this off and he shows me pictures he's like yeah look here I am in my garage we are assembling the piping no Factory wanted to take us on so I just had to like buy a bunch of piping in order to like make the original bed the MVP we s we sold a bunch of it I think the beds cost five to 10 grand and people's insurance pays for it and at this point he's going to do many tens of millions in Revenue this year and so I think this is just proof that a I don't know if this guy actually looked up to me maybe he little he did a little bit because we had a little bit of hype and I told him it was stupid so he don't listen to me or don't listen to anyone just do the damn thing and B this is just awesome yeah this is amazing dude so okay SP smart beds for special needs the thing looks amazing I don't know why this is Special Needs I would love to sleep in something like this this amazing Cocoon of peace and Solitude why would I not with like padded walls and whatnot this is amazing it's amazing and and if you go to the website it looks awesome it's like uh this is better than eight sleep this is better than the purple mattress this is better than all those companies I love this company and it costs I I don't it I don't know the exact price I actually am not sure if they even put it on there because people's insurance pays for it which is just a whole another Beast I'm like how on Earth do you figure that out um but it I think it cost5 to $10,000 it's quite expensive and they are selling the crap out of these and I was telling them I'm like dude not only is this an awesome business this is like one of the few things that you can make where you can make a lot of money and I think it's like actually good for the world and everything like that um can you believe this guy pulled us off like would you have had the same reaction to me as I did years ago no I would have seen the genius in it and I would have invested on the spot and I would have told him you're a legend for doing this you and I are not the same we're a little different uh but I want I got everybody bring your ideas to me not Sam he's a hater I gotta give you can go to Sam I got to give this guy a shout out I think it was awesome he told me a story I like dude I haven't heard from you in like eight years that's so awesome well I love that it's covered by insurance I'm sure that was not simple to do that to get that done um but now you have this $14,000 bed that's uh yeah I just put it in my cart it's about $14,000 what are all the features that it has so it has like a camera a camera system that I guess is good and it has monitoring yeah like the kind of safety kind of like it's like a contained thing that has like soft you know walls and whatnot so you can't get hurt um it's a bed besides that yeah it vibrates it has uh light that come a camera and it has lights that like dim with the sunset and come up with the with the sunrise it has camera or it has speakers in there so it can help with meditation and like certain breathing patterns it vibrates it's pretty cool it's a pretty cool bed and it's been totally bootstrapped I honestly think somebody should make this for adults am I wrong like should there not be a version of this for like the huberman acolytes who are like you know I need to optimize my sleep why not yeah I I definitely think that this could work for uh I told one of our mutual friends who is definitely on the Spectrum and his immediate reply was yeah yeah they need to make these for adults I want one dude I um I went to Rob Deer deck's house and he has this nap pod in his office and it's like this thing it's like a giant helmet so he lays down and like his body is out of it so lame his like chest up is in this cocoon and I don't know if it works I don't know if it doesn't work but if there is something like that that works I would definitely pay and in fact I feel like that company should exist if somebody's making that or somebody has one of these that works please reach out to me I want to I want to learn about this yeah I I think that nap pot is just absolutely ridiculous I think a blanket and a couch will suffice but what the [ __ ] do I know clearly I'm wrong um congrats cubby beds good job uh where do we go from here maybe we wrap up maybe that's the Pod all right that's the [Music] pod for

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so I can borrow $900 million at like 0.1% interest and put it into Bitcoin which averages 100% agile appreciation for the last 10 years okay what what's yeah why not yes but but there's another detail to [Music] it so pom dude welcome uh last time you were here I just went and looked it up four months ago the Bitcoin price was 37,000 today what is the Bitcoin price today today bitcoin price is sitting at 69,000 um in four months that's kind of amazing and my question to you to start it off why is the Bitcoin price going up well prices go up because more people want to buy than sell so uh that's like the simplest example uh or explanation but if you think about what's happened in those four months um probably the biggest thing is the Bitcoin spot ETFs got approved and in those ETFs it basically just gives a ton of people access to the asset that previously didn't have it and so historically we've seen these ETFs for certain asset classes get approved lots of money comes in the price goes up over a long period of time I think people are surprised how quickly assets have come in there's over 10 billion dollars that have flown into these assets um and then also how quickly the price of Bitcoin has gone up and set a new all-time high you know within two months of the ETF Sam have you followed this have you been watching this uh like the ETF stuff I know that when I tracked my um like net worth which I look at like every six months it changed hours yeah it changed and I and I and I saw that it went up and I had no idea why be honest when the Networth goes up do you strut a little differently around the house do you look at Sarah a little differently you expect her to look at you a little differently tell me the truth baby we done it we made it baby PP was right it's red panty night we made it we done it baby that's what we say I'm surprised you only check uh every six months like I I check on a weekly basis and track it like pretty religiously and I feel like uh things you measure move and so if you want it to move then you got to measure it like a I track I track income I don't track uh net worth because there's nothing I can do about that right it's i' I've I'm not like you guys I've done it set it and forget it but now that Bitcoin Bitcoin and uh uh ether is close to an all-time high Bitcoin is I think uh should I just should I just sell it all and get out uh the number one rule of Bitcoin is you don't want to sell your Bitcoin obviously um no I mean look the I think the longterm kind of like thesis around Bitcoin is uh no different than it's always been which is you have a scarce Supply uh asset there's lots of people who want it that number of people who want it is increasing now the people who are banging on the door aren't like retail investors on the internet with $10 do it's large institutions that have billions of dollars uh they're obviously allocating to it um and probably the most exciting part over you know call it the next 12 months or so is that at the same time that all this demand is coming in uh the Bitcoin having is coming and that's just when the daily incoming Supply the number of Bitcoin that get created each day is going to get cut in half from 900 Bitcoin to 450 so like I always joke if you went to economics 101 class supply and demand if Supply goes down and demand goes up at the same time then the price has to go up to accommodate everyone and uh we've seen this happen before and it probably happen again is most of your net worth in in crypto stuff now pomps I know I know it was you still you're still holding strong yeah I I haven't sold anything um I I bought more crypto stuff but also uh uh we've built another a number of other businesses and done a bunch of different things that um it's not the same percentages but it's still you know definitely over 50% do you remember about three years ago Sean made a tweet that I forget what the Tweet said but like some Indian newspaper picked it up what was it it said like entrepreneur Shan Pur puts all that worth into crypto what was it I love how you could tell a story and get all parts of it wrong but still the story's kind of right not an Indian newspaper not all my net worth basically when I uh when we got bought by twitch I had a bunch of cash come in and I was like you know what I'm moving I put TW I was like I'm gonna I tweeted out I'm I'm putting 25% of my net worth into Bitcoin I just that was it that was the tweet and then a bunch of blogs like bitcoin.com and stuff like that not necessarily Indian but they all were like twitch executive says he or then someone's like Amazon executive because Amazon owns twitch they're like Amazon executive twitch executive says he's moving 25% of his net worth into Bitcoin and a stunning move and it's like uh you know my net worth is like you know it's like we're talking about like oh I I put quarters in the vending machine here like these are not huge sums of money that is moving like like it should not make news when I do something uh but yeah that was the that was the story and honestly one of the better moves I ever did that was in 2019 so uh so that was a a good bet I've always thought that the media if they wanted really to get the clickbait instead of like Amazon executive or whatever they should just label everyone future billionaire right you can't tell aspiring billionaire yeah like you can't disprove that right they just everyone will click on every article so we had uh Michael sailor on like a year two uh maybe two years ago now he got we we gotten a little at the end a little tizzy he got he got angry at me I remember that's that's about the only thing that I truly remember from that podcast why because he goes I go Michael what's the downside of this of this bet you're taking and he's like there is no downside and I was like well that's that's dishonest because with every decision there's upside and downside and even if the downside is minimal there is also downside and he's like no there is no downside and I remember I think I said uh well I don't trust you then because if you're not admitting that there's downside to this decision you're just being dishonest what else are you lying about and it kind of got weird um and I still feel that way I still feel that way but on here we on what you wanted to talk about you're talking about uh Sean I think asked if this is the craziest bet of all time it appears as though it's working right I want you to do two things I want you to explain the like just explain like I'm five years old what did Michael sailor do and then after you've explained kind of like just the mechanics of like what is the bet that this guy has been placing kind of like from the start of it to till to now because he's kind of evolved it and then I want you to tell me if you think this is sort of on the on the spectrum of idiotic to genius where does this fall for you in terms of of a bet because it is a colossal colossal bet so expl explain what he's done yeah he he has definitely bet the company and burned the boats for sure and the way to think about um you know kind of how it started was he had a bunch of cash I think he had like $500 million to cash give or take because he owned a he owned a a a publicly traded software company micro strategy which is like a 20-year-old company at that point and they did something completely unrelated to crypto like they do uh business analytics right so they do business analytics the $500 million was sitting on the company's balance sheet um he personally started to get interested in Bitcoin he bought some personally I think he bought like $250 million of Bitcoin he disclosed that and then the company said hey well maybe we should buy uh Bitcoin as well and I think that there's like two different types of people who buy Bitcoin especially for a company some are like I'm going to go day trade the balance sheet which is a horrible idea and will end in you know sorrow and then there's another idea which is like I want to have an asset on my balance sheet that I have confidence in over the long run and what he basically came to the conclusion along with the board of directors and and some of the shareholders was wait a second the dollars are being devalued inflation is really high and so we're like losing purchasing power the number of dollars are staying the same but the inflation is eating away at our purchasing power and so he said let's go try to buy something else and they supposedly did this entire analysis they looked at like real estate stocks Bitcoin gold you know all these different assets they came to the conclusion Bitcoin was the thing that they should buy and so he was the first public company that wasn't like a crypto Miner or something like that to go and say I'm gonna put like 85% of my balance sheet into Bitcoin now if he had like1 million no one would care but this was a company that was like a billion dollar company $500 million in cash he made this big bet and if the story just ended there I think a lot of people would be like wow that's kind of crazy but then he like doubled tripled quadrupled down on it and he began to raise a bunch of money via uh debt offerings so he would like sell bonds and get really good terms get that cash buy more Bitcoin then he was like selling Equity at one point whenever the value of the company like was higher than what he thought it was actually worth he would sell Equity uh use that cash to buy more Bitcoin and he went from owning zero Bitcoin in July of 2020 to today he has more than 210,000 Bitcoin which is more than 1% of the Bitcoin Network um and it's worth you know I don't know something more than like 10 billion dollars uh and so yeah it's an insane bet but if it works then we'll call it a genius bet and so like history is written by The Victors let's see what happens all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask are members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we used we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you could check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM so he he currently has 14.96 billion dollars of Bitcoin uh in micro strategy and it's up 97% all time so he's put in 7.3 billion and now it's sitting on uh about 15 billion of uh of Assets Now I think there's one other piece to be honest about which is it wasn't just that he was like hm we have 500 million on the balance sheet what can we invest in I think the truth was and this is what we were trying in our original interview with him this is what kind of started to come out and I was like this makes more sense to me and I kind of wish he was a little bit more upfront about it which was his stock was flat or going down for a long time like I think if you look at the micr strategy chart for like since I don't know 20 2 to you know 2020 the stock the stock was basically flat from 2007 to 2020 before he started making his bet and that's a long time right that's 2007 to 2020 that's a that's a 13-year period And so what ended up what he realized was he's like why are they not giving us any credit like we're basically we're basically valued at the amount of cash we have um they're not valuing the business really at anything and the business is going to produce more cash but they don't believe that we can invest this way well or that we can reinvest our cash well to grow the Enterprise value of the company so we have two choices we either dividend out all the cash or we got to do something with it that's going to get our stock price to go up and I think the reality was he was stuck between a little bit of a rock and a hard place where he had this business that was too successful to to not continue but his share price would not move because investors just simply did not believe any of the stories about what they could do with the cash and so he kind of had to do something that I think that's the part that that's a little bit left out is like oh I completely agree and he was very loud about it on purpose which I don't blame him for being I I also think that uh like maybe an extension of this is whenever you have a company that has cash on their balance sheet and it's like accumulating cash uh it's usually because they don't know what to do with it like there's not a clear how do I reinvest in my business and like drive more cash in the future and so historically what those companies have done is they've either dividend it out or they've bought back their shares but if your Shares are flat and there's not a lot of volatility to it there's not a lot of opportunity to buy back the shares for less than what like the company's worth and so uh this is definitely like that's why I say it's a bet the company burn the boats situation where he went all in on this strategy now what I think is very interesting about it is uh he essentially has pioneered this like I have a business that does software analytics and kind of business analytics and uh that's supposed to throw off cash and then I have like a treasury strategy but if you really think about um you know maybe companies in other countries like this is not foreign to them right if you're in a country where like the currency is very volatile or or it could lose value very quickly a lot of times you're managing foreign currency risk and you're trying to get into dollars or something that's more stable it's just that no one in the US ever thinks about this or worries about it and so now he's doing it with Bitcoin now I actually think one of the most interesting parts of the story is that no one's followed him like there there hasn't been a second micro strategy um I've talked to a lot of people and I'm like you know one company is a data point two would begin the trend and so I actually don't have a good answer as to like if this guy has made basically 7 billion off of this bet why has no one followed usually in public markets like somebody does something you know back like uh 2017 2018 like companies were started changing their names to blockchain Long Island I changed to like Long Island blockchain right and they just start doing anything they possibly can right now ai like everyone goes and puts AI at the end of their name to try to you know get some sort of boost in their stock price but no one's following sailor which like the omission of everyone else may actually be a data point that we should pay attention to as well well it's a it's a very scary bet I mean in order to do this I don't know if you have to be a public company but you you have to be large enough to be in that ballpark and I I don't know how much he must own the majority of the company because there's been like border there's been so many times where like it could have been justifiable to fire him over all this I think he has voting control but not uh majority ownership but he's got voting control he has about I think he has about 50% ownership of the stock and so you have the unique combination of cash cow business been around forever founder CEO publicly listed already so he's able to do these bonds cuz when you listen to him talk he's like so I can borrow $900 million at like 0.1% interest and put it into Bitcoin which averages 100% anual appreciation for the last 10 years okay what what's yeah why not yes but but there's another detail to it and I'm definitely not an expert on like convertible Bond offerings in the public market uh but these are convertible bonds and they convert at a premium to the current price so without getting into all the intricacies is basically like people can get paid back or they could convert to equity at maybe let's say 50% higher so if the company's worth you know $10 billion today it'll convert at 15 billion so if the company goes up a lot like you'll obviously convert rather than get paid back and so it's not exactly the cheapest Capital if you know you're basically selling Equity uh but you are selling it at a 50% premium so it's still attractive to do and so do when you look at this are you like wow this is genius this is terrible this is uh this is riskier than it appears what's the pp takeaway because you've talked to this guy multiple times right we did an interview with them years ago and haven't really paid too much attention since um you live in this space you know dayto day and you you know this guy a lot better than us what what's your honest takeaway of this I think it is riskier for a company to sit with $500 million in US Dollar Cash on their balance sheet than $500 million worth a Bitcoin um and the reason being that um or or maybe the one clarifier is if you have a long-term oriented posture and you don't need that cash for day-to-day operations right now Bitcoin will definitely do better from protecting your purchasing power over the next 10 15 20 years then the dollars will um and so it it's a unique aspect to be able to not only have the cash but also not need it to run your business um and so yeah I think that he's actually taking less risk than most of the public companies and and my expectation is actually that shareholders um at some point will start turning on some of these public companies that have tons of cash and saying like hey if we're sitting there with you know I mean Warren Buffett sitting with a hundred billion dollars of cash like how much money is he losing for the business by leaving it in cash um and it's unclear what else he could do dude you know what's crazy is like uh you know there's have you guys read the book The Outsiders it's about nine different CEOs and the whole thing is like they've gone from CEO to Capital allocator and that phrase has thrown around a lot but that's actually a really hard so for a person who starts and builds a company from scratch typically their skill set is like they're a little bit of a wild card they're probably good at product they're probably decent at hiring and oftentimes that means that they're not the best at managing and I have found amongst my friend group oftentimes that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to be a good investor and so it's pretty interesting to watch someone go from being like whatever you are when you start something a tinkerer uh to a proper Capital allocator that transition is pretty rare I think uh I think typically the people who are good at being investors they kind of start as an investor and they either buy a company just so they can get the cash flow to invest but those skill sets to see someone like transfer those skill sets or or evolve as a as an operator that's actually really fascinating to see that the way I call it is you go from product manager to people manager to money manager that's the transition right that is the the levels of the game in business that's rare dump those three yeah very very rare very hard Warren Buffett has a great quote he says he goes I'm a better investor because I was a businessman I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and for those who have the disposition to do both they can become very good at one because they were very good at the other but you're right most people aren't able to do have both gears like Sean you and I I think are quite good and I'm sure you are too PP but I know Sean more intimately like we're pretty good I think at going zero to one do you think that and you've also invested do you think that you are better at starting versus investing and how's that evolution been so far definitely not better at investing than I am at building because I spent 15 years building and then probably four years seriously investing right so just in the learning curve a more of a white belt right but I can see what Warren Buffett says which is that when you have built and run companies you are better at analyzing companies versus somebody who's only ever analyzed a company from a sort of spreadsheet arms length away they um you know they they take everything at sort of face value right there's a skepticism that gets built built up a healthy skepticism when you've actually seen how hard it is to do some things or um you know for example a lot of times in the stock market people react to the news it's like Google puts out a you know a overly woke AI thing and people are like Oh Google's dead Google's not it's like do you know hard it is to compete with these companies do you know how durable you know how how strong these businesses are you know how hard it is to create one of these and so the you know Mr Market goes up and down in its mood right it gets euphoric and it gets depressed but a business Builder has trained themselves to not have that same swing of psychology to go from Peoria everything is is amazing going to go up and oh my God it'll never recover again a builder kind of has been through that themselves and therefore when they're an investor they don't get caught up in that kind of herd psychology that uh the worst investors do what do you think pump I I think that's dead on um you see this not only in the public markets you also are starting to see it in the private markets like uh how many of the Great Angel Investors today are really just running companies or or building things themselves and then they kind of Angel invest on the side or vice versa um and so like Founders fund maybe is like the best example where they're really you know putting a flag in the ground and they're like look we want to be operators and we want to invest by operating day-to-day we learn which makes us a better investor and vice versa um I just think of like to win in the dynamic World we're headed into you have to be a ball player and I always go back to the uh like you remember when you're 12 years old you play like little league baseball and there's like okay hey kid today you're the pitcher tomorrow like you're going to play shortstop tomorrow you're going to be like the catcher oh now you're like the designated hitter like you just have to be able to do all the different positions and there's not really like this specialization that you get maybe when you get into high school college or or definitely in Major League Baseball and so like that in entrepreneurship is like the most coveted position to be able to stand in is like if you're a ball player you can build things you can invest you can hire you can manage you can fire you can do all these different things um but it takes practice and and it's difficult to do just like anything um and so like being the ball player is really what Warren Buffett figured out what Jeff Bezos figured out what Elon Musk figured out and that involves not only building things but also Capital markets and it looks like Michael sailor figured out a way to tap to Capital markets and unique wet it's a good transition because you went from poomp Bitcoin crypto guy as like main brand and then you know it's like oh Pomp's doing this real estate conference pops buying these uh you know these sweaty businesses uh you've showed some range I guess in the last few years um I don't know if as a hedge or just where your curiosity went or whatever but talk to us about what what are some of the non crypto weird stuff that you've been looking at I know you were looking at some uh like what was the the line painting business talk about that talk about some of the weird stuff you're doing and why you do it so um I've always been doing this stuff I just never talked about it publicly you know if you go all the way back to uh when I was a kid like we always had some business we were trying to do I I I um built two companies right out of college and uh in between those companies I've remembered that like I taught myself how to do like WordPress websites and I would go around to small businesses and be like hey pay me five grand I like build you a website right and like that wasn't going to be like some big thing but it was just like a way to figure out like could you gain a skill could you solve a problem could you make money right do it over and over again and so over the last couple of years we we've been doing uh quite a bit of work and building companies or or trying to buy these businesses but crypto definitely was the thing that I think uh most people weren't talking about online that we felt like we had a unique uh kind of narrative or perspective uh the line business is a perfect example so I was reading uh the biography on Elon Musk and uh in it every Sunday he would have the Tesla team bring him a car and they would take him for a test drive of the self-driving uh Tesla and so there was this one area on the highway where it was kind of like a a really hard turn and the car kept messing up the human had to intervene and grab the steering wheel because the car wouldn't recognize that this turn was there and so what the engineers figured out was that the road the painting on the road was actually degraded down and so they were likew we're tired of Elon yelling at us every Sunday so they called the Department of Transportation and were like hey get out here and like repaint this road so that the car stops messing up and so they fix the road not the car then the car can drive correctly Elon stops yelling so like they just solved kind of their like local problem but it made me think I was like wait a second these like line striping or line painting businesses are going to be exponentially more valuable in the future because as self-driving becomes prevalent on the road governments are going to mandate that the roads are painted more often so that the cars from a safety perspective can actually drive correctly and so you probably can go buy these line striping businesses right now for like three times eida and you start to scale them and then as the government mandates them paint the road more often like Revenue will go up there'll be multiple expansion and there's kind of this thesis of like um you have smart cars on dumb roads but like everyone wants to go compete with like the smart cars but maybe actually the best way to make money is like go figure out how to take the dumb roads and just make them smart and interact with the tech uh if we really want to dig into like the nitty-gritty details like one of the hardest parts for people coming from the tech industry in doing deals with people who are not in the tech industry is there is a drastic uh asymmetric information advantage that tech people have and what I mean by that is like let's say that you guys start a company tomorrow and you're like hey I'm gonna raise a million dollars on a safe note we pretty much like you can pitch me we can have a conversation back and forth we can come up with the terms the safe document is already pre-drafted and we can have that done in like two three days like Tech has basically figured out these long-term oriented people reputation's really important there's some baseline shared knowledge and so deals get done very quickly and there's not a lot of friction and then because it's a power law game investors are incentivized to invest in tons of companies and Founders understand that like there's tons of capital available when you go into these like blue collar kind of industrial manufacturing businesses like sometimes these people have been building the company like the line tring business they've been building for 20 years this is like their life and when we were having the negotiations with them like we were starting out with like what's the point of the board of directors right like like there's an education that goes into it and so it makes getting deals done very very hard because of that friction uh that exists and so it's almost easier to do deals with people who have done lots of deals than it is to do deals with somebody who's done their first deal like this is the big one um and and so like we're still trying to figure out how to solve that problem but it's just something that we've noticed that you know doesn't get talked a lot about online what were the numbers of this company I don't want to say because uh they're they're super great guys um but uh these businesses um they're bigger than you think I I I've looked at a bunch of these businesses so there's like line striping another one is um like traffic cones and barricades and so if you think of that business like every construction site you have to have uh these things there from a safety standpoint it's legally mandated and it's like the greatest real estate business in the world they can buy like a a hip height you know like four foot wide barricade they buy those for like 400 bucks and then they rent them out for like five to8 a day and once you're on site you're not allowed to leave the site with like the equipment can't leave until the job's done so like LaGuardia that was under construction for like 10 years right so like somebody was just renting them cones paying getting paid five six seven dolls a day for 10 years and so like those businesses are really interesting what ends up happening is uh my my buddy Brent Bor got this quote he says small businesses don't stay small on purpose so a lot of times what happens is they'll dominate like a local area but they have very hard time kind of scaling and so you can expect kind of Revenue is like mid seven figures usually they can get to like about a million a million and a half dollars in eida uh and then the owners are taking quite a bit of compensation for themselves like you know if you're taking $500,000 and you live in kind of like a rural area or not a major Metro uh like you're rich right and so it's pretty good job uh to have uh especially with the freedom it comes with and do that for a decade like you know you got paid five million bucks and and probably living pretty good there's also like a generational thing so uh my father is a small business owner my father-in-law is a small business owner my father owns a a produce brokerage meaning buys fruit from a farmer and sells it to Walmart my father-in-law owns a moving company and I'm I've like asked them questions like um like do you do you have managers like how does that work and they're like what do you what do you mean I only have 18 employees like we don't like there aren't really meetings like I don't do one-on ones and or they'll be like well how do you do you just like do everything they like yeah everything goes up through me or it's like well how do you hire it's like well usually just one of the people who work there might have a buddy who hopefully like could could do okay you know what I mean like there's not a um the mindset is when when you come from I think a different generation and also you come from poverty and it's blue collar you're like dude I make 800 Grand a year I'm rich like why what do you mean why would I do anything else do you know what I mean I also think that there's this element of like ambition can kill companies um if you're in the wrong business and so like we all get excited because like elon's like we're going to Mars right like I'm GNA put a chip in someone's brain we're like that's awesome but I I have one friend um he's got a retail store uh he's got three locations in the United States one of them is in New York and I was talking to him recently and he's like yeah all of our profit comes from the New York store like actually I might be better off if I shut down the other two stores right and so it's like when you're in business everyone wants you to expand get bigger like do all these things and he started down that path but he realized like wait a second like maybe actually the value of this business is that like I know One Market really well uh I picked a great location like it's a great business and if I become ambitious I will suck all the profits out of this business and try to reinvest it and end up just like blowing up and so again if you're running a tech company like you have to be ambitious the whole point is the power law but if you're running some of these other businesses like yeah maybe you don't want to make more than $800,000 because in order to do that you've got to double the team size your profit margin goes down your stress level explodes and like the odds of success don't actually line up with how much you could make and so I do think a lot about like there's like an ambition product and Market fit where it only pays to be ambitious in the right market with the right product dude my father when he travels my parents now once they got older they go to Florida for six weeks every winter he travels I swear to God with a file cabinet a phone that you could plug into the wall and a fax machine and he's like well I have to have my work equipment like I I can't work without this stuff and like I'll get I I'll get texts from him and I'm like dude are you trying to post on Facebook right now like I I this is a Facebook post isn't it he's like is that what I just did like and so like the idea of like evolving to some of these tools it's like dude I'm like I don't give a [ __ ] about growing this I'm just gonna like bail and it's gonna die like there is no there is no exit what are you talking about the exit is when I die I I also think that small businesses like if people don't understand what goes into running these small businesses like you just like oh of course the business just runs it's somewhere like a tech company but um small businesses make up 50% of jobs in America and the country is literally built off the backs of these small businesses right in terms of GDP growth and all this stuff and we all probably know stories you know similar to this where like they're going around with their equipment um I know somebody who's an extended family member uh he has a business where uh it's like a chemical business and he like mixes things in order to create the product and he won't fly anywhere he will only drive because when he can drive he can put all of the materials in his car and then he'll like show up so like when I was living in Florida he showed up and he's like can I just like take over the garage and I walked in there and I was like this looks like a like a science lab like he likeing yeah and then he like makes the product and he goes to the post office every day and like drops the product off so they can ship it like all the stuff and you're just like man this is incredible what goes into building these companies compared to like the tech world we just like oh like somebody like wrote some code and it just like operates 247 365 money keeps coming into my account because Stripes awesome uh it's just a whole different way to kind of like play the game of business dude uh there's a great quote in venture capital of like you you can't put rocket fuel into a car like rocket Field's great but if you put it into a car the car explodes and that's what your your ambition thing is is like that you ambition placed into the wrong vehicle will often just result in pain not growth and um I had heard another interesting thing I was talking to a guy who's one of the probably one of the most successful uh VCS in the last I don't know 20 years and he was talking about Ai and he went and he met with a guy who is like a mega billionaire private Equity type of dude and he goes to this guy this guy's like 80 years old or something and he goes to him he says hey uh you know I'm here I want to get your advice your wisdom on what I should be investing in you know I feel like the whole world is changing AI is super exciting I want to be in the game I want to be investing in the right AI projects but I'm not sure like open AI could kill any project at any given moment if they just release a new feature uh the valuations are a little bit crazy what should I do and the 80-year-old P guy goes think you should buy railroads and he goes [ __ ] and he goes well when you know Buffett has this great quote which is that um change is the enemy of the investor in in in their style of of compounding right because you if you want something that's durable that's going to compound over 20 years you don't want to be in an industry of Rapid change where the leader one year could be gone in year three that's not it's great on the way up but it's terrible on the way down right and so he was like it sounds like everything is changing so much he's like my Approach is go find the things that are not going to change they probably have less people interested in them right now they're probably undervalued and what I like about your Lin striping business pomp is that it's a mix of both so it's like a AI proof type of business because it's painted lines on roads but it's also going to benefit from all the advances in AI like one of the big advances is self-driving cars and so you would be the beneficiary without the competition versus if you said I'm going to go create better lar system or you know simulation system for for self-driving cars okay cool but you're competing against the smartest people on Earth in the most competitive field ever where technolog is going to like make everything obsolete every three years and uh that's just a very hard way to win somebody's gonna win for sure but but it's a very hard way to win versus what you're talking about the line striping business if somebody's listening to this and they have a line striping business I know how to grow this nationally like please get in touch with me I will help you like 100% another thing suit dude come to me and Sam you're relatable you're relatable guys you know I got a cool baseball hat Sam's got his like denim collection over there you don't want pomp the suit this guy's on TV he's too busy for you Sean have you ever been inside a Home Depot your entire life yeah dude I go in there all the time for advice I'm like I'm looking for some men can some boys come fix some things in my house so here's thee my car go what are the other like maybe an extens of this is not only like what's going to change what's not going to change but like can you bring fresh ideas to Old Industries so uh there's this new podcast that I've been listening to that's fantastic it's called rain makers uh and it's this guy out in LA and basically he's like trying to find investors that no one's ever heard of before um and so he went and found them like and I think it's not like no one's heard of but just like the new generation hasn't heard of and so one of the guys that he profiled was Philip Antz who uh he owned a bunch of real estate he did a bunch of like oil and gas uh bought railroads and there's like a tie through of this guy's career where he basically tried to find like value no one understood so he would buy up railroad companies not for the railroads but he'd buy it because there was oil underneath the ground right or he bought up like a bunch of local sports teams because he figured out a Playbook of how he could get the stadiums for free right and he have a bunch of real estate but the one I loved was um he bought Regal Cinema the movie theater chain when all of the movie theaters were crashing and everyone was like oh this is a horrible business like you can't make money on tickets and food and what he realized in his like aha moment was for 20 minutes before the movie starts you have a captured audience that are just sitting there looking at the screen and so he started to sell ads and he made the movie theater and AD business and then all of a sudden he completely changed the unit economics and uh was able to like save Regal Cinema became this huge thing sold it Etc and so like one okay like that's awesome but also like part of being a ball player and like understanding this I listen to that podcast episode and we had a conference coming up and I was like oh my God I have the same thing as the movie theater all these people are going to be sitting there and so they went to advertisers like does anyone have a TV commercial that they've already made pay us and we will just like play the commercial in the middle of the conference and we did it and so you like start to realize that not only are you taking new ideas to these old Industries but then once you like see it you can bring this across all sorts of different applications and I really think like that is the beauty of what you guys do on my first million but also like these podcasts and Twitter Etc is it's just like find the ideas and then like capture them and apply them into your situation and this has been going on for a long time but now all these ideas are just much more readily available dude this guy Philip anuis um have you do you know who this is Sean no I've never heard of him Savage Savage he's super lowkey uh but yeah it started real real estate in oil um but then now he owns AEG do you know what that is the entertainment thing yes the entertainment thing it's basically I think it's the second largest ticketing service provider behind live Nation AEG owns music events like Coachella so this old guy he owns Coachella he also you know AEG you buy tickets through there uh he owns uh all types of sports magazines he owns uh a couple sports teams he owns uh entertainment parks that he's he's like prolific This Guy's super prolific and you guys want to know something else about him pop you probably didn't realize this I was reading I read a lot of history I bought this book about the American West this [ __ ] guy's the author he wrote the he wrote the book on like uh America expanding into the West This Guy's super prolific this guy feel how do you say his name Philip Antz AEG is literally Antz Entertainment Group right is the AEG uh he he's super legit he's amazing this guy's amazing I I've been fascinated by him but he's uh pretty lowkey like there's not I I don't think you could find a biography on him uh he's very under the radar This Guy's super fascinating that's cool okay I like it I'm sold the that he wrote the book was a great Twist by the way that is not what I thought you were going to say at all very fascinating guy um can we talk about pooms list uh so we have this segment Sean we have to do like a redo on this segment so it started out right with uh like years ago when my wife wanted to go work somewhere I was like where is a company where you can own the stock and it could like 10x potentially but it's like a really safe place to work where it's got 500ish employees you can get good matern well it's cool I think it's worth saying how old were you guys at this time roughly uh this was uh I was 27 so she must have been 24 so she's 24 years old most people when they think about a job they're just like I want a job what kind of job uh good job right like what do you want you don't even know what you you don't even really know what you're looking for whereas Sam you you went all capital allocator onor you're like look this is not a job this is an investment you trading your time for restricted stock units we're going to pick the best RSU package that's out there and you're going to think about this as one concentrated bet where you're going to basically get I don't know let's say a lot of these companies would give you maybe 40 50k a year of stock in addition to let's just use round numbers like I don't know 150k a year of salary and so you're going to get over a four-year period you're going to get $200,000 a stock and what you were saying was like how do you become a millionaire right how do you take that 200,000 of stock over that four years how do you become a millionaire without having a great idea without becoming an entrepreneur without becoming a great investor without without doing anything right no Capital no expertise you're going to join as a as employee number I don't know not even in the top hundred right 1500 right at a company that we all know about we can touch and feel the product so we're not betting on thin air here and that fascinated me you told me about this and then we created a whole thing around it called Sarah's list around her name which was what are the 10 companies or so that we think fit this criteria today and we did this and then we we did like a round of it and they all turned out to be or you know we hit like seven out of 10 that would have hit the criteria that we we had touched on pump we asked you to do your version of this pomps list um do you have any I we didn't we just told you about the prompt we didn't hear anything you had to say what are the companies today that you think fit this criteria where could you could go be I don't know employee 500 or employee 1,000 get 200k of stock and might become a millionaire just off of the company continuing to grow and chug along these sort of later stage private company or public or private companies so I broke it up into three different buckets the first two are like 10x reputation so I don't think there's 10x left in the stock necessarily but I do think that if you go and join now they're still like kind of seen as cool and new and fast growing and so your reputation uh and kind of your resume with 10x those two are like pretty simple open Ai and Ander I think are both at this point where uh if you go and you join like you may be able to make a couple hundred thousand dollar a year and like there's probably some upside but open AI at like 85 billion basically you have to build a trillion dollar company to get you know 10 to 12x and so uh I think that is like you can make a really nice salary you can probably get some upside maybe you know two to 5x is like uh kind of base case but really why you would join one of those companies is because the reputation and kind of resume 10x uh is kind of the the value that you're getting there andrel was on our original list my friend we we've W up to you on that one I don't even think open ey really existed uh the the first time existed as like a research lab at the time we did that episode and it was not on our radar we we missed on that one yeah well well and I I think that um you know these companies that's how they should mature right they should be like 10x economic opportunities and then 10x reputation it never works the other way like there's no company that there's a 10x reputation opportunity first and then there's a 10x Economic Opportunity like the economics have to be captured to some degree and people be like oh that company is successful and then that's where the reputation kind of follows let me ask you you you worked at Facebook and snap to you know Blue Chip logo type of things but also at one you know at different times have been incredible you know Financial things too when you joined those did you think about them from a a logo collector first mentality or a stock collector first mentality what in your Calculus I'm sure both were were beneficial but which one was more beneficial in your case yeah I mean Facebook's probably the best example um I built and sold uh this company it was kind of like in social media anal itics we used a bunch of the apis I'd gotten to know some people at Facebook uh when we sold the company I like made enough money to like make more money than my friends who had jobs but not enough to like retire or anything like that uh and the guy said Facebook like what are you gonna do now and like for whatever reason I never even thought that like Facebook has like you know a building with like hundreds of employees or like any of this like it was just kind of like this thing I used and I talk to that guy over email and um so like why don't you come out here and like interview for a job and I was like cool what job they're like product manager I had no clue what a product manager was so on the way there on my I bought the art of product management which is a book about product management I read it I went into the interview and I just regurgitated everything I remembered from the book king of king of [ __ ] but I was just like I mean like that's kind of what a product manager does right is like they kind of just like get enough information and then just like say some you know buzzword right and like get the product out the door um and so like definitely huge impostor s when I started working there um and I remember the last interview actually was with uh Sam leson uh who now is like you know very well known Etc uh and Sam got on and I didn't know what to expect because they were kind of like hey like this is like the boss guy right so like you know be on your aame and he got on and he was like let's talk about beacons and I was like what and like the be Facebook beacons that just come out like kind like RFID stuff and he just wanted to brainstorm and I was like oh this place is different right like like that's not like a normal interview um and so the reason I took the job was not the money like it was it was good Sal but it wasn't anything crazy this was at the beginning of 2014 the stock was probably like 50 bucks um oh you got a 10xer then well I sold it uh and bought Bitcoin way better were you about to say the reason you joined was kind of the people and the culture was different because I the first two companies I built I couldn't get them to grow past a certain point and so I pretty much came to this like fork in the road I was like I can go to business school and like pay to try to get this education where I can just go join the people who seem to be like the best in the world at growing things which was the Facebook growth folks uh and pay me and like that literally was the evaluation and so I went to Facebook and they blew away my expectations like sure you get some you know resume uh benefit and all that kind of stuff uh but what I found in my career is kind of like college like no one actually cares where you went to college after like maybe the first like three to five years of your business career working at a place like Facebook unless you're one of the first maybe like two to 500 employees um it kind of just is like all right you're like kind of legit you know you worked at a place that has some sort of high bar but now there's uh 880,000 people that worked at at Facebook as of like the end of last year so it's kind of like 880,000 people got in right you know it does it have the same you know kind of cache as it did uh a decade ago unclear dude Sam did I ever tell you when I interviewed at Facebook you didn't know I did not know that so when we were going to the acquisition process Facebook it was going to go we were going to sell to Facebook not not uh not twitch um they had the higher offer the better offer and they flew us out to to Seattle I guess is where we went and um they were like oh you know as a formality like your whole team has to go through this like kind of like leveling thing so you you interview you're all in but like you have to get leveled and you you got to do it too and I was like okay great I'm excited I've always wanted to know what this process is like but then a part of me was like [ __ ] I better not blow this one right like the emperor has no clothes let let me make sure I don't blow this whole deal here by uh by by going in wrong so I do the interview process during the interview I was kind of like you pumped I was just making up like I was literally just making things up every single question they asked I had I had no I had no idea what the answer should be and um you know it was completely out in the in the blue because I had done the interview process with the other people who were looking at buying us right and in theirs it was like tell me about a time where you showed resilience and I was like oh you know whatever this girl rejected me in seventh grade but I didn't give up eighth grade I got her right like whatever it was like some stupid like character type of tell me a story tell me about of time you disagreed with somebody but you've found resolution Facebook was different they go okay let's pretend you just released a feature and um you know you come in the next day and the chart of the usage looks like this and he showed this curve which like you know it was like normal and then it like drops off a cliff and he's like but it's not around the feature You released but this is this adjacent feature here's what the usage looks like walk me through like all right how would you approach that what would you do next and I was like and I'm so dumb but I was like well I'd go I'm I'd go ask the guy who works on that I'd be like hey do you know uh what's going on with this feature and they're like okay I like that and then what would you do I was like well then I'd see what he says and then based on what he says that lead to my next question if he doesn't know then I would do this what a stupid interview no it was it was honestly it was a great interview it was the best interview had ever done all of the questions were like this where there were real real scenarios where they got you to basically it wasn't a riddle like some abstract riddle about like how many toilet seats are there in Bay Area and it wasn't and um you know pre-prepped like character questions where you just cherry-pick one example that makes you look good versus the you know reality I was like oh there this is a problem solving job and they're trying to see how I problem solve and there were all different variations of try to solve this problem but it's like a real problem not like a very arbitrary problem that like doesn't even it's not even relevant to what's going on what level did you get now what what was it last last last pod I don't mean to sh my own horn but beep beep the guy told me that it was the highest it was the it was of all m&a that they had done it was the highest um like feedback rating they'd ever got now when he said that I knew I had been pretty much bullshitting the whole time during the interview so I was like I respected them even more I'm like these guys just want to win the deal like that's clearly what they want they don't actually care about my interview they know that they didn't just flatter me and that this is going to totally work as it is working right now I could feel myself blushing I was like wow these guys are really smart they they threw out the actual interview results and they just told me what I wanted to hear to get me to pick them because they already had decided before the interview that they wanted to buy our company um anyways the last thing I was G to say p though there were so many people that were at Facebook that you've never heard of because there's people you know of at Facebook there's Zuck there's Cheryl then there's like the chamath level then there's even like Sam Lon the guys I had T they interviewed with us I guarantee you guys have never heard him do you know this guy vij Raji do you know this guy vivec you probably never heard of these guys right they were so impressive these guys were so impressive and not just impressive like in the interview then their track record was impressive I was like so what are you been working on here at Facebook I've never you know heard of you guys they're like well we built the uh games like the HML games inside of messaging and I was like okay how'd that go like do some people use that they're like well honestly it kind of failed in this way but there was this one part of it that was actually pretty successful and it brings in like whatever like it brings in 500 million a year now and they're like you know that was a kind of like okay hit but our big hit was working on this and he's like yeah this guy Vic he's like you know how office went from like Microsoft Office went from something you down buy a disc and you download and you like type in the key you pay $30 once to like this thing in the cloud Office 365 that you play every month for he goes yeah he created that like he was at Microsoft he like created it at his desk nobody kind of believed that that's the direction they should go he did it anyways on his own nights and weekends and then like powered that through and got that approved now that's like the way that Microsoft Works and I was like you guys are the no names at Facebook holy [ __ ] uh the level of talent at this place is insane dude it is insane I remember taking tours there my wife worked at Facebook and I would just walk around the campus and I would just see some of the conversations and hear some of the conversations and I was just starting the hustle which is just a daily newsletter and I was pumped that I hit 100,00 people a day reading it and I just remember walking around and I'm like I'm I'm a piece of [ __ ] I'm nothing like I am nobody give me one of these Facebook vests I want one of these I'm in did you see the vending machine where they have like MacBook chargers that you could just like push A3 and a just a giant like brick charger will drop out for you I'm like dude I just bought four computers on Craigslist for $800 a piece and that was a big deal for me and like I'm out here and you guys have a vending machine with mouse and Dr Dre headphones in it like what the [ __ ] sign me up I'm in the thing that Sean was talking about with the interview um so there's three different tracks in the interviews when I was there um and I I didn't believe I was a good interviewer like I didn't know how to pick Talent basically and so one of the things that you can do is you can like volunteer to do the interviews more often um as a product manager like they don't have like oh that's the person who does all the hiring like the current product managers hire the prospective new product managers and so like the current team kind of like does the interviews right and so of these three tracks the one that Sean talked about was the favorite one that I like to do because it was like the most practical and so the example I used to give is like you launch something 50% of your traffic is down uh you come in Monday morning what do you do I probably did over a hundred interviews in like an 18-month period And so you hear all these answers and there's only one time ever somebody said something to me and I immediately was like higher like strong higher he goes um I would immediately alert the entire team we have a problem like everyone else would jump to solve the problem but it was so obvious like this guy's worked on teams before he understands like what happens in these scenarios like communication is key like everything that was wrapped in this like one single sentence and I remember just being like man you can tell the greats from like the pretty Goods in you know a 30- minute conversation just walking through a practical example because all of the uh Lessons Learned show up um and so I do think that's one of the strongest things that Facebook does in terms of like Talent uh filtering what uh what are the other companies that you like all right so uh there's a a bunch of companies that I'm going to put in like the middle bucket which are like the 10x potentials uh eight sleep I think is a huge business really I think they're huge you think it's 10x though think it's huge but not a business no no yeah I think eight sleep so like you know look I I'm very uh good friends with a lot of folks there uh I think that they are probably one of the best operators uh like team of operators uh they do a lot of Revenue they have only like a 80 or 85 employees uh I believe that they've publicly said that the company's been profitable and they're selling a hardware product plus all of the software um and some of the things that they're building now are just like really cool and I think a lot about like 10x Economic Opportunity uh is not just like hey can we make more money but you also have a really really strong Mission and so their whole idea of like for eight hours a day no one tends to a human can they compress that can they make it healthier can they you know do things like body scans Etc like all these kind of cool things um I think that's a huge opportunity for someone the second is vaa uh the whole idea of like let's go to space is not new but let's go to space to help us back here on Earth is huge and so what vaa does is they've created uh space manufacturing facilities they launched them up into space they're right now manufacturing drugs in zero gravity and then they're bringing it back to Earth and so I think that that's a pretty big one um explain that I forgot what's the reason to do the manufacturing in space it's a little unclear as like what all of the reasons are going to be so far but two quick ones are like there are some drugs that uh it's either very difficult or not possible to uh currently manufacture you know with gravity so like zero gravity is a huge component of it and then the second thing is if they're able to do this correctly it actually may be cheaper to do some of this in space than it is on Earth and so like their big macro bed is just like use space for the benefit of Earth rather than everyone else who wants to go to space to like conquer Mars or you the moon or or or whatever else but dude how does that make sense how could it be cheaper to do in something in space you have to get to space in a rocket and you have to have Labor in space like how could it Poss be cheaper dude there's no labor so that's the thing is they've built this like automated manufacturing like box basically and so you don't need any labor and then now like the other thing you have to remember is like rocket launches are super cheap uh compared to what they historically were and then it's not like SpaceX it's like getting a rocket just for vaa right they're like bringing tons of things up there all at once and so now you have like shared cost of an already you know 10x or more cheaper rocket and so the math ends up working uh in a really interesting way we got we got to get that guy what's his name Delan we got to get him on the Pod to explain this I'm be like and I'm not gonna let him do no hand wavy [ __ ] I'm going to be like no no no no no oh the Box manufactures it in space and it's cheaper than renting a place in Lexington like all right walk me through that line by line there's no way right like this is crazy you guys bring him on and we'll see what he says he's obviously right like he's he's he's not wrong I just don't get it and I want somebody to explain it to me because there's got to be other people out there that are like uh how does this work exactly all right everyone quick break because I've got a thrill of the shill I've got something to shill so here's the deal about 8 weeks ago I released this new podcast called MoneyWise where we break down different people's financials meaning we look at what their income is we look at how much money they spend and they break down their portfolio and then we'll dive deep on a certain topic that's a little psychological like what what do you spend on that makes you happy things like that well I said I was only going to make more episodes a few people begged me to make more because they're really hard to make and you did so I made more so we have a season of seven episodes the first one's released today right now it's live and this first episode it's with a guy who spends roughly $250,000 a month and we broke down exactly what he spends his money on his net worth his port folio everything it's pretty surprising that people give out this information and so I'm really proud of this podcast so you can check it out the first episode is Live Now look up MoneyWise you can find it on YouTube but uh right now it's not video it's only audio but the audio is on YouTube and then Spotify iTunes wherever you get your podcast check it out and then tweet at me the SAR let me know what you guys think because I'll make more after the these next seven but again only if you love them and I need to know if you actually do so it's called MoneyWise it's a podcast by Hampton my compy joint hampton.com and let me know what you guys think the S part as my Twitter all right back to the Pod so the the third one I'm shy to share this one because Sam's head's gonna explode but uh figure AI uh definitely I think is one um so for those that don't understand what they're doing um you know human labor is becoming a huge problem where there's just not enough people to do all the jobs people get sick they're tired they only work so many hours all that kind of stuff and so this rise of like robotics but not just like Bost Dynamic like dog robots actual like what they call humanoid robots um so these are like human looking things that walk around a warehouse they can pick things up they can pack things they can kind of do all the things a human could do um and one of the best things I I texted Sean this like one of the best ways to evaluate a company is like what enemies they pick and so uh here the guy uh Brett who runs figure AI he basically picked Elon Musk as like his competitor and so like you got to be a little crazy you gotta be a little ambitious you to raise a lot of money this guy's raised you know I think over a billion dollars now um to go after this opportunity but the other thing that's really interesting is like as an investor historically people paid attention to demographics how old a population was you know how fast it was growing all that now you're gonna have to actually pay attention to Robotics and BAGI shos has talked a lot about this where uh if you don't have enough people in society you're going to have to replace them with robots and so measuring like how many robots are coming off the production line maybe a better sense of like where you should investing versus the human demographics um but I think that's a big one once they raised their first round at $300 million I went and tour their like Factory or whatever and I went back I go Sarah let's move there you're going to get a job there we got and she's like uh I don't know anything think about robotics I'm like I already bought the books you got some read tonight uh we're going to get you to work honey it's going to be okay we're g to get you caught up it's like I'm the tiger mom like don't worry we we're enrolled you in Kuman you'll be ready in three weeks yeah the coffe is brewing it's gonna be a late night so uh come on Chop Chop let's get to [Laughter] work the um I've got three more for you is uh tra I don't know if you guys have heard of uh of this company it's one of the fastest company uh growing companies in Founders funds portfolio what they figured out is uh similar to like uber where you press a button and a car shows up all of these light industrial manufacturing facilities they need tons of Labor so kind of the other side of the problem that figure's going out after so what they do is they go to these like temp uh work providers but the problem is that the temp work providers you'll be like hey I need a I need 50 people tomorrow and they'll be like cool we'll send you 30 because that's all they have and then of the 30 that they're supposed to send you like 20 of them show up and five of them are like hung over from the night before right so it's just like it's a horrible experience it's super expensive all the stuff and this is the company where like the investors brag about the N it's like on their about page they're like we're a 996 company right Savages I I met the founders and they were like have an Olympians work ethic and I was like I'm in like we're just going to outwork everyone you know the truth about this company so I um I should have invested in this company I had a chance to invest in this I was like and then before I even heard their pitch I said I'm in because I heard something very similar to what you just said P not the Olympians work ethic the spelling be Champions work ethic the guy who started the company went to Duke and I know his brother and they both the brothers were like ESP on the ESPN spelling be like you know one of them won it and then the the guy who started tra he's the guy who fainted midw do you remember that clip of the guy who starts spelling the word he passes out stands up and finishes the word it's the most incredible clip I did not know that in ESPN history forget LeBron forget Michael Jordan this kid starting to spell a word passes out gets up says nothing about passing out and just finishes spelling the word flawlessly was absolutely incredible he's the founder of tra when I heard that I'm like I'm in just send me tell me where to wire the detail uh wire the money and then unfortunately got too smart to ask my partner who knows a lot about Staffing he's like well it could be hard for all these reasons and I was like I guess you know more than I do I'm just basing this off the spelling be performance turns out I should have just trusted my gut turns out he's done all right I met him I met his brother at a party and he had won the the script spelling be right I've seen him on ESPN I see him at a party I recognized this kid from ESPN I'm like you I've seen you before I was like you're the spelling kid he's like uh yeah how how you know that was years ago and I go dude and this is annoying drunk Sean dude dude everybody wait dude spell my name he goes and he goes I don't I don't know your name I go it's Sean and he goes I don't know s h a WN I go no I beat him I beat him as if I spelled something as if he him spelling my name s h a an meant anything and that was the only time I ever interacted with this guy the next day I was mortified I was like dude what a absolute douche I was last night and I've been hoping to meet this guy again so I can apologize for this 15 years ago like bro sorry I made you name at that point now we know why he didn't send you the wire details no no that was his brother that was his brother two different guys he beca his brother became like a a very successful poker player and then and did a bunch of interesting things that way both I think spelling be is like one of those hot beds of of like if you can get obsessed and about this like intellectual Pursuit you know means two things your parents are incredibly overbearing and you're incredibly smart and so you know that usually will lead to to success 100% um next one is a placer.ai uh so I I've invested in most of these companies the only one uh open Ai andil and figure AI I I wish that I had um but uh Placer they basically uh it's this Israeli guy and he was like Hey I'm gonna use like cell phones to create better mobile analytics not like what you're doing on the phone but like where you are so originally his like pitch was like Hey I'm gonna like be able to tell people when you drive into the parking lot and like what aisles you walk through in the store and we're going to sell all this analytics like really really granular uh kind of location data they just publicly announced that they're doing a hundred million doll in annual revenue um and so when you look at that again like it's for real estate right that that's where they've seen a lot of people buy but like I think also like some hedge funds and a couple of other folks uh buy the data as well um you know $100 million is pretty much dris it and this is like if you want to have a career in like B2B you know software or analytics like obviously you're not going to go to like an andil right this kind of like offbrand off industry but I think placers are like still got probably a 10x uh potential upside what's their valuation in their latest round I think the latest public one is like a billion dollars so kind of like 10 times Revenue um so it's not hard to see a business that you know already doing $100 million doll in annual revenue uh growing pretty quickly um you know still got some upside to it this is probably my favorite one of yours so far you got any other ones you had one more maybe I I've got two more that are kind of related so um I every's all excited about like the Deep Tech stuff uh I I invested this company called rain maker and so rain maker makes it rain they're flying Precision drones into clouds and they're dropping chemicals in the clouds to Make It Rain um and so like that's kind of crazy that is probably the riskiest one wow and then um kind of simultaneous to that uh if you look at like what's like the cyber security version of all these deep tech companies there's this guy Joshua Steinman who left uh I think he was on the National Security Council uh in the Trump Administration and he like realized wait a minute like there's no companies that protect all of our public infrastructure so like the example he gave me was uh imagine what happens if someone can hack like the water treatment plants and change the pH levels of the water and have like massive you know Carnage or like you know really really screw with like a local area by simply hacking this like one facility that's public infrastructure and doing something enough areas and so he's creating a company called galvanic uh again super small probably you know on the higher end of the risk Spectrum but just like a really cool mission of um if you're able to protect public infrastructure there's like unlimited demand for this type of service uh and you can see how these businesses could get quite big uh given you know all the concerns with our adversaries and people kind of getting better at cyber warfare Etc dude I love that idea that's a great idea that's great and and what was that called Galvin g a l v n i c k wow that one and this make rain thing are are pretty wild yeah the the rain maker one like um people have been doing it's called cloud seeding people have been doing that for a while uh and they're specifically doing it in like China and the Middle East and stuff but uh there's a world where like not only can they make it rain but also if you can change the weather pattern like you may be able to like prevent uh hurricanes from hitting land and you know doing stuff like that now of course you get into this weird world that like the second someone's like hey I can like change the weather people are like right no like yeah you're trying to play God whatever um but but I think that uh where they're starting in terms of like going to Farmers and being like hey you know get what is basically precipitation in this in the clouds just to fall um you it's a worthwhile Mission and and the founder is awesome he's got a mullet he he works out he has a squat rack in the office and he's just like we are going to be successful so you know let's see what happens dude maybe I should do that for all my portfolio companies just gift them a squat rack just increase returns in my portfolio 20% I mean there there is definitely uh got to be some sort of study that like one people who just are in better shape like you have more energy you think clearer you know all that kind of stuff dude we got to ask you about two things this salana bet you did explain this this was uh this was baller Sam do you know about this no what happened so um I had a bunch of uh eth ethereum uh back from when I was mining it um and it was just kind of like sitting there gone up a lot and uh at towards the end of last year uh I was sitting there and I was just like why am I holding this like deciding to hold an asset is an active decision every day so I'm basically like saying I should go long ethereum every day that I don't sell this and I'd been scared about uh like triggering taxes and like all like the normal lies you tell yourself as to like why not to make a decision and and I just said to myself like okay if I am going to sell this and not buy more Bitcoin what else would I buy and so I like went through a bunch of the cryptocurrencies and I was just like I think salana is going to go up a lot it's gonna go up a lot more than Bitcoin I think it's gonna go up a lot more than ethereum uh in this specific bull market because a smaller market cap there's a lot of energy and excitement around it and and all that and so um over the years I've learned how to kind of like put positions on which I think is also like a very underd discussed thing I didn't like sell everything and just buy buy this asset instead what I did is uh I bought a little bit of salana at $48 it started to go up a little bit more and usually when that happens people are like oh cool I was right instead I doubled the bet at 55 like the position is going in your favor and so I doubled down because it's telling me like the market is telling me I'm right it kept going up uh I then sold 100% of the ethereum and I bought salana at $73 I think it was and so it gave me like a uh Blended price around like 65 bucks and so salana just went on a tear it went to $120 and I was like oh wow that was awesome like hopefully it keeps going and that was it I was like done but then the price started to fall and as it fell it fell from like 120 to 110 to 100 and I woke up one day and it was at $80 and over the years I've just learned like nothing's changed with the thesis I got no more ethereum to sell to like you know convert over so like I'm going into the bank account and I just went and got more cash and bought it at 80 which happened to be about a 30% draw down which historically in crypto has been like a pretty good spot and then it's ripped all the way up to like 190 is um and so it's been a great trade but also it is uh I'm only able to do it because I've been doing this long enough and like learned how to put the positions on how to think about like when the position goes in your favor to add not like sell and take profits um but you also have to know what you own and like I don't think I'll own salana like five or 10 years from now it's very much like for the next year on very bullish on this um and then like we'll see what happens whereas Bitcoin like I'll hold forever and don't think that I'll ever sell it first of all I mean kind of very uh you know good trade so first of all the very very well done not not easy to do what you just described the psychology around what you just described is I think more important than than the why but I do want to ask you you said the word thesis on salana so I have a buddy who has a insane amount of salana he owns like 40 or 50 million dollars of salana and I think this guy's nuts for doing it he's a very smart guy in general but I'm I ask him I'm like why why do you own this absurd amount of salana this is like what do you know that I don't know please tell me so I can go buy it if you have some like incredible thesis and he's like I just I li I think it's going to go up that number go up thesis and he's like well I think it's going to be a bull market and a bull market it's usually these kind of like second thir third fourth fifth coins that like get the highest runup um I see a lot of energy in the Eos people like these like all of a sudden it starts to sound a lot like I don't know like uh you know we're talking like horoscope type language for me and so I'm like and I've been telling him I'm like dude please just sell this thing and he's like oh I just feel like the energy I feel like I see it a lot on Twitter it's like oh my god dude are you sure that this is the reason to have 4 or50 million dollars of salana that is an absurd amount of this thing yeah on one hand it sounds crazy you're like oh it's like the energy whatever on the other hand like in this person's defense what I would say is um when I first started investing somebody told me like follow the developers like that's like a great investing strategy and so there is like a lot of development activity that's Shifting the other thing is there is a pretty like wellth thought out investment strategy of like I want to buy the things that everyone's gonna buy tomorrow today rather like I like if everyone else is GNA build a thesis around something then I want to buy it uh before they do like be contrarian that becomes consensus and I love the George Soros quote he's like when I see a bubble I rush in right like like the whole point is that bubbles kind of like go bigger and further than you think that they can um and so let's just say that like salana is a bubble selling an asset at the beginning of a bull market is usually in crypto like a pretty bad strategy um but also uh as assets get bigger the returns go down and so I don't think it's crazy to say like oh there's a lot of activity around this there's a really strong narrative or meme um there's tons of coins and and things that are being launched on this and Bitcoin ethereum and Salon probably all go up but if you had to pick one of the three that goes up the most well it's probably the smaller market cap asset that likely will outperform and and so I don't think it's like the craziest uh Theory the question is what is your thesis on when to sell and that's what people in crypto including myself over the years like we have messed that up over and over and over again because timing markets is nearly impossible and when an asset goes up hundreds of percent you're like well of course it's going to double from here and then next thing you know it's down 50% you're like [ __ ] so what are you thinking with the salana one what are you going to do my theory in crypto now is uh selling is less to do with price levels like like in um the public markets people will hold a stock and they're like okay if this ever gets overvalued I'm selling I'm trimming the position in crypto it's much more cyclical and so I actually think that selling is more about what where are we in the cycle like time than it is like value right because there it's hard to like what is the value versus price and is this overpriced or underpriced like it's very difficult to do for these assets so I think about it a lot more as like is it the end of this coming year is it you know the beginning of next year is it the summer of 2025 like there's some time frame that I'll come up with and I'm like I don't care what the valuations are like I'm just selling because it seems like the right time in the cycle more so than I have a price target for any one of these assets what was the second thing you were going to ask him about Sean Andrew tapate uh pomp interviewed Andrew tape before he was Tate you you you were on Tate before Tate uh what's the guy like you you met him in person right um I did meet him in person he uh uh did an interview together in Miami um why' you interview him at that time was he kind of big is that was it like kind of interesting person or what was the context I don't really think that he had maybe he said a couple of crazy things online like crazy in the sense that you know people were like oh whatever like reacting to it but um you know he's a four-time world champion kickboxer uh we had like dmed a couple of times um I I actually thought that he was just like an interesting person from the perspective of like he had a lot of uh uh commentary about things that people either weren't willing to say or um like made me think and didn't mean I agreed with everything it just like when you want when you find those people you kind of like hey tell me all your World Views and then like I'll sift through the [ __ ] and figure out like what I agree with and what I don't um and so I interviewed him and he definitely said some like things that I was like oh I I can't release this interview like you know this is kind of like a little uh little spicy um and so what was interesting is I was like hey I don't know if we're going to like actually ever release this thing like let's just kind of put it on ice and and we'll go from there and then a year later like Society had changed culture had changed and he started to like become much bigger he went on a couple podcasts he said a lot of the exact same things and people didn't have a problem with it so like it it's interesting like he was saying the same thing for like a year or two years but actually culture became like a little bit more acceptable of some of the commentary and including things around like you know uh um the vaccine and like that type of stuff and like I think people just had more information to kind of evaluate these situations and so I was like all right it's still a little spicy but like let's release it and one of the like final points to deciding whether we were going to release it or not was I didn't really care so much about the like really hardcore uh perspectives as much as like who are you as a person like how do you make money like kind of like you know the business and the person behind these thoughts what was his business at the time Hustler University like his course he he had a bunch of them they were like online businesses uh he you know he described them actually it was the first time that ever a podcast episode I had done was like cited In Articles where people were like writing hit pieces or like you know critiquing him and then they were like referencing things on the podcast so I'd get like a Google alert notification like oh like you've been mentioned in like the New Yorker or whatever and I'm like oh must be awesome like obviously I'm a cool guy and then you go you're like oh I'm in an article where they're like you know talking about misogyny and like all these things like oh okay um and so uh at the end of that interview he he asked me he's like what's the one thing you disagree with me today and what I say to him in the interview is I said to him I said every single thing that you're saying has like this like kernel of truth but then you like extract it and have this like bombastic rapper that basically is gonna go viral online and he kind of like cracks a little bit and breaks character and he's just like ah you're a smart man he like shakes my hand and I think like that was the biggest takeaway was people don't become viral and successful without being highly intelligent and he very well understood the human psychology and the way the internet worked um and so he had a message he wanted to get that message out to people he was able to communicate in a very effective way um and so people might not agree with everything he said but if you look at his tactics they have pretty much become standard in a lot of people's like marketing today and so people kind of like saw this guy be successful on the internet get a message out and now you have a bunch of companies and individuals that are trying to replicate it and maybe it's not the same message but like that structure was pioneering and so you've got to be able to like evaluate people and say hey I understand you for who you are I agree with some things you say I disagree with other things you say and then like can I learn something from you and to me the learning was uh he really really understood marketing and communicating on the internet in a way that I don't think a lot of people did before they kind of saw what he did yeah and he kind of paid the paid the [ __ ] price for it too well in hindsight like that's the second You Know lesson is like don't become the main character right like or if you are you better be ready to pay that price yeah and it's just you know I ask myself a lot look I I have a number of very successful friends who um nobody's ever heard of before right and I'm sometimes like man that's an amazing life like like you figured it out you fig how to be super successful and also no one knows who you are um there's a lot of other people who like they enjoy talking to folks right you know uh Patrick bavid I saw a clip of him recently and he was talking about the fact when he sold his insurance company he was like I wanted to do something for the rest of my life that I enjoyed and talking to people and learning from them was like the thing and so he went he did all this Media stuff and and whatever and so I think you just gotta like know who you are as a person like what are you trying to accomplish professionally what what is your uh Comfort level with like privacy and like personal you know know kind of notoriety um and it's different for everybody and so yeah if you want to become the main character then definitely you got to be ready for you know everything that comes with that good or bad well dude you're dressed as the main character today you came on here you're looking good best dressed award for 2024 is in your hands somebody has to come take that belt out of your hands for my first million thanks for coming on dude it's always fun to talk to you thanks for having me all right that's the pod [Music]

no is a great tool it's very specific yes is a blunt force instrument that damages a lot of things it might be worth it because that thing you choose to do might be the thing that you needed to do but it does force you to say no to a bunch of other opportunities and the longer you spend on that yes the more NOS you are throwing off I do think it's very important to figure out what you're doing why you're doing it and then get it done in a reasonable period of time partially because you don't know if it's going to be any good or not you might have a feeling but the Market's going to tell you for sure so you want to get out of the market as soon as you can ultimately and then you find out and then you can iterate from there so that's kind of our general approach to things

Sam you know what they say when you're on a boat and it's sinking get off Women and Children First uh and that's what we're doing with the podcast today Women and Children [Music] First I have a topic I want to talk to you about have you seen this startup that's called co- fertility how do you spell it see fertility D I don't know it could have been Co like you spell with a K like in the Asian way I don't know co- fertility all right I get it yeah I'm there so check this out uh you know a little bit about egg freezing but uh I didn't know much I've never done it but I do know there's like a growing trend of this I think basically people are having babies later in life and um egg freezing Tech has come along and it's also become more normalized I think some companies pay you or will pay for your egg freezing um but like just look at this Google Trends chart so last five years egg freezing is basically gone from you know roughly kind of 30 40 on the Google Trends to like basically 80 and so it is it is on the rise and that's just in the past I don't know couple years two three years I think last year 20,000 women in the United States chose to freeze their eggs so still a very small number so for like the 18yearold men who are listening to this podcast for me 6 months ago what is egg freeze what what do you mean so egg phrasing so I guess uh I guess I I I actually don't know the difference in terminology but I know from experience there's two ways to do it one uh a woman just freezes her eggs and then when she's ready uh I don't I guess why does it feel like we're having the talk it's like when a man and woman love each other very much birds of the Beast I was a I was a participant in this and so I guess you could you could freeze just eggs and then eventually when you like meet a husband or you meet someone who you want to like mix it with you mix it and they stick it up beside the women and then like nine months later hopefully she has a kid uh the other way you do it is you freeze embryos um which is a process that I went through which is uh awesome but every like leading up to doing it I have to bring my sperm to the doctor uh like 30 minutes after getting the sperm out of my body and you just have this ultimate look of Shame and I remember my wife and I have debated what is more embarrassing and shameful like when a woman has to go to a geologist or when a man has to like donate sperm uh it's like it's like when my son comes out like I haven't seen him in a little while and he's like a three-year-old and he just comes out of somewhere and he'll be like I did a bad thing it's that's you walking into the hospital holding a cup of sperm it's a it's a horrible experience and so uh yes I so that's what egg freezing is somehow we made this about the dude side of things but I think for the women it's a little bit harder they have to like literally take shots and like harvest the egg it's like a very hard process on your body anyways it's also very expensive so I think traditional egg freezing one cycle is something like $10,000 and so there's a startup co- fertility what they came out and said was hey free egg freezing how is it free right and it says um by the way they had like this billboard or this ad which was it says the best time to freeze your eggs is often when you can least afford it that's why we're making it free and I don't know if you ever heard that phrase if it's free then you are the product yeah basically wow the biggest version of this so what it's doing what they're doing is they're like we will freeze your eggs for free but we keep half we we keep half the eggs and this sounds a little crazy when you first hear about it but I actually think this is pretty smart what they've done is they've bundled together two things they've bundled together egg freezing and egg donation so some people do donate eggs they get paid for it and they're willing to do that they go in eyes wide open and they choose to do that and that's great because other people need eggs and so they bundled it together where now you can you can get free egg freezing if you bundle in and agree to donate half the eggs up front and on the other side they go and charge people who want eggs and they charge them $133,000 at $13,700 to as their matchmaking fee to get you your eggs and so I think this is a pretty smart and disruptive uh model what do you think of this idea uh insane I think this is insane I not in a bad way necessarily I think it's a bad way for me I don't want to do that but I think that the whole process of that that I went through that my wife and I went through I think it was like something like $60,000 um and her insurance paid for it but if you can't afford it you're screwed this is pretty wild do you think this could actually work as a business I think this can totally work I think there's a lot of people out there who like you said they don't have the extra tens of thousands of dollars to freeze their eggs and so if your options were don't have don't freeze it or this free option but you're going to donate your you know some of your unused eggs and you'll know that they're out there in the world I think there's a lot of people who will take that and I by the way I think that because this is controversial it's going to get so much Free Press like there is something um almost strategic in doing a a sort of controversial taboo almost a naughty idea and you will get article after article on online argument after online argument and all it really does is it pushes away the people who were never going to be your customer but it educates the people who actually might be your customer because it's going to be so noisy dude let me tell you a related story so she said I could name her name but you and I have a friend named cat and well she's I'm really close with her I don't know if you're close with her I think you've just met her once or twice um her and her wife wanted to have a kid and it was and although she's successful she's a she's a Frugal woman and it was really expensive to do this and we all have a mutual friend David who's this wonderful man he's like a 6ot tall goodlooking nice smart guy and Cat and her wife Emily were like David would you like to uh you know could we get some of your sperm and have a baby and they looked into like some of this egg freezing stuff and it was really expensive and they were like can we just kind of do it yourself on this one and so uh they didn't have sex they didn't have sex but he would come over in the morning uh like when they were ovulating and he would do the deed in the bathroom they would get the sperm and they would just kind of uh I guess they had like a do-it-yourself kid at home yeah like a turkey I don't know like and uh they did that and in the very first try cat got pregnant now she's got a beautiful two-year-old and wow it worked so what did he get like free lunch what what Happ what did David get out of this nothing he just he's like a he's like dude it's like on paper this that's how she's a great marketer dude she is a great entrepreneur and a great marketer she convinced this guy to do this for free you know she used her uh her marketing skills well they have a beautiful kid and he's like the uncle and his parents sort of act like a mixture of grandparents and uncle and aunts and it's like a wildly awesome relationship and everyone's happy with the ordeal and so this whole like co- fertility thing I think this is another interesting solution to the same problem similar problem what's the what's the slogan for Austin I don't know what is it Keep Austin Weird Keep Austin Weird kept doing your part out there they kept it weird if I told you this solution like oh it's just possible you'd be like that's crazy these three people it's I guess it's a thruple I don't know what you call this it's perfect it's like the most harmonious relationship I've ever seen yeah sounds actually very healthy to be honest it's very healthy so I like co- fertility did they raise money uh um I I you know how I think they raise money they have the like you know when you see somebody who goes to the store and buys a new outfit and you're like you're looking great but like can't really put your finger on what's new about it and then you see the tag on their jacket still you're like oh this is you got a new jacket that's what you went shopping and got a new jacket their fonts are all the fonts of like a red antler brand where you're like oh you launched but you paid for fancy branding up front you got a font that I can't find on Def font.com in the free section and so I know that they got some money somehow to do this all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net wors and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I can see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it works and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM uh this is pretty cool would you do this yeah why not uh also it's hilarious that like on this huge life decision I was like why not and then for the first time in my life my brain responded with several reasons why not usually why not is met with nothing so they did some I was reading some study and it said that 83% of egg donors share that they would donate again and only 2% regret their decision which forget about you know surveys I think are are often prone to just like finding data that supports the point you want but I do think it's an interesting uh that's an interesting statistical thing which is what percentage of people regret ex decision like I would love to see a list of life decisions and then the regret score um you know for example burning Burning Man is this thing that I've been on the fence for for like 11 years even though everybody I like and Trust in my life who goes is like it's the best what are you even talking about what's the decision just go and I don't know anybody that's regretted it personally in my life I'm sure there are people because there's like a million people that go every year but I I just kind of want to see for life decisions the the regret percentage for each thing I think that would be very Illuminating for uh somebody who's trying to make good decisions in life don't you think wait so why haven't you gone to berning man I'm scared of drugs yeah same but you just literally said no one that you've Matt has regretted it and when I tell them that they're like so then don't do drugs I'm like but I thought that's what you do there and they're like no that's just one of many things you don't have to do drugs what kind of Dork ass response was that and then I'm like okay I'll I'll think about it this year then I go home and I'm like I'm still scared of drugs I'm not doing this my Square friend like my I'm straight edged so my other straight edged friend and his girlfriend they're like hey we went to Bernie man birning man it was awesome you guys want to see some pictures and we I was looking at pictures and swiping through their phone and it it looked a little bit normal a little bit normal and he's like sitting over my shoulder like yeah this is this cool guy we met like here's this cool van that we saw um there's us just like doing this and then there's a picture of him but naked like with a full frontal photo with his arm over her who's also naked and they're just like smiling and then he's just like yeah there we were like celebrating this thing the weather was great that day yeah and then just swipe and I was like okay and I saw that I was like I don't know man bur those might be the scariest words in the English language do you want to see some pictures from my Burning Man trip it's like you know right before you go to Six Flags and they put the the the the like roller coaster thing and the thing comes down and clamps you in that's that's how I feel when somebody says you want to see the pictures for Burning Man this year um I want to do another parenting one before I get to the parenting one can I do a quick little thrill the show thrill me baby this is something I'm um I'm proud of so in Hampton we have access to like a thousand Founders and we've been doing these really cool surveys where we Sur by the way Hampton it's my community uh for CEOs average CEOs doing about 25 million dollar in Revenue you guys can check it out and you apply we interview everyone fun fact my partner Joe and I watch 100% of the interviews and we're the ones clicking the approve or deny button um so you're like the Harvey Weinstein of the of the process would you say no I would not say that I would not so check it out join hampton.com but here's what's kind of cool we did this survey and I was like let's do wealth where we like ask all these people all these questions like you know how much money do you have what's your monthly burn all these questions that people are embarrassing to have it was cool but then we were like let's actually do it by industry and so we're doing it by software uh we're doing it by all the different Industries so what other Industries other software marketplaces Health stuff uh we just did one on e-commerce and if you go to join hampton.com or just search just actually this is easier look in the YouTube description or just Google join Hampton and then blog and you'll see our blog and you'll see all our reports dude we did this thing with Ecom owners where we asked them all about their revenue per employee and uh their uh how much profit they're making how much they're paying themselves things like that did you see that thing released what was the revenue per employee I'm curious dude it was pretty good so let me read you off some of the wow what a satisfying answer thanks thanks I'm gonna read it I'm gonna this the chart just says pretty good yeah de it just says de I'm going to read I I'll I'll read you uh off so we had about 50 people the average revenue of the responder was 25 million average revenue per employee 1.35 million the average founder paid themselves $385,000 a year net profit has grown consistently over the last couple years and we break down each company's net profit um and shockingly I guess this isn't shocking to you and I [ __ ] meta dude it's still the best platform for buying ads for Ecom dude uh it is except for there's a couple people just dominating on Tik Tok shops right now but um let me ask you something on 1.3 million of Revenue per employee right so 1.3 million of Revenue per employee I would say that a good e-commerce brand is doing 20% profit margins on that before taxes ia ia margin um and I would say the average might be between 10 and 15% so let's just do a little math so 1.3 and let's just use the 15% number what is that $195,000 and so I would guess the average wage might be 100 for these e-commerce uh stores maybe 120 and so roughly 50 to 70k of profit per employee and so that's why the 30th and final slide of this presentation where we go through all the numbers it just say Ecommerce sucks it just says don't don't but if you're listening and you are into e-commerce check it out just look up uh you can go to join.com blog or just search Hampton blog and you'll see all the reports there or in the YouTube description now can we talk about something that it was your idea to cover this person and I'm now obsessed with them

Long Island it's like 45 minutes outside the city she had a bunch of issues as a kid so she had like emotional issues that she wasn't sure how to handle uh eventually that developed into anorexia and she starts going to therapy at age eight or nine gets obsessed with therapy goes to Duke and Colombia to study psychology and then starting around the pandemic so 2020 she just starts doing this content on Instagram and I looked at her first post it's feels like very impromptu so it's like her just kind of actually like this setting or like your setting be next to a wall just with her camera up and answering questions about parenting of which she studied uh at Duke in Columbia and it takes off and one of the reasons it takes off is she's very charismatic she's very cool looking she's got the it Factor she looks like someone who you could trust and she grabs your attention nicely although it's sort of like Andrew huberman where he's not doing anything like thrilling but there's something about their personality and the way they look where you're like I just want to trust and listen I trust you just trust this person yeah I just want to listen to you now things kind of off and she's like let's turn this into a thing so she creates this business called good inside and it's a community where you pay $300 a year and you uh you get access to like this area where you can talk to other members and you could ask questions and they also have a bunch of uh she calls it good inside clinicians but people who I guess who she's trained who are talking and answering different questions and now it's a thriving Community behind the community you also can see videos of her things like that and by the way do you know who she partnered with to start this business I do I just found that out right before this pod I was like did you catch that I was like Eric abelski huh is that a common last name or is this Scott belly's wife and it turns out it's Scott belly's wife no way it's Scott belly's wife of the Pod Scott bsky yes Scott belly who's now the chief product officer at uh Adobe uh I don't know if he's actually been on the Pod but we both admire him just a wildly successful cool dude and that's her partner and did you also know that they've recently raised $10 million for this business good inside no way I did not know that and this is only like a few years old I think it's like three or four years old but you missed the headline the headline to the story is uh the product uh their product good inside has about 50,000 paying members so their membership communities probably doing around 13 14 million a year in Revenue giving parents parenting tips parenting advice from two clinical Physicians and mothers right uh that's kind of amazing and this is a amazing it's an interesting Market there's actually a bunch of these so I don't know if you ever saw uh taking care of babies you know who that is no what's that one so if you just get her her her name is Cara and then her handle is taking car of babies we had bought her course like for hundred something bucks when I had my first kid and she has basically like a sleep training course of like train your baby to sleep without without uh crying it out I did bought I bought her $100 course I sat down I did it I looked at it I watched it and I was like yeah we're not going to be able to do that but either way it was good material and there was some good insights in it and basically the funnel for these is All the Same free content on Instagram or YouTube and then basically like they're just building Trust on Instagram really where it's like here's who I am here's what I do I'm GNA put up stories and tips every single day they build up trust trust trust trust trust and then they have the free or sorry they have the paid either membership or educational product underneath at the info product taking care of babies was making somewhere between 10 and15 million this was not even like a company this is just like her uh 10 to 15 million a year in Revenue with fat profit margins because she was spending nothing on marketing and basically had no you know a small team or no team and uh and then she got cancelled unfortunately she got canceled because she donated to Trump of all things like pretty crazy reason to cancel somebody but uh the mom sort of in Mass unsubscribed and in all the mommy groups on Facebook they were like we're not going to support her if she's gonna support Trump and so she kind of got knocked down a couple of pegs I think she's still out there doing fine but but would like the Trump be like yeah I'm in even harder well I think there's probably some lean in the like who uses these products and who pays for these products which is like maybe more Coastal moms and whatnot like it might be skewed in that way um I'm not sure but but you're right yeah it it doesn't fully doesn't fully make sense but I remember reading that there's other ones uh Ben had bought this one called big little feelings I think uh they sold 200,000 courses at an average of $100 so 20 million in Revenue um turns out mom influencer great career great career if you could pull it off and it's a very simple career uh not easy to do let me put that put it that way but very simple free content on Instagram lead to paid thing but obviously these people have expertise maybe they've been a a doula for a long time or they're a clinical physician or they're a clinical psychologist sorry um they they have to have some you know expertise or authority in the domain but you know one of the things I really liked about Dr Becky's content by the way is I think intentionally she makes it relatable so she's not wearing a lot of makeup she's not sitting in front of a very well produced thing which of course they could afford it at this point but she'll be like on the go to pick up her kids from soccer practice just take out her phone when she has the impulse about some topic and say it and I think it makes her feel like the kind of relatable but aspirational mom who like just finds time doesn't have time type of thing and um I think there's something strategic about that that that's pretty cool so that's what I wanted to bring up so Dr Becky is I think a very very smart woman and I think she runs with very smart people because I was looking into this woman a little bit and this sounds like I'm hating I don't mean for it to sound that way I'm a big fan of this person and I think they're the real deal I think that this is far more put together than it appears to be it tries to look like it's kind of thrown together and and it's this thing but Dr Becky lives on the upper west side of New York where a 1,800 foot apartment is typically 5 to like7 million and she she also like uh went to the best schools she's from Scarsdale which is a beautiful uh fancy Community uh in New York I think that she runs around with you know people like Erica bsky these people that are top-notch top at their game and they I think that it was definitely like a we're gonna do this and we're gonna do this and we're gonna do this not oh one thing just happened to turn to this to this to this like she's executing this plan perfectly and so this again this sounds like I'm being negative I'm I'm not there's nothing wrong or unethical at all about any of this uh but it like I think this is like a perfectly executed plan is what I think it is yeah I think for most content creators it starts organically right because you don't sit there and think and now from scratch I shall become an influencer with millions of followers it's not really start I don't think she did I don't think so we can scroll back like let's scroll all the way they deleted Old Post all the old I I already found the old posts they've been like I I I looked on on YouTube like there like there aren't that many old posts um and here's what I think I think that if had you met this woman 10 years ago like it would have been very you could have just had a conversation with her and be like yeah I think you got the it Factor like this is like a type of person who I see her talking I'm like dude it's very obvious that you've got like whatever these popular influencers have let's just put a little bit of money behind this and turn this into a thing well I like that you've gone coffeezilla on this one you're like hey wait pause that frame that's Oprah in the background she's friends with Oprah like I try to find the thing think I think my my personal belief I don't think it's plotted but I do think it's strategic meaning I think there's a lot of uh to make something look effortless to make something look authentic and and and and real it actually takes some effort to make something look effortless and it takes um some thinking to make something look off the cuff in a way right and um and often it's not that you're manipulating people but it's you're intentionally saying no to certain things that would ruin that vibe that would break that trust that would break the fourth wall or what ever and so I do think that they've done a great job of that like uh you know there but there is the negative version like I think remember those stories about Sam bankman freed where they were like um hey uh you know you're gonna meet with whoever this investor today and they're in the boardroom and they're like Sam um you look good he's like thanks and they're like no like you need to you need to look like a like you need to look like a dork and they were like get this man some Jorts and like somebody ruffle up his hair make it look like he hasn't slept in weeks and there's there's an article that basically was like we basically knew that people pattern match and if we can look basically like Zuckerberg and a bunch of the other like kind of prodigies who are awkward who don't know how to dress who they have these weird personality quirks okay let's play up that he's vegan let's make him drive this car right like there was intentional choices along the way to either make him look more like that or prevent anybody from polishing up those rough edges they're like no no no the rough edges are key let's keep those and actually let's put those front and center yeah and there was there were stories that came out it's very rare for those stories to come out because even the people that pull it off they they never have any incentive to come out and like acknowledge that it's only when somebody has a complete downfall that his closest confidants come and betray and be like yeah that actually happened by the way I am not remotely implying that Sam bakman freed and this woman are even in the same I'm not all I'm say I like this lady I trust her advice I think not getting an invite to her Hampton party this summer right what I'm saying is I think that she's just a shark when it comes to business which is not something that would you would necessarily want to portray when you're trying to be a a mother expert I'm on board with Becky I think she's the best so I I'm on board um what uh is there any niches that you think are interesting other than parenting for this model because this model is the most basic simple model explain the model what do you mean by that so the model is um well I don't know why they rais money for this because typically you don't need to with this model but the model is we'll use Andrew shman as an example so or we could use what I've done whatever but the model is you get popular on the internet and become a thought expert and then you get popular oftentimes you're having a Blog sometimes a podcast sometimes on social media and then you create a community you create a community that is uh something like $200 or $300 a year and you try to get as many people as possible and then you also host events that cost money and then you have courses that are between $1,000 and $2,000 something to upsell because you want your pricing to be something cheap a little bit more expensive and a little bit more expensive and then you just focus on getting more and more popular and creating this business all around a lifestyle an idea for her her idea is um uh what's it called good inside I think that's like her it's like that's like a thing she teaches called good inside for other people like um there's Mark cist who did this with um uh good apple which is about like a a health company there's a lot of people who have done this in a variety of niches where it's thought leader blog book course community and then like some type of higher tiered membership yeah definitely like Miss Excel did this with just teaching people Excel Excel expert create free content leads to courses leads to info products leads to membership uh I think this Playbook has been out for a while and by that I just mean to say I don't think this is um I don't think you have to do the figuring out all you have to do is the execution which is nice in a way but it also means it's kind of competitive it's not as easy as it might have been if you were early in the figuring out phase but you could definitely do it we've done it in a way um we just gave three examples in the parenting Niche that have done it Miss Excel has done it there there's people who have done it in the you know the vshred type of model that have done it in the guys bodybuilding what's vshred v shred you know you don't know what V shred is no what is that involve like the V of your abs yes yes the Dorito body baby you want your you want your upper body to be shaped like an upside down Dorito um you don't know who vred is that blows my mind dude let's V it is the perfect intersection of dude's shirtless successful businesses and internet affiliate marketers I can't believe you don't know who this guy is that is your that's your vend diagram sign me up you don't know who big shred is oh my God all right so let me give you a little vshred uh story so you you do know this guy as soon as I you see him you're going to know this guy I I'm on his website I have I I don't I've never seen this before in my life basically this guy was super jacked guy who then has runs Facebook ads you click the Facebook ad and it takes you down a funnel and his funnels are pretty like well known in the internet like marketing Niche because it'd be like a vshred clickfunnel and it would be usually a quiz and it would take you through a quiz of like uh I'm a guy it's like do you want to get act or get abs and you're like oh man or it's like both it's like give me both and then be like what holds you back is it you know eating poorly you're like yeah it is eating poorly how'd you know and then you just keep going down this funnel it's like I'm gonna give you a personalized thing and then it gives you a personalized thing and you pay 99 bucks for it and he basically ran this funnel um and made like I don't know how much money this guy made but I'm pretty sure I ran at one point this was like nine figures but I think I might be mixing up kinobody and v no you're right I'm looking at VRE and some like there's some stories saying it's done $200 million in Revenue yeah so how look at this block post how vred used a quiz funnel to drive 200 million in Revenue I don't know if this is like legit or not but in 20 2022 they had five million monthly visitors on their website and uh yeah this guy just basically dominated with uh with Facebook ads for the the health and fitness Niche now what he was doing was he was using ads he was still an influencer but he was like cool I'm gonna pump ads and I have this like funnel that was basically the most simple click funnel in the world like you go there literally we could show this on the it's a progress bar and then it just says are you a man or a woman and there like simple Like A or B type of answers and you click you click you click and then you kind of want to see what's the end here and then they'll show you like at the end it's like before he sells you the thing he shows you like five Transformations like here's this nerd now he's jacked here's this fat guy now he's skinny and it just shows you like five Transformations and it's like do you want that [ __ ] or not and then you buy it dude imagine them just describing it at their meeting like you did so we going to show show a nerd a fat guy and then we're just going to say want this [ __ ] or not it's where are we going to get a nerd take your shirt off right now go take a picture it's you you're the guy um do you want to talk about this guy Isaac yeah yeah tell the story okay this is like a full this is a full circle story so have you have you seen have you seen what the guy that guy Isaac's doing the guy who we talked about his mini Katana brand what's his last name I have no idea what Isaac's last name is Isaac Mini Katana guy sword guy and we talked about him before because he had taken a product that was super Niche literally katas like the I don't know Japanese sword it is he sent me one yeah they're called mini katanas by the way this thing is like six feet long it's so long nothing mini about it you know pissed my wife was and we got this like giant sword in the house now I'm like I don't know it's supposed to be small I don't know what happened um and they couldn't run Facebook ads or Google ads because you can't advertise weapons and so what he did was really smart was he basically got content creators to make cool video he turned his disadvantage to his Advantage his disadvantage was I can't run ads his Advantage was I sell a cool product swords and there's a lot of cool content you can make with swords and he just used YouTube and Tik Tok to go viral many times and he built it up to like 10 million or so a year basically like you know uh 10 10 to 20 million a year in revenue on the katana brand but of course surprise surprise there's not a lot of repeat purchase in the sword Niche right like you're not you know there are some colle but for most people most people don't want a sword of the people who want a sword you might just want one you might not want to fill your house with swords so it was not a great Ecom product but what's he doing now he switch hold on before you get to what he's doing now you've missed a few points about Isaac so Isaac I listened to a podcast with him he was like a he did Postmates and like freelancing and things like that and then he's like I'm gonna start a business and so he was like yeah we can't like you said we can't advertise but you didn't say how big his channels got so basically he was like I'm going hard on content and so he gets to 1 billion views a month across his network of of YouTube channels and so his main Channel on YouTube which only launched in 2022 has 8.7 million subscribers and five uh like and billions of views and this is like not their main product their main product is the swords and they're just using this as marketing but it's they knocked it out the park it's an incredible example of marketing I've used this I've I've used I've learned some things from Isaac and used them in my business um that have been very effective and it's just a different way of thinking about marketing so but what he was doing was he would say all right how do you sell a miniana you can either go to people who already are collectors that's a really really small Market you go to people who might be interested why because they have interest in anime and and different like interest overlaps where do they hang out okay they hang out on Tik Tok and on YouTube all right cool how do I actually get them to want my product how do I build desire for my product and what he did was instead of saying here's the sword here's the features here's how the handle looks here's how sharp it is whatever he's like do you think I can cut this bullet in half if I shot a bullet at somebody at this ninja do you think the ninja could cut it in half with a sword that video has like I don't know 10 20 million views it's like an insane video where a guy literally chops a bullet in half as it's flying at him using a sword and um then he does another one where it's like which is kind of like a weird that's like a weird thing that's like saying like if you punch me me saying like told you my face could stop that like like the bullet aims at the sword hurt your hand huh as you bleed um he also did one that was like another marketing thing I really liked of his was how do you not mention the product in a way that drives the comments crazy so he started a video that was or not he but like one of his creators started a video that was like they're like cooking a steak so you think it's a cooking video and it's about a steak and then they put the steak on the on the cutting board and then they take a giant Katana and they cut it into slices but they never mention the Katana and every comment was like uh are we going to talk about him using a actual sword to cut the steak what what the hell was that and the comments Drive the virality and it was if he had said now watch me use this sword people wouldn't care it's when he didn't mention the sword that all the comments have to talk about uh bro what what is this and it's that type of social engineering that I think was really really smart all he needed was a better product I think he might have a better product now and so he he starts to sit down and he's like all right so my business got to like 10 or 20 million in Revenue that's not enough I want to go to 1 billion and so he shared out he goes in late 2022 I stepped back and I said I need to hit a billion dollar company or I want to make a billion dollar company here's my five requirements would the content Playbook give us an a severe unfair Advantage does the does it have a huge Tam meaning could a 1% win be a massive outcome is there some is this something that I'm personally passionate about does this have a moat sort of like mini Katana store already had which is like making swords are really hard so if I can figure that out I have a moat and then finally the product doesn't 100% rely on marketing because I want Tailwinds uh I want I want to like catch a wave and so he said what can I launch that fits that and so what did he launch he launched a Freez dried candy brand called conai foods and um it's basically candy brand and it's I don't have you ever had freeze-dried candy I've never tried this I I don't think I've had this I don't really know what it is all right so here's what it says freze dried process removes all moisture from the candy leaving behind a perfectly crunchy treat so I think it's candy that's crunchy like a chip basically and light so it's like a gummy bear but light yeah yeah exactly um it's like just the sugar and so he uh by the way this is a great example of one of the most valuable insights that I ever had on the podcast when Alex heroi came on the podcast long time ago I don't know where this was his first came on like three years ago and you know hormozi puts out like you know a metric [ __ ] ton of content every month and I don't consume all of it but this one thing he said to me three years ago on our podcast has stuck with me and I've repeated it to myself and many others I actually told Isaac this at a party once when I was talking about dude you are doing 10 out of 10 execution on a two out of 10 opportunity this was the advice I needed to hear early in my career because I started a restaurant and I tried to do all the coolest [ __ ] in the world and I tried my hardest and I was trying to bring 10 out of 10 effort and I thought I was a 10 out of 10 talent but I was going after a two out of 10 opportunity and that's what porosi said that he that that's the advice he got from Russell Brunson about his gym launch thing they were like uh dude you're you're an amazing marketer but you're just using your marketing to launch brick and mortar gym chains one at a time a couple in a year maybe what you need to do that's you taking 10 out of 10 execution at a two out of 10 opportunity brick and mortar small scale Boutique gyms instead what you should do is take your marketing Playbook and go sell it to every gym across the country that's the 10 out of 10 opportunity similarly um you know uh just the last segment we talked about with the Dr Becky taking her her expertise and children if all she did was saw five five clients a day as a clinical child psychologist or whatever it is um that would be a smaller opportunity than what she decided to do which was make a media product that scaled to millions of people and then charge you know a membership fee and make 13 to 15 million a year on her membership fees right that's a same skill set bigger opportunity or same person bigger opportunity I think what Isaac's done is he's taken that 10 out of 10 content Playbook that he really like mastered and he switched from going to a a one I would actually give the sword thing like honestly a one or two out of 10 opportunity and now he's going for like you know a sort of a five or six out of 10 some six out of six or seven out of 10 opportunity because he said it right he might have had 100% of the mini Katana Market before and it'll be smaller than him getting half a percent of the uh of the candy Market or even the like alternative candy Market in this case what did you do with your mini Katana it's sitting right over there on the wall in my office in a case just in case which is the problem with it which is the exact problem with that business is mine's doing the same thing it's just sitting there and I showed it to three people one time practice every day what am I supposed to do with it uh and so did he shut down mini Katana I have no idea but he should all right just light it on fire and throw in the dumpster and hope no one finds it with that whole business it's honestly an underrated uh an underrated thing is the art of quitting um like your whole life you're told not to quit and you're told that perseverance is everything well quitting like everything it wouldn't exist if it didn't have a function and uh there is a function to quitting things and you know it's easy to quit when everything's failing hard thing to quit is the Slow Burn of mediocrity right like the thing that's not taking up all your attention but it's taking up some the thing that's not totally working in achieving your goals but it's not totally failing it's that middle zone is the danger zone um the things that are obviously failing are easy to stop we stop them no problem the things that are working are easy to keep working you just shouldn't stop them it's the things in that middle Zone that people are very very bad at quitting and if I had to give myself a little pat on the back this is the one thing I'm good at is being pretty ruthless about things in the middle Zone like I had a venture fund that I was doing I I had a rolling fund it paid me very well and I was deploying I don't know close to $10 million a year to invest in startups it was uh it was good but it was in the middle I found better investment opportunities outside of that um but it wasn't so bad that I needed to stop and I could have just let it chug along and eat away at my focus and instead just made a ruthless cut and said I'm stopping this and when are you stopping it I'm stopping it yesterday it's done I'm just going to stop it now that was a good time to use a line that I think we should make our line which is not to toot my own horn but beep beep you got to say it like that dude that was so good have you said that before where is that from something that's an MFM special dude once in a while you just get me like you make me laugh in a way that very few people can make me laugh dude it is so funny that oh my God wow give yourself a little toot do my own home beep me oh that was good I don't want to do the podcast anymore I want to end it and laugh that's an MFM special um Isaac I think you're awesome man Sean I think you're awesome for being a quitter beep beep Dr Becky even though I was sounded like I was being rude I think you're also awesome beep beep um is that it is that the pod that's it that's the [Music] p

we each put 10 grand in so we had 30 grand to start the business and then our first customer was HP HP was giving everyone business back then the gig was a few hundred grand to do some website design for them from that point on we were profitable because we only had a few people we didn't take big salaries we were able to pull out all the money every year and because we had ongoing client work that would sort of span the gap of the calendar year so we just always had money coming in and our costs were so low that we weren't ever starving so it just was a situation where we always had high margins and that's how I've always run the business we pull out everything at the end of year first of all we're an LLC so we're taxed on everything at a personal level if I leave money in the business I'm still paying personal income tax on that money it doesn't really make sense to do that we have a recurring Revenue model we have very predictable Revenue so we have a little bit of overlap we take some money out in quarterly distributions and there's some money left over in January and we kind of wait till April to take it all out so there's some overlap and operating cash right

all right this was not supposed to be a podcast this was me calling Sam two minutes ago and being like dude did you hear the stuff about Reddit and he's like no no no just he put the finger up to my lips push record and in fact me and Sam we should really never talk if we're not recording I think that's the new the new Lesson by the way I still have no idea what you're going to bring [Music] up okay so let me give you the background Reddit goes public today uh interesting fine I don't really care I didn't participate in the stock or anything I wasn't really looking at the chart but I did read Paul Graham's essay about Reddit and he it's titled the reddits it's on the YC blog Paul Graham uh has known these guys for nearly 20 years now and so he wrote this post today that had so many little breadcrumbs that I thought there were like as I was reading this every paragraph Was firing off like a connection to a different lesson learned like my my brain of Frameworks was literally like lit up like a Christmas tree with some of the things he was saying and I just wanted to like say them out loud to you I wanted to I'm I'm imagining you I'm imagining you eating cereal as you reading this and then you have like one bite in and like you you just this is my bow my salad I'm eating look it's half eaten because I was like oh [ __ ] I got to put this down I got to record this and so um we didn't plan this but let's do it all right so I'm reading this essay and I want to give you kind of like Point by point of what I think is really interesting and by the way Paul Graham is the I guess we have to give context now because this is like a podcast Paul Graham is the founder of Y combinator and Reddit was one of the first companies Reddit was the first company in the first batch but actually what's more interesting is in that post Reddit is not only the first YC company in the first batch ever it's actually the reason that YC exists I don't know if you do this but um this is kind of cool so Paul Graham in this essay he says YY started because he went to the Harvard like Computer Club or something like that and gave a talk which by the way is how many interesting things have started I also believe this is kind of how Apple started wasn't there like a u he they gave a talk or a demo at the home brew club this is how Tim Ferris started the four-hour work week he taught a class at Princeton and there's this principle which is if you ever want to learn something try to teach it and that that has led to many people writing books so Tim Ferris did it then he wrote a book near Al same thing when he wrote his book hooked same thing he's like I first was just giving a talk somewhere to give the talk I had to sharpen up my thoughts by the end of that I was like [ __ ] there's something to this and the same thing happened here Paul Graham gave a talk at the school called how to start a startup he gives us talk and then from the talk he's like dude I should create like a a vehicle to invest in like these earlier uh younger Founders he's like at the time Founders were thought to be like either older or just super young prodigies but he's like I think this college student age I think that's where you could start um companies from so that's why he creates YC so he gives the talk he meets with Steve and Alexis afterwards and he's impressed by another thing so the second interesting thing he gave this talk at Harvard they didn't go to Harvard these guys go to school in Virginia they took a train up from Virginia to hear this talk because they used to follow his blog so uh Steve loved his blog he convinces Alexis hey come with me to go see this guy talk they go up there it's not like a show there's no tickets it's like you know 30 person room and he's there and so Paul was so impressed that these guys came from Virginia he's like they wanted to meet for coffee he's like okay no problem uh you guys came from such a far away I'll I'll do it there's a principle there in the like 80% of success is just showing up or like when in doubt like just go just take the train take the flight just show up put yourself in positions for good things to happen and that's what they did and it's a high agency move they could have easily ay not gone um you know showed up and not told him but they they went there they took the train they told him and this is the first of many high agency moves that they pull he talks about later how they actually ended up rejecting these guys from YC so he he gives the talk decides to create YC reaches out to the guy's like hey guys I was inspired by meeting you guys I actually created something called YC for people just like you you should fill out the application they fill out the application but he hates the idea so he rejects them their idea was ordering fast food off your phone door Dash yeah but there was no no smartphones so there is no door Dash they basically had to go to cell phone carriers and fast food chains and like do it all manually so that you could do it like over text message um SMS back then and and you have to set the context even hear about them showing up which is Paul Graham's a big deal now you know Paul Graham funded uh Airbnb Dropbox whatever all he's a big deal back then he had just sold a company for I think $30 or $40 million which was a big deal back then and I guess he had some extra money and he was blogging but it wasn't like a big deal it was like a it was this was like a very like BL for hackers for programmers who are entrepreneurial right which is almost like uh as ridiculous as when twitch was coming up you're like people watch video games online it's like this guy's just blogging about this type of Internet stuff that's not even that cool or interesting it's a very small Market by the way twitch also in that first batch and uh EMT best friends with Steve the you know the guy who created Reddit all right so anyways uh more principles so the first one is if you want to if you want to actually learn try to teach giving a talk is actually a really good Gateway into either books or companies or whatever if you can't articulate in a 45-minute talk a bunch of really insightful things that get other people excited it probably won't work as a as a as a book or company and in Reverse even if you're not planning to do it it's a great way to generate you know sharp ideas is to go try to teach a class second thing taking the train showing up all right great now here's the next one trusting your gut so like I said he he's inspired by these guys he creates YC because he meets these guys but their idea he hates he hates the order food off your phone he's like that's too hard and he says at the time I didn't realize that the game I'm supposed to be doing is sort of betting on people not ideas I thought at that time I'm supposed to be betting on ideas and I hated their idea so they rejected him and he's like you know Jessica his wife who he he credits as having like the best kind of like people detector um of anybody he knows she was like oh you rejected the muffins and he's like muffins and she's like yeah that's what I call those guys you know Steve and Alexis they're like so endearing they're like a little poodle like you know they're like a little puppy she called the muffins she's like oh that's sad I like the muffins and he's like yeah but I didn't like their idea she's like I feel like we should have the muffins in YC like they're they're the reason you created this why why would you not accept them so he calls them back up they're on the train ride home to Virginia and he says uh guys I want you to be in YC but like we got to only I'll fund you only if you're going to change your idea and how much was funding was it $115,000 yeah like nothing yeah5 so basically like a a summer yeah exactly but it was it was the somebody believing you in you was the real currency there they're on the train right home from Virginia they just get off at the next stop and then hop on the next train going back up north again and they like immediately seize the opportunity which is another kind of like again these were all like little breadcrumbs of successful things successful like successful actions successful behaviors that it doesn't surprise me that a Reddit comes out of something like this on his side it was trusting his gut Paul side trusting his gut that he wanted these guys involved he should bet on people not ideas early on and for them it was being willing to hop off the train and just take the next train up north again so he gets there now here's the next interesting idea the some of the best ideas are found not thought of discovered not thought of so Paul Graham had been blogging and his blog was not too big of a deal back then it was it was you know okay not not what it is today but he noticed that a lot of his traffic to his blog was coming from a website called delici do you remember delicious yeah was it really a website or was it like a bookmark was it aook bookmarking tool it was a way to save the stuff you liked like bookmark for later for yourself but they had one little side feature called delicious.com poopular and/ poopular was basically just an aggregator of all like what is what are the most popular bookmarked things that day it was a side feature sort of a throwaway idea for them but what Paul Graham noticed was he's like damn I get actually a lot of traffic from the SL poopular tab of delicious not the main product it's the side product and so he took that he's like guys you need a new idea here's an idea um the delicious/ poopular thing is cool what if there was just a page that was like the front page of the Internet it's like what are all the most interesting Links of the day that you should go check out just take the side thing and let's make it the main thing that's a pretty uh Wild Thing to think about because back then so they started in 2005 which meant Google was only 8 years old and AdWords was probably new I don't remember when Facebook was started but right around then like Internet advertising I guess was still pretty new dude they weren't even thinking about advertising they were just thinking what's a cool thing that should exist on the internet what's a cool useful product all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we used we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM that same idea I heard again many years later when I met Ryan Hoover Ryan Hoover was uh the founder of product T but most people don't know is before that he was he was blogging and then um I reached out to him and I was like hey I really want to hire you I tried to hire him he wanted to join my team was like he didn't pass the interview process for some whatever reason so they were like ah we don't think he's got enough experience or something and I really liked Ryan I was like hey man so sorry like let's keep it touch I feel like our paths are going to cross again three weeks later he emails me about an idea he's like hey maybe instead of a job I should start something and what he tells me is he goes I go he goes like you I like to go to Hacker News every morning back then that was my routine I we we both used to go to Hacker News every morning still is but my favorite tab is not the main page of Hacker News it's the side page the show section where you can go it's like a show and tell where you can show what you're building cuz if you go to Hacker News you click show it's only like links to cool products that people are just like hey I want to show you guys I made this hey I want to show you guys I made this he's like what if there was something that was just the show tab let's make the side thing the main thing and so that's what product hunt became and product hunt then became this sensation in Silicon Valley he ends up selling the company for $20 million and you know it was this this success for Ryan and so this is like Reddit kind of had that same idea that same thing where it took the side page of delicious and so there's something to this which is one great place to discover ideas is look at your invoices or look at your p&l look at the cost section I think that's one great place to find Investments or ideas another one is look at your traffic referrals and if you ever notice referrals coming from someplace that's interesting another one is what's a side feature your favorite side feature of a different app that actually could be a standalone app in itself and so there's something to that philosophy one bit one quick story Scott bski I talked to Scott bsky Scott bsky um is a famous uh entrepreneur and investor he told me that when he was in his early 20s he had a website and he noticed that he was getting a lot of traffic from this brand new website called Pinterest and so he reached out to the founder of Pinterest and was like hey what what's this thing tell me all about it and he wasn't getting a lot of traffic like a 100 people a day or something like pretty small and the guy was like yeah it's just this thing I'm working on I'm going to raise a little bit of money at a $3 million valuation do you want to invest Scott goes like well I only have like 50 Grand in my name but I guess I'll give you $155,000 and he did that went on to make probably $100 million that same week he started getting traffic from a website uh called uh stumble upon and he and he goes and does the same thing he he talks to the guy stumble upon they're not raising but he becomes friends with Garrett Camp who goes on a couple years later to found Uber and he invests in Uber as well $15,000 also made something like $100 million because both times he was getting traffic from these brand new websites that he thought were were interesting exactly that's what I'm saying these are breadcrumbs that it's not specific to the Reddit story this is everywhere and those are perfect perfect examples of uh of the same the same principle um it's kind of like the art of noticing like if you can notice you know where you're getting traffic or notice that hm this keeps growing every month you might find something earlier than everybody else so that's another one all right here's another principle that I found interesting the name Reddit was not meant to be the name of the site they wanted to call it sn.com SN o and today the the Reddit mascot's name is SN um and Reddit was kind of like their placeholder name for it it was it was the working title and it was like we're going to change when we actually launch this thing we're going to change it but like for now it's this sn.com was too expensive so they couldn't afford it and um this is so common like we're so often wrong about names uh some people get really precious about names early on but Paul Graham advised these guys to just like just pick a name that kind of like feels right works right for you right now you can change it later if you need but also he urged them to ship it fast he's like I think we could build a fast version of this and Reddit actually launched in three weeks after they went through the after they got it admitted to YC which is incredibly fast and then from there they just started iterating that's awesome that's amazing um next thing do you know how they got their early traction have you heard this story it's it's a good one yeah basically Steve Huffman and Alexis I believe what they did is they just created a bunch of fake usernames and they just would submit constantly like different links to look like many people were participating because the way that a site like Reddit or any Community works is you typically have like 99% of people going to view stuff and only 1% of people actually submitting stuff so they had to submit content in order to create uh Supply exactly exactly nobody wants to be nobody wants to come into a dead room and just start dancing right like if you go to a nightclub there's nobody on the dance FL you're not going to go either so they had to fake it till they make it right I think that's kind of the principle here was fake it till you make it gone right and this was they were the they were the users I think they talked about like they created I think 30 different accounts and they would just not only submit the links for Reddit but they would then comment and they would comment as different personalities and I think Steve talked once like he's like the first day I logged on and the comments under a link were not from me was like this Hallelujah moment it's like holy [ __ ] we did it we got enough of that critical mass that chicken and egg problem we solved it we got them the ball rolling and importantly they had also set the culture you did this I thought really really well when you launched Trends I got to see you launch Trends from a idea to a three four five million a year re recurring Revenue product and all it was was a Facebook group and in that Facebook group there was a research report too but the the Facebook group I think was actually the main product it was and you were so damn active and I was like oh this is how you build a community every day you would go in there and you'd be like hey what's up up guys I was just thinking about this interesting thing I'm like no the [ __ ] you weren't you were like you were like I have to stoke this fire otherwise this fire is going to go out right now and I used to write posts on other people's behalf I don't know if you've ever if you did this at the time you asked me you like hey can you post this in the group I'm like did I ask you that and then you copy pasted this huge thing and I was like okay I guess it's well written so like sure so you got us to you were basically our fake accounts yeah and I got I I I couldn't remember if this was Prem MFM days so if this was prean being famous uh and I would like get other popular people and write on their behalf and be like hey just post this and uh yeah it worked out really well be like hey can you go com like You' message 40 of us he'd be like please go comment on this thing this baller just joined and I want this to feel really active for him like I want him I want him to feel overwhelmed and I'm like okay what do you want me to say you're like say this and I went I would go comment that and then that guy would be like wow what a community this is fantastic and like that first impression was so good because of that that's what the Reddit guys did and I found by the way you have to do that I have I've had to do that uh in that case to about 2,000 people with Hampton I only had to do it to about 300 people and so the numbers that you actually have to do that for like the new members or whatever the community is website visitors it's actually not that high dude those numbers sound so high you did it for 2,000 members that's crazy I don't remember exactly but that doesn't see but now Trends I think had 20,000 members uh the way I remember it was sort of like the first 150 days yeah you were you were tending to that fire you would not let it just go out uh yeah so it was only about six months that I had to do that um what's the other point all right next one um okay Talent filters so one thing Paul Graham says he goes that the reason Steve showed up at that talk was because he followed my blog which was about lisp lisp is this like obscure programming language that I think Paul Graham created if not created popularized but I think he created it and he's like the thing about lisp is um he goes it's one of those languages that few people will learn except out of your own intellectual curiosity meaning it's like it's not you don't learn it to get rich or to get famous or any of those things if you go through the right of passage of learning this thing and being interested in it you are just wired a certain way and you are somebody who pursues your intellectual like your intellectual interest and Pursuits it's like I guess pretty elegant if you do code and Lis it's like really elegant in certain ways but again it's like cursive or calligraphy it's like you don't need to learn calligraphy but if you do you probably have like ey for design right the Steve Jobs thing um so same sort of thing so he so that kind be kind of interested that there are probably like a dozen things that I can think of that are like this amazing talent filters we talked last week about um that startup cognition that came out and raised a bunch of money and uh they have this like AI software programmer that's like you know better than chat GPT that write in code and that guy was like in the math Olympiad right he was like his sport when we were playing you know basketball and soccer and stuff like that he was like you know sitting there at a on a stage buzzing in and answering like really hard math questions or the spelling be it's like things that you do if you can become obsessed and degenerate degenerately obsessed about certain things you're wired a certain way and you are almost like predisposed to success then you know it's like all I got to do is introduce you to the idea of the stock market trust me all your like [ __ ] World of Warcraft grinding is going to apply really really well over here you just have to get exposed at the right time here's a list poker yes yeah board games yes uh Sports specifically individual sports so if you're world class like an IND like a swimming track of field cycling wrestling those types of things all right the video games one is obvious let me give you a wild card magic I'm not talking about like cards but like Tada like that type of is that every 12-year-old boy I don't know any 12-year-old boys who did not think magic was the [ __ ] and bought a magic set for sure if you could trick me on levitating or make a coin come out of my ear like that took a lot of hard work I'm into it eBay flipping was another one back in the day like you know sneaker flipping and eBay flipping was definitely another one being a Mormon and going on a mission another one right being from the countries the Ukraine like any War torn country that you have escaped from great filter right there's like there's there's a bunch of these um all right next one one of one of the the best principles my uh my my trainer and Coach taught me was that the best products are simply you pushed out that's how I feel about this podcast this podcast is just me pushed out to the world and for Whoever likes me they're going to like this podcast and it's going to feel very second nature to me to create this podcast because it's just me and so uh Paul Graham says almost the same principle without he doesn't have that catchphrase but he has says the same thing about about Reddit he goes Reddit is Reddit was successful because Steve has two things number one he likes ideas for the sake of ideas like he likes ideas just for the sake of interestingness which is really what Reddit is like you go to Reddit not because it's the top news story but because it's like mildly interesting or it's fascinating in some obscure way and that's what makes Reddit really really special and that's the type of stuff that Steve really really likes and so naturally it went in that direction which is like not obvious actually like I think the obvious if you were like writing a business plan you would have made Reddit a lot more like I don't know the homepage of CNN today right the important stories rather than the quirky interesting stories that are only just they scratch your intellectual itch and nothing really else dude that's kind of a weird way to say the product is just pushed out of you like just ejaculated straight out yeah yeah yeah you just got to squeeze really hard grunt a little bit and pop it's just GNA be pushed right out got to make your innie and udy all right that's that's all you're really doing when it comes to entrepreneurship I like you all right the ne the next one that he says there he goes the other thing about Steve he has that but then the second thing is he has a very anti-authority streak um so he liked the idea of creating a website that didn't have editors because at the time in the internet all edit all websites that were like editorial news link submissions they had this like small class of like The Gatekeepers who decided what's in and what's out and Reddit does not work that way they you know over time they have like a self like a de Democratic mod thing but there there is no person at the company who decides what gets posted what gets featured what gets shown and um he's like those two factors are just like inherent in Steve himself and so it of course the product is an extension of of the founder that I mean yeah that's pretty amazing I think uh what's his name Jason freed uh has had a big part of that in his podcast where he talks about being crazier early on because if you start a little bit crazy a little wacky a little weird later on things inevitably become more tight wound more conservative and so it's best to do it early on to establish that and I thought that I've always felt that but I didn't I wasn't articulate enough to phrase it in such a wonderful way and that actually is a beautiful uh way of thinking and read it exactly that way the the mascot is this like goofy alien creature right and it's like first of all you don't have to have a mascot you could have a logo without a mascot but he has like this alien mascot but it's like the the weird [ __ ] got baked in early once this thing got big the idea of like Hey we're going to introduce this new alien mascot it'd be like well I don't know do the numbers support that do the focus groups support that is this going to risk the traffic blah blah blah it's important that the weirdness gets baked in early I shared an office at third and Bryant in downtown San Francisco with Reddit when they were 13 employees uh like shared an office building they were on floor three I was on floor four and I used to get into the elevator and if I would like I was such a fan of Reddit I was like if I meet someone from Reddit in this elevator I'm going to ask for like a picture with them this is a big deal and you would see these guys wearing their Reddit backpacks and sweatshirt and I'm just thinking like these are my heroes and then it's just like this nerdy Asian guy with like a a crappy mustache who's like 53 getting at the elevator the book bag was like weighing him back and like he's going to fall over and I'm like sir it is an honor like like I just remember thinking like uh I love your work yeah like can you sign here just lifting up my shirt and ask up could like side on my chest like I was like the the tide has turned uh I'm not exactly like a like a jock Alpha looking guy but compared to this guy I was and yeah I'm like begging him like please have mercy Well here here's another good one um Alexis ananan tweeted this out today it was a screenshot of an email he got from Chris Saka and you know this is early on because his name is Christopher Saka not Chris he's he was still Christopher back then and his his email was like he's still at Google he was working at Google so he emails them out of the blue and and Alexis tweeted out he goes shout out to Saka for being the first person before my mom before our investors before anybody else who saw how big and successful Reddit could become and here's what the email says it just starts off there's no hi no hello it just goes someday folks will be pleading with their hosting companies because they're being reddited or something like that you guys are driving a surprising amount of traffic to my site I wonder what site it was he's working at Google at the time I think he literally was just calling Google his site which is legendary I don't know if there's another way facing that and the whole email so far is lower caps there's not one cap lowercase ey is how you starts paragraph three by the way um anyways he goes anyways it was a pleasure meeting you guy not only were you both impressive technologists you both seem like well-rounded guys with senses of humor and I love this he goes humor should never be underestimated all right there's some wisdom in that bro we've been saying that for a long time that's awesome how how old is Chris in this email you think I mean he's not like a he's not a big wig yet five is my guess so he's 48 now and this was 24 years ago so he's 24 years old what Chris sacka was 24 when he wrote this email right oh no no sorry 20 years ago so maybe he's 28 sorry 28 that's still like this is like a pretty baller email at a young age all right go ahead so he's 28 years old and he says um I would be thrilled to have you come visit us at the goog o all right you lost me there GL that one didn't stick yeah luckily you've you've racked up a bunch of cool points in our Bo yeah definitely took a hit um and then he's like you know come come then he goes this is the best part dude I didn't even see this the first time here's how the email ends he goes we can grab lunch sometime and intro you to some googlers cool question mark the next line cool period dude God I hope my emails never leak cuz I do [ __ ] like this all the time that is so just so bad and so great at the time that's all right again he's got so many cool points that he could be deducted a few douche points and he's still way up on top like this is better than just being like you're welcome in advance Yeah Yeah Chris sacka the type of guy to like introduce himself and say please to meet me um this is awesome I thought this was cool and then one more thing you have on here Sam Alman owns 8% which is like a billion dollars today before we even get to that Reddit sold the company so Reddit has had a ton of drama I forget the guy's name his name was Aaron something um so basically yeah Aaron Schwarz so basically if I remember correctly during YC that three-month period there was another guy named Aaron who was pretty brilliant and he got in trouble or rather before that his company wasn't working so they merged with Reddit so he kind of became a co-founder of Reddit a few years into the business I think he got in trouble for doing something that is like a uh a lot of people protest against but basically he stole information from MIT I think it was was and they were going to lock him up for like 20 years he did I think he basically gave access to I think scientific journals and what J door I think it was J door uh I mean yes he's stealing not the right word according to the government it was stealing according to him and I'm on his side it was like this information deserves to be free whatever and he was going to get locked up for like years and he ended up killing himself and this uh along with a bunch of other drama uh they had a bunch of like drama early on and in fact they sold the company to K Nas I forget for how much but I think so here here's the thread so Alexis tweeted this out the other day which was which was cool because or not the other day four years ago time flies um he talks about selling it in 2006 so they started 2005 basically sold it um in in 2006 so here's what he says so he goes Halloween is a surreal holiday because on Halloween we sold Reddit to K Nest which was like not a tech company at the time a big magazine publisher he goes basically with 16 months of work I would be getting more money than my parents had made their entire working lives and there were lots of things about management team building whatever that I just didn't know and I would need to know um he said his mom was ill and he's like basically it was a $10 million exit and he goes um I didn't know there were other options like raising money or doing other things so we just kind of sold I think he said previously they they each walked Steve and Alexis walked away with $2 million and then they they ended up buying it back or getting Condon to spin it out and then end up buying it back essentially yes and when they did that they eventually raised money of which Sam mman is credited with now owning 8% of the company and Sam Alman so Reddit has gone through all types of drama where like a CEO was fired and then a week later another CEO was fired Sam mman was intermittent CEO for one day and he was fting interim interim CEO yeah he was the fasted CEO sorry interim um and he uh uh was the CEO because he was in one of their investors and his fund owns 8% I don't think Sam Alman owns 8% I think he owns a percentage of the 8% which now today is worth something like a billion plus right right that's right as if that guy you know I'm glad Altman has finally gotten a win under his belt you know like he's been at it that poor kid God bless him yeah exactly other remarkable things said Not only did they sell too early but they're they got they got a second ride back on the train um this is also 19 years in the making like it took a long time and by the way the company still not profitable like there's so many just crazy kind of mind-bending things that if you're not from the Silicon Valley world like none of this computes like Reddit is the whatever like the fourth biggest uh you know social network in in the world or something like that well I think it's uh like the 10th most VI visited website in the uh in the country which is funny because if you go to like quote a normal person and be like hey do you use Reddit and they're like either what's Reddit or no I don't know how you know people that use Reddit use all of Reddit use a lot of Reddit there's a lot of Reddit going going on for people who are users reddit's my life it's basically Hacker News and Reddit is and Twitter those three things are just how I get information they um I think they have like 75 million da or something like that anyways they uh it's crazy that after 19 years are still not profitable but uh everybody who built it made a lot of

the Myers Briggs test to take the test is somewhere between 15 and 40 bucks so everybody who takes the test you get on average 30 bucks from but then you can't just take the test it has to be given to by a practitioner well the practitioners have to pay $2,000 to become a certified practitioner that's the only way you can take this test last year they enrolled 5,000 practitioners who each paid $1,500 to $2,000 each 8 to 10 million bucks in Revenue off of just the practitioners and then each of the practitioners then distributes the test and they get paid by Distributing the test the practitioner makes 30 bucks a test and then the extra royalty the extra 10 bucks on top goes back to the publisher this thing they don't know the revenue cuz it's still private since the 80s and they once said their number was over 20 million in Revenue I suspect it's higher than that there's been millions of people who've taken this test and Myers Briggs that's their cash count that is insane dude it's used by the government 200 federal agencies use this the EPA itself they use it on quarter of their 20,000 employees 89 of the Fortune 100 used this test

I got four words for you self-funded cash cow that is what today's guest Jason freed has built his company 37 signals is awesome you've probably heard of it I heard of it because I read his book this is rework I read this thing like a decade ago I still have so many of these Pages folded because they're just it's full of gold uh but the best part is he's not just an author right he actually is an entrepreneur he runs his own company he's done it for like 25 years now and these guys they say next to nothing about their numbers the only thing they've ever said is we make tens of millions a year in profit um but I do think this is actually kind of a juggernaut this is a juggernaut of a business Jason Lin a great investor once said that the two greatest self-funded cash flow companies he's ever seen are Craigslist and 37 signals and the best part is they do it by kind of like kicking the traditional Playbook to the to the curb they set no goals they work four days a week in the Summers they spend next to nothing on marketing and so I wanted to ask Jason three questions the first is how did you build this low stress cash flow company right you are the cash flow King how did you do it that's the first part then we asked him what was it like being face Toof face with Jeff basos negotiating a deal he got to know Jeff Bezos 20 years ago I wanted to know what is it like to be in the room with him and lastly he's got this skill where he's able to generate massive interest in his products pre-launch and I wanted to steal that superpower how do you do this before you've even launched a product he uses these founder letters to blow up his products and so we talked about it we got him to sort of explain bit by bit how he does those how he writes those those things all right no more teasing enjoy this episode with Jason [Music] free we were doing research uh before this podcast and I've looked into a bunch I'm inspired by you is it weird that we know that you spent something like 30 million dollars on homes in the past like two years you know you you started like a tech company not looking to get into this and now like your home purchases are on the blogs it's embarrassing and frankly I I tried to hide them you try to do all the things like double LLC and the whole thing I I like architecture I like houses I like land it's just that's like really the thing I really found myself liking a lot and unfortunately it's very hard to just how do they find it how do they know because they're like Jason freed bought this house and me and Sam we're supposed to be prepping for this pot and we spend like 20 minutes clicking through these photos being like this house is sick how do they actually it um I don't know my guess is so like technically it's it's it's hidden in a sense but I think that all they got to do is probably ask like you know a real estate agent and you know you you kind of have ndas but you know someone knows some or like the electrician or the cable company someone hangs out and finds out or they look in the mailbox and see that you know there's a million ways unfortunately well what's cool about you and what I honestly admire we started off talking about how big the business is but the reality is what I admire is some guys are into to beautiful eyes some guys are into butts me and Sam on this podcast we're we are into people who play their Define their own game and then play it and that's the one thing I think you do really really well and you've gone viral many times by putting out there some of your philosophies on how you approach business what I want to do is I want to kind of read you a quote I want you to react to it I want you to explain and unpack a little bit for each one of these and we can go fast so the first one is your anti- long-term planning you don't you don't do long-term plans and here's the quote I lik you go long-term planning is a fantasy I don't plan long-term because I want to do what I think not what I thought that's right explain that one yeah long-term planning is is is what you thought and like doing figuring out as you go is what you think and I don't like the idea of having a thought 6 months ago or eight months ago or 12 months ago and feeling like I have to follow that whim because I happen to have it and happen to write it wrote it down I don't I don't get that um I know a lot of people think there's a lot of certainty or comfort in like setting out a plan and like you know but really it's that plan is then just based on a moment in time and and then people are like well you can adjust well if you're going to adjust Just Adjust just just don't even do the first plan um so my feeling is uh just make it up as you go frankly we we think about things six months or sorry six weeks at a time and uh and go from there and adjust all the time and that's fine we've always done it that way and I feel most comfortable frankly just paying attention to reality in the moment and making calls along along the way you also wrote that uh you've never had a goal so you said um you had this whole blog post that you don't like goals I I think you might have be you maybe were quoting another person but you said um the reason that most of us aren't happy most of the time is that we set goals not for the person we're going to be when we reach them but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them and I don't think you explicitly said that the company doesn't set goals but you sort of implied it is that the case yeah by the way that quote is from a fellow named Jim kudal who is a good friend of ours and runs field notes which a lot of people know you know goal our only goal is to be profitable on a given year we've been profitable every year for 25 years that's the only thing we look at is we want to make sure that we make more money than we spend otherwise we don't really set goals or have expectations other than just to do our best work I'm not a fan of thinking that you're going to do better work if you set a goal I think you should do your best work all the time as best you can and again let the chips fall where they may you know the way I think about this that I think helps people understand this more is if you want to go out for a run and run a six minut Mile and you got to run a 6 minute mile and you end up running a 604 you're you like didn't hit the goal and you're maybe upset like I almost got it whatever now some people might say you're going to work harder next time but what if the goal was 605 instead like it's 5 Seconds difference and you would have beat it and you would have felt differently it's like five seconds does that matter like to me the right question is like was it worth it did I enjoy the Run did I have a good time do I feel good now do I want to do that again am I injured no great did I get some fresh air yes like if you ask different questions then you're not so obsessed with like this this point this this goal line that you set up that is really arbitrary and made up to begin with so I've never believed in goals I just kind of do the best I can and and see where it goes so I like I I I want to agree with you uh because I I prefer I think I would be happier if that were the case but there is like some logistical push back of like well you guys launched hey.com a few years ago and you um you have to plan uh like how much to Al at towards that project otherwise potentially you could be unprofitable so how do you justify like looking at like well this needs to this needs to hit this metric or let's ask the question slightly differently I come to work you're the CEO you're like no plans no goals I'm like all right so then and what are we doing here how do we do it what is the answer well this is going to sound strange but we don't think that way we look at the big pile and go like at the end of the year do we have more money than we spent and is it because of this product or that product or this endeavor or that endeavor or this cost savings or that expense like I don't really care frankly like to me it's just one big pile it's a range it's a feeling like we feel we actually it's more of an aesthetic for us David and I talk about the aesthetic of running a high margin business it feels right to do it that way I don't want to run a business where I'm nervous all the time and you're nervous when you're looking at one or two points here and there and like we're barely breaking even like I don't want to be in that kind of company right so we keep our costs low we have a huge customer base over 100,000 people pay us on a monthly basis for a variety of different products and um given the fact that our costs are low and our revenue is high and we have a very diverse customer base things are things can be sloppy in a good way I feel like it's a comforting way it's not like a reckless way we are careful about costs we think about costs a lot actually but we don't worry too much about points you know that's just not how we how we look at things and so this approach where you're like we I let me let me give you what I see from the outside you tell me which parts of this are are me fantasizing versus reality so the way I view you guys is you kind of think about what needs to exist in the world so for example you're like there needs to be email that doesn't stress you out or software that you pay for once and not every single month for the rest of your life that and every additional employee you have it costs more and more and more right like it's sort of like first there's a point of view on what needs to change in the world or the way you want things to be or what what you wish existed then you're like probably some second check which is like can we build it are we the right team to build this do we have a an approach that we think might work and then you budget this like six week Sprint where you're like let's try to make a version of that that we like and then we'll iterate from there and we're willing to tolerate like six weeks of attempt at this to get to the next Milestone of belief like we'll give it you know a leap of faith to six weeks and then after that we re-evaluate and and decide what what to do from there is that correct what parts of that are incorrect partially U so we will spend a lot more time than six weeks on exploring an initial idea so for example when we're going to make a brand new product we might spend six months wandering around an idea and seeing where it ends up and then at some point where again I don't know it's just a feeling like we spent enough time on this we're feeling good about this this is feeling better and better and better as we go let's do this then you commit to doing it then you do it six weeks at a time or you get into something and you wander for a while and you go H I'm just bored or like I don't know where else to go or this isn't really this doesn't seem interesting and you stop uh and you just give up frankly you just give up which is something I think more people ought to do all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM Sam do you do this wandering thing too like I've seen your process I feel like it's kind of similar yeah I it's you know I don't want to sound uh like I'm sniffing my own farts but it's a little bit of an art where like it's I I feel like an artist a little bit where I I'm exploring a concept and then I it takes six months for some inspiration like I I I feel inspiration and then I have to wander to like like kind of hone in on the painting and the concept A little bit and it's sort of like one of those things where you take a lot of showers and like you get different ideas or you go for a walk and you get a different idea for like six months until it's like all right I think I've honed in this concept let's move forward is that what you do yeah yeah that's that's really a big part of it it does feel like an art and not to again not to get stuffy about it like I'm not an artist I not but like we just we we we explore and we leave room to explore and the margins allow us to explore and being profitable allows us to explore not having uh investors allows us to explore not having a board allows us to like all these things allow us this Independence allows us to do the things we want to do the way we want to do them but at some point you know you you also don't want to be um you know Reckless with with money and time and people at some point go this is just isn't going anywhere let's stop or so so we really do take our internal sort of motivation temperature a lot of it is wrapped on motivation like are we like pumped about this ises this feel good if so let's keep doing this and then and then you finally kind of come into something so for example with hay briefly hey didn't start out as an email service it started out actually as a rethink of highrise which is our CRM product which stopped developing years ago we still offered to existing customers but we don't sell it anymore but we had this thought like what if we explore that again so we began to explore that and through that exploration we realized what we were doing was building this sort of email system that we wanted for all of our emails not just like business communication emails but like all of them and so we go ah you know that's interesting this is actually like an email thing I remember bringing this idea to David I had been exploring it with one of my designers for a while and he's like yeah that that is interesting like let's see where this goes and so we started kind of hooking it up so we we did the UI first this is what we always do and showed them a bunch of UI and we started making it work like there's there's something here and you feel this pull of something here there's a certain gravity to these ideas and it pulls you towards it and you keep going for a while and then at some point though you got to get serious and that's when you begin to you know break this into six week chunks essentially of work or monthly chunks depending on it but you got to have some end to these things so you can get on to the next feature and the next feature and the next feature otherwise you'll spend too much time trying to perfect just one thing yet a product has to do a lot more than just that so you kind of have to you got to time box these things in a sense well uh you said two things that I liked one you said one of your superpowers is focus uh sorry I was saying this about you um and what what you said was no is just saying no to one thing yes is saying no to a lot of things and I really love that no is just saying no to one thing but yes is saying no to like kind of the the whole future set of things because you've now taken up your mind chare and your talent your hands with with the thing you said yes to yeah no no is a very precise you know Precision instrument um because you get to evaluate a thing and say no to it and you have the whole spectrum of everything else that's possible available to you at that point so uh I I think no is a great tool it's very specific uh yes is a blunt force instrument that kind of dam damages a lot of things essentially now it might be worth it because that thing you choose to do might be the thing that you needed to do but it does force you to say no to a bunch of other opportunities and the longer you spend on that yes the more NOS you are throwing off and you don't even realize it so I do think it's very important to figure out what you're doing and then you know why you're doing it and then commit to doing it and then get it done in a reasonable period of time partially because you don't know if it's going to be any good or not I mean you might have a feeling but the Market's going to tell you for sure so you want to get out of the market as soon as you can ultimately and then you'll find out and then you can iterate from there so that's kind of our general approach to things and we don't make new products that often like we used to make them a lot like when we first launched we had Bas camp in 2004 backpack 2005 campfire 2006 high-rise 2000 we were making a new product every year and then we did a bunch of other things job boards and a whole bunch of other things now we you know we'll make a new product once every handful of years but yeah in general we don't say yes that often and when we do we we try to get it right so you mened the job board there's an interesting story here so Andrew Wilkinson bought the job board you guys created we work remotely because you guys were really far ahead of trend on remote work and so you had we work remotely as a remote work job board you sold it to Andrew Wilkinson friend of the Pod he's probably the most frequented guest on our podcast and that I want to ask you about this because for him it's like he loves the story because it's a great buy he bought it for really cheap and then now I don't know what that thing does but let's I think it's something like 5 million a year profit comes off the job board I think it's four it's in his annual report you can kind of dial it down Okay so let's say four let's say four million of year profit and I wanted to ask you like for you guys is that a ah we wish we had kept it bad sale because it's now a lot more profitable or is it no that was the right thing to do because it cleared us up to do other things how do you think about that that transaction well it's easy to look back on it and make a different decision now the reason we sold that at the time was because we were selling off a bunch of stuff or consolidating to kind of go all in on on one thing on base camp essentially it's kind of around that time we've since decided to make more things than just base camp so we're kind of in a multi-product world again uh I think they got a very good deal let's just say um and the thing that I will say bugs me about our decision about that is that that was the easiest money not the sale but the the product was the easiest money we built the job board in two weeks and it was generating at the time for us like 30 grand a month something like that with no work like literally clo next to nothing to do it was all you know self-service automated maybe there's a customer service question here and there but like essentially nothing and uh I wish we still had that we could still launch another one like nothing says we couldn't do it again we still work remotely. we still work remotely I think we do something different I have some ideas on that we might do something like that at some point I don't really know but I would say it was a very good buy but now now I'm an investor in his company so I own a little tiny piece of that anyway on the other side you uh Jason what I think is cool is if I remember correctly you guys I think you started almost as an agency and then kind of like became a software company because you saw recurring problems and and you built that and I think it's been something like 25 years and you've I don't think that there's any uh great resource out there that says your guys' Revenue but it we it's definitely tens of Millions who knows if it's even north of 100 million but it's a very big business you do Marketing in the sense of you have these really cool books uh rework is awesome and you're a public figure and you blog a lot but if I'm listening to this from the outside I would think well it works because Jason and David were early and they kept at it for 25 years and that's the reasons why they have such fat margins not just because they're smart but it's because they were early in in the game what would you say to that I think you're right by the way as far as numbers we the only thing we've ever shared is that we generate tens of millions in annual profits because I don't really care about Revenue numbers you can go broke generating as much revenu as you can imagine do you measure profit on a gap basis or do you do like uh uh non-gap where you just look at cash flow no it's Gap okay it's like net profit legit after everything right so we're we we really we're proud of that you know we're really proud of that and we work hard at that um but I do think timing and luck uh have a lot to do with it and market conditions like could we launch this again today no we couldn't um that's fine too like who cares it doesn't really matter right people ask that old time could you do it again no probably not who cares why why would I need to I don't have to don't have to like you you know you this is why this is one of the reasons why we've kept this business going for so long I don't think lightning strikes that often um we've got a couple really really big hits we've done it the way we wanted to do it um we've got a lot of momentum we're well known we've we've built this business our own way I would hate to give this up like selling this would be sad like i' I'd lose something you could say well look at all the money I'd lose more than I'd make now that's not to say that that couldn't happen at some point down the road of course like a business is either going to die or be handed off or sold like it's not going to last forever and ever and that could change next year I don't even know right who knows but this is the whole we don't plan I don't really know what's going to happen but right now it feel like a loss to sell the company so that's why I'm actually frankly nervous about that I'm afraid of what I would I'm afraid of having nothing to do that I'd be good at uh I know I'm good at this I like doing this why would I want to stop you know uh is sort of how I look at it but yeah to your point I don't I don't take credit for being able to do this again and I think a lot of I mean you guys speak with a lot of entrepreneurs sometimes people hit it big twice sometimes um sometimes though those are more like s you know where like they're in they're in a a world where you can keep selling companies that don't work as far as actually finding people who've started multiple businesses that have been profitable businesses and really successful businesses it's not that common it's really hard to do by the way that was my big fear so I sold my company and uh I had a guy sit down and talk to me and he said how many people do you know who have started too successful business and in my head I was like you man like I'm going to do it you know like I was angry I was angry and I was angry because I was afraid in reality and after I sold I dabbled in real estate and I failed and I was like I'm human I'm not like I'm not the man I did get you know there was some skill there was also a whole lot of luck involved in my exit and um I I I also had that fear and then after about six months I was like I got to do something I can't just do nothing I I feel like a bum but it was a lot of starting things was rooted in fear and rooted in I don't want to be lonely so I need to create something where I can hire people and be around them I hear that I also think you know like I'm turning 50 in a few weeks like I don't have the stamina to start another business like and wait 20 years you know like I I just don't I don't have that like you know when I was 25 I could do it 35 I could do it I don't want to do it anymore I want to keep this thing going until I don't all in I think that we really uh like doing this we've got some new ideas the one stuff is really kind of injected us with some new ideas we're about to start another product which will be a SAS product so we're going to do SAS and and non-sas products again um and we'll see what happens again we'll see what happens and it could be this is the thing like it could be a year from now where I changed my mind I I don't know really don't know but I think David and I both like I think if we one of us decided to go uh we would have to sell the business because I don't think that uh what either one of us would stick around one of my favorite stories is the story where um Mark Zuckerberg early on I think he's like 21 years old or something and he gets an offer to sell Facebook for a billion dollars and The Story Goes he goes into the board meeting and he's like yeah like you know we have to we technically have to discuss this got an offer from I think Yahoo to sell for a billion dollars obviously we're not going to take it uh onto the next matter and then uh Peter teal and others were like hey hey Mark uh hey yo you know you're gonna have like whatever $500 million if you did that maybe we should just chat about this for a second and they were like well let's talk through and one of the things he said was like he's like I but I like this business he's like if I had the money what what would I go do I would just want to build a social network uh I think that's the coolest thing I could do right now and I like the one I've got why would I want to go start over and try to build a new one totally and I loved that I don't know how much of that story is true because you know there's a lot of like lore but that's okay uh still cool story have you guys did you guys ever have a moment where somebody comes to and it's it's an offer you have to discuss and like what what went down in that conversation um we've never been we've never allowed that to happen uh no one like I I get I still get a handful of emails every week from VCS or p PE firms like and I just say no like I have a I have a default just no so we don't even have conversations um we did take some money from Jeff Bezos though back in uh 2006 six or seven six I think it was like a secondary thing so he he bought some shares from me and from David so that money went into our pockets and never went into the business no money's ever gone into the business except customer revenues and we did that to take a little bit of risk off the table because in 2006 Bas Camp was 2 years old the product and we're like this could be a fluke I don't know what the hell is going to happen in this industry who knows when we could get wiped out tomorrow you know could we put a few million bucks in the bank each and just like take some of that risk off the table and and also give us some confidence to just go for it at that point because if it all went to hell we have something to show for it personally so we did that um Jeff uh Jeff found us because um a couple of his companies that he was invested in had used Bas camp um he saw me speak at a conference in San Diego in 2005 called ech I don't know if that conference is still around anymore he was speaking I was speaking I think he liked what I had to say the way I was we were very different as we still are now but way back then way different in terms of like our point of view and the things we were saying and he likes those kind of companies what does that mean you more were you more harsh or or more what I was a young punk we'll call it punk rock you were more pun punk rock more punk rock I love that they answer to this question is kind of actually that Jeff was a fan Jeff was a fan so he reached out that's he was I mean Jeff was a fan like let's just you know it's anyway he was a fan he's a fan of of of of you know people think differently about H to run a business as he thinks differently about how to run a business so so we just kind of chatted you know we we went to Seattle met him I didn't really I knew this was like an investment opportunity for him because he wouldn't just come he wouldn't say come out and say hello but I didn't go into it wanting to do that um but after a couple meetings we really liked him uh he's very likable uh and and um we had a lot of admiration for him obviously for what he's done and what he built at the time and who he was and how he did it and his whole story and the whole thing obviously I mean bezos's Amazon amazing thing right So eventually we worked out some deal which was ridiculous was a ridiculous ridiculous deal and I can't go into the specifics but um we barely had any Revenue at the time the valuation was stupid um he knew it was stupid he's like put together something I need or like we don't know he's like put together something I need something so we put together something we share with him and we all had to laugh about it because it was ridiculous but like it had to be something where we could make something happen and um we're like look we don't want you to have any control we don't want a board of directors um they had one provision which said something like in five or seven years they had some right to do something like um encourage us to do something that we might not have wanted to do like sell or go public or something but they didn't have the power to I think push it through anyway it was just a suggestions Clause maybe that's what they call it I don't know it was very weak though it was a weak he didn't want like he's like I want you guys to do what you want to do he's like I like long-term thinkers I'm like we're in this forever we're not in this to sell the business the whole thing he liked that so what what's he like you go there to Seattle take us into the meeting when none of us will ever get to do that right especially Bezos back then by the way have you guys heard this story really quick uh it was the founder of root uh or it's w t there's this famous article oh wo yes where they go out to eat Jeff Bezos wants to buy this guy's company and they go out to eat and Jeff Bezos is sitting they go to breakfast and Jeff Bezos orders potatoes with bacon and occup OC ocupas and he and the guy's like why'd you order that that's like a weird breakfast order and he goes you're the octopus that I'm having for breakfast Bezos said when I look at the menu you're the thing I don't understand the thing I've never had and I must have breakfast ocupas and it was like the article tries to paint him as a weirdo but it doesn't exactly give full context and so at least now we have someone here who's also been in that in that situation that seems very Jeff [Music] um Jeff is probably the most optimistic person I've ever met and that was very clear from the start and I'd never been around someone who had that much optimism that was I mean clearly intelligent very intelligent but so but that made it with optimism is really powerful optimism about what about you about the world about his company what was he optim what do you remember he just comes in it's it's an aura of like can do this just positivity you know you've seen him he smiles a lot he laughs big you know he's just he has a he has an enthusiasm about him that is um I would say like formed into an optimism that is unshakable and unbreakable is it like a like why not like for example I've met people I think what you're describing and I went around them they like explain their new idea and they're like it's going to be this this and this and a lot of people default to like well you can't do that but these people default to well why not this all makes sense like I'm G to do this and then I think this will happen and this why won't that happen I think if you post something really unusual to Jeff he would just start laughing in a way like wow that is interesting like it's all interesting to him that was my take and I remember we were showing him campfire which is our first chat group chat tool this way way you know back before slack and there wasn't really something out there like this there was IRC but there was nothing really simple and we put it up on the screen I started talking to him about it because it wasn't out yet and like 15 seconds in he just got the whole damn thing he just got it like he got it in a way where he got it more than we got it um and he for people are always curious like okay well you're not going to sell the business how does he make any money on the investment well we're in LLC so he's a member he has units and every year he gets distributions and he's made his money back many times over and he still owns you know his shares and we haven't had to sell the business it's been a great investment for him not like a massive exit but like it pays for a lot of things I'm sure it's it's real cash Jeff good news your net worth has gone up by 0.001% this year you can thank us for that what's cool is like we don't matter but when you talk to him it's not that way yeah of he is genuinely curious and interested in what you have to say and I I've always respected that about him I love that description and by the way I've heard almost the same verbatim thing cuz Amazon bought twitch and I've asked em you know the CEO of twitch I was like what's Jeff like because that was his for a while it was Andy jasse and then it was he would go meet with Jeff once a year when they would present the plan and he said the same things he was like when you're in the room with him it's like there's nothing else that exists in the world like he's fully engaged fully paying attention fully present and he's like uh he's having a good time he's not like super super serious about everything he's laughing and he's curious and he asks questions and he mostly listens but then when he asks a question he almost always like has I like struck the heart of the issue and you're like how did you he's like dude I've worked on I run this business Em's like I founded this business for 15 years ago I run it every single day you think about this for like one hour a year but in that hour you kind of put your finger on the right thing that fast that is impressive Sean I want to ask him you have on here about this this Elon quote so you talked about reading bezos's book uh bezos's book you actually had an interesting take on reading elon's biography that I thought was intriguing I I I just think it's I admire you Jason so it's cool to see like who you admire and what your opinion is on different people who I may or may not admire by the way I think it's not like this person but maybe an aspect of that person or a one way that that person does something not like this person's good and other people are bad and all things they do are good or whatever right we're all a lot of different things we are all a lot of different things can I read you the quote you had tweeted this out I thought this was pretty fascinating you said I'm inspired by the business side of elon's biography there is one word that's overused and I think inacurate in the book Reckless what seems like risky actually to me strikes me as risk reduction and then you said the following you said compared to traditional Corporate America Corporate America takes the riskier route it's fear marginal decision-making complexity and I love this line you go mediocrity slathered in marketing and then you said uh mistakes come in all shapes and sizes but the ones that come from slow decisions committees that dilute responsibility sloppy cost controls and requiring pseudo certainty making a move those are the worst ones and Elon doesn't make those but his critics often do his mistakes are real and and they have consequences but they're rooted in Forward Motion I'm glad there's someone who is out there unafraid of making those kinds of mistakes and showing us all what H what is possible when you pierce the membrane that holds most things back that's that's pretty good uh What made you feel that way I would say reading the book made me made me feel that way now of course it's a story well it's you know a biography but like it's story there's a perspective on it a point of view um a lot of the examples in the book are about um simplifying are about cutting out waste getting to the root of things figuring out like what really matters um not getting caught up in what other people think it should be uh and also not being caught up in things you can't do and it was that impression and there's a there's a multitude of examples there's one one of my favorite examples I might be miscoding this slightly but there's this example of of uh there's a rocket you know SpaceX rocket ready to go launch and they find like a crack in the in the skirt that surrounds one of the engines and I think again I'm gonna get this some of the details wrong but like if NASA had found that um there's like a three Monon launch is scrapped multi-month delay rebuild the whole engine kind of that sort of thing so so there's there's a crack in in the skirt and and Elon hears about it they they stop the launch or something and Elon hears about it and uh he goes what's the problem he goes there's a cra in the skirt he goes um let's get rid of the crack can we get rid of the crack and they go well if you get rid of the crack you're going to lose some propulsion he goes okay how much propulsion are we going to lose they're like this much he because we can lose that there's enough margin here so let's cut the crack out and go and that's what they did and the launch was successful and it's like the kind of question that nobody else would even think to ask like well what is the problem it's a crack it's not the engine it's a crack let's get rid of the crack can we get rid of the crack yes but how this way well that's going to do this okay well what does that mean okay sure let's do it so that might seem Reckless I think it was position or pitched almost as reckless in the book to me that's like Common Sense fundamental smart problem solving and you think about all the other risks it saves and all the other things it prevents and the time that goes by and all the other things that can happen during that time they can go wrong I just see that as Brilliance um not as as as as recklessness so that's my take on it so I know that you guys are on your website you're uh you have a landing page for this product that I believe you descri I forget how you described it but it's something like it's a non-recurring software product because it's like you want to take back users need to take back control of like their their wallets and not pay a company every single month they just could pay one time so that seems like that excites you and I want to hear more about that and you also alluded to you have like a few more products you want to launch what ideas and businesses are exciting to you at the moment sure so uh what you're talking about is this thing called once which is more of an umbrella brand so once.com nc.com and it's a one pager and people can read it the the fundamental idea behind once is that we think that people should be able to buy products again right now pretty much all software is a service it's a rental you're renting Serv you're renting software in perpetuity and if you stop paying you lose it all like okay some Services make makes sense that are services but they're also I think a large collection of products old school products so you'd buy and you'd own and it's yours and you don't have to keep paying for it we want to bring that back that's how it used to be we think there's some real advantages to that in certain areas in certain product categories and we think companies should have the option to spend money once and not a lot a few hundred bucks and own the thing and not only own the thing but get the code too so you can modify it and screw around with it as much as you want this is not something that has been happening for many many many many years we think it's time to bring it back so we launched the first prodct which is campfire bringing back our old chat tool that sort of died on the vine to some degree although there's still some customers using the original version but we don't sell it anymore and uh campfire is installable software we built a whole new tech stack around this to allow people to we we you buy it on Shopify store it's 299 bucks you buy it we send you an email with a single line that you paste into a terminal of a server so it's there's a little bit of technical knowledge required but like barely any I'm not technical I can do it I've done it on digital ocean I bought a a shared server and ran this one command and now you have a chat server running that you own it's 299 bucks once unlimited users and it's basically 90% of what like slack would do it's the core stuff chatting DMS ad mentions sharing files it doesn't have threads it doesn't have video chat doesn't it but it has the fundamentals of what this nugget of this idea is and the principle around this is that in any industry um generics eventually come in for for example there's a lot of chat tools that exist in software today in in in in in the industry so they're basically Commodities but they're still priced like luxuries it's it's companies are running are spending tens of thousands of dollars a month on slack it's our teams it's obscene absolutely I SP I spend that it's obscene yeah you're um okay you get it right it's a lot of money it's a lot of money for basically chatting with your co-workers for the most part right um and it's just like there should be a generic option essentially this is what happens in in all Industries when there's a commodity or there's a lot of product Commodities something becomes a commodity that becomes a generic at a much lower price we're doing something at a high quality in a low price and changing the model around so anyway campfire is the first one working on a second one right now which I can't talk about yet but it's related to writing and uh maybe we'll do another one or two and then see how the model looks in a year from now like are we early how's it working so far it's been working really really well with campfire we've sold hundreds of thousands of of dollars worth of campfire and in a few months um so we're very happy with the start but we have to see if it sustains and how it goes and we're going to add some more products to that category and see how that goes can we talk about this strategy you have where before you launch something you put up a page a big blue page with a founder letter yes and the founder letter is basically saying kind of what you just did which is uh things used to be a certain way they've changed it's kind of obscene you know I get why they changed but now it's gotten a little ridiculous don't you think we're going to change that we're going to bring it back we think it we think life should be this way Common Sense logic don't you agree and uh yeah we're going to do it if you want to see if you want to be a part of that do this and actually this morning I saw something on Twitter that was kind of intering some guy announced his Venture round it was like we raised $16 million I'm like oh that's interesting what is this and it's this something called quilt and I go click this thing quilt and I'm like go to the website and it's um it says some like blah blah blah AI jargon with an email sign with a signup form no dis no no tell me don't tell me what it is don't tell me why I should want it don't tell me what it could do for me don't tell me why you built this and what was your motivation just we raised a bunch of money give us your email and you're on the list and we need to grow this list basically and I thought I can't believe more people don't copy what you do it's so like this that's how that's how this podcast came to be Sean by the way we were talking about copywriting and we're like man Jason's the best at this yeah and you did this for hay and um I used to teach this thing called Power writing and I would teach them I would say one of the landing page variants that nobody's T nobody's doing is founder letter um there's actually a company called Runway that did an amazing job of this I don't know if you ever saw runway.com but uh this guy siki who's a Serial founder was like the landing page was a long scrolling thing but it was basically just of dialogue and he's like being a CEO is hard for a bunch of different reasons but one of the Annoying reasons that feels like it shouldn't have been hard was that I kind of had no no grasp of the numbers of my business and that felt I felt stupid and I felt insecure about that and it was important but I just frankly didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to use these tools I wasn't really ever taught it why don't I know how many weeks of run why I have left why don't I know this why don't I know that and so I decided like I'm going to build a tool that's a finance tool but it's for Founders and he it as a letter and it was awesome and he got a bunch of people to sign up for it I think more people should be using this tactic and the reason why I think they don't to be honest is because there is no reason to be building their product there is no intrinsic why there is no strong point of view that would get people behind it their product is either derivative or sort of mediocre or it's just Trend following and so if they tried to write the letter there wouldn't be much to say it's not the writing that's the hard part it's the having a point of view that resonates with people that's the hard part it's the point of view so this is my favorite thing to do in the business business period and unfortunately I don't get to do it that often because we don't launch new things but I love writing a brief letter um and I I sweat every word and I just love it this is my like Bezos moment where I just smile and laugh while I'm while I'm doing this thing I just love finding the right Rhythm and the right rhyme and the right pattern and the right message and the right way to say it it's super fun I don't know why more people don't do it but to your point I think there is something about like you have to have a point of view first of all and the thing is is that you can do with any product like any a novel product a commodity product you just have to like understand the angle that you're taking although I don't even I don't like the term angles because it seems like it's almost manipulative but what stick you need a stick yeah yeah you don't like that I don't know you need some flavor what do you want call he not going to like stick I understand I appre ex you're right like that's the category shtick also has these like negative connotations like it's sort of like this game and manipulative thing maybe you don't mean it that way and you probably don't just like a flavor you just need Style Style I like Flavor I like style about it I like I like the point of view I to me it it cuts it it has a it has an edge that's the kind of thing and I think first of all it's very hard to do this not I'm not giving myself like credit like I can do a hard thing but it is hard to do this well I've always been inspired by people like you know Buffett and Bezos who write these amazing shareholder letters who are able to communicate very clearly um and and can do it in long form writing now this isn't that long form it's a it's a page but I want to get excited about that I I want to read something and I want to be pulled through it and by the end feel like it wasn't too long and just it said exactly what I needed to say and I'm left with some mystery so one of the things I like to do is you'll see the first sentence on once is something like um something happened to business software now that is planting a question in people's heads but it's not a question I'm not asking a question I'm making a statement and now they're like what do you mean right and now they're bought in because they ask themselves the question like oh yeah what did so what do you mean something happened now they want to find out what happened and then I kind of go through it and that and all the way I'm thinking about how do I find resonance like how are are they nodding their heads when I'm nodding my head when I'm writing this thing like how do we get to that place we like yeah yeah yeah and you build up this yeah of course yeah you're yeah uhhuh yeah and they're like y why am I spending this much money on this thing like I should own this by now I think there's a line like you should own this by now like bet Sam you've spent I don't know how much you've spent on SL like you should own it by now come on right and and and it's you know nothing against you right it's like everyone who does this it's like wow I mean how much money have I spent on this thing and I'm still spending the old the the metaphor that the SAS companies used initially was like just pay a couple bucks a month no big deal right pay as you go only pay for what you need but the problem is it's it's the renter and you reframed it as R right oh yes but you can get evicted yes but you don't even own this thing yes but they can raise the hike up the rents anytime they want right and so reframing it as cool yeah but you're you're a renter and they're the landlord and all your data is owned by them not you right he calls it the church the church of recurring Revenue Church of recurring Revenue so it's done very well for a lot of followers and and and people who attend the Church of recuit but the thing is like some things make sense like this like a magazine or newspaper like this is kind of old school right but you pay subscription but you'd get something new literally every week day month whatever it was software I know it's improving but it's improving around the marginal edges you already have 90% of it on day one when you bought the damn thing and so you're paying over and over and over and over for essentially the same thing and at some point if you're paying a lot you should be like wow I should own this by now this is crazy um so I want to kind of make that point and get people excited and leave people with some mystery so there's it's not like the stal thing where there's like we're doing an AI thing you enter your email it's like here's a story it's all legit but I'm still not going to tell you exactly what it is and uh then we kind of you know eventually deliver the product the simple test by the way is let's say you did buy slack or whatever insert what your favorite product for one year and then they did all these overthe a updates and they they you know they added this they added that they tweaked this they fix this butt if they had just charged you for it one year and then you could buy V2 you know slack 2.0 or the 2024 version would you buy the upgrade like you know we used to buy Windows 95 and then you would you would hear you're like oh man I heard whatever the next one Vista or whatever it is it's got all this new stuff okay maybe it's worth upgrading uh but like the reality is almost none of us would buy those UPG buy the next Edition because the upgrades are so marginal right they're not like uh gamechanging but you're char charge for it as you go as if those are such gamechanging updates yeah and like again some products like we have a few products like this hay sass tool base camp ass sass tool so we're in that world too I totally get it um that said we don't charge any of our customers more than $299 a month period flat so with base camp you can have 6,000 users it's just 299 flat unlimited users at that point so we don't offer the same thing where people could be spending 50 60 Grand or 10 grand or five grand or three grand a month with us like you can only spend $299 a month Max with Bas Camp so I don't feel as guilty frankly selling something like that you know compared to company asking companies to spend tens of thousands I get it's good for Revenue I get all that but man I wouldn't feel comfortable or confident I I would feel like I'm ripping people off frankly so how do you deal with the counterargument which is you guys were first with with campfire before slack slack comes out kicks your butt becomes a 20 something billion dollar company exits and blah blah blah how do you deal with that well first off slack is it was an excellent product it still is an excellent product but at the time it was way better than campfire so we sort of let campfire kind of Wither um we we you know kind of didn't Pioneer the idea I IRC was before us and there was Chat thing but like we kind of pioneered this version of it to some degree and we sort of let it sit and didn't really make it much better slack came around and made a much better version of that idea so full credit to them for that I think another problem we had was that we were really early with campfire I remember when we launched campfire in 2006 I don't know when slack launched I think it was like six years later or something like that I couldn't get anyone to buy campfire people are like why in the would you use a chat tool like what like we're all in the same office like just talk to people or whatever like I don't even get it well we we we used to use like Gmail chat and then for a while hip hip chat which I hate hip chat yeah that was another one yep yeah but if for while Gmail you were on the edge though because a lot of people didn't even like chat was like now everyone can't imagine working with a it but like it was not a thing that companies used individuals Ed it a lot but companies it's just this persistent chat room was just not a thing so because we were early on it we kind of didn't think there was a future in it because it was selling okay but not that well and so we just didn't pour more energy into it then Along Came slack I remember actually it's interesting steuart Butterfield um sent me an email before they launched slack we were friends and he said hey just want let you know we're launching this thing it's competitive with campfire to some degree um we're buddies I just want to like let you know you know like that's cool I remember looking at it the first time and like my stomach dropped I'm like oh we're dead or this thing is dead because it's good and the thing that impressed me the most about it was the onboarding experience I think that in my opinion there's two things of course the the bot integration stuff was really Innovative but the on boarding experience was so good where you basically talk to the chat and create your user account and stuff those it just took in my opinion those two things the chat itself isn't Better or Worse chat is chat essentially onboarding and and and Bots were the thing and we didn't have them and they crushed us so yeah that's how I'd answer that question dude you're um you're cool to me because you're like it all right so for the listener go to basecamp.com go to hey.com and once.com your landing page is like we're internet dorks all three of us like we're we're talking about like crm's like we're talking about like something that's not inherently like a punk rock thing but you have like a punk rock Vibe about you like if you look at your landing pages they're all like kind of cool and they're fun to read and you make non- cool things kind of cool it's it's yeah for me there's a degree of like mining for novelty and recognizing like what's interesting and what isn't how people can look at something go oh man I never thought of that but of course like that's what I'm always looking for I wrote this this post recently about towel bars and hooks I don't know if either of you saw it but riveting R riveting concept you ready for this I'm not ready but I'm sure it's great what is it so we're doing a bathroom Innovation and and the designer the architect like do you guys want hooks in your bathroom or towel bars and for me the choice was like it was so obvious it's like hooks hooks hooks I'm team hooks too in my house right and it's like why well for I'll give you a bunch of reasons first of all you can't screw up a hook you can't mount it wrong first of all um you can't use it wrong um you can put other things besides towels on it um it doesn't take up any space uh if you need to add a second one there's room for that um and sometimes it's nice to have like a two hooks a few inches apart and you can kind of spread a towel so it dries a little bit better um there's just all these reasons and for me I'm always looking for the hooks in product design like what are the little things that just are so simple and straightforward and everyone knows how to use them and you can't get it wrong you can't use them wrong and actually you can use them in a bunch of different ways that weren't intended and it still works compared to a towel bar it's like the only thing you can use a towel bar for is to hang a towel or your nine-year-old will do a pull-up on it and tear It Off the Wall that's the other thing you can do with a with a towel bar and and it takes a lot of space and like if you don't put the towel on just right it slides off like you can use it wrong so easily it's easier to use it wrong than it is use it right so that's why I like Hooks and so I'm always looking for these analoges in other areas I don't look at other software other software doesn't really inspire me like a hook will inspire me a piece of architecture a a space land a tree Furniture Design print design I don't know objects that's the kind of stuff that I I look for motivation and inspiration in I think there's a lot of really good ideas in there so that's that's where this stuff comes from and I'm like oh this is a hook and this is a hook and this is a hook and and anyway that's kind of how I think about it one of my favorite things I did in my in the research for this because I'm always looking for in the research it's like what what are the Big Ideas what are the important ideas but they're not necessarily new to me and then what are the new ideas and one of the new ideas I thought you put out there was really great super nerd but we're that's where we are right now we're in the nerd Zone which is really the place we should be all the time uh but you said when prototyping always try the wackier quirkier stuff first uh the deeper you go into a project the more conservative tends to get stranger ideas are more at home earlier in the process I love this this is so true I never heard anybody say this it's something that if you embrace it you can actually you know Sam's old company I think their only company culture thing was Let your freak flag fly it's like that's what you want to do in product design there's also kind of good life advice too which is the weirder quirkier things are actually it's easier to get away with them and do them when you're in your early 20s versus when you're 37 right like you tend to get more conservative it's product development it's life advice I thought that was brilliant thank you I I we really take this to heart and um the reason why is like for example I'll take the calendar example again if you're building a calendar and you think that there's all these table Stakes features that you like you need to be on par first with Google Calendar like if you're like you want people are going to buy this like if they're going to use Google Calendar they're going to expect Google Calendar Fidelity and functionality and then maybe we add a couple other things like no one's going to buy your thing because Google Calendar is Google Calendar like why just make that other thing with a couple other things so we always start with the Novelties the things that don't exist anywhere else that's what makes your product differentiated that's what makes it worth considering like to say like we made Google Calendar a a little bit better like not worth it but we made something totally different that it's not just different because it's different but we actually think there's some Novelties here that matter that make sense that are radically different in good ways that's what we pile on early and to the other point of that quote is that if you just wait till the end to try to add those Novelties you'll never have enough time you're always running out of time at the end and you're never going to try new things you're not going to have the tolerance or the the the uh the patience to to wander so then you end up leaving those things out and then you never get around to them because once you launch to the public the public then demands even more normal stuff know what the public doesn't demand unusual things the public demands normal stuff it's on you to find the unusual things the things they didn't consider but once they see they go of course where's this been my whole life that's the kind of stuff base camp is packed with these things and hay is packed with these things and hey calendar is packed with these things and those who use those tools understand that those who don't don't know but they are packed with things you're like oh my God where's this been my whole life that's amazing um by what do you do you guys pull out uh profits every years out of the LLC I like that you don't reinvest it you basically get the benefit are you like a boring kind of like index funds and bonds guy like Sam is more on the conservative kind of uh side I'm more like that 820 index bonds life baby yeah I'm like the two sexiest words in the English language are like exotic instrument it's like oh we got an exotic instrument for you I'm like tell me more and then I regret it later what do you what do you do sex what what's an exotic what's an exotic instrument it's the thing that you're uh you know lose money your shitty wealth advisor gives you to lose money it's called an exotic instrument code I mean our exotic instrument is our own business that's where most of our risk is tied up so so I'm more on on Sam's tip here which is to be very conservative with with um Investments outside my business so primarily index funds I do invest in a few individual companies that I really know and really like and have liked for a long time I might even know the CEO I might have a good sense of who this company is and what they do I'm not jumping on the meme stocks that kind of thing right um I've an advisor I I've done some like other kinds of investing around like um some some PE deals and some stuff like that but primarily I'm pretty much straightforward index funds like play the the US economy longterm essentially and some maybe some other companies or countries economies but primarily us that's my main thing I I also like so I do that and then I also like to spend money on things that I I enjoy and that my family enjoys um and but I'm not a I'm not a um I don't what I don't like to do is ever put myself at risk I don't like to put my business at I'll take risks but I don't take risks that put me at risk that is not an interesting risk for me it seems like you value being able to sleep well at night it's like I just want to be able to to sleep easy and not do anything that's going to jeopardize that right like people ask in business all you you know what keeps you up at night and and typically the answer for most people is like some the competition am I going to be able to make payroll for me like what keeps me up at night when I am up at night because of work it's excitement like I can't wait to start working tomorrow on this thing that we're working on it's it's not it's not like because our our Mar it's not like our margins are rais are thin and might not be able to make payroll or I'm focused on the competition hyperfocused so like they launched something new and oh my God what are we gonna do like that one slack moment I did have was was one of those moments that was years ago um I I just want to sleep well I don't I stop work at five I don't talk about work with my family at all we just don't it's just not a thing it's a separate thing that I do during the day and I get excited about sometimes at night because I'm just excited about ideas um um but it's also recognition David and I both practice this idea of like negative visualization basically like look we've been at this 25 years we've done exceptionally well we've been incredibly fortunate if this thing all Flames out in two years because of something we we did wrong a major Market shift competitive shift whatever it is you know what like that's okay too it's will be painful to some degree but like it's okay if we if we have a 27-year run gez I mean what more can you ask for now people lose their jobs and it would suck I'm very certain many almost everyone who works here can get another job somewhere else very quickly um we would help people all those things I mean I don't want this to happen but if it did we'd be okay this is not my identity this is not my life this is not something that needs to exist forever um I don't want to feel that level of obligation to it as much as I have a lot of responsibility and feel obligated to our customers and to our employees and to the ideas that we have it's not the whole world that's just an important thing for me Sean and I are in similar positions uh where we have profitable businesses and a question that I'm trying to figure out is what percentage of the profit profits to pull out um versus reinvest do you have a framework for deciding like that percentage especially earlier on right maybe in year 27 the answer is different than in year three or two yeah so I can only tell you what we've done which is again a little bit unusual we pull out everything at the end of the year now first of all we're an LLC so we're tax on everything at a personal level so if I leave money in the business I'm still paying personal income tax on that money it doesn't really make sense to do that so we have a recurring you know recurring Revenue model we have very predictable Revenue so we basically have a little bit of overlap you know we take some money out in quarterly distributions and there's some money left over in January and we kind of wait till April to take it all out so there's some overlap and they Opera in cash right when we were when I first started the business in 1999 we were an agency and we our first client it was it was uh four of us three Partners one sort of employee we each put 10 grand in so we had 30 grand uh to start the business um and then our first customer was was HP HP was like giving everyone business way back then HP was like the hot company to get a gig with because they paid a lot and I think the gig was a few hundred grand to do some website design for them this is 99 where people are paying numbers like that and um from that point on we were profitable because we only had a few people we didn't take big salaries and that was that we were able to pull out all the money every year because actually we started out as a C Corp for like a couple years and then we switched to an LLC but regardless we pull out all the money um at the end of the year essentially uh and because we had ongoing client work that would sort of span the gap of the calendar year so we just always had money coming in and our costs were so low that we weren't ever starving you know so it just it just was a situation where we always had high margins and that's how I've always run the business so I I know it's an unusual setup um but I do think it doesn't have to be quite as unusual I think what ends up happening is companies hire too many people their payrolls are they have too many people on payroll they spend too much money on customer acquisition and their costs are really high so their margins are very low if there's margins at all and then it's very hard it's much it just becomes a much harder business to run now again like there's a lot of luck involved with this we happen to find a way somehow to have very very healthy margins over two decades part of that though is again the cost side of it which is just not considered enough do you run any paid ads no not right now we we have explored that we we played with it so here's the thing like last year we're like we're g to spend five million bucks for the first time ever on like ads we started getting into it in a few months like we spent a bunch of money we're like this is just it just it's vanity money because like this isn't doing anything for us now someone might say who's listening go you got to give it more than three months and 6 months and eight months you got to do this for five years before you show returns and you got to try a bunch of campaigns we just don't have the tolerance to spend that kind of money on something that isn't very clearly going to return for us also our price points are so low our customer acquisition costs are tricky because a lot of our competitors they're selling things for thousands and thousands a month we're selling things for base camp is 15 bucks per user per month um or 299 unlimited like there's not a lot of play here um to really invest a lot and spend a lot to to acquire a customer so it just doesn't work for us so we don't do anything not even branded keywords we occasionally do that if someone's like using our our brand we kind of want to knock them out but essentially we just don't it's all through our own channels you know that we've developed over the years and there's no question in my mind that there is a Formula that we don't know that we could figure out at some point perhaps to grow the company in a big way somehow through through marketing advertising targeted whatevers we just don't have the the TA the tolerance for it frankly I just don't think that we're interested enough in that kind of growth and the answer is always like why grow that much like if you're trying to sell the company at some point like growth rates really matter but like for us sustainability matters profits matter margins matter I don't want to eat into those for some future whatever it doesn't really matter again like if we were to sell the business in a couple years and we got a 10x multiple or 5x multiple but could have had a 15x I don't don't it doesn't matter to me it doesn't matter to me to spend all that money trying to search for that I'd rather just take the money out and put it into Investments that I can basically gu not guarantee but like have a really good sense of return on and and just do our thing our own way dude you're the man I think that if I had to make like a mount Rush mod uh a mount Rush M of this podcast like you know I think Sean opened it up by saying we love people who carve their own path and I don't care if that person is an entrepreneur or an artist or or a mother like just someone who like just says this is the way I want the world to be and I'm going to live that way um I admire that greatly and the way that you write the way that you think you're you're kind of on my Mount Rushmore I really admire you and I'm incredibly I know we both are incredibly thankful that you uh spent some time with us you're the man it's very kind I I I love the show by the way I listen to it it's great um and uh I really appreciate being here thanks for uh the time and the questions and happy to do it again anytime um I could go for hours with you guys if you ever want you have a uh you have uh an open invitation whenever you want to whenever you want well I'm not going to invite myself on I did this time actually kind of sort of so I will not do that again if you ever want to talk again I'm available let me know thanks for doing it Jason we appreciate you that's the Pod thank [Music] you

you can do anything but you can't do everything and that is what I want to talk about today ruthless focus laser-like focus for [Music] 2024 I have not been great at focusing in the past in the past I have let myself get distracted I have let myself set a goal at the beginning of the year and by the end of the year I check in and I'm like where the hell what what did I do all year why did I drift and it's not something malicious it's not like a total fail but it's just this drift that I didn't like and I wanted to get better at I'm going to show you what works for me how do you get more focused how do we get the laser-like focus that all the great ones exhibit whether it's in sports and you see Kobe Bryant completely obsessed in entertainment you see Mr Beast he completely locked in and obsessed in business you'll see somebody like Mark Zuckerberg laser focused on one thing trying to make that happen they don't let let themselves drift the way the rest of us do so here's the little visual this is you and this is all the things that you might do so this is uh you know some news thing that's going on the election This is Love is Blind season five this is that investment somebody wants you to do this is um that email you got from that person who wants to do a call and pick your brain this is that side side hustle that's not really going to go anywhere right that's all the things and then the blue thing is the thing you actually want this is the thing that you would feel proud of at the end of the year if you made this happen and so what we need is laser likee focus we do not want the cone to be wide I'm going to show you how we do that so first thing you want to do this is a before and after of how you can operate and again we have all the possible things that we could be saying yes to and you want to think about your yes threshold so let's write that up this is your yes thresold and before it might be you know here so you might have your yes threshold right there and what you're doing is you're saying yes to anything above that line if it's below that line you're able to say no but you're able to say yes to everything above that line and the after all we have to do the first thing you have to do is simply acknowledge bring your awareness to how low your yes threshold is and raise it raise your standard for yes and so instead of saying yes to things that are pretty good maybe interesting might be worth doing pretty cool it needs to take your yes to a hell yes that is the easiest thing you could do so we're going to raise the yes threshold right we're going to take it from here up to here and you know this sad guy becomes this happy guy and he's taller so you get two inches of height at least and your your yes threshold is even higher all right so that's the first thing you do bring your awareness to where's my bar today and take my yeses to only doing hell yes things that doesn't mean you don't do if somebody you know if your friend comes and says we're going to Costa Rica and it's going to be amazing that might be a hell yes for you go for it but make sure you you have a premium quality on your focus and what you're willing to do all right next thing time management you may have seen this is a famous Pam essay that I've turned into a cartoon and the pogram essay is basically come uh showing the difference between a maker uh uh oh wait I have these flipped okay uh yeah hold on let's reverse that this is a manager schedule this is what their calendar looks like and this is what a maker schedule look like this is the artist right somebody who's a builder and so for a lot of people they have this 9:00 am. 9:30 a.m 10: a.m. 10:30 a.m 11 a.m. 11 oh I'm double booked oh [ __ ] and they end up just in a puddle of Tears they are overwhelmed their stress they sort of busy themselves to death why didn't I get everything I wanted to done in life why didn't I achieve my goals and my dreams because I was too busy like listen to that sentence that doesn't even make sense you didn't do the things you need to do because you didn't have time because you filled it with other crap and so most people by default especially people in jobs you will be default opted into a m a manager's schedule what you want to do is switch to a maker schedule a maker schedule is basically long interrupted blocks of time usually in the morning you need at least two and a half hours of uninterrupted time usually three is ideal a break where you're going to lunch exercise go for a walk play with your kids walk your dog whatever you do and then another uninterrupted Sprint for some people the real great ones they have a another break and then they have a third night Sprint but you know you don't have to do all that um you need to switch to this maker schedule and so the maker schedule is the one thing you could do with your time where in the same number of hours you can get more done why because when you get into these interrupted blocks of time you get into flow States and you're able to actually lock in on uh knocking out one whole thing without distractions without checking your emails without being pulled into a call or a meeting about this and about that you're able to to to lock in and so whether you're an engineer and you want to build a product you want to code something or you're um you know you're trying to be an Entertainer you need to write chapters of your book or uh a YouTube video that you're making or you're just trying to come up with a new idea not letting yourself your your day get split I call this the uh the zebra calendar where you're just Stripes all day that is the next thing you need to do to enable yourself to come up with great ideas right you are setting up your environment so the first thing we did was we raised the threshold of yes to a hell yes so that we're just saying no to things that clears space the next thing is we do the maker schedule versus the manager schedule so that you have uninterrupted time blocks where you can be your most creative productive self okay next thing now we're going to Clarity so this is something I stole from assana Asana created this thing called The Clarity uh the Pyramid of clarity and the Pyramid of clarity goes as follows at the top here you have your mission and the mission is your big the reason your organization exists it's the reason you're even doing this it's your big why and so let's say you're Elon Musk your mission for SpaceX might be um you know make humans an interplanetary species a multiplanetary species um or for Tesla for him it might be get the world off of using you know fossil fuels and get them to a electric future right so that's the big vision for what you're doing now you break that down you say so you write that out and by the way little Pro tip because when I first write about this I was like wow that makes total sense you got to have this big audacious Vision but let's say you're not building rockets and going to space or you're not trying to get the world off of fossil fuels to a fully electric energy um system you you know you might just be building a e-commerce business that's designed to enable your lifestyle to be really great because you wanted money and you didn't have money right like whatever it is the key here is honesty because you can write a fancy Mission but if it's not your honest Mission it's not going to help it's not going to do anything won't have any emotional resonance so what I try to do is I try to be honest about the mission so for example with my company we are building a a company that is going to enable us to have an amazing lifestyle us the owners of the business have an amazing lifestyle we only have a couple of people in the business it's all owners and we want to have a lifestyle where we can do what we want when we want with whoever we want and only work on projects that are you know intellectually fascinating for us Crea aely challenging for us and so we write that that's what we're doing that is the mission of what we're trying to build we're building a vehicle that enables that um from there you want to go down to the one-year goal okay so this is the the mission might take 10 years it might take 20 years but then you break it down to the one-year goal where do we need to be at the end of the year for this to be a smash success and specifically I set two goals so I have the uh what I call the [ __ ] goal and then I have the floor goal and so I set kind of a range here because I don't like static one you know single goals binary goals because you're then you're you're like should I just be super ambitious but then I might be disappointed or should I be conservative but then I feel like I didn't push myself so I set both I set a f goal and a floor goal the floor goal means you would be disappointed if it didn't reach this level meaning um this would be a solid win below that you kind of feel like ah man really we we didn't we didn't get there and the FIA goal is we're high-fiving we're toasting to our I can't believe this is how good it turned out and so you want to kind of set that range for yourself and say all right we have a minimum and then we have sort of a Target that we're going to shoot all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool service and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worth and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what the payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM okay what's the next level of this now you have your overall mission clarified and I'll show you an example in a second you have your one-year goal where we want to be a year from now and that's what you're going to work backwards from so then you work backwards and you say okay in order to achieve this one-year goal what do I need in terms of people what do I need in terms of product and what do I need in terms of finances three categories and so you break the one-year goal into the this is the output to the inputs so for example for my e-commerce company we had a one-year goal and we said we're going to try to go we're we're going to try to double Revenue we did about 17ish Million last year we're g to try to get to um you know over 30 this year so we said what do we need in terms of people well I needed to hire a CMO because today I was doing it I'm not the best uh CMO for for that business I'm not full-time on it so we we set some people targets we need to hire an amazing CMO who's done this before uh we needed to hire a website developer who's going to do XYZ right so you write down what are your people gaps then you have your product gaps so what does the product need to be able to do in order for us to hit our goal so for example when Elon launched Tesla he set a product goal and he was like how do we make a car that is um I think it was like faster than a Porsche and um better for the environment than a Prius faster than a Porsche better for better than a Prius right better for the environment than a Prius and that is a prodal that is a benchmark that we are trying to achieve is it faster than a Porsche and is it more is it better for the environment than a Prius and so similarly you want to set some product goals for yourself um for for to achieve your one-year Mission and lastly is finances so you know do you need Capital um you know by by default people think they do you should question that assumption um Beyond just how much money do we need to do this might be your margins or might be your unit economics we need to bring the cost down to this in order for this to work because we want to be profitable and today we're unprofitable and So within each one of those you've now broken your one-year goal into the the different um input input metrics that if you did those correctly it would lead to the one-year goal and then from there you just break it out by month you say all right in January okay what are we going to do well we need to chip away at the people goal the product goal and the finance goal so let's break those into a digestive chunk and now all of a sudden it's like you know uh let's do 20 interviews and and try to find you know two great candidates for the the CMO role or whatever it may be and so then you go month by month and every month you check in you you check in on the whole pyramid you say all right as a reminder our mission is X by the end of the year we're trying to do y in order to do that we need to hit these we need to do these three things internally and then the score will take care of itself and so to get there we need to break this out month by month into what's what's What mattered last month did we achieve it and matters this month you do that for 12 months straight you are going to stay on track there will be no drift last thing I want to share with you I stole this from my friend Joel Omen he's a listener of the show and I hope he's okay with me sharing this I'll ask him but he he said he shared this um this simple slide that he made for himself and I loved it it was a killer slide it was one slide that gave him Clarity on what is he trying to do and how is he going to get there and I like the way he framed it so I want to share it with you so he had his goal uh the mission that I called it on the last last page and his goal was to build a creatively fulfilling cash machine I just love that creatively fulfilling cash machine and he said well you know I've done I've done each of them individually you know I've built successful businesses uh cash machines and I've built I've done things you know he wrote like a fantasy fiction book right something was creatively fulfilling but didn't make any money and so he's like this time my mission is to do this because if I did this I would be Bliss out walking into work every day right I would be my at my happiest in terms of my professional goals and so set a goal for yourself like this and you want to use this as a bar for residance right you know this is a this is a not a generic offthe shelf goal like be successful or um make money or whatever right like set it set it for real so maybe for some people it's make six six grand a month um so that I can quit my job make six grand a month out of my business so I can quit my job and be totally independent not have to worry about how I'm going to pay the bills right I could be stressfree and then it's only up from there and write that whole thing out write it out in a way that has some emotional uh pull for you that it's a compelling picture all right so the second thing then you have your output right so what are the you know that's kind of like I said the one- year goal right so in order to do that we might need to do the following two things now here's the part I liked best when he says I say yes to blank and I say no to blank so for example let's say for this podcast I you know have a goal which is I want to I want to be one of those people that inspired me when I was coming up that is very much why I do this podcast because growing up I remember when I was in college somebody gave me a book called The 4-Hour Work week and it blew my mind at the time I never thought about half of the concepts in there and I was like just insight after Insight page after page of inspiration and story and I just said that's how I want my life to be I said I called it catching the 4H hour fever like I read that book and for four hours I went into a fever dream and I replanned everything in my life that was very impactful for me thank you Tim Ferris um there have been other moments like that Tony Robbins and others where I've had these um people who created content that really shifted my thinking that made me have more clarity more insight more motivation more Firepower to go do what I wanted to do and so my goal with this podcast is to do that okay well great what do I need to say yes to in order that to happen well we break that big dream down to a one-year goal and then we break that one-year goal down to the things that we're going to have to opt into so for example for this podcast you might say well I'm gonna have to sit down consistently week after week doing my absolute best to create the most compelling content out there the best wisdom for entrepreneurs and when I do that I am I'm saying yes to doing my best and knowing that the numbers are not going to change every week that it might look flat for a long time that I'm going to do that for years and I will not be discouraged I say yes to doing that input even though the the numbers will take a long time to build up right so that's what I'm saying yes to what's the second thing I'm saying yes to well for this year for example we wanted to bring on higher profile guests we booked a bunch of Tim Ferris coming on we booked uh Tony Robbins and a bunch of others and so I said yes to doing something I didn't like to do guest Outreach I hated begging people to come on my podcast and all that I just I don't know I don't like when people ask me I didn't want to ask other people but I said I got to say yes to that I got to say yes to the discomfort and the ego of continuing to follow up with people and try to get them to come on the podcast and what do I say no to so what are the things I have to say no to well I have to say no to starting a company I sit on this podcast every week and I come up with ideas for businesses I got to say no to actually going and doing them because if I now I'm a CEO of a startup I'm not going to be able to achieve this this goal so I have to say no to some very compelling good ideas that would make me millions of dollars write that down right so what are the other things I have to say no to I have to say no to avoiding hard conversations I have to say no to um my old habit of blah blah blah right I thought this was a very very useful thing because it had both the it was it was all about self-awareness this is a self-awareness game what is the goal that motivates me to get out of bed every single day and chase this above all other possible things I could be doing with my time and my talents second what is it about me that I know I'm going to have to consciously force myself to say yes to and say no to to and here it's the things that are not easy for you you don't want to write the things that you already say yes to that are already just uh you know trivial for you it's it's your nature to do that it's here you identify what's against your nature and and write that down so that you're very clear in what you need to do and to me this is how you can do anything you are Limitless right you nobody can tell you that you can't do that thing but you can't do everything right so that you can do anything but you can't do everything is a very powerful idea and it's gives you that focus is a superpower people say that but they don't tell you how you focus so I hope today you learned a little something from Uncle sea about how you actually Focus this is something that frankly I'm still a beginner at right I'm I'm maybe a blue belt in the in the game of focus um but I do know that it's important and because it's important I'm working at it and I wanted to share with you the things that I'm doing that that tend to be working for me the things that have helped me make some progress maybe there's some more things out there I'd love to hear from you what works for you in the comments but uh that's it that's the episode [Music]

now the grit score goes I think it's zero to 10 I want you to guess my grit score 10 is super gritty gritty as it gets uh I would say I would put you six six seven you're pretty gry I appreciate your faith in me I scored a 2.5 on this grit test bro D you should have took it [Music] again all right Sean you're back how was the trip my trip was great me and Ben went to Phoenix and um I'm not going to share all the details but it was a dope experience dope life experience I think one great thing to share by the way when's like Sam was the last dope life experience you had something you didn't have to do but you did anyways probably Camp MFM two years ago don't let that happen don't let too much time go by uh I think like every three months or so should try to do something that's uh a little extracurricular if you know what I mean just something that's outside of the routine outside of what you have to do um so I did that anyway so we went to Phoenix um because uh Matt ishia who is the owner of the Suns the Phoenix Suns the basketball team there we had gotten in touch with them and he was like Hey if you guys ever want to come check out a game come hang out so we go down to Phoenix and we meet Matt we meet the team we get to go sit Courtside do like live life as an NBA owner which is awesome because I always dreamed of doing doing that now what I want to tell you though is not about Matt uh what I want to tell you about is actually much more uh in the weeds so here's a little in the weeds um a little in the weed story so I think Ben emailed him when he bought the team and was just like hey congrats buddy and then was like thank you thank you Ben Levy goodbye and that was the first touch Point second touch point was we invited him to Camp mm we're like hey you he used to be a college basketball player so he was a college basketball player now he's a multi-billionaire who owns an NBA team well that's a mix of basketball and you know entrepreneurship that that's who we try to invite to the camp and so we invited him he was like oh I'd love to come couldn't end up making the dates but his kind of make good was listen sorry I couldn't make it but if you guys are ever in town let me know we'll we'll hang out we'll check out a game hey what do you know Matt we're in town what are you in town because that's when we're in town so we worked with his assistant to be like when do you think we should be in town and we did that so this is the rule of reciprocity by the way you offered someone something and regardless if they take you up or not they now owe you we should just host events that aren't ever going to happen and we make sure we file the person online like oh they're out of town that date they're already busy let's ask them we're hosting a charity event honoring you uh so so yes we did that now the funny thing is uh well the background here is that what why what's the randomness here Ben used to Ben is a DieHard Phoenix Suns fan he loves the Phoenix Suns more than you love your child he loves the Phoenix Sons with a deeper passion than Romeo loved Juliet and he was a ball boy for four or five years so like literally was was with the team every day volunteer ball boy basically um just to give you a sense of this guy so when every year when there's an All-Star game so you what the way the way it works in the NBA is the fans vote on who gets to be named an All-Star so Ben supporting his guys being the loyal supportive guy that he is takes literally 100,000 ballots home forces his family every night to sit there and punch the ballots to vote the Phoenix Suns guys in and himself over the course of a couple months they churned through 100,000 ballots to try to support the team the guy the players didn't care they didn't know about this he just did it because he's that that big of a Die Hard fan so that's ridiculous Ben obviously does a lot for me I was like can I what's a what's how can I make a Ben appreciation weekend and that's what this was this was go and and kind of let him live a live a child to dream out so he goes down there we we watch the game it's all good one of the cool things was and this happens all the time by the way you think you're there to meet the the famous person but it's actually this other thing that's really interesting that's more accessible that ends up being the fascinating thing you wouldn't have known it until you showed up so similarly we go and we have this great conversation with one of the guys in their kind of like data department so it's like analytics data that's become a big part of sports and so Ben is grilling the guy Ben's like uh the guy came down to say nice to meet you and Ben's like cool I have 1,000 questions for you have a seat and he's like in the year 2013 you picked this guy why I'd like to know what telling you that what and he's like what are the metrics that matter right now for us when we play a game obviously besides the score like you know what leads to the score and he's he's asking all these detailed questions and when Ben asks questions sometimes I've noticed the person won't even finish and he's like I got what I need next like it's just like and he's he's he's great because um everybody needs a place where they're Shameless like for me and you like I'm Shameless about like I'm a monologue okay I got something interesting to say I know that's not how this is supposed to work but I'm a monologue because that's I just need to get this off my chest and trust me you're gonna like it by the end your thing is like you'll just ask a blunt question you'll just be like well dude you keep saying this like what is it how much what's in your pocket right now and they're like I guess nobody's ever asked me that here here's the answer Ben's thing is that he's like oh we're um you know we're supposed to be at dinner I'm going to ask you all of the questions I will I my C is endless and like I don't care what the social situation is like we'll be playing basketball and he'll be guarding a guy and he'll be like he'll be like so like what's Revenue like nowadays like dude like you got to let it go for this moment in time like just give it a rest but he doesn't he doesn't do it anyways we're doing that with this guy and one of the one of the fascinating questions that he asked we were like what's you're the data Guy what's the data you wish you had that you don't currently have like what data would would help you do this because he's showing us these cameras in the gym where if you're just shooting around there's cameras now that will it does facial recognition it'll track okay Sam is shooting in the practice session it'll record the length of the session the number of shots the exact arc on every shot his exact um field goal percentage without anybody having to be there to keep track of stats so cool Tech right now his answer was very interesting so he was like you know we test for we can we know everything you've ever done on the court but what we've learned what everybody knows who's been around Sports is that the difference between the Michael Jordans and the you know Isaiah ryers or the Kobe Bryants versus the Lenny Brooks it's like it's like what's up top what's in your mindset and the guys who are completely obsessed extreme disciplined they're able to work harder than the next guy they don't take those days off they um you know are receptive to coaching and they're going to improve on their weaknesses they're going to double down on their strengths they can keep their confidence even when something goes bad it's all about the mental right like every athlete every great athlete would tell you how much of the sport is mental but they have no way of measuring the mental and so we said interesting what would be the way that you would want to do that he's like grit grit what do you mean grit he's like well there's this book that came out I don't know have you ever read this book the book Angela Duckworth Duckworth yeah exactly so I went down this Rabbit Hole after that so that was just my segue into me going down this rabbit hole on these uh mindset tests so first I actually want to tell you about a different test which you've probably done in the past and that's the Myers Briggs Test have you done this test yeah do you know the backstory of this you know where this came from no but is it even real are horoscopes real right are Palm readers real like there's a lot of [ __ ] in this industry which is why I'm fascinated by it so let me I'm not saying it's completely [ __ ] but there's a lot of handwavy stuff here's the story there's a woman and her name is Isabel Isabelle 1942 uh I think World War II is going on and Isabelle is reading Readers Digest and she reads in Readers Digest this article about people sorting people sorting and basically it's how companies are using test to do people sorts and so she reads that locki uh locki the aircraft uh company was using it to locate you know possible troublemakers they're like we need to do some screening so that we can identify who's going to be a troublemaker who's going to have some Mischief in them another company was using it for finding uh you'll appreciate this one henpecked husbands and they were basically the argument was that if the man is under the thumb at home then he'll easily also be submissive at work fascinating right like people were legitimately doing this they're like trying to figure out like who's who's got that Alpha who's got that dog in them all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their landing page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM so she writes to her mom Catherine she's like this is fascinating companies are doing this blah blah blah she's interested in Psychology her mom writes back and says you should make your own test um and you should do it you you're always telling me about that guy Carl Jung you should uh Carl Young J I don't know how you say it uh he's like you should do it on those principles so um she ends up creating and their last names are Briggs and Myers and she ends up creating the uh the I forgot what it's called the Briggs Myers type indicator or something like that right like that's that's how this test started and she creates a test and basically he had this Theory the psychologist had this theory that there's like people Branch out in this like decision tree it's like you're either a thinker or a feeler so you're a perceiver or you're a judger and and they if you just go down the tree it ends up with 16 possibilities and they gave each of the 16 like kind of a positive affirmation name so there's no bad there's no bad score yeah they give you a fortune cookie everybody gets a trophy and so they were like oh you are an executive you are a caregiver you are a scientist you are an idealist and they just had all these labels for the for the 16 categories now of course the funny thing is if you end up taking the test you'll get one score and on average if you take the same test Weeks Later 50% of people will will end up with a completely different label so yeah I don't know how reliable these things are and that you know people who criticize it they say this takes advantage of something called the forer effect have you ever heard of this thing the forer effect it's basically the same thing that astrologers fortune tellers and other pseudo scientists use where they kind of cold read something general about you like you're the type of person who um you know you don't let everybody in but once but when some you get close to somebody you really open up or like you're the type of person who um you know sometimes when things get hard you're able to really you know you're able to really stand up and and and make it happen it's like know I do have a little bit of that in me you know you're right how'd you know um here here's some money and so anyways they create this test it's not that popular at the beginning but it ends up getting picked up by uh you know fast forward many many years and gets picked up by a company called um CPP the Consulting psychologist press CPP and so and they picked up the distribution rights and they're like hey we are going to Market this to American businesses we are going to tell American businesses about this when you say picked up do you mean was this a publication that promoted it or bought it it was a publishing company and they buy the licensing rights to Market it and they're Isabelle and her mom are just going to get a royalty and basically right as she dies she dies at 82 sales start taking off by 1983 almost a million people are taking the Myers Briggs Test annually is it free no so the way it works is it's a it's kind of a brilliant business model so basically to take the test is somewhere between 15 and 40 bucks so everybody who takes a test you get you know let's say on average 30 bucks from them but then well you can't just take the test it has to be given to you by a practitioner well the practitioners have to pay $2,000 to become a certified practitioner that's the only way you could take this test and so like last year they enrolled 5,000 practitioners who each paid you know about $1,500 to $2,000 each 8 to 10 million bucks in Revenue off of just the practitioners and then each of the practitioners um then distributes the test and they get they get paid by Distributing the test so they it's kind of like a multi-level marketing scheme right the practitioner makes 30 bucks a test and then the extra royalty the extra 10 bucks on top goes back to the to the um to the parent company to the publisher and uh so this thing they don't know the revenue because it's still private it's been private for like whatever you know since you know the 80s and uh they once said their number was over 20 million in Revenue I suspect it's higher than that um there's been millions of people who take this whove taken this test and Myers Briggs is that company CPP it's their biggest earner it's that that's their Cash Cow and so that's insane dude it's used by the government it's used by 200 federal agencies use this um you know just the EPA itself they use it on a quarter of their 20,000 employees I think 80% of the fortune 89 oh 89 of the Fortune 100 use this test 89% of the Fortune 100 isn't that insane there's a few things that are insane about it one to create something so when did you create it in 42 1942 yeah so we're coming up 880 years now as we're going to be close to 100 years soon that's amazing to create something that lasts that long I mean that that's it's such a reputable brand even though I think it's nonsense uh but many people think it's reputable that it uh it's at this point it's an annuity so you just like it's predictable Revenue all the time um we talked about uh was it Gallup Gallup pulling and they own Clifton strengths which is famous for strengths finders 2.0 and I tried to find how much revenue they did and I could not find anything I believe Gallup I we did this two years ago so I don't remember I believe Gallup does something like a billion a year in revenue or or hundreds of millions but if you go to the strength finder website and you look at their traffic it's huge it's a huge huge huge thing and it costs the same thing 20 or $40 for one of these tests I loved this business because the test business is so fun because you're desperate to know like when you're in a hard time you're desperate to know you just want affirmation that things are going to be okay and I loved it I love it and I used to do these all the time and I would even game them I'd be like well that's not right I should I should take it I I should take it again I probably answered a few a few wrong uh so check this out so I read about that now when we meet this guy and he tells me about the mental makeup the the grit the mindset and being important I'm like he's totally right the mindset thing is super important and so I'm like what was that book grit Angela Duckworth what was that all about I I believe it's um uh you could put off desire what's that called or you could put off gratification delayed gratification is like the I think that's a part of it but the ones I think they had is basically it's ability so like your talent basic your ability times Zeal which is like your passion or enthusiasm about something times capacity for hard labor is the formula for success and with what with grit specifically it's around Zeal and the perseverance so it's you know basically your Your Enthusiasm your passion times times perseverance okay so here's what's interesting about this thing so he tells me about this and I'm like all right Doug like how what's my grit score let me go let me go test it now the grit score goes I think it's zero to 10 I want you to guess my grit score 10 is super gritty gritty as it gets who's who's a 10 David gaggin is a 10 uh I would say I would put you six six seven you're pretty gry I appreciate your faith in me I scored a 2.5 on this grit test bro D you should have out of 10 I am I am in the bottom 10 percentile of grit so what were the questions you so check this out I'm gonna read you some of the uh The Testament and this is the this is why I was like this is [ __ ] why is this [ __ ] okay so here's the claims the she writes this book and becomes a bestseller you see Keith for boy they be like oh grit's the most important thing and all these CEOs are like grit's the most important thing they're not wrong it's it's just that like many of these best-selling books it's like pop science right like the principle is not wrong but the the depth of the evidence is actually quite shallow and so here's what it says so it says uh so she starts off by saying well showing up you know what's that old quote 80% of success is just showing up and you know and people realize well yeah like if I guess if you give up that almost guarantees failure if you give up and they looked around and they said well 50% of solders quit the army during the selection process 50% of marriages end in divorce 25% of students drop out of high school sales jobs 50% of people will turn over every every year in sales jobs and um they noticed that like uh there were there what's the Counterpoint the Counterpoint is basically what they looked at was West Point and I don't know if you know much about the school West Point but it's got a pretty like uh pretty high bar right it's like being a guest on this podcast it's a high bar and so what they do is say to get into West Point you don't apply when you're a senior in high school you apply when you're a junior you apply in 11th grade and you don't just apply with your test scores and whatnot you have to be nominated by a member of Congress to get into West Point so you have to hustle your way to get a congress member to vouch for you in order to do this you have to do a leadership interview you have to do a fitness test and out of 14,000 applicants they'll select like a thousand people to come join this thing and even after they filter with all that like you have to run through walls to get here 20% Dropout during the one the the seven-week orientation period that's called the beast is West Point free I don't think so so you got to pay money to do all this and then go to the Army like all the best things in life all right all right the Beast is a rotation of calisthenics marching classes weapons training Athletics you go 5:00 a.m. to 10: p.m. with no breaks no weekends no contact with family or friends and you have to be subscribed to this YouTube channel in order to get in and so even if you're not going to do all the other things you should go to YouTube right now my first million and you should subscribe to our podcast all right so basically grit was a higher predictor with this grit score they said was a higher predictor of West Point success than your SAT score then your high school rank then the leadership interview then all the other things and so anyways I thought here's the grit test I I can even just give it to you so here's some of the questions they ask on this thing it says new ideas and projects sometimes distract me from previous ones basically do you get distracted by new ideas and projects from your current one uh do that very much like me mostly like me somewhat like me or not like me that's guess what it's very much like me okay another one setbacks don't discourage me I don't give up easily okay that I scored well on that one I set a goal but later choose to pursue a different one I am a hard worker like come on this is not science this is this is what I call nothing that's what this test is this no there's some stuff here I finish whatever I begin so for example bro do you trust people's self assessment of this no here do you have any uh unfinished Lego sets in your home I don't even have a Lego set no but I would if I did I would I got a box of un unset up Furniture right over here I have a half half written book over there yes of course yes I I do fail this test and so you but the thing is I can think of 10 examples where I'm not like that I can think of 10 examples where I am like that this is you know what I'm low in grit I'm high in honesty and to somebody who's like I'm really high on the grit score I'm like is this real like is this is this honest is this an honest assessment I think your butt hurt I think that you got I think change comes from within brother I think that you Gotta Be You gota the stages I'm in denial right now I'm bargaining yeah is there like grits Anonymous you need to like go and go through the the 12 steps my friend you're you're in Step number one if there's anyone else out there what's the opposite of grit by the way just like cream cheese soft the word the marshmallow scale um so yeah well you know what I want you to take this uh test actually just take it right now let's take it together let's see what your grit score is all right uh new questions okay here we go all right I'm gonna give you the grit the grit test okay Sam you have to just say uh true or false basically yeah very true very false so new ideas and projects sometimes distract me from previous ones false false all right very false would you say not much like me false all right not much like me setbacks don't don't discourage me I don't give up easily is that very much like you you don't give up easily or not I don't give up I don't give up easily uh yeah I often set a goal but later choose to pursue a different one mostly like me I am a hard worker somewhat I have difficulty maintaining my focus on projects that take me more than a few months to complete that's not much like me I finish whatever I begin very much my interests change from year to year not much I am diligent I never give up somewhat I have been obsessed with a certain idea or project for a short period of time and later lost interest somewhat I have overcome setbacks to conquer an important challenge not much like me I I've not had that many setbacks like I'm just so good it just works I just try easy stuff wow all right that's a grit score of 3.5 correct okay so you got a 3.5 okay so I had it wrong the scale to five you're a 3.5 out of five you scored higher than 40% of Americans what does that mean I'm in the 60th percentile no you're in the 40th percent right I don't [ __ ] know I'm between 40 and 60% so I'm not that good you're like above average yeah no wait you scort higher than only 40% so you're actually average to below average grit yeah that sucks this St is stupid it would have been a lot better if I was a four or something yeah the segment needed you to be amazing and me to be terrible inste you're pretty average and I'm way below average so anyways go back take your grit score you just go to you just SE Google search grit score and uh take this thing and then post it in the comments on YouTube I want to know who is the grittiest YouTube commenter of them all it's probably the spammers that never go away that keep impersonating us and being like to everybody who comments they're like Dy that's not us we're not telling you we're not trying to sell you something like that that if we try to sell you something you'll know it trust me that's not the way we would do it I want to tell you about someone who would score a five out of five on the grid score can I tell you about this person tell me do you remember a few years ago in 16 or 17 I think there was this company called lunch Club it was basically like the social platform where you I guess meet up with people for lunch I thought it was really Dum I used to do that I used when I moved to San Francisco that's how I made friends I I joined the lunch club and I would go get lunch with stranger Tech Bros I thought that that was a stupid idea I thought it was very stupid I'd never used it but not I I was alone on that one I think that like when you didn't have setbacks you're like I always have friends and I never have setbacks yeah I scored low on this one as well uh but here's the thing not everyone else thought it was a dumb idea in fact they raised $30 million from adri and Horwitz and all these like really smart people and I don't think it ever became that big of a company but they raised $30 million at $100 million valuation have no idea what happened to it today uh because it's not really relevant anymore however the guy who started it is amazing and this is just proof that smart people sometimes do like they've got silly things that are just stepping stones until the real thing and so the guy who started it his name is Scott woo and recently I think yesterday it was he launched something that's pretty amazing and we're going to do another episode where we talk in depth about what he launched but basically what it is is it's called cognition labs that's the name of the company the product is called Devon the summary of it is you just tell Devon make me a website that looks like Yelp except it's just for uh agencies or something or make me a website that's like Airbnb but for cars and what Devon does is it gives you a checklist of all the things it's going to do and then it does it and it builds the website for you and this is like gamechanging technology because it basically makes coders obsolete it's an AI software engineer or programmer yes and many really smart people Patrick cison the CEO of stripe they're basically saying all right this is the first time I've ever seen anything like this actually be as good or better than a human and it's amazing whatever the product's awesome we're going to talk all about it but what's more interesting to me is Bloomberg did this article on the three it's basically three co-founders and then they have uh the main CEO his brother also works there they did this amazing profile on the 10 person company that created this and they are magnif everything about these guys are beautiful the Magnificent 10 should we call them yes the Magnificent 10 everything about this company is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life so check this out it's 10 employees they've raised $21 million amongst the 10 employees they have 10 gold medals uh that they've won from Top coding competitions and many of the people on Twitter when they when they came out with this they go I remembered Scott Scott was the guy who was winning all of the math competitions that I used to go to as I sat in the crowd wondering how on Earth this guy did this and this one guy named by by fan his name he tweeted out this thing he goes I want to show you all some tiger mom porn and it's basically and it's basically this young guy I get judging off his name I guess Scott woo I guess he's Chinese he there's this video of him when he's uh like 12 or 13 years old and he's had a math competition Sam we gotta do this we got to do this test sorry put I have the thing here's the question the question says if the pattern continues what is the letter in the 2010th position and it just says mathl mathlete mathlete mathlete and and it says dot dot dot what letter will be the 2010th letter in this sequence and he goes a dude you know how you know how like in Jeopardy how by the way he looks like he's like 12 years old in this video by the way like a child he's a kid and then you know how in Jeopardy they show you the question uh as the reading it so you could read along with it he answers one of the questions where it's like what's like uh 352 to the 4th power times like this other 384 to the eth power he answered the question before the announcer finished reading it like he literally hit the beat all right so same the digits 1 two 3 four and five can be arranged to form many five-digit positive integers with five distinct digits and how many such integers is the digit one to the left of the digit two two such integers include 14,3 52 and 51234 go ahead just walk me through your thought process here I feel like an integer is like an Advertiser I ordered last night with a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top sounds like an influencer mom on Instagram like coming up with a cool name for their baby there like we have Bronx and integer they're going to math today like it sounds like a an amazing roller coaster ride at Six Flags I don't know what an integer is I can't even answer this question but these guys were crushing it at these at these at these questions and there's three of them and so listen to the third listen to this segment from the article so this guy named Ashley Vance he's the one I think he wrote um he wrote uh the uh the biography of Elon Musk he he wrote this article and he goes the third co-founder he's currently the CPO he asked me that I not explicitly say what his current status is his enrollment status at Harvard is because he doesn't want his parents to fully understand what he's done basically the CPO the the co-founder of this company now is worth hundreds of millions of dollars has yet to tell his mother that he's dropped out of Harvard even though he's now worth tens of millions of dollars because he's too afraid to break her heart and in the article the author the author goes I just want to let you know uh you've raised a wonderful son and this can work out wonderfully it's okay if he's may or may not be enrolled in Harvard anymore and this article it's the greatest thing I've seen I just Googled the guy's name Scott woo and the top it is a Reddit post from 18 hours ago in the subreddit r/ next [ __ ] level which is an amazing subreddit by the way I go to there I go there all the time it's just next level [ __ ] and it goes here's Scott woo the CEO of cognition labs in a math quiz 14 years ago it's a clip this thing has 5,000 up votes and the first first reply is if anyone's wondering here's the tricks that they used here you know for question three the standard permutations of 54321 blah blah blah and then the top comment of that is it took me longer to read your explanation than it took him to actually do it and answer the question it's ridiculous parentheses I just said read not even understand what you just said so anyway these guys are ridiculous uh and what's it's just amazing that a there's young people that are like self- Gathering into like this is like to me like truly like that Facebook [ __ ] like that movie of Facebook when they're just in the dorm room doing it these guys are doing it right now they range between ages 20 and 27 it was so inspiring to read about these guys and I'm so happy that freaks like these guys exist uh it was it was an awesome article about this company the company I'm sure it's great the story behind these guys is even better this is like the American dream to me yeah I don't know if it's the American dream or like the robot dream or like the math wet dream I don't know what this what dream this is but it's it's the Chinese mother it's the Chinese mother Chinese tiger mom dream for sure um except for the dropping out part exact yeah they go you know it's not too late son you can still go back that's what they'll say after this article Harvard should launch a tiger extension school which is you get to remain a student or you get to graduate it's dropping out by graduating early because we're like you're you're done here your mom will be fine we just get 0.1% equity in your company thank you and and all they have to do and we get 0.1% and what you get son is you get a photo of you wearing that gown and we're going to go get one of our our our teachers to shake your hand on on we have this guy Charles he'll shake your hand he looks like the dean and uh we have a green screen here it'll look like you graduated and your mom it'll make your parents proud this is the Harvard version of a fake ID of some guy running a scam um anyway I wanted to bring that up I thought these guys are amazing um what do you got you have a thrill of a shill right right now don't you oh I have something cool I'm doing okay so this is not really a shill it's just a it's just a thrill to be honest with you this is actually costing me a lot of money it is not making me any money so um I have an idea which is wouldn't it be amazing if you like this podcast you like listening to us maybe Sam you were at a Meetup last night that's cool people got to meet you would anybody like to text with me because I got a number that you could text and if you text me I'll text you back um and so what I'm going to do is I create a number so all you got to do is just text me you just go 650 334 0790 I think we got to work on that number uh but if we do that 65033 4079 I'm just going to send out texts of stuff that we're doing uh that's cool I'm going to share like you know stuff that's on my whiteboard throughout the day like just random stuff that I think is interesting or let's say the main thing I wanted to do the the re reason we had this idea was after every podcast you don't know this after every podcast um Ben Le is usually not listening on the on the recordings but he was usually like really curious like oh oh yeah you guys had Gary von like what did he say but he's he doesn't want the full hourong podcast he's like can you send me like a voice note of like the two or three most interesting bits and so I do that and I've been doing that for like three months now where after every episode I'm like oh yeah me and Sam talked about that uh that company co uh uh that's doing the AI software engineer and how that dude the founder actually is like the mass genius and I also shared like Myers Briggs does 20 million a year and how it was how it's kind of [ __ ] we did that and I'll just give him a two-minute voice note of the thing and and so he loves it he's like dude this he's been telling me for months this needs to be like a thing but we didn't know how to do it and so everything we looked into was like you could try to create a giant telegram group but not everybody uses telegram I like dude I just want to like just the way I get it where I just you just text me this as a voice note or as a photo that's what I want what did you use so um we're using this this app that will let you do it it's really expensive and so I kind of just want to limit this and so maybe I don't know exactly what the limit is I'm thinking just like the first thousand people I'm going to cut it off because like this is going to cost me tens of thousands dollars a month to do this but I think it's going to be great um so the number is 650 334 079 that's right I'll put it in the show in the description so you can just tap it and send a text you just have to say hi you just have to say hi to the thing it'll ask you your name and then I then it so then it shows me so when you reply to me I can see oh it's Jeff from you know Cincinnati or whatever it is I could see who it is and I can I can reply back and so gonna try this out I want to try it with a thousand fans I'm looking for don't do it if you're just like super casual with it like if this is your first time listening to this episode don't don't bother but like if you're like all about MFM uh and you've been listening to this for years and you know you're cool do this that's so funny this cost me a lot of money so please only do it if you really care about only like a thousand people do this uh I don't really want more than that to do this because it's quite expensive but you know whatever leave it to me to cut it off at a certain point tell me about your friend walking back you have on here walking backwards and speed running is it speedr running just sprinting no so so uh we did a pod with Gary ve yesterday and it's not going to come out for a couple of months two months I think it's going to come out when his book comes out or whatever but he said something very interesting I don't know if this stood out to you but you had asked him a great question you go Gary you started with like um like family business mom and pop or actually before that you were just flipping you know baseball cards as a teen then you joined your family business and was like a a family shop and then as you started to grow your brand now like you have all these business owners who listen to you but also your brand has grown so so much you now get to you know rub shoulders is it rub should elbows I don't know what people rub you rub against you're rubbing you're rubbing chest to chest with a bunch of billionaires and you were like what I want to know is have you observed any difference between the guys who end up guys and gals who end up making it to the to the highest tier of the the of winning in business the billion dollar Club let's say versus the the small business owner the convenience store owner versus the the the solar preneur whatever what do you notice in the is is the biggest difference he instantly answered something that I thought was not what I would have expected he goes the willingness to walk backwards we like what what do you mean and he said it and kind he didn't fully explain it but he explained two things he goes number one the great ones always reinvent themselves uh you know uh you could look at Elon Musk Elon Musk starts out doing zip 2 and he he then he creates PayPal and he's like he's like this the internet entrepreneur and then after that he was willing to walk backwards and go back to zero and he was basically like cool I'm going to now try Hardware which is a completely different game it would have been easier for him to just stay with PayPal keep growing that or do another software company internet company but he was willing to walk backwards and so he started a a rocket company something he didn't know anything about at the time but he's like I'm gonna start from zero today I can't tell you how to build a rocket and then fast forward to today he's got self Landing rockets that can go up and come back and land on themselves right it's kind of amazing he was also willing to walk backwards financially so he invested everything that he made from zip 2 and PayPal into Tesla and SpaceX to the point where it would have gone to zero if those companies had failed which they almost did so the willingness to walk backwards both in terms of um where you're at in the mountain can you go back to being a beginner and the second thing is can you go back can you are you willing to risk it Gary told us that his he has a safety net you were like I have a safety net some amount of money that I just don't touch if everything else goes to zero I always got that he's like me too and you're like how much is it and he I don't what did you expect that he would say and what did he say I expected I mean he seems pretty wealthy I expected 10 or 20 he said 1 million so he said $1 million he said a safety net was $1 million which if I had to guess that would cover his life expenses for like less than six months right as current lifestyle yeah exactly it's like safety net that's a that's a safety floss my friend that's a thin thread you're going to land on there uh obviously it's a lot of money in the grand scheme of things but like relative to his level of success and wealth that's a lot less than I would have expected but he's like that's all I need and he's like that's all I needed safety I'm willing to roll everything else and I thought that was very fascinating then I've seen so I thought that was cool and uh nval has said a very similar thing he goes one of the hardest things to do is you start to climb the mountain and when you're in your 20s you don't you know you don't know anything so you just start going up the whatever the trail that you see is and you start going up and the problem is let's say say your ambition your dream is to get to the top of the mountain but halfway up you learn that the trail you're on is not the path that gets you there and so what do you do he's like the reality is that most people you're now 33 years old you've realized that the path you're currently on is not the lifestyle or the path that you want but it is very hard to say I'm GNA walk back to the bottom of the mountain and pick a different path and what most people do is they just settle they say I guess like I guess I don't need to get to the top I'll just this is high enough and um they're not saying it because they actually want that they're saying it because the thought of starting over is so hard mentally but the great musicians the great actors the great entrepreneurs the great scientists they reinvent themselves they go into new Fields new new studies new beginnings and they start again and so I find that pretty inspiring that and I've seen that so many times in the people of my life that people who aren't willing to walk backwards aren't willing to go back to being a beginner again um it's really tough I've met met multiple people who have started something and sold it and then went back to went back to college daresh being one of them that he started HubSpot in college after he already made say the name say the name you want to say say the name you're dying to say Brett Adcock did the same thing um our friend sea did the same thing um that's right and it was hard at the time when your whole friend group is doing one thing when your own success does one I mean I've even felt it in the smallest ways this podcast is does pretty well I know that if I come on here we're going to put out some content a lot of people going to consume it the thought of doing Tik Tok which a I didn't even know how to edit a Tik Tok B I'm not like good at that style of content C I got zero followers over there but I was like all right well like I need to be somebody who can go back to the beginning so Tik Tok is like you're Tesla exactly now you get it and I'm just like Eli so so what about these guys then the then there's the opposite speedrunner so I'm going to tell you about uh I saw this story and I want to tell you about three friends so the story I saw was that the founder of RX bar speedr running is such a better term for sprinting for running yeah so speedr running what is speedrunning speed running is the opposite speedr running is where you don't go back to that beginner's mind you don't go back to the bottom of mountain you literally hike the same Trail again and now you know that trail so well you can do it so much faster they do it faster faster it's a video gaming term I don't know if you've seen it but like there's people that they don't play the new game they don't buy the new the new the new uh you know the next the next edition of whatever fortnite or whatever they play Mario that was released in whatever 1985 they play the first level and they play it over and over and over again to where they can flawlessly Sprint through the level hopping on all the Goomba's heads and they could finish the level perfectly in like 32 seconds and that is like the actual fastest that a human being could do this and they do it and they're they're called speedrunners and people love to watch them because you're watching absolute mastery over something that you know has been around for a while that they can just keep replaying until they absolutely Master it like that jro guy who just like packed sushi for like 50 years and like didn't change right right exactly he's not trying to make the new [ __ ] he's like spicy tuna roll this is what we're going to do and so I've noticed that I have friends that are the beginners and I have friends that are the speedrunners so let me tell you about uh the speedrunners so first I noticed that the RX bar founder who built RX bar ended up selling it for $0000 million came out with a new bar and it's called the David bar did you see this no but that that must mean that it's not compete ended like right then yeah yeah exactly he sold his company in 2017 and so now it's um you know whatever yeah I don't know how how many years what I don't know what year it is it's been eight years or something like that it's uh he could start a new bar so he started this thing called the David bar it's just like epic protein bar that he's doing David protein.com looks sick by the way looks awwesome looks sick sick name and the macros are also pretty insane like look just look at the macros do you see it on there no uh 160 calories 28 gram of protein sugar-free that's amazing pretty I'm in yeah I'm in so I want to tell you a couple things about this before we finish actually I'll finish the speed running point and I'll want tell you some RX bar story so anyways speedr running we have three friends I think you know I think you know at least two of the three people I can't say their names but let's just call them e-commerce friend number one two and three e-commerce friend number one sold their first e-com sold a e-commerce company so the company let's let's say won the first time they played the level uh for hundreds of millions of dollars almost $500 million and then they decide they're going to start a new company do they go into AI do they create a space company a satellite company no they're like I'm going to start another e-commerce company in almost the same Niche and I'm going to do it again I'm going to speedrun the same level because the first time I was an idiot I didn't know what I was doing I figured it out along the way now I figured all this knowledge out why not just do it again and so they they say they're going to start a new company they are talking to somebody and that and they go yeah I think if I they go I think if actually they weren't even planning to do it they go I think if I started one today I could hit a million dollars a month in Revenue in three months and the other person goes no way no chance dude [ __ ] like you think that but that's not true challenge accepted only for that reason this person starts a new company and and how big are they now month two hit a million dollars a month in Revenue you know they're they're you know a couple months in and you know they're going to do probably two to three million doll this month in revenue and it's less than six months old can you can't can you even say the category nothing I can't say a word I might even I might get shot just for saying what I said already so so that's the first and who's who's person two person two e-commerce person two sold another company also for nine figures nine figures means $100 million or more doing literally the same company again doing the same company in the same category obviously there's like a you know 10% twist but like back to e-commerce back to the same category back to the same Playbook how big are they now doing phenomenal again right off the bat I don't have all their exact Revenue numbers but I know it's like tracking faster than it was the first time friend number three friend number three was friends with person one and two saw them run the levels helped them a little bit along the way and then friend number three had an experience that triggered them also a little chip on the shoulder moment so they were invited by a very successful company to come to their annual like come check out the office come to our annual Retreat and they go and they are watch they they go through the office they like wow this is really impressive they go to the annual like company uh conference or something like that and they're like wow this is really impressive but the problem was that the the people invited them you know there's like a good faith way to invite someone which is like hey check this out you'll really like you'll enjoy it I'd love to show you what we're doing blah blah blah and then there's hey you want to see my car collection and that's what was going on it was you want to can I brag to you real quick and they were arrogant they were incredibly arrogant the whole time and my friend told me they said friend number three told me they go you know that scene in um The Big Short where these Bankers are are talking about how they're giving loans and they don't have to do any uh they like don't have to do much much of a a credit check and they they're able to about giving strippers like five houses yeah exactly and they then the guy the main character's like why are they um why are they uh confessing and then this friend goes they're not confessing they're bragging and he he goes he's like short this like we need to short mortgage back whatever my friend says same feeling walked out I just like why are they why are they bragging about all this and it's like and he's just got turned off he's like okay you showed me you showed me exactly how big this Market is you showed me exact how lucrative this is you show me how arrogant you are you show me how bloated your company is I will come out with a lean mean fighting machine doing the same thing that company gives him 10 million plus in profit a year personally just 10 million in profit in your bank account every year um and this is less than five years raise no capit raise no external Capital all that stuff right amazing amazing story and when I was talking to this person I was like I was talking to one of the friends and I said this is amazing number one but it's also kind of lame and they're like what do you mean and I was like you're playing the same level of the game again like yeah you're so talented like you could do anything and like it's fun to win and I get that but it's also fun to grow and like I feel like you opted into fun to win with no growth but you're so talented that you could get the growth and win that was like kind of my argument but I might also just be that they're like cool my broker friend thank you for the advice you know like and so I wanted to get your take are you a walk backwards guy or are you a speedrunner Guy where do you land in the philosophy of this and I'm curious actually for all the listeners I really want to know because both ways can win but there's like a almost like a political opinion on this I have a political opinion and a belief that walking backwards is the is the way it's the right way to to do it your life not the speedrun the same level again for years I thought you owe it if you have talent you owe it to the world to like almost be a steward of that Talent like you you owe it to the rest of us because you're so special to exploit your ability to the max now that I'm a little bit older and I have a family I think [ __ ] everyone do what makes you happy uh like make your kids proud of you and like just whatever you think is exciting and fun do that you don't owe anyone anything so not explore exploit basically like you're not uh don't wander out just Harvest what I what I think is if it if you so like for example I'll name drop him again Brett adock I was like Brett why are you doing all this complicated [ __ ] you don't have to and he's like I just think this needs to get done and I should do it I love that attitude I also love the attitude of well I'm just gonna do the same thing over and over again because I get joy out of it and this is awesome and I just love it I think that is also a total win I think both are wins and I don't think that you owe it to the world to do anything unless you choose to owe it to the world so let's say we're not telling other people what they should do what do you how do where do you land on that let's say you could have started another newsletter right after the hustle but it's not like I'm starting like huge like world I'm just starting things new things I'm doing new things because I do I have a chip on my shoulder to prove myself in multiple Industries or multiple business models but I don't want to risk everything and I'm not willing to isn't that so funny it's like prove yourself to who who car is there anyone Sam's successful but only in one industry not give him respect until he lands industry too like nobody has ever even had that thought besides you like oh you don't know anything about Ecom bro uh um so for me personally I would say that I I don't feel like I owe I don't owe it to the world to explore and I don't owe it to someone who's less talented not that I'm partic I mean I think I'm mildly talented but when I see someone who's really talented I'm like you owe it to me because you were gifted this well let me ask you this would you run it back let's say you were the RX bar guy would you run it back and do another bar company so I think when I run back newsletters no cuz that bores me uh the RX bar I think it's pretty dope I think it was great for the world uh I think that so yeah if I'm if I'm him I would and there was actually an article written about him how he was retired and he was bored and he had nothing to do and they had a picture of him but they made this photo the article of the of him really great where it was him by himself on a lawn chair like in front of his mansion and he was lonely and they talked about like you know what I'm talking about that famous article that that was caption Rock Bottom a recliner in front of a mansion well and it was like in the middle of the day and he was just like by himself and the whole article was like he's looking for his next thing and so for someone like that I'm like just do it again man that was exciting that was cool I think that's awesome and I think RS so if I'm David uh would I redo it yeah I think I would by I don't even know if his name is David um the I think his name is Peter so by the way the RX bar story so he's obsessed with Crossfit do you know do you know this story or no no so he's obsessed with Crossfit he's like they don't sell any snacks that are like paleo um at the time this is 20 13 and he goes to his dad and this is the best part this is the whole reason I only wanted to tell the story just to drop this one line he goes to his dad he's like Dad do you know any investors I want to start this like bar company his dad literally says you need to shut the [ __ ] up and go sell some bars if you want to start a bar company he told him you need to show the V up and go sell a thousand bars and so he's like okay um and so he's like and he talks about like you know he was in school he was not very good at school and he's like you know so when I um when I was failing with this business I was comfortable I was used to eating [ __ ] I had been a failure it was not foreign to me I had been a failure already at school so oh okay great I'm bad at that I'm bad at this he's like I just kept going I didn't like doubt myself I didn't like second guess it because I was like so comfortable in that like the the failure mode that every company starts with um his first first business was in high school selling weed by the way um all right let's see the next one so his next thing was like he's like I um I thought raising money would solve my problems but actually it was such a blessing that they didn't raise any money so they sold for 600 million I don't think they raised any money they bootstrapped the whole way and he's like it was so good that because we were so forced on the one important thing selling the bars that was the only way to continue the business and so he's like we would just sell I would email I would call I would give bars out on consignment we would do anything to try just try to sell more bars so in the first nine months they did 600k then the first in the first year they did 2 million year two 6 million uh year three I think they did 36 million wow and year four they did 161 million and then they sold to Kellogg for 600 million at that point wow and then there's there's there's an article that's amazing there's an article making fun of the article I referenced it says Michigan company pays guy $600 million but he's kind of bored now uh this guy is awesome the article was called what happens when you become a millionaire over that second headline that's amazing uh it was just like a shitty radio a local radio station because I guess David or

you want to start with up dog I might well thought I might catch a sleep in there uh that's you should have just gave it to me that's way below you you should have just gave it to me um all right before we start I want to dedicate this podcast Sean oh to two groups of people because I've I had runin with the these two groups of people and I've taken for granted how special these two group groups of people are the first one people who start businesses and are English speaking as are uh not native English speakers it's insane I like have hug I hug out recently with a few friends that uh you know are entrepreneurs and they don't speak English natively that's so impressive I take it for granted so much until I've got to communicate someone of a different language that's amazing so I want to dedicate this pod to that the second group of people people who start businesses and they're not wealthy and they're just starting their businesses trying to make their dreams come true while they have newborns or little kids how impressive is that like I didn't take I I kind of took that for granted my parents did that when I was younger I don't realize now now that I have a kid I realize how scary that is so I want to dedicate this podcast to those two groups of people wow good guy points okay I like it um dedication acceptance shout out to shout out to all those groups um I have a few interesting things to share with you today do you have a few interesting things or or what I have two things you're going to like what do you got I'm GNA take you on a journey so Sam Buckle up because I got a little something for you I'm GNA tell you about a journey I went down and the journey starts with a tweet I saw that was very interesting you know Bitcoin hit an all-time high price AI taken off my I wasn't I'm not interested what I was interested in is a picture of a guy holding a giant avocado and I was like what is this and he says here what he said he goes these are the best avocados I've ever had they were grown by my 93-year-old Japanese neighbor I have had used Google Translate to talk to her about the variety and she thinks it might be uh one that just grew from this this specific seed if that's true this could be a new Landmark variety the H avocado was discovered in similar fashion and is now the most popular avocado in the world this avocado that I found cannot be propagated with normal methods uh it doesn't take well to air layering I don't know what this means he says so I'm going to have to start with the seed I'm going have to grow it out the tree I'm going have to cut it from the mature tree graft it onto its own seed I don't even know what any of this means but then he's like and then I'm going to try to recreate this avocado it will probably be a three-year experiment wish me luck and so I saw this and I've what a noble Quest I said you're like what do this avocado teach me about life no what has life led me to to make my life about this avocado because I am so fully invested in this three-year Journey about this guy who's going to try to grow a better avocado and it led me down a rabbit hole about him and about the avocado so the guy is this guy named Kevin Espiritu do you know this guy he's calls himself the plant Daddy on Twitter No but I'm in you don't know this guy I think you do when I just started describing people so he's got a pretty amazing story and I'm gonna first tell you his story then I'm gonna come back to the avocado we're gonna Tarantino this a little bit all right so this guy basically he used to work at scribe the like book in a box company that they help you produce books so he's working at scribe he's like an early employee there and on the side he um used to have hobbies of like video games and online poker and he was just playing Non-Stop and so to get away from kind of his online addiction he's like you know what I'm going to start gardening like him and his brother they're this is the quote in the article they go hey let's go hit up a nursery they go to a plant nursery and they are like all right we don't know anything about gardening but like we want to do something we want to do something away from a computer outside with our hands and they go buy a bunch of stuff and they're trying to figure it out they go online they're looking up blogs to learn and along the way he starts blogging his journey and so he's at scribe and he his little blog starts getting you know a little bit of traffic because he's posting his experiments he's very relatable because he's an absolute Nob beginner and so people who are Googling are also absolute new beginners and they start to like this and eventually he's like you know what I'm gonna quit my job at the time the blog is making I don't know 167,000 a year so roughly two two-ish grand a month a little bit more than that right so or a little less than two grand a month sorry so he's uh he quits his job and he's like I'm going to go all in on this thing and at the time he's all about this one type of gardening called hydroponic garden is that like where the the plant is like raised is that yeah it's like not in the soil and like in water something like that I said exactly I have no idea all right so he's he creates R hydro which is like a Reddit community so he starts just building a community around other people who are interested in the same type of thing he's doing along the way he's like oh dude I think this hydroponic thing is a little too Niche he rebrands it into something called epic gardening epic gardening today is huge is dude I'm on the website and I'm looking at his social numbers holy crap he's got like 2 million on Tik Tok 2 million on YouTube a million people here his Twitter pops off so he's done really really well with this epic gardening content he's just a dude in the baseball cap super like relatable when you watch his videos he's like he's just very likable guy he's got the gift um that you need when you're going to do this type of content and so he keeps going and he basically for 10 years essentially bootstraps this company so it starts with like a $10 domain pays five bucks for hosting and he was like all right I'm going to try to get this thing his goal was I'm going to try to get to three grand a month because three grand a month means I can live off of this like blog Revenue he quit his job and in the first year he does it he hits actually five grand a month so he even surpasses his his one-year goal and he just keeps going so first year 60k second year like aund something K third year 250k fourth year 7 million fifth year you know it just keeps growing today this business does over 30 million a year no way are you kidding me and he just raised a huge amount of money from churnin the same guys who backed we talked about eer bar stool others they have this content to Commerce idea and they're like this guy in the gardening Niche is gonna be able to do big things and and he had already kind of proven it so what he did was he was doing pretty well with the content and he was just like learning so he's like dude I've been on YouTube for so long you know since you know basically 10 years now on YouTube he's just keep evolving with whatever the new metag game is of YouTube and what ends up happening is that in 2020 [ __ ] takes off during Co So Co was the big like inflection point that like really took this from moderately successful to very successful two things happened Co first where his Channel all of a sudden he said he started adding like 15,000 subscribers a day because the same thing he had when he was like oh dude I'm just so sick of being inside on my computer I want to get outside do some gardening the whole world basically felt that when covid hit and so a lot of people got interested in this and then he's like cool all my money up till that point was ads and Affiliates right so just like YouTube AdSense YouTube ad revenue and then you know affiliate links to products and finally he's like was he doing 30 million that way 30 million ads no no way less than that he was doing like you know less than a million doing that but then he decides all right I'm gonna launch a product and he's like I'm going to create a gardening product so he Imports a product from Australia and immediately it works and so he's like oh this this is kind of a good idea and he starts to uh sell that product and you know the beautiful thing about these Creator businesses right we've talked about Mr Beast we've talked about Logan Paul with prime Mr Beast with febles you know the the mass creators what they do is they take a mass Market product like you know Gatorade or chocolate and they're like cool we'll sell this commodity product using our branding and we'll use our branding to get into retail well for like the medium like the the mid- tier creators like this guy or you know like us for example you have to actually create a niche product that's going to be higher ticket higher value um and you're going to use your audience to do it and so what's cool about this is you create something that's called negative CAC so what does negative CAC means every business otherwise has a sales and marketing talk dirty to me baby I love negative CAC keep going CAC which is customer acquisition cost is the amount of money you have to spend in marketing or sales to get a customer and for most businesses this is maybe 20% 30% 40% 50% for some companies it's 80% of their revenues are just how much it costs to go market to to to acquire a customer with a media business like this what ends up happening is you get Negative CA meaning he gets paid one to2 million doar a year for his YouTube stuff for his content right his blog and his YouTube stuff he's making money on that and that's his customer acquisition channel so it's like kind of an unfair Advantage this is what the chin guys are really smart about doing shout out to Mike CNS over at Turnin where they recognized they identified that hey some of these creators have high trust they have high Authority in a niche and they actually have a business model where instead of spending 30 or 40% of your revenue on acquiring customers you actually negative CAC it's actually you have not only zero it's better than zero you actually have a profitable Media company that is being used to acquire these customers and that's the beauty of it and so then he jumped and he was went from making you know let's say a million bucks a year to 7 million 7 million to 20 million and then now he's over 30 million a year in in revenue and the other cool thing is he's bolted on some Acquisitions all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using HubSpot landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much Revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM hold on what's he selling he's got like a seed product um so they like some tray seed crap I don't know I don't I don't know anything about this it's called Botanical seeds um and he bought that company actually that's not the one he started he bought that because they had retail distributions they were in like four or five thousand stores so he's like cool let me buy this because I know that my audience will help grow this right this is what I did with Shephard too right it's like let me buy this company that I is already a good business knowing that my audience will acquire a bunch of customers for it and like that's what happened with shepher we basically tripled the business using this strategy he's doing the same thing in the gardening Niche and so he bought this seed business and then he bought this like house plant business um which is actually a cool story so he's like he gets into he's like during Co everybody wanted like house plants I think you guys talked about this with Trends too like the dud we were we talked about this a year and a half I think before the pandemic about uh like suul succulents or like people are wanting to buy succulents online and there's not a lot of options you were totally right you were ahead of trend what he did was he was like cool um should I start creating this content and he realized a very like you know in the in the uh the growth of any entrepreneur eventually you start to realize that hey sometimes it's actually easier to buy than build and so what he did was like well I could try to create all these articles rank for them in SEO or he found this website that was called like you know yourhouse plant.com and he's like this actually has like good content and it's good SEO they just don't have any business around it and so he's like I think I could make this product a lot better but I could like get this off a head start so he he does a who is lookup and it's some Indian VC owns this as a side project he buys it for $1,000 and then immediately like month one he's making more than ,000 do off this thing and then grows that property and so he's done this a few times and he raised money from Chan to be able to go do more of these and so I think this guy is amazing I've asked him so many times to invest because I'm like dude this is you are gonna win and you're gonna win in such a big way it's G to shock people like I think as I'm saying it now it sounds like pretty cool pretty obvious and as his growth happens but like 10 years ago so so non-obvious even four or five years go even when Co started to get more popular it's like okay cool you're a YouTuber okay cool you're a YouTuber with the Ecom shop it's like no no no you are going to be the most trusted influencer in the gardening Niche and the gardening Niche you know look at how much there's full retail brick and mortar stores that are selling fertilizer and different things like that like he can take this huge if he does this right and now it's just GNA be a question of how fast his kind of Business Development Can Can level up with the content skills he already has and he's got the look I'm looking at his Instagram he's wearing flannel he's got a nice smile like he's got it's he's basically like a uh what's the what's it called chip and Joanna uh yeah Gaines yeah the G yeah he's got that type of vibe where I look at him and I'm like you're relatable I trust you you're somehow a little bit aspirational a little bit that sounded like an insult I didn't mean I didn't mean for it to sound like that uh but this is awesome uh and dude these guys at churnin have done this so many times they did it with meater who we or was it meater who we talked about a few podcasts ago they did it with cars and& bid and Doug demorrow this is like when people say they're going to do this I often think it's like at a small scale these guys are doing it at multi multi multi-billion dollar scale uh it's really cool yeah exactly so I think this is this is amazing now let me Circle back to the avocado thing so he says I'm going to do this three-year avocado Mission and he says something about the hos avocado and so I go look it up I'm like where did this hos avocado come from learned a couple things number one it's not pronounced H it's h so we're all saying you're wrong that's the first thing I learned second thing do you know the story have you heard the story about the the has avocado no I why would no all right so basically avocados W avocados were absolutely not popular back in the day so nobody ate them they didn't taste very good not even like in Mexico no they were not they were just not a popular fruit there were these it was a green product it was not very uh popular it didn't taste very good and it had it wasn't even branded very well so some people called it avocados some people called them alligator pairs some people called them like in Mexico the called them the like I don't know how you pronounce the word but it was like the Spanish word like the native word for testicle like they just like yeah you want to go go eat a testicle and so nobody really liked this this fruit so enter Rudolph H Rudolph H basically is a mailman from Milwaukee he's now living in California and he decides he wants to plant an avocado tree so he goes and he buys some seeds and he tries to plant it but like you have to I guess do some grafting process or whatever to get thing to like take and it didn't work and so he's like ah didn't work whatever he thinks thinks about just cutting it down but he just doesn't get around to it or whatever so he just lets the tree grow and he lets it grow for like a year or two and then his kids like notice that there's fruit on it they PL they pluck it they open it up and the kids really like it this is how the story goes kids really like it he's like oh why you eating that that's that's not good and they're like no it's great he tries it he's like oh this is actually really good it's way creamier it's got like kind of a Nutty taste and there was way more space between the seed and the peel so it was like softer creamier and it was just more of the actual like filling and he's likew these are actually really good and so he starts eating it you know word starts to spread he goes and he partners with the local nursery and he's like hey can you help me grow more of this tree um because this tree is like bearing this amazing fruit and so the nursery is like cool yeah we'll we'll do more of this tree and we'll give you you know some royalty off this thing and then now as avocados are like 80% of worldwide avocado sales these trees are planted all around the world Mexico and China and everywhere like this is the dominant fruit and it's not even that old so he patented it in 1935 so we're talking Le avocados as we know it today are less than 100 years old so now here's a couple of interesting things I found from this so number one a lot of fruits are like this where they actually start kind of shitty they don't taste very good and then through a process of artificial selection so like not natural selection artificial selection you find the good tasting fruit and then it becomes the dominant species because that's the one everybody wants to eat I just didn't really think about that too much yeah like a like a banana like an old uh banana from 100 plus years ago tasted like a carrot they weren't as sweet and that's happened that's happened with a lot of our fruit it's gotten sweeter and sweeter and sweeter so they're like the honey Cris Apple uh there's like a cotton candy apple right now and a lot of like Health Advocates are like dude you shouldn't even eat modern fruit because it's like it's not exactly how it used to be and and the health benefits are are aren does have the same properties in it because it's a different thing uh optimized for taste so um couple couple more interesting facts number one this guy even though he said he got like a fruit patent which I was like what the hell is a fruit patent um he didn't make much money off the this thing I don't think he really had the patent I don't think he really benefited from it his son Charles came out and told the LA Times that even though he go my dad created the greatest avocado in the world and his total royalties lifetime are $4,800 less than $5,000 he made off off of uh of of discovering this and I I say discovering because he didn't invent this he didn't mean to do it um he didn't like M you know like manually try to create this he discovered it and even he says this he goes it was an act of God that I discovered this that this fruit and so um I found that interesting the third thing I found interesting is the marketing behind this so even though this thing tasted good it didn't take off right away and one of the reasons why is that an avocado doesn't look like most fruits so most fruits are colorful they look very appetizing like the reason they called it the alligator pair was because like the skin was basically like all wrinkly and like tough like like the way an avocado that we all know looks and so nobody wanted to eat it they were like this thing looks bad and so nobody would even try it and so the like fruit Association of California comes together and does probably what the greatest like greatest act of any committee ever they were like look couple things number one we can't keep calling this [ __ ] testicles and alligator pairs like we got to come up with one name that we like all right we're going with avocado everybody needs to call this the same thing so that this can spread in popularity the next thing that they that they did that was very very smart they were like cool uh why aren't people buying these they're like well because they look like they've gone bad right they're dark it's like black basically it looks like fruit that's gone bad so they're like all right new new marketing campaign we're g to put stickers on every one of these that says ripe tonight basically that this is the this is perfectly ripe it's ready to eat tonight and this is already true it's just that consumers don't understand this and so they put stickers on on every avocado and suddenly avocado St sale started to Boom because once you try it you like it but people weren't trying it because they they thought it had gone bad instead saying this is ripe ready to eat tonight that was the second thing that they did um and then the third thing was that they were like they needed to educate people that a green avocado was actually a bad avocado and that this was a good avocado and so they did all this marketing to make it work which you never really think about with fruit like you don't think about fruit marketing but everything around us is the product of some ad guy trying to boost sales and like once you realize that you can learn two things you can learn a lot about marketing and you can learn a lot about um you know what the products that you see are not as they appear you become a little more skeptical a little more jaded towards all products when you Iz that even avocados were basically like you know they were just someone's some drop shipper somewhere had a great idea dude we first of all this is awesome this is very interesting we should do an entire episode on fruit and marketing it's actually really interesting uh Planet Money have had a podcast on the honey crisp apple you know it's the most popular right you know before a lot of apples like that existed it was red delicious uh it's like kind of fascinating I met a guy who had done a venture back startup it was like raised a bunch of money was trying to grow business blows up and we check in with him we're like yo like what are you thinking for what's next and I think he's gonna say some AI crap some like crazy you know whatever some some big idea and he's like I'm I'm trying to invent a new fruit and I was like what and he's like yeah he's like you ever had a a mango yeah he goes you think you've had a mango wait till you try my mango like I'd love to try your mango send it to me he sent it to me and basically he was he was like he was basically like the shape of the fruit really matters so for example like the ease of eating so he had these like uh his mangoes were in like circular spheres basically like little balls and his little mango balls were ready to eat they were super juicy the texture was perfect and I was like wow this is genuinely an amazing mango experience thank you for this what's it called Well he kind of pivoted off the idea because he's like the logistics of it are so hard he's like to get fresh he's like it tastes really great when it's fresh he's like but just the logistics to get this like to customers is so hard I would have to go about this in this way this way this way so he pivoted off that idea in the end but and then you have I feel very fortunate that I got to try that mango and the crazy part is and this is like actually kind of like an interesting MO is that it takes 10 or 15 years to do because imagine if you're building a website and you could only make a change once a year to that website and see the results and be like ah [ __ ] that didn't work next year let's see because you have to you know you got to wait for it all to grow it takes a long time um and so we should do a whole thing right like you know I guess there's some rules around the patent so the rules that I read were basically like you if you want to do a fruit plat patent you can't um you basically like it has to reproduce asexually it has to be created by breeding or grafting it cannot be discovered if it's already in the wild it can't be patented like there's a bunch of rules like that so like you know the first fruit PL the first plant patent was this guy Henry who planted the the climbing ever blooming rose and like he created that Rose and he patented that plant and then he gets to benefit from that so I think when we do our fruit and plant episode I think we got to go find like the greatest fruit preneurs to ever live uh yeah we I I just looked him up on Twitter I have had some interactions with him you know what's funny about Twitter is these there's so many people like I remember I was talking to this woman named Shelby church and they're like YouTube celebrities they'll have five or 10 million subscribers on YouTube and you go to Twitter and they've got 10,000 followers and on Twitter just trying to learn like the rest of us to get business in insight and things like that this guy is not that popular on Twitter but he's got 10 million across all of his other socials we could just DM them and get them on here that's kind of cool yeah let's do it I would love that so I'm gonna uh show you something here so I made a video of Camp MFM that I want to I want to show so originally by the way this is my debut of of vlogging and you'll notice that the video is not a vlog why because your boy sucks at vlogging it's hard learned that it's really hard I learned that the hard way um he'd be like all right so I'll just get a shot of you um walking into the house and I'm like I just walk into the house he's like no no no you can't just walk in I was like what do you mean he like you got to say something and then you got to walk in kind of an interesting way I was like that I don't walk interesting or say I just walk in places there's no one here to talk to what am I supposed to say anyways didn't work out so well but we have a cool video we are playing for the Rolex oh God this is Camp MFM the once a year Retreat I host with Mr Beast where we get 20 entrepreneurs in 3 days is living in one house together where we play basketball play poker what the was that and just have a whole lot of fun and this year I asked my buddy max if he would come with us and record the whole thing always has to have a [Music] camera man there's a lot of good not as much good [ __ ] to the championship team has to do a cold Pune in the pond yeah there go down and Screen hey the the the buzzer went [Music] off really deep breaths [Applause] Ready set go [Music] [Applause] W straight to the top never going down don't superill had a great time and can't wait for next year all right so two things number one number one if you're just listening to the audio version you got to go to YouTu to see it we're not even going to put that in the audio version because it's not going to make sense so go to go to the YouTube video if you want to actually see the video Sam I have three questions for what do they search what do they search oh they search my first million or you can just search the greatest podcast of all time either one should show up if Google's doing their job right and you search my first million click on this episode and you'll see the video um here so Sam I have three questions for you number one how much fomo are you feeling right now knowing that you skipped this year's Camp MFM in fact we may need to not even name it Camp MFM just name it camp because you didn't skip it I could I had a newborn child I was committed to being with her for a certain period of time I didn't just skip it I couldn't go by way there was a hilarious moment when we were there everyone was like Dude where's Sam and I was like oh he can't come he uh he just had a baby and then everyone's like oh yeah yeah yeah and nodding and then one guy goes wasn't that two and a half months ago and then we were all like yeah what the hell and I even thought about it you can totally go for two days it's two and a half months in and so then we all laughed at you and then moved on it was two and a half months ago but I committed to three months I committed to three months I had to stick with it so that's point one what's point two point two what do you think of my not Vlog video there what could we have done better so I was I wrote this down to let you know I don't think you can have any of that music on there you know I think it's gonna get taken down no I think it's be fine Conor price that's Conor Price's song he was gonna attend the camp it's fun the first song was Dropkick Murphy's the first song is fine and it's gonna be absolutely fine nothing's gonna get taken down this isn't like a like oh I just got to ask for Mission type of thing like it literally won't like like the algorithm's gonna like prevent this from going live so I think you have to change that song but it's great I thought it was great okay narc um okay third third question third question for you have you noticed this trend uh right part of this is me just showing you a vacation photo album basically but the other part is noticing that um I think I started a movement dude I think I just [ __ ] around and started a movement so I didn't mean to do this did you just invent vlogging no not the vlogging this the movement is of these kind of like man camp active conferences I don't know I don't have a good name for it I'm thinking it's something like a man business Camp type of thing so I did this Camp MFM thing then I started noticing other people who heard the podcast were like oh you know what would be cool like Sean did it for basketball let's do it for something else and so I I have a few of these that are now started so um our boy Danny Miranda has like a running club type of thing yeah dude I see them out there all the time there's like 50 of them looks like a blast um Pat walls from starter story uh was like Hey what if we did this for tennis pickleball whatever and they called it the Mr open like the month Rec Revenue open great name that's better than our name [ __ ] this guy uh this guy in Hampton messaged me and he goes hey heard about CFM so awesome had the same idea this guy Victor he was like I'm going to do this for poker and so he did a poker getaway weekend uh rented a house invited a bunch of people and they just played poker all weekend I think this is the new new wave of uh of getting you can either just get together for drinks but guess what the cool kids don't drink anymore everyone's sober as a salad dude isn't itane did you did you see uh Whole Foods announced the most popular beer that they sell do you know what it is it's athletic Brewing Company a non-alcoholic beer yeah a non-alcoholic beer is the top selling beer right now in Whole Foods is that insane no one drinks yeah no one drinks so nobody drinks anymore so what are we going to do get together and just uh you know suck our thumbs this is not going to work so next thing nobody U wants to just sit at a conference or you know like a lecture hall and just sit there and listen to speakers kind of boring uh you want to weave it in with these things so I think this kind of active conference thing is cool I think more people should make these um you can invite me I would love to know about them and then politely politely pass cuz I don't like to leave the house that much but I think more people should do these and I'm hoping that um I'm just hoping that I get credit for starting this movement and I know people are going to go out and say no no this been going on forever but that was the past but I'm the present future and I just needed to tell you that I think it's awesome I uh I want to go to the next one and I'm going to make it a point to go there and make a big deal out of it because I do have fomo uh after seeing that video good job and vlogging not only I don't care if you're giving birth next year when it's happening you better be there it uh dude vlogging sucks by the way D Mr Beast made fun of you in that video or he made fun of he was always with the camera was he giving you guys a hard time for having a camera there yeah cuz I showed in you know with a camera following me basically and uh the funny part is always with the camera that's the first time I've ever done a vlog as evidenced by the fact that I at the end I was like this Vlog kind of sucks let's just make a hype video out of it um but it was really fun actually having a guy there this our buddy Max came and uh he did a great job it's really embarrassing I see a lot of people like vlogging and walking around and they have a guy uh following them on camera it's it's quite embarrassing it draws a lot of attention to you I find it to be very very humiliating the upside you might get famous the downside you're immediately humiliated um all right let me tell you about something yeah I'm gonna talk a little bit about the best business in the world now this business chamath who I think is coming on the pot actually has said it's the singular best business model and Monopoly ever created this is easy for you to get right Ritz crackers no it's got to be Google Google Facebook yeah Google and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about Google and search engine stuff because I've been interested in this for years I've been interested in Duck Duck Go which I called that shot I think I missed the I thought it was going to grow a lot faster than it than it uh actually has but it's like slowly coming about this by the way this is going to be the episode where we take credit for things that we had absolutely no part in and actually didn't call our shot and in fact kind of doubted it early yeah it's like hey do you like making right-hand turns on a red light I invented that I was doing that I was doing that when I was 16 yeah my permit I created it I created that uh and so the reason let me tell you why I've been interested in it type four athletic fitting dress pants hey the auto complete didn't even had no idea what I was doing there that is not a common search thick boy parants yeah all right I was searching for this the other day and I had to scroll down so far to get to a website because if you look through like the first it's it's like tons and tons of images is that what you see so I see tons of images so I see a whole shopping Carousel then I see uh a couple of ads and then I scroll down I see Amazon okay yeah go ahead so you got to scroll down a ton to get to a website it's actually quite annoying and so Google's been pissing me off and you just talked about how they uh like have gone through some stuff and you still believe in the company I'm slowly to I'm slowly starting to lose fa faith in their company because the search has been really [ __ ] and it's starting to piss me off and so I've been looking for all their other Alternatives did you Google for that did you just Google search for Alternatives yeah I mean it's like it's like even though I hate it I use it you know like it's like an abusive lover but I was doing some research on when they first started so Google started in the late 90s and when they did Sergey and Larry the founders they created this paper called the anatomy of large scale hypertextual web search engine riveting riveting stuff but please take our my power writing course Larry P that title is awful and in that paper they talk about like what they think is possible with a search engine and and and they kind of started from an academic point of view which is pretty cool though to see like their their predictions and there's this one line it says in general it could be argued from the cons consumer point of view the better the search engine is the fewer advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want and then he goes he says the goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users so like 30 years later they just went back and edited it and they're like nah yeah yeah like the the sub text on their like the sub headline is just psych like they just like uh and then and they said for this reason uh as for for this reason we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and won't be aligned with the consumer needs and they actually go on to say that they think a subscription service uh search engine is actually the answer of course that is the opposite of what they've eventually uh have become you know Google is a$ 1.5 trillion dollar company market cap company and 95% of the revenues come from search and it's the greatest business model of all time I would I don't know how many people work at Google exactly I think I think over 100 thousand but I would I would imagine that you could basically fire everyone but like a thousand people and the company would just Thrive it would be the most profitable company in the world and the crappy part about Google well I guess it's good for them bad for us is that their remot is quite simple which is the more people who use the search engine the better it understands like which results to give you and so it's just going to get better or supposedly better and better and better but harder for a new person to create a an alternative now ultimately I think actually open AI is going to be an alternative uh Gardner had this report where they said by 2026 they think 25% uh Google search is going to be reduced by 25% because of uh AI but I found a new alternative that just launched uh publicly a few days ago or about a month ago they've been around quietly but they like kind of made they had like a big like launch uh coming out party the other day and it's kind of cool so it's called I actually don't know how to pronounce it it's Kaji yeah sorry Good Start I mean how do you say this word k a gii yeah Kaji Kaji K kg yeah I don't know but it's got an interesting premise so it was started by this guy named Vladimir and the premise is is that there are zero ads and it's five to $10 a month for a subscription and I think that that's like an interesting premise but I don't think that that would work that well however this guy's story is pretty interesting so he started bootstrapping this business in 2018 slowly started making progress and at this point he's got about 30,000 people who pay for it and if you go to cad.com k ai.com stats he reveals all of his stats and so you could see the number of paid members you can see how many searches are happening per day you all of this stuff is pretty transparent and I love when people do that stuff it's so fascinating to see and the reason he had this like big like launch recently is because because they just raised 8800 I think it was $800,000 and very stupidly they looks like they're spending that $800,000 to buy 20,000 t-shirts to send to their 30,000 members so so Vlad uh Vlad has some questionable judgment when it comes to finances that real yeah so they blog like all about the business so if you go to their uh blog do blog. ci.com they blog about like everything that's going on in the company and so they're actually pretty transparent and in the thing he was like yeah and we're uh we're going to be sending out 20,000 t-shirts and I was like doing the math and I was like oh that's that's like 800 Grand like so so that's questionable but they like he has like this whole Manifesto online and it's pretty fascinating and this this is the type of entrepreneur who I really like because he's got this blog uh his personal website he says I'm dedicating the work by the way be honest when you found out the Founder's name was Vladimir already you were pretty biased to like this thing right yeah I'm in you can add an extra million to that valuation if your name is Vladimir I'm in general rule and I have no arguments with that yeah he's he's he's born in Yugoslavia and he like had all these like little like Indie hacker projects for a long time worked at GoDaddy so he's got he's a very technical guy he seems very Savvy he was a VP of product at GoDaddy uh he had another company called manage WP which was a web application that helps users manage uh WordPress sites and that got to a couple million Revenue so he has some experience but he has this blog where he goes I'm dedicating this work on Kaji to my three CH children while I try to make the web a more Humane and friendlier place for them and I started reading that I'm like okay I'm really fascinated by this guy I'm very interested and so he on his blog they talk all about the company and like how it's working and things like that and he's got all these like great lines about how he's like pay for search engine is unusual but that's the only choice if you want to build an independent search engine that isn't ad supported you could do donations but I don't think it's going to work 5 billion people use a search engine 99% of people are never going to pay the thing is the tiny minority of people who think differ the 1% that will pay it's still quite a large number that's 50 million people and he talks about 20 years of AD supported search have created resistance to the idea of paid search but a lot of people are already coming to the realization that the predicament that they found themselves in with ad supported search is not good for them and my point through all this is I think I agree with this guy the issue is that I don't think I don't think he's going win I think I agree with all of his stuff about subscriptions and I'm on board with that and open AI is really good for that uh but I'm very fascinated with guys that are going after Google at the moment there's been a few there was u.com which I don't think is that intriguing uh there was nea.com so neeva that was one and there's a few others and this is a type of idea that if you told me that you're going to launch this most people as well as mine gut reaction is like there not a chance you're ever going to be Google but when you start thinking about it I think it's really interesting and I want to know what's your opinion uh of these people trying to build these search engines and do you actually think that any of them will work other than open AI well I think I agree with you on pretty much all fronts which is that uh Google's search over time has become more and more just you you search for something and you get an ad and they add the result the top half of the page is ads and that's what that's what you get Google I think uh in kaji's website it says that Google if you just take their revenue divided by the number of users on average I believe that they make like 300 bucks a year off of each customer I think it's like 277 so that's 23 bucks a month and that's like what you're worth to Google so what this guy's doing is basically saying hey instead of Google making 23 bucks a month off you you pay us 10 bucks a month and we'll have no ads and I think that I agree with you which is that the big threat to Google is obviously the AI driven uh engin and Google's trying to become that themselves so you know whether it's chat GPT or it's Google or it's Bing or it's some new one that we haven't heard of perplexity or whatever else that is the big thing which is it's a better experience and so they're trying to win with better experience then you have Duck Duck Go which is basically like we are the anti- gooogle right we're gonna and kaji's in that same bucket we're the anti anti whatever I would say duck duck ghost is the surprising success the amount of traffic they have we we did a whole thing on them you know in a few episodes ago which was looking at their traffic numbers and how stunning they were what I think is cool about Kaji is that it doesn't need to beat Google this is just like I'm going to build this I'm a cockroach I'm going to build this business and you can't kill me because I'm going to be supported by my customers right now it sounds like he's probably making like what two to three million bucks a year in Revenue uh I think it's closer to one to 1.5 of subscription making let's say 1.5 million in revenue and he's probably able to run the thing Break Even or profitably at that rate and um you know he'll just keep crawling you know next year he'll be at 40,000 members and then next year he'll be at 60,000 members or whatever he'll just keep growing and he's not even worth it's not worth killing if you're Google it's it's too small to matter um and he doesn't have to become huge I think what he's saying is like my mission is for people that you know believe in this the the point he says the 1% who would pay I don't think it's 1% I think it's like 0.1% that would pay um here's your option and now the question is how good is this like for example you're into this did you sign up pay are you using this now instead of Google it's so hard to use something instead of Google because they're the default everywhere yeah and basically my frustration with Google is borderline to the point where I'm like all right I'm out but the thing is is that I'm like so six or seven more times Google and I am out of here the the issue is like I've logged in with everything like on Chrome you know what I mean I'm like [ __ ] I gotta type in all these passwords this sucks but I mean I definitely you know chat GPT has definitely taken away at least 30% of my like Google time which is a pretty insane number actually and I uh we're going to have to do an entire episode on Sergey BR and Larry pige these guys are crazy fascinating and I was reading a little bit about them when I was like researching how Google started and they were like huge [ __ ] and like Sergey Bren dude they were [ __ ] you're gonna have to explain that one to me so Sergey Bren he's got this uh he had his resume online and in the code he put uh if you expect the source code of his website you'll find brin's hidden objective laid out bare which is and this is in quotes this is exactly what he had in the code I want a large office good pay very little work frequent expense account trips to Exotic lands would be a huge plus Is that real that's insane that's on you could go to the website right now and find it uh you would never expect somebody whose like innermost goal is a big office no work expense accounts to create [ __ ] Google yeah it's it's funny and then there's stories of Larry pagee um where he he was just kind of like they had this like combination of just like being really blunt and where uh blunt and just like not totally understanding normal human emotions and so Larry and Sergey they took pride in the fact that they would argue with each other and they would call each other stupid and be like your idea is so stupid that's dumb why are you and they would like fight and fight and fight and then one person would win and then the other person would like concede and be like oh your idea is better and they would buy over that and then they're like to all the other employees they're like that's what you all need to do unfortunately when you're at like 50 or 100 or 300 people most people aren't like that and there's these crazy stories of like uh apparently uh do you know how like a janitor when they take out the trash oftentimes and they replace the bag they'll actually leave an empty bag at the bottom of the trash in case someone else wants to take it out and they're like well there's a bag already there for you Larry saw this and he was like that's the most efficient way I've ever seen anyone clean that is brilliant and he made this whole like memo about how the janitor does that and how brilliant that is and he's like why can't you guys be like this in fact everyone in the office needs to be like this here's the new rules and he laid out these like eight rules and it was like uh if you think that your idea is right go straight to the person who's in charg and tell them exactly what you think and don't hold back or it would be like if you are working on a project and you are not providing value leave that project right away and go and let the doers do what they need to do and just get them coffee and like just like serve them and like he would do all these things that very logical and like you dis agree some more yeah like he would say these like crazy things that you hear them like yeah I mean that's more productive unfortunately like this whole thing called human emotion kind of gets in the way and so it's probably not practical when you have 500 employees but there's all these stories about how these guys would behave and it's very fascinating and they were they were [ __ ] when they first started I think Google right now is going through those uh period where their CEO kind of I think it kind of sucks to be honest uh and so I think they're going to like come back but right now I'm not bullish on Google I think they're going to be around for a whole a real long time because they're so big but I'm eager to see something come and kind of crush them yeah yeah well I think the the funny thing about all like crush them type of ideas is that when a company is really successful it's like a giant castle with a huge moat and everybody who tries to like Siege the castle it's like the kaj's of the world they're basically trying to cross that moat and take over the castle and it's too hard the Castle's too big too strong the Mo's too big Etc and what ends up happening is that you the thing that beats that castle is not somebody who comes and takes their land it's somebody who just walks over like two miles and it's like hey this is actually like this is fertile land over here that everybody's ignoring and they build a new Castle over there and actually the thing that diminishes the castle is that that original Castle is just no longer as relevant like the world and the attention has moved the new plants that everybody wants they grow on this other land over here and nobody took your thing but you know you became less relevant in the world no one wants that thing anymore like Microsoft didn't defeat IBM or whatever by making you know by beating them at their own game they were like oh actually the game is software it's operating systems and then the things that beat the the Microsoft Monopoly and like Microsoft the biggest tech company in the world got then beat by the Googles and the Amazon and the Facebooks of the world which were like hey okay cool you can keep the operating system we'll take the internet and Microsoft missed the internet the internet was the place and then even when the internet was the place then was like the companies that made it on mobile were the ones that were like oh cool yeah you can have that desktop app we're going to make you know Uber and we're going to we're going to create these new mobile companies you know Instagram whatsapps and they outpaced the growth of Facebook and so now the qu now the thing is well AI is here and crypto is here and these are the the new lands and then the big projects that are getting built here they're just comp they're just competing for something in a different game altogether and I think that's really that's really what ends up happening more so than somebody overtakes you know a company like Google it's that Google becomes less relevant you don't need search why do you not need search well because the AI just does it why would I go why would I go search for links that doesn't even make sense anymore I don't need that I just you know I need the answer or even better than the answer oh I just need this little AI agent that's just going to like look at what I'm doing and then like do do jobs for me right like I don't even have to go search for an answer it knows the answer and then it does the task right that's where this is going and so whoever does that is gonna actually be the one that is the next Google without even creating a new search engine right and that's nine out of 10 times it seems that's how like big Innovative things come about where it's like you know all these people are trying to make the world's fastest car and they're trying to make a a V6 turn it into a V8 and then we're going to turn into a V10 we're going to put more cylinders in more horsepower and then you're like oh this electric car just like went way faster and it has zero cylinders uh you know what I mean that that's how it works did I tell you about the um my boss who his boss was Larry pagee and what he tell so he didn't tell me many stories but he told me one which was I came in once and I was like yeah um I was like presenting my goal I was like yeah our goal is to do you know 9.1 this year uh I don't remember what the metric was like like 9.1 million users or something like that and he's like you know what Larry Page used to say when I would uh present a goals like I'm gonna do nine of something he's like he would just say that's a wuss goal if you could do nine you can do 10 he's like never set a goal at nine it's like and then I was like what and he's like I just said what I said if you can do nine you can do 10 saying nine is just a wussy way to go about things and I was like he told you that he's like yeah he would tell everybody that and so I stole that and I I made the change and then now in my companies I do the same thing if anybody ever comes to me like yeah we're gonna do four and a half now you're gonna do five yeah we're gonna do 9.2 no no no you're gonna do 10 like if you can if you're gonna get 9.2 you can get to 10 trust me it's like when uh 510 guys lie and they say they're 5'11 it's like dog just say 61 be the real thing yeah act as if my friend act as if um all right that's the [Music] pod

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right everyone we just finished recording this pod and we wanted to come back and give a little bit of intro because I feel so many different emotions and here's why the stakes of this are super super super high yeah we're talking about what's going on with robots in the real world so robots that are being used we have specific examples of really cool businesses that are doing robots for you know Lawn Care restaurants all different types of things but then we go over the Elon Musk versus Sam Alman lawsuit what is this lawsuit between two of the Power Players of Silicon Valley and what's our take on it which might surprise you as well as some of the brilliant the Nuance the marketing and PR that's going on here we kind of call it out this is actually we have fun while doing it but this is actually really really important in my opinion listen to the entire thing and you have to listen to the first half to build up the story the stakes for the second half trust me you're going to understand exactly what I'm talking about when you get through the whole thing so enjoy [Music] it all right what up Sam hey what's going on Sam I got to tell you something when it comes to kissing eating ice cream before bed or business timing is everything my friend and I think I think that timing is important in all aspects of business and in technology there's a moment happening right now I can feel it I could feel it my it's like when you hit your funny bone and your whole arm gets hot I can feel it right now [ __ ] it's about to change robots are going wild I got to talk to you about robots and they've like been around for a minute but now it actually feels like it's a reality exactly so right now A lot of people are talking about Tesla because Elon Musk came out and he said the future of Tesla is this humanoid robot and I forgot what they call him like Optimus or some [ __ ] like that so it's like uh he's like hey we got this robot that can walk around pick up stuff do tasks it's going to change the workforce and um your boy Brad Adcock he's got a company called figure which you're an investor in they have their robot I think they just raised like a billion dollars or something right like last week I think they raised $600 million at a two and a half or3 billion valuation I think nice little investment there for you I know I was in the first I was in on the first round I doubled down and did on this round is this going to be my my Mota Lisa is this going to be my my big win well it could have been anybody's because you had him come on the podcast and tell the world what he was doing so uh good good on you multi-billion dollars uh valuation right now so that's a big deal and people are really excited about that I think there's these stats that say if you uh basically labor is 50% of the GDP the labor market is a 10 times bigger Market than Transportation which makes sense why Elon is like hey forget cars it's all about these robots we're just we're an AI company we're doing robots um he is very good at repositioning and re- um reimagining the vision of the company over and over and over again right it went from affordable electric cars to self-driving autonomous vehicles Robo taxis that will just drive people everywhere your car will become an appreciating asset instead of a depreciating asset and then now it's actually it's not even about cars it's about AI robots and that's that's the future but I want to tell you about something that's less fancy than that because I think it's going to come first and that is single purpose robots AKA roombas on steroids and roombas on steroids you know the Roomba was a it's a single purpose V little vacuum robot that just goes around your house and but it's in the wild today it like actually works it's actually useful for people an even better example I think is the dishwasher which is in pretty much every home in the United States right now and it saves you a ton of time like when you're like my dishwasher broke last week terrible experience when your dishwasher breaks the dishwasher is a single-purpose robot that's actually out there in the wild we should be striving to create something as useful as the dishwasher that should be the Northstar right now for a lot of lot of companies and there are so I I went on Twitter today and I saw this great video that was about um a company called electric sheep have you seen this no Electric Sheep that's Electric Sheep I I don't know what it is that's a great name I think and I think it's a law a lawn mower it is imagine if you took the Roomba and you put it in the lawn that's what it is it's a that's a great name it is a robot that mows your lawn does all kind of landscaping what's interesting about these guys that I found pretty fascinating is not only are they a company that's like a bunch of guys in a garage building a robot like a a lawnmower that's got a camera on it that can go around your lawn they're actually buying up and rolling up landscaping services so it's a combination of a sweaty startup and a moonshot startup together so these guys are going out they're buying all these Landscaping businesses in the Bay area and because they're like well we need a like a testing ground for robots like you have to actually like in their office it's just like an astro turf and they're like yeah well I can do this Square astro turf pretty easily it's it's not so bad but in the real world your lawn has got all kinds of different lumps and dips and divots and trees and rocks and it has to be able to work how are we going to get the best data right just same way that Tesla is putting all like the cars on the road collecting data at all times and they're collecting like whatever a hundred times more data than the next biggest self-driving car company these guys are trying to do that with their Lawn Care robots so they're buying these Landscaping businesses then they use them for as a Sandbox they take their robots out and they try to use them they they Mill your lawn normally but they'll try to test their robots as well they gather the data and then over time they're like well we're buying these Landscaping businesses at one valuation but then what we'll do is we'll slowly start to replace the workers in the landscaping business with the robots and actually have improve margins um and so we're gonna like it's like a private Equity play as well and so I thought that was a pretty fascinating approach that I hadn't heard before I can't decide if that's just Overkill like maybe that's not actually necessary to to to do two hard things at once but I did find it very interesting what do you think of that strategy I'm looking at their website all right so it's slick this is cool I agree with you the whole Overkill thing that bothers me that could be true well the problem is like the the founders like founder like went to Stanford and like you're smart enough to build a robotics company that's almost you're smart enough where you can get yourself into trouble you could you could be like oh we vertically integrate and it's like anytime you use the words vertically integrate be real careful you might be mid witting the [ __ ] out of your plan right now basically like for him there needs to be a vend diagram of this guy this founder of sheep robotics he's like the dumbest smart person and he needs to hang out with the smartest dumb person and we need that like we need that like event diagram overlap to to make this the perfect business that's that's kind of like what he's doing uh this is awesome this is awesome this is cool another thing that I worry about this is badass but is it a badass team and a badass execution on like small opportunity yeah like lawn I mean I gu I don't know is lawn mowing a big big I mean is it as Grand of a plan as what these people are actually capable of doing I think so because I you know I don't know how big the Landscaping industry is but I know that any time private Equity is going on rolling up things there's a lot of money to be made they wouldn't private Equity doesn't roll up you know like uh liit you know small lemonade stands for example like they go into things that are that that are cash flowing you know Industries and so I do think if you add it up all the Landscaping businesses and you're like well you know either what they're going to do is they're going to use them in their own business to get it right and then they're going to go lease or sell these robots to every landscaper in the country and be like hey would you like to improve your your operating margins by you know 10% 20% use these robots and so that either that's what they're going to do or they're going to go try to out compete them somehow on price I don't really love that that idea so so I think it has to be they're just using this to prove their own Tech to then go lease these out to every other landscaper so on their about page they list their team and I guess uh their advisors include this guy named Dan Foley it says Dan Foley was a CEO of a company that sold to Bright View I Googled Bright viw Bright View is a commercial landscaping company that did roughly three billion dollars last year in Revenue publicly it's publicly traded it's has a [ __ ] market cap what you're saying is the newsletter guy is call the land guy small no what I'm saying is I yeah I did what's up BL boy I did call it small and then I looked up Bright View it just shows I'm I I'm I'm an idiot I don't know anything like every great man you're willing to change your mind uh congratulations I I'm only one Google away from saying sorry all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worth and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this anous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM so check this out okay so that's the first one now I have a similar you know uh where else are robots being used again these single purpose robots not the general robots but single purpose robots in the same way that we got specific AI before we're getting art AGI artificial general intelligence we got specific AI where it's like you know I don't know it's been like 20 years since uh deep mine could just beat jary Casper of at chess right like we we solve chess then we solve go then we solve math then we solve route planning you could do these single purpose AIS that way before you can get to General AI so similarly I think the timing of the opportunity is not in the the Tesla robot or even sorry the figure robot which is like just a human robot that could do everything uh you know that is the big biggest win obviously but I think before then almost by definition we have to see these specific single job one job robots because you're it's going to be easier to build a one job robot than it is going to be to build a general robot that could do all jobs and so um here's some other ones so I don't know if know the Sam but this podcast is not only listened to by people who are trying to make their first million but maybe by people trying to make their their 100th million they their NE their next million there's more Millions to go and one of those people is the CEO of of a restaurant called uh sweet green and so the the CEO of sweet green is a listener of the Pod and I was looking up where else are robots being used and I saw that sweet green actually now has a what they call their infinite kitchen which is a like robot driven version of sweet green so sweet green is like like a salad uh bowl typee of type of concept you normally go in there and there's like you know whatever four people working the line and then there's like four people in the back kitchen doing prep just like most fast casual restaurants and what they've done is they basically went in and they were like hey what if we they first I think they bought a robotics company for 50 million bucks and then they used that technology to build a concept where you basically have like one person in the store and the rest of it is all done by robots and so click this link that um I put in our sheet we could show this on YouTube um by the way is this Jonathan Newman yeah I know that he's a listener you want to know how I know he's a listener don't tell me you're getting free sweet green and I'm not no even better he emailed me and he took a screenshot and he showed that he subscribed to my first million on both YouTube podcast for apple and Spotify so if you want to be like John and start a multi-billion dollar company you got to subscribe that that's all you have to do I don't think there's been anyone who subscribed that isn't rich and famous and successful and desired by many people of the opposite sex or the same sex if that's what they're into it's just a thing that works all right um okay so so sweet green uh so check this this video out so basically what they did was they made these like this kitchen it's just like a giant wall where all the ingredients are in these like little robotic kind of dispenser arm type things and whatever you order the bowl goes across the conveyor belt and then it's like the bowl is spinning it's like rotating so that it drops in all the ingredients at the right spots and again they have all kinds of ingredients right so like this sounds pretty simple it's just like dispensing but like maybe dispensing almonds is really easy but feta cheese which is really crumbly you got to be careful with it right like so so they basically fine-tuned this thing and now this concept can do 500 bowls per hour and I dm'd him and I was like how much does like the human like a human L like your normal restaurant line do he's like maybe like 170 to 200 wow so you get basically like more than 2x the speed and now you have a robot that does work that can work 24/7 never calls in sick never uh you know always get puts the right proportion into into every Bowl you know you have perfect food control costs and so you end up with a better version of an employee and the strategy the way that I think about this is you trade Opex for capex and trading Opex for capex is actually a pretty good idea um I think you should further explain what that means so today all restaurants work with human labor your human labor is your operating expense it's an Opex and so and what that means is that for every hour that you're operating every every bowl that you're selling you need to pay a certain amount in wages to to employees and so let's say today you know you're paying 20 bucks an hour to people that work in these restaurants you got you know 10 people working in the restaurant at any given time blah blah blah you can add it up and let's just pretend that your labor costs come out to 33% of your revenue and so the opportunity here which is I would say normal for for restaurant food costs usually 30% labor cost usually 30% um and so you you you add these up you can't can't change the food cost but could you change the labor cost and so what the what he did with these restaurants is every restaurant to put in these robots cost more money it costs more capex which is like the initial upfront investment and I think in their last earnings call they said it's about 500k to put the robot in so you put an extra 500k to build the store but again this is 500k of capex which means you can depreciate it which is good for your you know tax purposes and whatnot um and it's a one-time cost versus your Opex is a every day of of operation and what they found was for that extra 500k investment they get at least an extra 7% of you know of net margin from uh from those restaurants that because they have less opics and so you would take that that basically creates you know some Break Even point where you say okay cool two years in we're gonna have paid off you know the cost of this robot or whatever um and also he's like you know the 500k capex that's today and this is the most expensive it's ever going to be like the costs are only going to drop as we scale up as we find the as we simplify the design like every version we come out with is just going to be lower cost than this one and I asked him I go in 10 years what are the odds that um your restaurants are basically robot robot driven not human labor is this guy swe green is publicly traded right yes is he are you allowed to say what he's gonna say right now I told him I said is there anything in that I can't share in this and he goes no I've shared all this but he was basically it's very high right like and just just thinking about that a little bit out loud it's like man that means the next 10 years in you know very EAS you hopefully in our lifetime restaurants are just going to go from you know a lot of restaurants are going to go from you walk in and there's just like a bunch of people who are sort of disgruntled people who would rather just be checking their phone right now than you know sitting there with this like stupid uniform on and it's just going to go where you go in you push a button and then your bowl gets made by a robotic arm and then you walk out like that's gonna be thing there's gonna be one human in the loop one one human whose job is now called you know robot maintenance robot operations and they're basically the guys like oh the carrots machine got a jam let me go and uh take a little fork and unjam that thing or hey I got to refill the container of apples and so what the what these guys do with the sweet Green Restaurant is the humans are all in the back doing the fresh prep of ingredients and then the robots are serving the customers and that's how they split it today so you and I are are fairly optimistic uh you know we try to see the the bright side of most things you in particular do that but let's try to be pessimistic right now now a little bit so the argument that you're going to see from a lot of actually most people I would think particularly pessimist but most people I think are going to be pessimistic on this they're going to say but this is going to ruin the economy this is going to ruin jobs and let me ask you a question before you actually give your opinion you have Sean you own a business that employs warehouse workers roughly what's your annual turnover for your warehouse workers like how often do they quit well we use a 3pl now but before when we when we had it in housee it was I would say every year we're going to replace 90% of the team so I was reading I think it was Amazon I forget someone who employs t or hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers for them it was it was 100% so it was 100% turnover rate and I remember talking to Brett uh from figure and I go Brett are you gonna like are you preparing to like be the most hated man in America right now and he was like well why and I said well because like you're going to be you're get you're taking jobs and he was like well I'm not actually taking jobs in fact there's all these warehouses that no one will no one's going to work there they just literally cannot they cannot convince people to work there whether they can't afford it or if it's just a people uh aren't interested in that type of work and then and then he goes plus the average turnover on a lot of warehouses it is 100% so like they just can't keep people like in these jobs for a long time and so my question to you is are you pessimistic at all of what's going to happen in 15 years 20 years you know my first job I was a laborer and then a dishwasher I bet I think you probably have done similar things like that what's going to happen my first my first business was a restaurant business I was the guy chopping tuna and doing all that stuff in the back doing dishes you know every every night um I think there's two versions of pessimism the first version is it's not going to work the second version is it's gonna work and that's a bad thing you're talking about the second version right I think this I think I think it's going to work it 100% is going to work I think and by the way I I asked the guy was like um how I was like what's the non-obvious like only when you're in the weeds doing it is it really obvious about this but to the outside person they maybe gloss over it I was like what's what's that Insight that's a great question he goes well it's like it's like most things in technology he goes the first 90% is easy which makes it really easy to have like a sweet demo and everybody just immediately is like oh man this is gonna change everything and it's like it will eventually and probably a lot longer than we we we want um because he goes the so the 90% is easy the next 9% is 10 times harder so it's like you know the simple stupid example of this would be like you know dispensing almonds easy dispensing the right amount of crumbly fet of cheese it is literally 10 times harder than the Almond's problem right or like on a Tesla like my Tesla self-drives and it's the autopilot is mostly good unless it's a flashing yellow light then it like freaks out and I almost die right or it's like if it's a dewy morning or it's foggy this whatever or it's rainy here or there's construction there right there's like all these edge cases and then that's what he said he's like the last 1% is it's even 10 times harder than that first one and he's like so with self-driving cars the problem is nobody wants a 99% good self-driving car even if that's actually five times better than a human yeah it's like if I'm gonna die I'm gonna die at my own hands not at the hands of this you know this piece of software and so that makes it really hard to roll out these things and get and and deal with the pr backlash anytime there is is a a crash or a or a a bad result even if it's less even if it's a better probability than than humans driving but I don't think you have the same problem with restaurants right size of the prize is smaller but also the barrier to entry is the barrier to deployment is much smaller where it's like oh man I asked for light sauce this is medium sauce right like you know it's like whatever it's okay it's not a self-driving car crash and so I do think that that's the case here where a lot of people can get 90% of the way they're getting the next 9% 10 times harder getting the final 1% 10 times harder than even that in software development we used to say this where I would always be because I'm the non-engineer I worked at a company of all programmers and i' just be like walking around you know eating cashews and just walking around just like hey hey guys how's it coming when you think it's gonna be done and they're like well we're about 90% of the way there or we got like 90% of the things done so we're about halfway done you're like great 10 minutes we'll be done and I was like wait 90% done so you're halfway done like yeah the last 10% always takes at least double the time that you've already spent like all right cool that's how that's how math works I uh anybody coffee I'll go get some like 10 years ago Universal uh income or you know Universal wages was like a thing Ubi Ubi we're gonna you're gonna we're g to give everyone in America a bunch of money and like I'm a capitalistic guy and I was like what F that that's the worst and then I learned two things one do you know in alas in Alaska I've had a friend I've had friends move to Alaska you know they do that they've been doing that for decades they give you five grand the oil oil dividend right it's like you get a share of the money that they were making from having so much natural resources I think I don't yeah maybe I don't know where it's from and I I believe if I'm not mistaken I think sometimes it's a tax credit where like you just pay less in taxes or if you don't owe in any tax money you literally get a check of like $4,800 or $5,500 something like that and then the second thing that I learned was I started researching Ubi and I was like wait why is Sam Alman advocating for U Ubi like why are all these like really smart robot makers advocating for it and I'm like [ __ ] they know they when my wife comes home and like why is the kitchen clean what did you do why are you cleaning up this mess you did something else that's what he's doing by starting Ubi which he has he has uh you know I think Sam Alman along with a few other guys are doing experiments in San Francisco where I think they're giving $800 I forget I don't even want to say CU I'm going to get the numbers wrong but it was like a a fairly small SU now they I think they did it for like some number of years and that was the experiment and then they stopped and I we should go look up actually what actually happened but I remember reading something that was like not like entirely positive it wasn't like oh my God this is great we this is the program we need to roll out Nationwide it was like well no that's not that's not what the takeaway was but it's still an interesting concept to me that I'm open to learning more about because when I learn more about these robots I actually do think I'm like I'm just old enough where I I think this isn't going to impact me but for most Americans who are born who are young now it's going to have a massive impact on their future yeah yeah uh and so that second concern of like oh wait this is the this is the real version of they took our jobs like hey it wasn't the immigrants it was the dorks building robots that took all your jobs um yeah I do think that's true in fact it's kind of a paralyzing thought because it's not just labor jobs actually it seems like the knowledge jobs are going first for sure every two weeks it's like oh video editor out of a job oh Photoshop useless skill now okay well lawyers don't need them right it's like it's like clearly the breadcrumb starts to get laid where you're like okay today they haven't replaced all these but what's going to happen in V12 of this like of this product like this V12 is just going to do the job for doctors for for you know for everybody for for all these designers for video editors for all these things and so it's kind of a paraly in thought and it reminds me um they did this interview with Elon Musk and he was like they're like you're really worried about AI right and he's like yeah I'm extremely concerned about AI it stresses me out I lose sleep over Ai and they were like so why are you working on AI then why are you developing it he's like well basically I think this is going to happen either way it's it is inevitable my mind told me that he goes and then I just had to decide do I want to see the AI Apocalypse in my lifetime or do I want to die and then not get to witness it he's like I decided I'd like to witness it which is just a hilarious thing because I thought he was gonna say something else I thought he was gonna say like you know I can use this for good and instead he's like I'd just rather see it in my lifetime than not see it he's like and then he's like then I felt good I just operate I just continued on that's kind of how I feel when I see the AI like getting so much better I'm like dude I don't know if any of my businesses will even make sense in 10 years well all right carry on then what am I going to do about this like am I really going to go stop the progress of Technology no am I going to anticipate this now and like change everything that I'm doing now also doesn't really make sense let me just make hey while the while while it's possible and see what happens I think that when it comes to Ai and these robots I think what it is is it's sort of like uh a squirrel preparing for winter where between now and the next like 10 years the name of the game is Just pile away as much as you can to get above this certain threshold to where you make it through this winter that is never going to end and so it's like between now and whenever this moment happens if it's going to be 5 years or 20 years the name of the game is just hurry up and like board up your home for the store to come so just that way you're safe for it and that you're just you're independent and you're all right but once that once it like once ever that threshold or that time comes a lot of people I think are actually going to be screwed I'm not going to predict what's going to happen because I have no no idea but I just think that between now and then the name of the game is just to make as much money set up your life in such a way where you can pile away all these nuts and you're just good and you're just good for the winter that's like basically how I've been living I I don't know what the right mindset is I think that's for for right or wrong that's also my mindset is just like get it while it's hot do good while the get's good right and it's like well I but I also am not like blinders on about this stuff in fact one of the name the name of my original holding company was inevitable outcomes and I was like well why don't I just figure out what is inevitably gonna happen and then go invest in that because that that that's just a better thing to work backwards from if you realize that something is inevitable that's way different than speculating of like well maybe this could be the case it's like once you know something is inevitably gonna happen then you just have to figure out which company's going to win which is actually like you've reduced the problem set down into which company's goingon to win and when is the right time for for a business like this to exist I I started this episode talking about timing because I think that these single purpose robots is going to be the big winners in the next cycle here where like you have the knowledge work like llms chat GPT type of stuff but then I think you're going to see these specific robots I think both of those are going to be really really successful what you're not going to see is that I don't I think the human robot I think it has to be further out than U this that's just my my opinion you know there's also other versions of this so we talked about the sweet green one you know the founder of Chipotle has a new restaurant concept that's all robotic first what is it and by the way one other Insight that sweet green guy said he go goes the key is not to retrofit the restaurant he goes uh what everybody tries to do is they have their existing restaurant then they try to install a robotic arm that can try to use the existing restaurant layout because it's cheaper right to not rebuild a restaurant and his quote was everybody's trying to retrofit I'm different I'm willing to blow the whole thing up quote I'm willing to blow the whole thing up and he was basically saying like we just thought through from first principles if this was a restaurant that was not going to have humans working on the line it was going to have robots how would you design every part of this restaurant and then let's build those and so they did two this year they're up and running and now they're doing like 10 more in to scale this up what's it called and what do they serve so is it called Colonel so now uh what's his name um Steve ell's Steve ell's the guy who created Chipotle he's got a new one called kernel and kernel is basically like some kind of like vegan Bull type of concept and so you can see videos of it uh where it's basically like dispensing stuff into a bowl and then it's like shaking there's like armed at just shaking the bow just to mix it for you it's pretty hilarious the crossover of vegans and uh apocalyptic uh like AI people I don't that V diagram I don't think is going to cross over nicely like you know what I mean like like hey do you want to go to this uh restaurant that has no humans working ever cuz [ __ ] people yeah do they do they sell hummus you know what I mean like that conversation is not going to be it's plant-based machine operated baby yeah who who's got that tattoo nobody that's not a huge crossover but it looks cool so he has two or three of these locations yeah so I don't think this one's like as figured out it doesn't seem like it's as promising but uh there's a bunch of people doing this just soft bank had poured like hundreds of millions into a pizza bot that I've talked about a lot which is pizza's the big prize here Pizza is a a much simpler dish like a single single item it's the most popular kind of like fast casual type of type of food and if if you could and it's also owned by chains and so you can get if you can get Dominoes as a customer you're going to get to go in whatever like you know 5,000 Domino locations and so whoever can build a pizza bot that can make a perfect pizza every time perfectly circular perfect ratio of ingredients never calls in sick can work 247 um consistent it doesn't matter if that thing costs like you know $500,000 you'll be able to sell into all the dominoes all of the Pizza Huts all of the chain chain Pizza Stop shops in order to um uh to do this um so I think that pizza bot is like you know the big opportunity here I uh I'm I like to think of myself as an independent thinking person I like to live my life somewhat independently and I don't want to rely on other people that's why I like to start my own companies when I went to Brett adcock's Warehouse or factory whatever you call it and he showed me he was like check this out we're learning how the Achilles on a human works and we just got our humanoid to move its foot like in a dors flexion way and like we also like here's like this human knee that we're studying now our guy over here is making the knee so we can like move I saw this stuff and I was like Dad can I come and like I was like can I should I drop everything and just come and join you like it felt like yeah sounds great it it felt like I was in a cult like I was meeting like Charlie Manson and I was like yes sir who would you like me to kill like I was just like so into this I remember this going to my wife I was like you should quit your job I was like Sarah I don't I'm not smart enough but will you quit your job and go work here I was like I just was so into it when I saw this stuff this is and and and the cool thing about this topic is that it's happening this second right now and this isn't far away enough to say one day in the future it's like it's happening now and over the next couple months and couple years we're going to see it in play and I think that's why this topic is very really fascinating by the way this is also the magic of Silicon Valley like one of the reasons to be in the Bay Area is you will because he's his Factory is in the Bay Area right yeah it's in uh it's South San Francisco uh uh it's just north of palalo so you will go you will either meet somebody you'll be at a dinner and hear something or you'll drop by somebody's office and you'll see what they're working on and how they're approaching it and then you will walk out being like my life is meaningless everything I do is absolutely meaningless I am a small small pale dot on a giant rock and I I mean nothing and what I'm doing is nothing most people that's a pretty disempowering feeling but for me I wanted to be in situations like that I wanted people who could basically like blow the ceiling off of what I thought was possible what I thought was cool what I thought was interesting and be like no no no you thought that was interesting this is interesting and um that that happened the other day I don't know if you saw these videos that were going viral some people were at a hackathon down in uh also in Sunnyvale or Mountain View somewhere doing like a there's like something called like the AI house or some [ __ ] like that and during the hackathon during the hackathon this guy walks in with this cool look of jacket and like disheveled hair like he's been in like a cryogenic freezing tube for the last 10 years and it's Sergey Brin it's the founder of Google just showing up at the hackathon and he gave an impromptu talk did you see this no what did he say well he goes up there and he's just gets really into details about Google's Gemini thing like about like bugs that they're fixing and stuff like that like not like some Grand Visionary talk he was just like yeah like here's what the here's what it could do here's how it works here's how we're thinking about this and he's just talking to a bunch of guys and all of them this hilarious it went viral because there's a guy sitting there the guy who asked the question in the clip and his shirt is just a shirt that looks like someone's body flesh with boobs and he asked serious question he's like what is it about the uh because you know like Gemini got in trouble for being like too woke or whatever like the thing wouldn't generate images of white people and he's like how come your you know the llm is not generating images you know what's your views on the policy of that and nobody even calls out nobody like Sergey really doesn't point at him and be like dude can we get a different question not the guy with the boobs shirt I'm looking at him now it's just like a a guy who looks like me just like a like a normal looking dude but he's got a a flesh cover but it's it's tits It's a he's got boobs on his shirt and nobody references it nobody acknowledges it it's just like yeah carry on what Live and Let Live maybe that's the San Francisco way and so it's a very strange place but it's strange in a way where kind of amazing things happen like the founder of Google just showing up at your hackathon and uh and answering some questions this is pretty wild I exp so I experienc this all the time in San Francisco when I liveed there there'd be so many times where it was like I've I've told many stories about this where I've go to someone's office and there's just like huge screens with porn playing and it's like well they're just working on this this website and it's a and it's like they make porn and so just like normal we like normalize it or there's been other times where like I've seen like I've come into the office and there's people sleeping under desk and stuff like that and just like weird [ __ ] that we would make fun of or things on that TV show Silicon Valley where they like have nippler and like like I've experienced this in real life and it's fun to make fun of but honestly it's awesome it is so awesome to like be around these freaks remember when hacker houses were like just getting going I would go to these these houses and you would see that they' have share kitchens and like half the time it was like just powders it's like well these guys just live off these P they just live off powders that's all they eat and it's really that's how to it started you know started those guys are just living in a house together where they were supposed to be working on other stuff and then one of the guys was just eating only he's like I'm just gonna create like baby formula for adults basically and he's that became soilent and that same guy when like I forget what type of Chip it is when it came out like you know like these credit cards that we use now where you touch your credit card on a machine instead of inserting it and and you could read the credit card he inserted all of that into a small chip and he surgically put it into his hand and so he could just like touch his so like being around freaks like that it's fun to make fun of them because it is silly it is awesome I loved I loved being around that I would see this stuff all the time and I would just like I'm so happy you freaks exist this is the coolest thing I've seen I felt like that all the time did you ever experience that where you'd go to these like hacker houses and and they would be disgusting these guys well it's just like triple bunk beds they're filthy but you know like God damn it I can't even look down on this because one out of the one out of 18 of you guys is about to become a billionaire in the next 5 years I just don't know which one like you know whose neck beard is the longest is like you know who who showered least in this room like I got to guess I guess write you a check I think I think that's the optimal strategy here like I had a buddy um who worked at my company that would just do these things these experiments like uh his guy Quinn and Quinn had this like crazy like uh sideo bob style haircut and Quinn would be like he was in really into games and so he's playing this like little like Word Scramble game on iPhone and I think like his girlfriend had beat him in the like they were him and his girlfriend would play or this girl he was like flirting with or whatever would play and she beat him and so he stayed up all night Pro programming a robotic finger and a camera to like solve this like word scramble thing so that he would never lose again and I was like it's like these stories you hear about Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan with like this like Fierce competitiveness but applied in the absolute nerdiest way and it results in kind of amazing things and it's amazing energy to be around I've been around a bunch of those people and I love it and it always makes me feel like the first feeling I originally what I felt is you're stupid that's stupid and then it's like oh I'm stupid you're better than me and this like this is awesome uh yeah I I feel like that on a regular basis when I when I would go around these weirdos and I love them so we got to also talk about this lawsuit so Elon Musk sued Sam Alman and there's probably there's good analysis out there about this lawsuit but I want to point out a couple of things so here's my frame of this Elon is good at PR he's not just good at engineering he's not just good at business he's not just a technologist he's also kind of a master of PR and I should have known this because Tesla runs basically spends nothing on TV commercials every other car company spends like billions of dollars on uh you know like all other car companies in total will spend like a over a billion dollars on marketing whereas Tesla runs no commercials yet Tesla's brand is huge and it's because Elon is kind of a master of marketing he's a master of PR and he does this with Twitter he does this with with Tesla and he's doing it with SpaceX and now seeing him do this with this lawsuit it's the first time that I've ever seen him do this in in public but it's basically he's gonna lose the legal battle but he's gonna win the pr War I think uh have you ever been through a lawsuit do you know what the discovery phase is uh no I haven't but I'm familiar with the idea of Discovery so basically I don't exactly know uh what all the rules are but I've like I remember there was a time I was going to sue someone uh because I thought something didn't work out and and I I thought they violated contract and I'd lost money because of it and I was going to sue them some guy didn't rack his weights yeah insult bro code has been broken I can't let this stand uh and so I uh I was going to do it I hired a lawyer and they're like all right but they're like you're probably going to win this thing you're not going to win that much money and I'm like but it's the principle of the thing whatever and they're like okay cool but do you know what Discovery is I was like no tell me more and they're like we going to get access to your email to your phone records to your text messages and they're going to be able to see all of it and in many cases and this is where I don't entirely understand how it works but in many cases that's completely public record so if I file a lawsuit that part is public record and oftentimes the the things they discover will be in public record and I was thinking about it it's like did I just text my wife the other day to let her know that I farted but a little something came out because I think I did text that and I don't want that in public and that's like a three out of 10 on the PC meter like what's the N Out of 10 and would I be okay with them seeing that and that's when it finally hit me of all the years of people telling me don't write like offensive or crazy stuff on text messages or email that's why it's because I just didn't want that embarrassing stuff to be seen so I didn't end up going through with it just for that reason and so in this lawsuit we're going to see all types of private conversations that these people have I think Elon doesn't give a [ __ ] but I think the average Joe would including me well yeah I don't know we should know more about this I don't know how Discovery works of like what parts get because not everything goes public but not everything stuff does so it's like what what's what's the where's the line and how does that work because I think Elon has a lot to lose too with that like nobody wants their [ __ ] out there in the public and so but he does like when he when he TW when he texted that guy the the former CEO of Twitter he replied with all the stuff like can we talk about this and he just reply was what have you done this week like I I feel like in his mind he yes he want to do that but in his mind he's like I'm going to say stuff that I want the world to see you know what I mean it's like all part of the game to him so in this lawsuit there's actually some stuff that's in there that I thought I found pretty interesting can I just like tell you what I thought was interesting in this so he um so it starts off basically the whole lawsuit starts off the the document and it says well humans have transitioned from a labor economy to a knowledge-based economy and now knowledge is basically getting wrecked by AI so first AI got so good it could beat the best and chess players then it could find the best uh routes between two points like two best streets to take fastest route then it could be more complicated games like poker and go and what it talks about is that Elon Musk saw this happening and he was I think on the board of or an advisor to a company called Deep Mind and he's like oh deep mind's really interesting he meets the founder of Deep Mind this guy um Dennis uh I don't know how to pronounce his last name and he said he's basically like what are your views on AI safety because El on for a long time had been worried about AI safety and he walks away like I don't think this guy is really you know concerned with AI safety I think he's just trying to build really powerful AI okay whatever but he gets pretty worried because he finds out that Google is gonna try to buy Deep Mind and he's like well Google has the most data because they have emails they have search they have YouTube so he goes Google has the most data Deep Mind has a monopoly on AI talent and so they have the best AI talent and what the result will be is that AGI when it eventually gets done artificial general intelligence will be in the hands of you know the biggest Monopoly private company out there and he's like okay that's a little bit worrisome and he goes and he hangs out with uh Larry Page the founder of Google and he's telling him like Larry I'm worried about AI what are you guys doing about AI safety and he's like basically kind of the way Elon describes it he kind of say Pats him on the head oh don't worry about that we're not worried about that he's like well you know AI could take over and basically eradicate the human race if it you know goes there's a path where this goes wrong and he's like well that'll just be Evolution and he's like don't be such a speciest Elon and he's like species he's like yeah you're favoring the human species oh my God yeah I'm prum and so he gets really pissed about this and he he says that this is when he stopped talking to the CEO of Google so he after that that's like the trigger according to Elon and again I think a lot of this is Elon crafting a narrative I'm not sure I'm not saying that these things didn't happen but I think is very good at creating an origin story and creating a bad guy and then ping himself oh what do you know as the hero and so he here he goes so now what he does is he teams up with Sam Alman so Sam Alman who's the CEO of open AI in 2015 wrote The Following he goes the development of super machine intelligence at the time that's what he calling it SMI super machine intelligence is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity there are other threats but they are unlikely to destroy every human in the universe the way SMI could what a great what a great opening sentence all right Sam so Sam is worried about this elon's worried about this they get together because oh then there's the trigger Google's buying deep mind I I didn't know this uh the in the lawsuit it shows that uh Elon then went to the PayPal co-founder this guy Luke noek and tried to quickly like emergency raise $500 million to buy Deep Mind instead of gole just to keep it out of the hands of Google and he fails it he can't pull the deal together in the in the in the last minutes deep mind gets bought by Google and now now elon's really worried and so Sam Alman then goes to Elon and says hey why don't we create a nonprofit AI lab to catch up with Google and actually the origin of this was to do it inside why combinator where Sam was currently the president so I don't did you know that that the the origin of opening eye was actually supposed to be inside of YC and he called it what if we created the Manhattan project uh for AI and he's like what if YC did a call to arms and was like hey we need to develop this technology to the basic we need the anti-google like we need to get the best people we can to start working on this as a research project what he said originally was we'll give them equity and YC as their upside and so they can work on this as a nonprofit that was the original idea I think he said that like no person will have control over this thing that we're making and in said they were going to get equity and YC that's how they the be a nonprofit how do we pay these top AI researchers because Google's going to pay them a [ __ ] ton well we'll give them equity and YC YC is our our huge you know Cash Cow and so that'll solve that problem he's like we'll have a board of directors me you Elon and then we'll pick three others and like if it's he says this is the like initial email he goes if it's not obvious what the right thing to do is then the five of us will decide like that's the governance idea okay so that was the original idea it evolves a little bit by the way elon's reply to that email was great and so Sam wrote like a fairly casual I mean he used the verbiage like you said those sentences that are like a big deal but it was like a casual almost email with like five points and elon's reply was agree on all like that was it right I've moved straight to the end um so yes agree on all so they start and they're like cool we're making this nonprofit um and it'll be open source Elon comes up with the name open AI he's like let's just put it in the name uh this is open source AI and in the next five years Elon contributes $44 million to this nonprofit and they develop some pretty interesting Tech so so chat GPT now GPT 4 it's it can do it it's like it's in the 90th percentile at the lawyers like the bar exam it's in the 99th percentile uh for the GRE the verbal section it's a even a 77% at the advanced small EA test which I don't even know how that would work uh it's like the Somalia like the wine test um and so he's trying to in the lawsuit argue that it's already AGI which it's not but but he's trying to make that argument uh because his whole his whole legal case rests on this idea that there's been a breach of contract and they breached the founding agreement but there is no actual founding agreement what he's calling the founding agreement is like what we call the gentleman's agreement it's basically like a handful of conversations emails and then just like the initial founding like Articles of Incorporation of the of the company he calls all of that together the founding agreement he says they breach that but it's not actually a uh agreement I'm a [ __ ] and I don't know anything about legal stuff but I think that that actually counts as some I mean there's been I think there's precedent where that matters so but in this case basically he has to establish that there is a founding agreement and that it's been breached but if you go look at the founding agreement like those emails like one time they're talking about we could give equity and YC that's just like brainstorming that's not like the agreement then later they they do have a little bit more formal of like okay it's going to be a nonprofit it's going to be whatever ever but in the articles on Corporation it specifically says like um we will open source this you know whenever uh you know whenever we deem appropriate yeah V stuff it's vague right it's like we will release we will develop this for the benefit of humanity we're definitely doing this maybe someday exactly when we want and so they basically left themselves like complete latitude to do whatever the hell they want and that's what they did now what I think is interesting so Elon say a couple other things so one he says gp4 is already so good at like those test scores he goes and now they're developing this thing called qar have you heard about qar no what is it so qar is a reportedly like the new um what what what not reportedly rumored to be the thing that the open ad is working on that is like next next level after gp4 so it's like instead of GPT 5 they're using some method called qar which they think is like a leap in the intelligence um which is really exciting because even gpt3 to gp4 gpt2 to gpt3 like those were like pretty substantial improvements but not like a huge leap whereas houar reportedly is like what the huge leap is there's rumors where Sam Alman um came out and said you know like uh I was in a meeting like a de we did a demo or we had an internal meeting the other day and I S you know I saw something that like blew my mind like basically saw something that just like was all inspiring and it's like what what is it and he hasn't shared any details this is also right when the that big coup happened they fired Sam Alman one of the one of the rumored reasons was when this could be total [ __ ] we don't know this is one of the rumored reasons was the the board saw that how powerful qar is and they were worried Sam is way too fast and way too loose lucyi way too aggressive and now this weapon is getting too too powerful is kind of that idea there so anyways he talks about Elon talks about that in the lawsuit that they're developing qar and whatever so it's kind of like confirmation that this thing exists um although the fun the legal language he uses in all this he goes at the start of every sentence every paragraph it says using knowledge and belief and basically it's like saying like we don't have evidence but like I know some things and I believe this to be true and then it says all the claims so who knows it's kind of like elon's claims a couple other big pieces of this so I want to read you some uh some Elon emails that that did get surfaced in this so one of the key things that happened early on was they had this dinner and at the it's Sam Alman it's Greg Brockman it's Elon and then it's this guy Ilia Ilia was the Le you know one of the leading deep deep learning researchers at Google and he became the chief scientist of open AI the big turning point was he Elon recruited Ilia away from Google to open AI this is when Larry Page stopped talking to him because he was so pissed that you recruited my like top guy and you declared war basically and recruiting him was like a herculan effort basically getting him to leave Google and Google was offering him like a blank check this a [ __ ] movie and exactly this will be a movie for sure um so then Google starts offering all of their talent like crazy lavish offers they just up the Annie like crazy they're like we're gonna price anyone out of this Market how much do you know uh million like I don't know like millions of dollars per per employee minimum for some people 105 million um a pay package annual and so it was like okay well uh Sam and Greg email Elon saying hey it's getting really hard to recruit um you know we have to think of a strategy here Google is doing this Elon replies he goes we need to do what it takes to get top talent let's go higher if at some point we have to revisit what our current people are getting paid that's fine either we get the best people in the world or we will get whipped by Deep Mind whatever it takes to bring on the ace Talent is fine by me deep mind is causing me extreme mental stress if they win it will be really bad news with their one mind to rule the world philosophy they are obviously making major progress and they should give the talent level of talent over there and so he basically gives them the green light like I'll keep funding more go get the best talent and so in 2016 he gives him 15 million in 2017 he gives him 20 million in that 5-year period he gives him 44 million dollar in total now the problem is Elon the biggest backer and the original backer says he doesn't own anything in open AI the for-profit company and the this is the strongest part of his case here's what he says he goes how is it that you can create a nonprofit company that is supposed to be nonprofit and open source raise millions of dollars from people you take $50 million from me you hire the best people in the world and you you write down that this is your Charter and then you end up a closed Source maximum for-profit company owned by the most valuable company in the world Microsoft owned 49% by them how is that possible and he's like two things he goes if he goes if it is possible to create a nonprofit hire people and basically fund all of the research on uh you know basically like in a tax donation way where you for every dollar you're putting in you get 50 Cent rebate back from the government um he's like if that's possible and then you could just flip to a for-profit when you make breakthrough technology why is everybody not doing that why is that not just the default for every single technology company in the world either it's illegal or everybody should be doing it it can only be one of those two things and I love this argument from Elon I think this is a tremendous argument and there's no answer to that question yet of either this is illegal or every single company in the world is going to do this why would you not we are we you and I are not I wouldn't I'd say we are fans of Elon elon's work but we're we're lukewarm on him as a human being and we are only hearing one side of the story but in the last 10 minutes only knowing what I know just from those 10 minutes he's right yeah so then he gives this analogy again master of PR he goes it's like if I donated to a nonprofit charity that said we're going to save the Amazon rainforest and then that charity took all our money and then they created a for-profit Logging company that was just cutting down trees in the rainforest and selling the lumber that's what's happened that is open Ai and so he says it is a de facto subsidiary of Microsoft and he goes He includes this quote and this quote I think is going to become very problematic I predict it's going to become very problematic for Microsoft in the future so it's the Microsoft CEO saying remember when all the open AI drama was going down and Microsoft stock price started to tank because they were like oh [ __ ] you put you've given $10 billion or whatever to open Ai and they're about to like collapse this is bad for Microsoft and they're going to go create like a new company that you don't own that's bad um and so then he came out and he said this publicly he goes if open AI disappeared tomorrow we have all the IP rights all the capabilities we have all the people we have the compu we have the data we have everything we are below them above them around them the the CEO of Microsoft said that wow yes exactly and so that also weakens the case that open AI is this like nonprofit non-controlled by Microsoft entity when he came out and said that we are below them above them and around them God damn what a what a what a phrase dude this is U riveting this is riveting that's me when I if I go to Chick-fil-A and I order nuggets I'm below them I'm above them I'm around them I have them mine like dude that's a what a what a phrase the uh by the way the the way they call this the Manhattan Project the best that is the best that is so good all of this is just epic can you imagine these nerdy uh AI Engineers who were probably like bullied and were dorks throughout all the years now they're like oh me you want me no boys come on let's be civil about this they're just getting fought over and we're talking about $5 or $20 million a year packages that's insane everything about the story is insane you're right this needs to be a movie if you're making the movie or you want to make the movie of this get in touch with me let's let's create the movie of this this is going to be like The Social Network movie all over again uh an epic photo collage or something like that would also suffice too like just like some some neat photos with captions that tells a story I'm into that um I want to leave it with this so dares sha dares is the founder of HubSpot and you and I have talked to him a bit he's on this podcast all the time he's doing this thing on AI uh that I want him to come talk about hopefully he will he told me something that I tell myself all the time when thinking about this which was basically daresh is super into AI he goes to a lot of conferences on it like Insider conferences I would think that of he has a good grasp of it he has said it's not probably going to be as good or as bad as you think it's going to be and him saying that in a calm like fatherly voice to me that's like been the one thing that I've I've been thinking about of like Sam Alman I think he's a great guy and I love Sam uh I don't know him but it just as like a fan of his uh I think that the all these guys in this game are also brilliant marketers and Brilliant business people and Brilliant at the skill of programming and making this stuff but I also think that they're brilliant at PR marketing and I have to remind myself constantly that it could be good it could be bad it's probably going to be right in the middle though of what the reality is going to be in the middle and these guys are just excellent at telling their story do yeah and we should say uh you know Elon is compet creating a direct competitor to open AI right like grock uh he has he has xai which is uh like his uh his AI company it's his AI competitor to open Ai and he has grock which is the competitor to chat GPT that's like the product name so he obviously has you know interests in this and I think you know one thing that's clear out of this is it's definitely Mission driven like in the same way that um I used to think when it was like oh Jeff Bezos is doing a rocket company it's like oh is this just like a giant dick measuring contest between like billionaires like just the last level of the game is you say I I win Earth okay let me go win Mars now right like that's kind of what it seemed like was oh I'm gonna build a bigger rocket than you but then you read that like even 25 years ago basos was like really obsessed with the idea of space travel and um has been a giant fanatic about it and been trying to donate to it and trying to advance the cause in that and that now like even with these companies he's in all the engineering meetings and the planning meetings every week it's like okay this wasn't what I thought it was in the same way by the way it could still it could be that and that's okay it could be Mission driven and ego driven and profit driven and that is okay to have all those things too that's a better way of putting it yeah like most things uh it's accelerating because of multiple causes multiple there's multiple things multiple Tailwinds pushing it but I would say like the hater and me wanted to discredit it but the realist in me when I go back and read old interviews or watch old videos before Amazon was super successful it uh it becomes clear that actually was a deep interest so similarly here even though I think it's part of it is he's trying to bog open AI down with a lawsuit and spin the pr battle in his favor uh and he has a direct competitor it's clear that opening ey wouldn't have even would not have existed it would not have been successful had he not genuinely had this fear and concern and belief about what needs to happen with AI long time ago so you know that I think that's that comes out very true this there there's a paper trail of evidence what a [ __ ] pod I feel amped and scared excited nervous I

bad as we think but Sean Bravo you did a good job this was a great good pod uh and we'll end it there that's the pod [Music] h

all right everyone this episode is going to make a bunch of people angry I think it's going to make a bunch of people angry and here's why so we're going to discuss renting versus buying I saw recently on Tik Tok or something like that there were so many people complaining that it's too expensive to buy a house and they're complaining about renting and I've got a surprise I think it's way better to rent and I'm going to explain my reasoning and I know that on the surface that's going to make a lot of people angry but hear me out and we have my friend remit safety REM is famous for writing a book called I will teach you to be rich he also has a famous Netflix show called I will teach you to be rich and he gives his explanation as well I think this might anger a bunch of people listen to the entire thing before you judge and then comment on YouTube so go to YouTube and comment and let me know what you think and by the way I just looked at YouTube right now 70% of people who watch our videos are not subscribed to our channel that is ridiculous to me because we have a gentleman's agreement with with this podcast and what that what does that mean that means if you've ever listened to more than one video or listened to more than one podcast you need to go to YouTube go to my first million and click subscribe we call it the gentleman's agreement because we can't track that you're actually doing it but Sean and I and people like R me we make content for you all the time and all we ask in exchange is just click and subscribe it means very little to you it cost you very cost to nothing and it means a lot to us so please do that and I hope you enjoy today's episode and let me uh let me know what you think in the comments of YouTube if you agree or disagree renting versus buying all right let's get to [Music] it all right we're live R me so today I had you on because you and I are a little bit of an agree an agreement on a few topics one of them being that even if we think that you can afford it which I'm sure we could we could afford to buy a home we actually prefer to rent and most people at least online and amongst even our friend group think that that's insane and I wanted to have you on to discuss kind of your opinion on buying versus renting because it's got some of the numbers behind it and we're going to get tons of comments we're going to try and defend our argument against all of them before they actually come I don't need to defend it I'm I already know the answer like there's no defending it's math it's basic math here's my position let me state it very clearly because for the last 13 years I've gotten about 150 comments a day telling me that I'm stupid and I think I turned into the Joker around 2012 when you know random people were telling me it never makes sense to rent you're always throwing money away on rent you're not building any Equity uh Equity is really important and what are you going to leave to your kids and on no I don't want to pay my landlord's rent ETA well and you actually do a funny job by the way of sharing the comments that you get on all your YouTube videos typically the comments are something like land is always a good investment or yeah uh you're not really wealthy if you don't actually own land people people tell me that I'm poor because I don't own a house first of all that's actually quite insulting because not everyone can afford to buy a house doesn't mean you're poor just because you're renting there actually a lot of people who rent by choice including me and potentially you um but anyway let's okay here's my position for the biggest purchase of your life which for almost everybody is a house you have to run the numbers because sometimes it's financially beneficial to buy and other times it's financially beneficial to rent and this this should not be controversial it's like very straightforward simple especially if you have lived in a High Cost of Living City New York San Francisco LA I've lived in all three cities however for some reason saying that basic concept is like me telling everybody that the sky is green and by the way you said sometimes it is profitable sometimes it isn't there's a a third part of that sentence which is also who cares uh like that that is an important thing when people when so usually my take on this situation I try my hardest never to use um certainty like C certain words so I I I'll never say always or never that's nonsense that's crazy to say that um but usually my take is or my take now is historically in many cases in fact maybe even most cases it is buying a home is not more profitable than renting and what people say is well I shouldn't so why are you buying home they'll say and like well because it makes me happy why did I buy a steak last night you know why did I do this other stuff this you know it makes me happy yeah my other point is that doesn't mean it's a horrible investment I'm just saying compared to the Alternatives I actually think it's not great and then and people will say well but I made money on my house and this house I've done it before and I say yeah it can happen sometimes yes it definitely happens sometimes and particular particular and those and they'll also say so should I never invest in real estate it's like no because uh investing in a apartment building or some type of development where it's the intention is Cash flowing and the intention is number one investment many times be a great idea but historically if you look at the trailing 50 years of the S&P 500 of the average uh home uh growth annual growth rate and and rent that is of equal quality if you just run the numbers I think more often than not in fact not sometimes yes sometimes no more often than not it's actually not as profitable or it's less profitable to buy than it is to rent have you ever done like the historical math I've seen the historical math on uh how the appreciation of homes purchased homes which shockingly for over about a hundred years is right around inflation people find that very hard to believe it's like three and a half percent I think yeah and and what they typically will say their first response is is quite funny they go my house went up 26% in the last two years and I go hm I wonder if anything historically a historical aberration happened in the last four years such as a worldwide pandemic and generational shifts I wonder but that comment is actually quite revealing because it reveals recency bias the fact that what happened to us in the last two or three years is something that we extrapolate will happen forever you hear people saying this all the time they're like remember when we were younger it's like um people would say stuff like Myspace is always going to be on top like it's dominant that changed people believe that right now about Amazon Facebook Apple that will change in our lifetime when there's a major world war people believe things will never recover they do so if you want to be a great investor you know you got to look at a big big big picture and sure things have appreciated that's awesome for the people who own a house and they can make their payments I think that's awesome I'm really happy for them but I still made more money renting than I would have owning and by the way I'm in the category where I I currently own a home I own my home now I'm moving and I'm renting a house I'm I haven't decided if I'm going to sell my house or rent it out I'm making that decision in the next couple weeks but if I decide to sell it I'm actually going to made a profit because I got very I got very lucky and uh it it just it worked out now but here's I I got to tell you something you said something the other day on Twitter that I really liked um you said the the older I get the more I appreciate what role luck played in My Success what I said was and what I believe is basically when I started my career it was like pull yourself up by your bootstrap make it happen like it's only I'm the only one responsible for my wins in losses and I actually think that that's an all right attitude to have when you're like doing it because you think the internal locus of control like it is up to me I have to do something great but then when things work out in my favor I reflect after a few years and I'm like oh my gosh like that worked out like perfectly and it had nothing to do with me it just like for example when I sold the company the CEO of HubSpot a few days after the deal closed he got into a life-threatening accident and had that happened three days before or one or 10 one week or two weeks before the deal closed everything could have changed and that had nothing to do with me it just was luck and so there are many examples where like it just got lucky and in the case of selling my home and buying my home everyone thought it was not going to be a good investment and I didn't think it would be either and it just totally got lucky that that is luck I think that it's okay to be lucky it's actually great fantastic sometimes luck strikes let's take it fantastic but I also think super important to be honest about when you are good or when you are lucky so I have a question for you because I found that when people buy a house they rarely want to rent afterwards and so now you're going to rent what does that feel like for you all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we used we just Chang the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you could check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM so I'm moving to a place where I intend to rent I don't know how long I'll rent it for two years five years don't know um and I wanted wanted to rent a completely furnished home and the reason being is I don't want I didn't want to own much of anything I didn't want to own a lot of stuff because I have a small house in in Austin and it's 2200 square feet I have to fix stuff all the time and that's a small place and I have historically rented for three months out of the year when I go to and visit family in New York and I love it I love being able to call someone and just say fix this please uh it it just it it brings so much joy that I don't have to like go and like find a vendor or like fix something myself and so it feels like there's a burden lifted off a little bit of my shoulders that's what it feels like um just from looking at you I would have assumed you like to fix stuff I do like to fix stuff uh but only stuff that I like to fix so for example like I like to do Legos that's fun for me I like to work on old motorcycles but I don't want to have to fix like an electrical thing in my home that it's reliant on like I don't have light tonight if I don't fix this okay now looking at me you also agree that I like to fix stuff too right a lot of tools a lot of grime under my fingernails right if I had to guess you have never stepped foot in a Home Depot only the last time I went was when my dad made me go which I was probably like 11 years old yeah my goal my rich life is to never set foot in a Home Depot ever again ever so far I'm 41 years old I've done it I think I can keep it going okay and so that's great that you know what you want so when you're thinking of the buying versus renting thing is what percentage of your equation is on math and numbers and what percentage is on emotion and happiness great question in the beginning almost all on numbers so when I was renting in San Francisco it was a steal basically the amount that I would have paid to own it was close to two times more for an equivalent place then I moved to New York and I had a place in New York a pretty nice place and I would always keep my eye on the real estate market Just for kicks and I was tracking stuff and of course every year I would negotiate my rent and in a 11-year period my rent went down four times this is in Manhattan so a lot of people think like rent only goes up no it doesn't depending on where you live even depending on the segment you're in rent can go down uh at that point in New York when I ran the numbers for an equivalent place that was just two buildings over same view same square footage same everything it would have cost 2.2 times more to own than to rent so let me break down the math because this is I was mathematically oriented let's pretend that I was paying 5,000 a month okay if I was paying 5,000 a month to rent then to own that place when I factor in taxes um maintenance opportunity cost of the down payment transaction costs all of it can wait let me ask you about those numbers so for opportunity cost do you assume seven and a half percent 7% okay so you assume 7% and then for maintenance what do you what do you assume 2% of the property value a year uh I in New York yes in other places I would go lower but New York is just inherently more expensive okay and then uh and then in some buildings or apartment versus other stuff you'd have HOA New York correct like thousands per month very expensive yeah I I have friends who have an HOA that's 5,000 a month uh very expensive yeah that's totally normal in a highend building in New York completely normal um all right so you have opportunity cost you have maintenance you have HOA uh what else do you factor transaction costs when you buy and sell it's a massive real 4% uh I for get the calculation I used back then but it's like hundreds of thousands of dollars for a unit of that when you count both ends okay and then Furniture this is something not to be missed you don't get the same Furniture in a rental as you get in a place you bought for a lot of money you get nicer Furniture you need to factor that in you need to be honest also Renovations people are not really renovating their rentals but they're renovating their other ones so I factored it all in okay and again you can play with the assumptions in New York I always prefer to estimate High what do you use for the future growth do you use three and a half% uhow I used three uh I used 3% for rental growth uh and I used I think a three and a half or in the ballpark of that for owning again we need to factor in appreciation because there are a lot of buildings in High Cost of Living cities they lose money every year but they make it on appreciation okay so I factored it all in I was like wait a second if I'm paying Grand over here sample number it would cost me 11 Grand per month to own the same basic unit with the same view Etc I go um I'm good I'll take the 6K per month I'll invest it and that's exactly what I did and I've been doing that for like close to 20 years so that turns into a lot of money over time and you get to live in amazing places now that's the math part but at a certain point when my wife and I decide to buy which one day we probably will do you have a time frame or like not a time do you think that maybe in the next five years you might or is it just whenever you probably probably not in the next five but after yeah probably like after that that's my guess but when we go to make that decision my goal with anything really important in my life is that I don't want cost to be the number one consideration I don't want it to be number two or even number three I want to have enough money that I can go and be like that's what I want it's it's totally irrational but it's exactly what I want and I don't really care what it costs is your mentality uh okay so money is number three or number four I think you said four or five on that list so in is your mentality going into buying a home do you think it's going to be like I would like to not lose money on this or if possible I want this to be a store of value or something like that no I will lose a huge amount of money it will be the worst financial decision I ever make it will cost me Millions it will cost us Millions I know that it's okay well but you said that money you said money's number four so if it's number four no I don't want it to be number one number two number three it's going to be like a distant number like give you an example my wedding when my wife and I got married i' had been saving for like over a decade well before I knew her because I knew you know I'm Indian I want to have an amazing wedding and I don't want cost to be relevant at all you should brought that up your first date like hey I I've been saving for our wedding by the way that's not weird that's not weird at all that's what people uh often in the personal finance Community want you to do though they're like pull out your Roth ey show them your allocation I'm like uh can you guys go on a first date for once in your life please like during dessert you're like what's your credit score and by the way can we go over our budget for our wedding so that that was an example where I knew that something inevitable was going to happen one day I was going to get married I wanted to be married one day and I was like this is going to be awesome and I don't want cost to be relevant at all okay within reason but like I was happy to pay a lot same for a house it's a luxury purchase it's not an investment it's a horrible investment in a high cost of living area so I'm just approaching it as a pure luxury as if I was going and buying a beautiful sweater car whatever I don't care I'm gonna lose money it's pure desire you said that you want to be able to buy cash will you get a mortgage or does that depend on the rates maybe uh maybe so one I have 10 Money Rules they're online and um one of the rules is be able to pay in cash for any large purchases such as wedding honeymoon car house now people always like what the hell are you talking about pay for a house in cash and the origin of this is I had a mentor when I was an intern much younger and he told me he said R we have a no debt policy in our house no debt I said wow in my head I'm thinking must be nice the guy lived in a very elite Bay Area city as I got older and my business grew I started to realize that actually takes discipline to have a no debt policy in your house now we can quibble about whether debt is good or bad and sometimes it's leveraged and whatever but just the idea that he had a philosophy a point of view on debt I really love that and so I one day when we buy a house I want to make sure sure we have enough somewhere in our net worth that if we wanted to we would pay with cash will we do it if it's a 1.5% mortgage no we'll take that mortgage all day but I I'm not going to buy a house that we don't already have the uh available cash for purely as a matter of discipline and uh I want to ask you about like your uh future home like what what you want to what like what the attributes will be but what you are uh does does it factor in how often you're going to move so for for my rules for buying a home the one of the rules I have is I want to live there for 25 years dude you and I agree on so much basically all of our podcasts are two Bros agreeing with each other like that's it it's I love it okay I totally agree when we go to buy a house the the general suggestion I give to people is you better plan to live there for at least 10 years I I I think the same way longterm let me explain the math behind it because this is quite counterintuitive as well so you we've all heard the phrase uh you're throwing money away on rent I go uh how come you don't say the same thing when you go eat at sushi on Saturdays you're throwing money away on Sushi or how come you don't say you're paying your sushi owner mortgage how come we only use that real ridiculous sneer for a landlord I don't care if a landlord makes money as long as I'm making money everybody can make money it's great in the case of buying a house and staying there and then moving in a few years it's usually a really big Financial mistake let me tell you why I uh I ran a quick calculation before we talked let's take the median house it's like $417,000 let's even be conservative let's say you put 20% down which is pretty hard to do but let's just say you do do most people do 20% or less I think they do less especially now because it's so unaffordable that's a median price house that's really expensive um let's say you have 7.1% interest I calculated with really good credit but that's the interest rate right now now 7.1% okay listen to this this is going to blow your mind everybody you are paying more in interest than in principle for the first 20 years not one year not two years for 20 years only in year 21 are you paying more towards the principle then you are an interest so in other words for all the people who leave me hundreds of comments every single day saying why are you throwing money away to rent so dumb so I just have one simple answer I don't like to throw money away on interest do you think that your opinion and this is more so because I know you get these comments all the time and I'm recently in this category and I'm reflecting on how I feel do you think that your opinion would change if you had two or three kids family definitely factors in for sure in fact I was going to ask you how how does family factor into your decision but it's so interesting because you're choosing to rent right now I love that well it's for me it's it's going to fact in when she's of school age uh she's not I have a four-month-old um and so that's why I said the and so by the way the lease that I got I negotiated down a significant amount and I got them down by signing a two-year lease and uh paying six months up front or so good uh and so like I think we got a it's like a 30% discount that's amazing yeah it was a significant discount um because we we did a two and then I called them and I go look like I'm the we are the perfect tenants because we are we have stable jobs we uh like we don't party we I've got a newborn like we are the I'm the best possible tenant you could ever want but like at what point did you say by the way have you ever heard of my first Mill never I actually don't like bringing that up okay I have to tell you something so my friends are always like after my Netflix show came out they're like dude so like what's it like being famous like you get into any restaurant you want and I was like what like what are you talking about they're like don't you have like your agents called and like get you into what and I'm like is this what people do cuz if so I need to learn I need to learn how to name drop my first million no first of all I never named that and second of all I'm not famous I I when people make fun of me and like as my friends and they'll say I'm famous I'm like no I'm popular amongst a handful of nerds so anyway for me for factoring uh for with children um I think that like when they're of school age uh and like school if we decide to go to public school school district matters um things like that and in which case buying will be a no-brainer but my and I'll talk about this in a second but my whole thing with the hardest part about me deciding when to buy is is not the rules it's deciding what I want so uh the hardest part is like seeing like what features of a house do I actually care about and so what I love to do is when I uh I go and visit my family uh in different parts of the country all the time I purposely actually rent a variety of airbnbs so like sometimes I'll splurge and I'll rent a 10,000 foot place other times I'll rent a really small apartment uh other times I'll rent a place in the city sometimes in the suburb and so I get to live for two weeks or whatever just to see what is this lifestyle like and do I like it I'll give you an example I love that I used to want to buy a brownstone in Brooklyn I thought they looked so cool I rented one for a month and it was a lot of money and I splurged and what I found is they stink like the even the like for what my preference is an old or a renovated Brownstone is still an old building that things break all the time and like you hear the and so like I got to I got to like test that out you know what I'm saying so I do that all the time uh when you're when you're thinking about buying a place what attributes do you want it to have I have a very very specific and growing list because like I said it's a luxury so a luxury means you get exactly what you want it's not about price it's about getting exactly what you want how long's your list it's pages P bullet points yeah just bullet points for example so we rented an Airbnb that's amazing right that we can test it amazing amazing and honestly like a huge gift to be able to be like oh I can live in a different house that I would never have access to and living there even for a week you see things you didn't so we rented an Airbnb one time and the owner was a chef oh wow well it made a lot of sense because the kitchen was like extremely efficient like I found I I'm not in the kitchen a lot but I found myself just enjoying being there and it's because uh I later learned there's something called like the kitchen triangle or something and it's like a highly efficient way of setting your kitchen up and then I connected the dots oh this is a chef so they knew what they were doing like two dishwashers things like that exactly like it's all within reach so you're not wandering around so good um I also you know I love hotels right so every time I go to hotels which I consider the best hotels have the absolute best designers the best Hospitality the best thinking about what's going to make an amazing experience so I go for example the best uh bathroom in the world that I've ever encountered is at Aman Kyoto it's amazing so what makes it amazing okay first of all so they have a beautiful mirror the the lighting looks incredible the setup huge counter space beautiful hokei wood right behind you toilet in a separate room the Toto toilet alone I think is $220,000 and it looks like a spaceship it's incredible our friend Noah has one of those oh really that's cool I think I think so it's like a really expensive like smart toilet right wait hold on are you sure Toto has like 20 models well I don't know which I I know that it was uh uh like north of $10,000 and it has like a and it has like a remote control Noah okay that that's amazing I did not know that wouldn't it be funny if we got Noah on right right now we're like Noah join this link right now and then we're like Noah show us your toilet and he's like show you I'm sitting on it right now no it's a fancy to and he uh he as a gift he bought Neville one as well a really fancy toilet wow so Neville had and they have like remote controls enough that like Neville's family member came and visited and they were really intimidated because they were like I don't know how to work this toilet it is a little um nerve-wracking for sure so you want a fancy bathroom you want an efficient kitchen a couple other things bedrooms small I'm noted in a huge bom I don't want a couch in the bedroom it's so irrelevant it's so Dum small um I want a place to put packages because we get a lot of packages and I don't like seeing cardboard everywhere in the South they call that a mud room you want a mud room a a mud that's what they call it great I like that um we want uh well uh I I my vision is multiple Pavilion so three small houses like or structure um one would be an office physically separate one would be a guest house physically separate and one is a house I don't like a house that's huge I don't like uh anything I don't like anything above 3,000 square feet I find it quite cavernous um and so humanized um my parents taught me this really interesting thing you know we grew up we didn't have a lot of money we have a pretty big family and I was asking my dad you know as I got older like how did you decide to buy a house how' you calculated all this stuff he's like let me give you a piece of advice he goes don't get too big of a house I was like what how come you say that he goes if you have too big of a house kids will go into different areas and they won't congregate you want them to congregate because that's how you build a family I was like whoa dude I uh interviewed this guy uh on Tuesday or Wednesday or yesterday or something like that and he has a 25,000 foot home he was telling me like I was like what's the expenses for that he was telling me all the all the answers and I was like how much time do you spend a week like managing vendors he goes go like he's like 15 or 20 hours a week I'm spending he he's retired so he's like I kind of like doing it cuz I don't have anything to do okay uh and he's like at the time I was divorced and remarried a woman who had a bunch of kids and I had a bunch of kids and it was cool to have and then they grew up and they had kids and so I like this is our compound that everyone hangs out he goes but now I'm trying to downside it's just too much work I can't handle it yeah and he's like I'm just he's like I can't change the light bulbs like they're just like because they're too high I'm not going to get on a ladder he's like just way too much work um and so because I was think about size I'm trying to decide how big I want I I think I actually want like 5,500 uh square feet 5500 square feet yeah um and the reason why I like that is because my in-laws can come and stay there and basically live and have their own room and they could be with my family and it could be and it's and it doesn't feel like it's a burden that they're just living and and they could work from the house and I and and by the way working from home in ordeal now uh where like and plus I record for a living so I would need a dedicated room for that my wife wife needs a would like a dedicated room um and I want space for in-laws and I have out of town family I want them to be able to make themselves at home and not feel like they're a burden on me and so that's kind of how I decided on my square footage is about 55 to 6,000 okay I I'll tell you what I I like that it all kind of makes sense you go I need this I need that and then it expands I think that also brings me to the list the it's not just about the house so I went one level up because when when um my wife and I moved to LA um one day I was like let's go let's go take a driving tour of the most expensive houses in the city so I found like all the expensive neighborhoods and then we just drove around Bair all these places most of them have huge Gates but you can kind of see through and and you're talking like1 million homes 50 to 100 million yeah yeah exactly so I was like write down that address and we would look it up later and sometimes there's photos it's pretty cool just to see and um as I was going through this I you know while you're driving there for a minute especially as an entrepreneur you're like I could live here RIT Sati Bel Air you know like you're like kind of falling into the vision and then I got home and I was like what the hell am I talking about like I have a very small list of things that are absolutely important to me and guess what's number one on that list walkability same walkability so how am I going to have a b a house where there's literally no sidewalks and then also reconcile that with walkability and that's why I think it's so important for us as you as you get to know yourself to just create a simple list of values because otherwise even I will get enchanted by some cool thing I see like oh Bellair so cool and then I buy this thing that I don't even want or it could be a car it could be a shirt it could be whatever so just having those values to remind you what is actually important to you the place that I rented the the second biggest reason why I did it was it's across the street from a weekly Farmers Market I love that so simple and I just like I just want to eat like fresh vegetables and fresh meat uh and that was like an deal was that it's just across the street from a farmer's market I love that and does this when you're this methodical about buying a home are you this methodical about all the other things you like to purchase on a daily or weekly basis well I think you should be this methodical for the largest purchase of your life that's what blows my mind is people just literally buy a house and they spent more time researching their local steakhouse I'm like what what so no uh I'm not as methodical no I don't spend years deciding you know what brand of chips to buy but I do I do like a couple of rules that kind of make life simple like you I don't want to have to be consumed with stuff I find that just like that older guy you mentioned we buy stuff with good intentions right it's like I worked hard the American dream I'm GNA buy a car a house Etc and then suddenly we blink our eyes and wake up one day and it's we spend 50% of our time fixing stuff and repairing stuff and thinking about stuff I don't want stuff I find that sometimes when people buy stuff their world shrinks it's like oh I got to work on this uh the roof thing outside you can see how little I know about houses that's the only example I'm like the roof and yet I want to expand I want to be like talking to friends traveling trying new foods doing my business I don't want to be focused on a light bulb that's not of interest to me so tell me what your opinion on this is so I'm actually methodical about uh iring just things on a daily basis like what So like um I don't have an Amazon Prime membership I just found myself buying like $5 extension cords or like a USB thing that I don't that I don't need like because because a I uh I don't want like all the packaging coming to my home like it's I think it's ridiculous just that the sometimes I have to spend more money and it's not the money but it's just the energy of just like the actual energy in terms of what it's doing to the environment but also like my mental space of like I have to spend money to get someone to come over to get rid of all the boxes because it doesn't fit in my trash can um but B it t takes so much clutter and so I've actually created a handful of rules when it comes to just buying things on a daily basis tell me um tell me yeah so the first one is when possible I try to buy for life and so that could mean a fancy leather jacket so like let's say I want a leather jacket I'll spend more money than uh than I then I'll buy the nicer thing in hopes that it can last for 30 or 40 years and and like it'll can be classically like it's it a classic style or it could patina nicely things that can last for a long time I do that with cars as well I like to buy something that I think can last for a long time because I don't want it's it's a little bit of cost like just transaction cost but it's like Financial cost but it's more so the mental cost of just like having too much stuff the other thing that I do is I actually think that recycling is nonsense I think that most of recycling in America just gets thrown into the garbage and so I prefer to just Reduce Reuse so I just like the amount of energy that an Amazon truck takes to get something to my house that it got from China overseas with this huge ship uh and like all the energy that goes into that I find that to be just it hurts my heart of like how much waste it is just for me to buy this like silly USB thing that I could have just gotten at Target without all the packaging do you know what I mean and so I I prefer just to reduce and reuse um and then finally I try to be super intentional of like I bought a weighted vest the other day uh because I like to wear a weighted vest when I take the baby for a walk it's actually a fun way to like get a little exercise and so I try to be intentional of just being like all right which type do I want how much weight do I think I want for this weighted vest when in the past I've just like bought I've bought three of them and I'll be like oh I'll just see whatever's cool like they're it's only $25 and so I just try to be a little bit more intentional about intention about what I'm going to acquire to make sure that that's the one I really really want because I don't want my home full of clutter because it makes my brain cluttered yeah I totally agree wow um amazing I love those I love how int you are that you just have them uh I have to say that um I think we kind of grew up fairly similarly like socioeconomic like similarly my my mother was a teacher and my father was a small business owner and he didn't yeah he did okay but that was when I was in high school yeah okay so um it's so interesting that often you know on my podcast I speak to these couples about money and sometimes there are trends that emerge um from different types of couples so for example one Insight that is quite obvious if you ever listen is uh parents who have credit card debt can never say no to their kids 100% of the time they have an inability to say no to themselves inability to say no to their kids it's classic another one you'll find is that um people who have credit card debt sometimes I'll be like hey pick up your computer and take me over to your closet and they'll show me their closet and wow is that intimate well you had a lady on your show that like was kind of I don't know if she was broke but she she was in a money Crunch and she had tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of like purses and things like that yeah but the but the interesting thing she had a lot of money on the Netflix show Natalie but in in the couples that will off sometimes I'll ask them to show me their closet so they have financial problems they're overspending and I take them to the closet and they and I and usually they're kind of withholding they're not really opening up and so I say show me your closet they love it they open up because for many people their closet is their identity and I don't mind like I love my clothes and they start telling me and what you see in the closet is often chaos it's just tons and tons and tons of stuff and I'll say um hey uh if you were given the option to buy one $150 shirt or1 $115 shirts what would you take okay before I tell you what they say sam what would you say less quantity any day of the week exactly and they never say that they say I want more it provides me memories it shows me that I can get it Etc so what what I see is a class money socioeconomic status they all intersect and what you're talking about is so interesting because as you have made more money and you've kind of met people who have a lot of money you also realize that when you go into their houses there's a lot less stuff in there and it is really fascinating and extremely taboo to talk about in our culture about how what you see in someone's house tells you a lot about who they are their identity it is so revealing yeah and it creates huge amounts of headache this isn't just a financial thing this is a like um I think that like usually the desk where I work I need it to be clean um I think you said something you said something like um you're like I love beauty and if I surround myself in my home or my office with beauty I feel inspired and I feel more productive I don't need Beauty I'm not inspired by like particular paintings and things like that but I need it to be clean I need it to be clutter free so the desktop on my computer it is always empty and it's just white space I like that um you know there's this quote uh luxury is that which can be repaired and it strikes me when you talk about you know reduce and reuse same exact thing one one example I shared that people went berserk over they loved it was I have these shoes tennis shoes and the company that I bought from they're expensive and they do free repairs so what's the name of the company that's pretty cool it's Brunello Cinelli it's a high-end Italian brand and basically anything at at these like high-end Brands if it ever breaks or gets frayed or anything you take it in they'll fix it for you no questions asked there's no cost but it's very expensive on the front how much are shoes there I I I I know the brand but I've never looked at their shoes well I think those tennis shoes are like 700 bucks that's a lot but yeah but you know it's not really this service they doing it as a courtesy to me really they want you to bring in your $1,000 Cod got it which you've had for 25 years and they'll send it back to Italy where only they know how to perfectly repair it and then they'll ship it back awesome right which yeah it's amazing right so I posted this and I showed my shoes I wore some of these shoes on the show and I really like to you'll see me in sometimes the same outfits a lot because I want to wear my stuff I buy it I spend on it and then I want to wear it I don't want to just throw it out so I took these shoes and I took them to the store and they were like yeah no problem and it took months so the other thing about buying nice stuff is that you're often not going to get the speed that you would get if you ordered from Amazon Prime or something else like you go to H&M you're you're buying it right there on the spot you're tossing it Etc but uh or another fast fashion brand I should say but for this it's like months away anyway people loved it they loved the idea that oh my God free repairs free repairs where' I get stuff repaired for free free what they don't love as much is spending on quality in the first place right it's not about the free repairs like I can afford to get shoes repaired so can you but I think I like your mentality of like I'm going to be selective about what I buy and not just by quantity but really think about what's meaningful to me I think that's really cool yeah it's I think it's exhausting I remember um as we're preparing to move and I'm thinking like all right so we're going to spend money to ship this and I'm like but I don't even want this like I don't even want why why am I I don't even why do I want to ship this thing that I don't even want like it's kind of ridiculous yeah it's I I like how you kind of stop it before you even get it in the door like you're like I'm not even going to get Amazon Prime but I also think that once you have it in the door if something's in your house you can also like I do a quarterly closet cleanse that's in park because my wife is a personal stylist so she's taught me how to always cleanse and um it's just nice to get things out and it free up mental space you know when you open your closet or when you open your office or even your kitchen every day I want to feel good I want to open the fridge and things are in order I don't want to feel chaos like by 7:30 in the morning it's really challenging though by the way to throw away stuff uh it's like a I used to make I I read that I I would make fun of like a the hoarder TV show I'm like how are these people so ridiculous uh and then when you go through that process of actually cleansing out and and cleaning it it I don't know if it impacts you it impct me I get emotional I'm like oh but I've owned this thing for 15 years even though I've never used it it's actually it is it is hard and so I don't want to get into that rut yeah I agree I mean I I don't have an emotional thing but I do have a problem with piles like I get stuff and I just put it in a pile and then I like never get to the pile sometimes for years and it's just like why am I doing this like that's the one thing I really need to improve on as it relates to cleanliness because I'm like these piles do do not look good they don't feel good either so for the listener the takeaways and all this so we talked about running the math you get criticized online all the time and I think it's nonsense because all you're saying is run the math that's all you're saying and don't do and even if it is unprofitable do it anyway but don't kid yourself and say that that it's a good investment yes you can totally if you like I have a friend they lived uh they they moved to New Jersey New Jersey notoriously high taxes and they were like hey R we ran the numbers makes no sense and we're buying anyway because of schooling and because of location to work I go fantastic I give him a round of applause good job it doesn't matter to me if you buy a rent it only matters that you're actually calculating everything math is one part of it you need to know your numbers but also there are other things family uh you know just pure desire anything you want but you got to calculate at all you cannot simply say uh like I want like it's hilarious to me that so many 24y olds on Twitter are like my number one goal with money is Financial Freedom and then they spend 63% of their net worth on a 30-year mortgage it literally makes no sense you need to be sure you're actually using your money to live your rich life and part of that is calculating carefully the biggest purchase you'll ever make and I I wanted to ask one last thing which is amongst your friend group um is there a difference is there a pattern that you've known amongst people who earn a sign ific amount versus those who don't uh like I have a bunch of relatively High net worth friends who actually rent uh and yeah same have you seen a pattern in that uh it's the ones who are like especially Savvy with personal finance like and it's it's like um it's like me telling you Sam like hey Sam if you eat a lot you're going to get full and you're like yeah I know it's like yeah okay we know it's so simple when you understand it and you're not being blinded by this idea that I need need to buy a house and by the way this is like a lot of people in any expensive city um by the way for everyone listening did you know that it is currently more expensive to buy than to rent in almost every city in America that not did not used to be the case but with interest rates as they are and with the rising asset prices it is crazy that people are still recycling the old you know phrases of like you're throwing money away on rent when right now in almost every city it does not make Financial sense to buy all right man we're going to wrap up there I appreciate you doing this this is awesome I'm uh if you're listening uh I want you to go to our YouTube page uh type in you know if you're listening on podcasts uh like Spotify or iTunes go to our YouTube page so you know type in my first million find this episode I want you to put a comment if you agree or disagree with us I'm very curious and by the way be nice be nice about it all right that was very nice of you to say thank you Sam let me tell you something um you can always Rec recognize someone who has never been to a High Cost of Living City by the comments they leave I had a guy this just happened like two days ago he goes for me just such an idiot um I I make more money owning it's so much better Etc and so I you know I like to talk to people I like to ask questions say tell me more and I have this like very long conversation with him he bought a house for like $75,000 okay he lives in a very inexpensive City so in a city like that it actually makes a lot of sense here's my here here's my simple request for anyone leaving a comment before you leave a comment I want you to look up properties in Palo Alto or Meno Park and I want you to look up those properties and I want you to find a couple properties that have rented and have sold and I want you to understand the math of a really expensive city like Meno Park and pal you could do that with like Chicago as well or Atlanta like I bet you right now the numbers would actually still say tell you the same story you're totally right you're totally right I just want to show them like all the way in the most expensive cities in America because I want you to see that it is true in some cities it will never make Financial sense even after 30 years to buy and once you understand that you go wait a second so if that's true then what about Chicago what about Atlanta what about my own City let me take a fresh look at this and that's when you really start to master money when you take all the preconceived notions you have you go ah maybe that wasn't true let me analyze it for myself that's awesome I appreciate you and that's the [Music] pod

all right we're live Sean I've got a little bit a few actually stories but it starts with a person I hung out with out the other day you know Ryan holiday right the author Ryan holiday of course he came on the Pod he's awesome I was hanging out with him the other day and he said something actually to me in person but he previously said this on the podcast that we I think he's been on twice he said something about how he actually made a funny comment he's like most most authors say they make more money through speaking than they do actually selling their books those people they just didn't sell a lot of books [Laughter] [Music] however uh Ryan has sold a ton of books we know that for sure but he also mentioned to me that his other things like the daily stoic which is his daily newsletter so Ryan holiday wrote a book on stoicism he's written six or seven now at this point but he has his other property it's a daily newsletter called daily stoic where they sell coins and merch and advertisements he has told me that that has made more money for him than selling books like which is crazy because that's what he's known as as an author and so what I wanted to talk to you about today was I went down this huge Rabbit Hole where I found ways that authors are making money other than just like writing a book well you got you got to tell the coin thing because the coin thing is the perfect simple example of this I don't know what he confirmed exactly but explain the coin thing because I think it's the perfect simple example an author making money not off their book but a lot of money in some other way Ryan holiday's whole shtick is stoicism it's a philosophy that is fairly useful and it's just like how to deal with hardship in your daily life and for some reason he decided to come up with a coin and it's a coin that in Latin it says like you're going to die or like today's one of your last days alive or something like that like some like inspirational thing but it's in Latin so I'm not exactly sure what it says and a coin is a great product to sell because it costs 25 bucks to sell it costs like like a dollar to make it ships for whatever a stamp two stamps so however much that is 80 cents there's no returns there's no sizes it's just like the easiest thing ever to sell and on the podcast I don't remember if he said the exact number but I believe he said tens of thousands of coins which is millions and millions of dollars is that what he said he did he did say that and he also said that he works with some mint some mint in the United States and I guess it's it's one of the old famous coin mints and he I think he was like their biggest customer so like he's like they're minting more of his momento Mor coin than they are anything else so what I want to do and that was surprising to me I had an inkling and then he kind of revealed that that is true where he made more money not from selling books but I had uh I went down this rabbit hole and what I want to do is I want to show you three people who are making significantly more money than you would think and they are doing it in ways other than just writing one book making whatever 10% of the revenue that they of which they sell all right so we're going to start with the first one Sean do you know who James Patterson is I do not know who James Patterson is who is James Patterson I did not think you would know sandwiches maybe a former baseball player who are we talking about here you you are very smart you're a very high IQ smart person oh God here it comes the fact that you don't know some of the most basic things like of pop culture like it's it's beyond pop culture at this point this these are things that you see all over bookstores whatever it shocks me that you don't know this is he the vampire in Twilight yeah boyfriend who is this no okay your second guest was a lot further away from the first guest so listen to this so have you ever heard of this strap Meer Syndicate you probably haven't right of course if you haven't heard James Patterson you also probably haven't heard of Nancy Drew or The Hardy Boys have you heard of those things I know who those they write murder Myster they write mystery novels right for kids or something yeah yeah yeah so they are the main characters in murder mystery novel so the way it starts is in the 1930s there was this thing called the shrap Meer Syndicate it was this one guy he came up with this company in the 30s where he was like Hey not a lot of people are writing children's books I'm going to go ahead and start publishing children children's books and then he was like you know what I need to write more books but I don't feel like dealing with the hassle of working with these artists authors who like are just a pain in the butt to deal with all I care about is making like kind of cookie cutter novels that children like so what he did was he goes I'm gonna actually just come up with these characters so Nancy Drew The Hardy Boys and he had a variety of other series and I'm going to have these authors write these books but I'm just say it's written by the same author every single time I'm not going to give a person like their little bit of Fame I'm going to pay them a fair rate but it's and and and they're gonna follow my rules and maybe eventually they'll become a famous author but for now they're just going to follow my rules and that's what he did and there was at one point where like every kid in America could name Nancy Drew The Hardy Boys things like that Strat me Syndicate what a name uh so wait sorry The Syndicate is I think I missed something here The Syndicate is the set of novels The Syndicate was the name of his company he called it a Syndicate which sounds like a drug like a drug Syndicate it sounds like something illegal because usually s that was just the name of his company it was a legitimate company this wasn't like anything shady although he did a bad job of nameing it'd be like naming like your kids children's book like warm candy and vans or something like that like he did a very bad job of like naming his publishing company called The Syndicate kind of weird got but basically he came up with these rules where he was like all books need to be part of a series uh every chapter needs to end with a preview of what the next chapter is going to be the beginning of each book needs to give a summary of only one page what happened in the previous books and he just had this like outline of how to like make hits well fast forward 70 years there's this guy named James Patterson at this point now he's 75 years old he started uh in advertising in New York for the J Thompson advertising firm which just some huge firm but on the side died in his late 20s and early 30s he starts writing novels and they do okay like they're not like that big a hits um but he keeps at it and he's a workaholic and he keeps going and eventually at the age of 47 he retires from advertising and goes all in on publishing these novels so he's been doing it now at this point for about 20 years and he's finally starting to see success and the whole point of his novels is they're Thrillers some people might say they're kind of like trash formulaic Thrillers but the thing is is people love him and at this point he sold something like 500 million copies of his books and at one point he uh accounted for 16% or sorry 6% of all hard cover novels sold in America so the guy's a hitmaker he s he sells a ton of them but here's the craziest part since he started writing uh about 48 years ago he's published on average seven books a year and at this point even though he's 75 5 or 74 he's doing something like 30 books a year now how on Earth does a guy do that that's like ridiculous right at this point uh to be doing that it's ridiculous to be doing that at a young age it's more ridiculous to be doing in 70s well more than a book every two weeks it's ridiculous well here's how he does it he has co-authors and a little secret with James Patterson even you know he's well- loved in America he actually has only written about 20% like solely written 20% of the books that his name is is credited with as writing the way that he does it he has a team of uh of co-authors and so what he does is he pays these guys out of his own pocket he kind of comes up with a framework they flesh it out he reviews it almost like a movie script and he's like writes notes in the in the in the margins and he gives it back to them and they kind of flush it out and at this point he's done it so much that you'll see that there's James Patterson with Dolly Parton I think there's a James Patterson and then the co-author is Bill Clinton and then the other co-author who's like the person doing the actual work is listed below it but this has been so success successful that at this point he's made something like $800 million what yes that's how rich this guy is he owns like three or four homes each of them are worth 40 million bucks he's donated something like 50 million according to his website to small bookstores but this has been a smashing success I'm shocked you've not heard of James Patterson I think I have seen the name what's like his most famous book I don't even know the name of his books but he's almost like a do you know Tom Clancy yes okay he's like Tom Clancy does Tom Clancy do the same thing or does he write all his own books no Tom Clancy uh would write them but Jim Patterson does not write as much but you know like Jim Patterson at this point is sort of like Tom Clancy where you're like oh it's a Tom Clancy novel and I don't even know what Tom Clancy I can't even name his novels but I know it means like it's like a spy novel right okay so um let me ask you a question did this guy start out writing all his books and then over the years was like how do I scale and he's like what if I got another author or from the beginning was he like did he have this plan from the beginning or did this come about organically trying to scale up so over the last 20 years that he's been killing it I don't I don't think one of his books I'm not sure exactly but most of his books have not themselves been bestsellers however he has been a best-selling author if you add up all of his titles for many decades and he learned early on he was like well like I don't know if any of individually are going to be a hit but I'll just make a [ __ ] ton of them and so he discovered early onto on his career he goes we're going to be about quantity and at this point he says that for the last 40 years he's worked something like uh 70 hours a week and he writes all day and when we talk about writing it means working with a team and things like that but he discovered early on he's like we're just gonna do quantity we're gonna pump these babies out and so at this point Jim Patterson he's a face he's a guy he's a real person but it's almost like a brand and he's like gets these authors to kind of come under his brand and he makes jokes but he'll say things like they should pay these like these referring to as co-authors they should pay me to be a co-author because I'm teaching them so much and they're getting their name out there and he actually gives them press so they're able to like list but it's almost uh it's almost like the way the music industry works of like have Nicki Nicki Minaj coming on your song you have to pay Nicki Minaj you know what I mean right I like that that's the first one you went to Nicki Minaj um all right so this is interesting uh what what do you like about this guy you like that he basically to me one one thing I like is I feel he broke the like Precious rules of like like writing and book like being an author is this like high Prestige usually it's a high Prestige low volume labor of love uh you know that may you know almost never makes money and if it happens to make money you you kind of got lucky with this one Smash Hit And um you know the honor is in slaving away at this novel for four years and he's sounds like he broke all those rules he's not precious about it he's like cool let's write books people want to read read let's make it formulaic uh let's make it so that I can hire people that are going to write these books um let's scale this baby up no individual we're hitting singles and doubles baby we're not going for home runs necessarily because these will all add up and it sounds like the cool thing is that this guy almost like productized this type of book and treated it more like a business person than he did a artist well in reality what he is is he's he was he was the CEO of the Thompson Agency Group that's like a that's part of a huge corporation and he's basically an advertising executive turned author and he brings some of that Pizzazz to being an author and it has worked really well so he's both a business person am and an advertising person all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we used we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that works that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM let me give you two more that I think are even more interesting have you seen these books lately written by this guy named Jack Carr it's kind of all the rage right now I've I've heard the name but I I haven't read anything now all right so Jack Carr is a former Navy SEAL he served in the Navy Seals from 1996 I think to 2016 and he started writing these books called uh the first one was called the terminal list it came out in 2018 and if if you go to the terminal list on Amazon you'll see it's it's one of the highest reviewed books I've ever seen given the quantity of reviews it has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of reviews and it's like a 4.5 I read one of them two weeks ago I think I even suggested that you read it but it's really great it's basically like the equivalent of a romance novel for a woman it's like James Bond for the man it's like basically the story of a guy who goes through all these hardships where he's a he's an ex Navy SEAL his family gets hurt he's got a save them he's got to get revenge whatever all that like Epic Man [ __ ] however I started reading his book and I noticed something really interesting he names products and Brands like crazy in his books and I'll give you an example so this is a a few excerpts or one excerpt from from one of the books where he talks about he reached inside and removed the 9mm myth and Weston M39 from his chest better known in the SEAL Teams as the mk22 hush puppy and then he goes on to saying he grabbed a box of his 9 millimeter super Vel subsonic ammunition that was sitting next to his Yeti cooler he I swear to God he'll talk about things like for example he'll talk about like he sipped his athletic greens he names Brands like crazy like there was one point where he was talking about like they're like he needed the best most durable equipment so we started using a hill person fanny pack or something like that and I'm like like dude can we get like my he's like he he put on his headphones and turned on my first million his go-to on Tuesday and Thursday for all types of entrepreneurial inspiration and then dud he he named stuff like crazy and the the main character his name is James Rees he's like a James Bond type of guy where he does a lot of bad stuff but like you really like him and you kind of want to be like him and he just names all of the products that he uses and it's crazy and so I was interested I'm like why is this guy naming all these products so I go to his website I Googled jackar Brands I just Google that he's got this whole website I think it's just Jack car.com but if you Google uh jackar Brands uh what you'll see is he has Jack car.com and he creates do do you know like that website um unrate or uh uh gear Patrol he basically has created his own version of that where he has all these gift guides or he'll be like here's all the gear that uh James reest used in this book and he has these beautiful guides on his website and lo and behold if you highlight over a lot of them they're all affiliate links and in fact and in fact oftentimes on Jack car.com he sells his own stuff and so one of the main parts in this first book that I read is he's got this fancy Tomahawk which is basically like an Axe and he uses this Tom Tom Hawk to kill people and it's like a really high quality Tomahawk Well Jack car.com sells that exact same Tomahawk and I thought that this was brilliant because when reading these stories he's talks about the cars that he's in like the type of car that he's in is like a main part I'm like I want all this stuff because this character James ree is so cool all I have to do is go to Jack car.com and I can buy all of this stuff and it's amazing I love this strategy yeah this is brilliant i' never I never would have thought that product placement in books would work like product placement in movies does but that makes perfect sense this is his uh this is his febles this is his prime Tomahawk dude it's awesome and by the way I was just giving him a little [ __ ] not all of them are affiliate links but a lot of them are and if you go to like his Amazon page he even has this cool feature on his Amazon page where it lists all of the products in the books and those are think this is just like um you know for example a lot of people ask us a bunch of questions about like oh what do you use for this whatever and it's like sometimes writing the [ __ ] down is actually just it's valuable to them it's useful to me it saves me time uh and I know that a bunch of podcasters do this but it's it's like small income it's signed income it's not their main thing do you think this guy's like he's got to be making more off of his books than he is off of this uh this Amazon affiliate thing right I think he's making more off his books but my third example is I'm going to show someone who's making way more off this thing and I think there's a world where Jack Carr will make way more off that side thing than the original thing meaning when you think of a Navy SEAL you think of like many things including like the cool types of gear they have and you like see what they're wearing you're like that's neat I would love to have that thing or you know it's like cosplaying to be a tough guy there's a here's right I mean like he says in his cardigan yeah yeah as he walked around his home wearing Birkin socks yeah does JC Penney like sell like really good boxers or something I could talk about the third one Steve ranella have you heard of Steve re renella I'm three for three no who is Steve ranella okay this one is I would I would not think you would know who this guy is so he originally starts as a magazine article guy for outdoor magazine so basically he's from Michigan went to school in Montana He loves the outdoors he also loves writing and so he starts as a freelance journalist he works for outdoor magazine he works for like Men's Health these things where he he's able to like talk about the outdoors and they pay him a small amount of money whatever his first book book that he writes is about foraging so which is basically just he wanted to create the books sound silly but they're actually awesome he wanted to write about how he went and hunted and forged his own Thanksgiving dinner but like in doing that you find like the meaning of life and you see like the history of food whatever and Outdoors it's awesome the second book that he did is called American buffalo and it's this amazing book about him hunting Buffalo and how the Buffalo are really important to American history whatever if you're not into that you're not into it which I don't think you are but for the people who are what gave it away yeah this is like you know my body language right now is the body language of a girl who's about to get grinded on by a guy at the club unwantedly no no no thanks foraging for my food no thanks I'm out of here would you like a free copy of my book it's signed nope yeah you're you're not into this guy but you're going to be into what what I'm about to explain so he writes This Book American buffalo it gets pretty popular so then he creates this website called meater.com have you ever heard of meat eater I have heard of meat eater yes so meat eater starts as a series of podcasts they have a show on this thing called the the outdoor or the sports channel something like that and it starts working out well eventually chernin I think you know churnin they invest into it and at this point in 2023 meat eater is a website where Steve Rella uh blogs about Outdoors he publishes books his books under the meet eater name he has recipe books he has uh more podcasts whatever newsletters however they went and bought a bunch of Brands they bought a duck call business they went and bought um a clothing line now in 2023 they announced that they did a 100 million in revenue from selling all of the products on meater.com of which his kind of claim to fame or at least where he gets a lot of the traffic from is his books and then his podcasts and things like that and so this is an example of a guy who I think has made significant ific more or will make significantly more in terms of Enterprise Value from selling the product that he talks about in the books or selling the lifestyle those Guy's super fascinating dude going from American buffalo a book about buffalo in America or whatever to having $100 million doll in revenue on your business is like that's not the American dream but it's it's something it's someone's dream somewhere it's it's an American Dream It's yeah that is I can't believe that that happened that's insane churnin is so smart by the way they took this one thesis of content to Commerce so they were like hey anybody whose's world classic content it's not valued properly in the market because media is such a [ __ ] business that they're valued as a media business but if you can flip their business model from content to Commerce then this thing is gonna this thing is going to take off and it's going to take off in the same way that our YouTube Subs are going to take off when you go to YouTube and you say to yourself godamn I'm learning a lot from Sam today about mediators and about authors and about all these people and they're going to go to YouTube You're Gonna Go to my first million and you're gonna click subscribe because you love us so much thank you very much that's the plug that was a good one pretty seamless right good job I think um if I had to make a prediction I think that meat eater will be worth many many many hundreds of millions maybe even a billion dollars in the next 10 years I I believe it these these lifestyle Brands once you get like there is no no Niche too small with these lifestyle Brands mediator is actually pretty big compared to some of these lifestyle Brands like the hinki the watch brand luxury watches only right or there's things for like you know how people when they get into biking they become like you know Lamer they start dressing like SpongeBob Spandex and like clipons and they walk into a coffee shop after like a 990,000 mile ride that morning like those people are super valuable as an audience and they need content that's like so lame like that that it's the thing that they care about and so there's like an endless niche of these like really really hypers specific lifestyle content brands that I think can be built uh you just have to come from that space it sounds like this guy Steve Rella you know came from that space which is pretty pretty cool you want to know the uh here's a curveball to the situation he lives in Brooklyn for real he lives in he lives in Brooklyn yeah well he lives in Brooklyn I was doing research on him and he's like from Montana and he's like I know Montana better than anywhere anywhere anyone else in the country like I knew enough to get the hell out of there yeah and now he lives in Brooklyn which is what I thought was kind of weird um but anyway those are my three examples of strange ways or shocking ways that a bunch of these authors are making money I know that you were thinking about becoming an author does this change but I think you've paused it I'm not sure if you've paused it or well I think becoming an author uh to make money is just uh that's like saying you know I was hungry so I went to church it's like yeah just cuz I have some some food there doesn't mean that's why you go and so like I don't think making money is the reason to write a book if you're going to want if you want to make money and you're smart about marketing and all that there's a hundred times easier ways to make money did you just make up that analogy that was a really good uh that was a really good analogy I did my morning routine today so you know the brain is on um the brain is awake the thing that I've looked into is how much these authors make so there's like tiers to this so uh if it was 10 tiers the first five tiers you know of tier 10 through five is just all of them made no money actually maybe tiers you know like uh 10 all the way to number three all made no money but a couple of interesting data points uh that are in our world so I think the top tier is like the JK rowlings of the world the JK Rowling James Patterson which is like you actually are mainstream Canon right you are you're a part of the meta like you you became the equivalent you know you're going to get a Netflix show type of thing dude have you ever thought about by the way have you thought about JK Rawling and how she invented an entire universe and made up rules to like a game or a language that people refer to now like the word muggle she just thought of that word at least twice a week you know people do the Roman Empire thing I don't give a [ __ ] about the Roman Empire but dude I do think of like Diagon Alle I think about Hogwarts I think about all these places right like I think about that twice a week how cool that is someone made it up yeah it's weird to me that when I think about that I'm just like that's that's so odd no [ __ ] what percent of you is like might be real is there any part of you that's like well I I am just a mugle how would I know the way that I think about it is it she is so good at inventing this thing that she couldn't possibly have invented it and she's just telling a true story like you know what I mean like it's just impossible to think that one brain like our brains are each six pounds but that came out of hers I don't understand how that happens dude I've been at an airport where it's like you have the smart cart thing and I'm walking between you know nine and 10 and I don't run at it but like you know I'll take my finger and sort of drag it against the wall just in case there's a little little give in that in that wall you know I'll play I'll see um so there's that that tier right that's like god tier then there's the James clear you know Atomic habits David gogin Mark Manson I think these guys have cleared like 30 to $50 million off of a single book that's a lot I would say more like 20 so James Clear I think uh I don't know how many he's sold now it's his thing is escalating by the way which is really interesting he tweeted this out recently and it was it was something like I'll try to find it but it was basically like he first year was like you know maybe like a 100,000 and then the next year was like 200,000 the third year was a million and then the fourth year was like 4 million and the fifth year was like 15 million and he's just gone up and up and up I think now he sold uh basically I don't know 20 million copies or something like that worldwide and so you know no way really that many 20 million yeah yeah his book is like a it's like a runaway train basically um so I I think I'm pretty sure his his book has grossed like 150 to20 million probably 100 probably $150 million worldwide it's my guess you know I might be off by 30 million in either direction but but I'm not off by by half you know um and he's just a guy in Ohio I think like he's just he's just a guy like I I knew him before the I talked to him before the book and he was just like a blogger in Ohio like it didn't seem particularly fancy he years what I yeah I knew him before he stopped talking to me yeah so so I think that's like the next tier David gogin his book I think has done like 35 $40 million in sales and he did it through scribe so he kind of like owns more of that um Tim Ferris surprisingly didn't sell that many copies of 4our work week I thought 4our work week was like a to me it was like that was a huge book it obviously did super super well but I think it sold two million copies you know so two million versus 20 million 10x more for for Atomic habits which is pretty crazy a fun one is Eric Jorgenson so you know Eric Jorgenson um he he was like a startup growth guy he lived in some I don't know where he lives he lives in like Kansas City or something like that and Eric Jorgenson wrote the naval manac which was basically he's like yo naval's tweets are the [ __ ] what if I printed them out basically like what if I printed it out and stapled it together right obviously he did more than that but the core idea was he didn't write the book he didn't do a he didn't study nal's life and write a biography he didn't create a bunch of original wisdom he just took naval's existing wisdom that was super fragmented packaged it up into a really easy to use book and then and he actually gives away like the ebook for free I think online um I'm pretty sure Eric he's never told me this is my my guess work based on some some back of the envelope stuff pretty sure Eric has made like3 to5 million off of the nalmanac himself no way I don't believe that that is so much 82% confident that that's a real number dude if you're even half right I would be he's definitely made more than a million dollars I think it's like three to five million do off the nval manac okay well that's insane does Naval get anything Naval got distribution I don't think he gives theal any money from it I don't know I'm going to make you famous baby you're going to be superstar that's what I'm going to tell you I'm going to create the sha shaam dude you said that way too naturally that was not the first time you've said that is that what you told trun that's insane I uh that that basically the concept is ridiculous right I mean it's good the concept is genius is what it is he he took somebody else's genius that was fragmented and was like why would I write nobody wants to read the Eric jensson book but a lot of people want to write the nval book and nval is kind of Open Source with it he has he said this many times he's like the best thing you could do is let other people reshare your ideas they're you know stealing your ideas but really they're propagating your ideas it's one of the highest compliments one of the best strategies you can have to get more distribution and so you know I think he was happy that Eric you it took him like a year he put a lot of effort into it not nearly as much effort as the guy who actually came up with the content well nal's made 500 million in his life so I think he's done fine too right that's that's the whole idea no and Eric by the way I think is now the CEO of scribe David the the company that did David gagan's book so and the company that I think you might you be using uh yeah not yet but um okay so another crazy story so I've never heard of this book and I doubt you have either because are you a Sci-Fi reader not exactly only like the most famous ones so have you ever heard of this book called wool no talking to me about science fiction is like talking to you about bison you know I mean ain't going very far that conversation's got a lot of dead heads yeah that's a hard yes hand well basically here's the here's the idea I was looking at the uh at the charts and I saw all of the Game of Thrones books so it's like you know A Song of Ice and Fire and it's basically George R Martin George R Martin George R Martin there's five of his books and there was one book on top of it called wool and I was like I've never heard of this book what is this book so I went and researched it so the author this guy Hugh Hoy which sounds like a fake name might be I don't know um the his origin story is he's living in North Carolina he's broke uh he was doing some odd jobs he was like oh this a roofing gig yeah I'll go help you out you know I'm a technician sure I'll help you out and basically at some point he's unemployed and he's like you know what I'm gonna write a book his wife was kind of supporting the household he's like I'm gonna write a book and she's like okay honey great uh sure you don't want to get out there with the old resume and he's like no no I'm gonna write a Sci-Fi book like it was like the idea was like something he like what if aliens at this flying car or whatever I don't know what it was some crazy idea this conversation could go way different it'd be like hey by the way like I know that you love having these action figures in the plastic still but can we make a little bit of room for the baby oh you're going to write a book I'm gonna go find another husband so so he puts the book out he sells less than a thousand dollars of the book okay so first first try and it fail most people would obviously quit strike one he's like oh I'm just getting warmed up he's like I that was that was good but I can do better and he still has no job he needs to kind of start you know paying for the bills a little bit so I love this part about the story he gets a job but he's like he's trying to find not the highest paying job he's trying to find a job that will make a minimum amount of money of money that he needs to live with the maximum amount of free hours so he ends up finding this job that he could do for about 25 30 hours a week it pays only 10 bucks an hour but he's like I'll take it because there's a lot of downtime where I'm just sitting there not doing anything I could be writing during that time and it's only 30 hours a week so I can spend all of my free time doing this and I also don't even want a good job that'll make it hard to quit later because I want to be an author and I'm not going to trap myself in a job that's like hard to leave then he changes his schedule he's like I'm going to wake up 2 am every day and I'm gonna write before my job I'm gonna write during my lunch break I'm write after dinner it became a compulsion for him and in three weeks he writes this book wool three weeks so again just like James Patterson wasn't precious about the whole idea of writing books this guy was like three weeks not three years and so he bangs he bangs out this book he puts it on Amazon for 99 cents and he sells like 1 th copies he's like boom thousand bucks all right love it and he's like uh and the but like you his small reader base it's kind of like weissy they say you want like a small number of people you'd rather have a thousand people that love you than 100,00 people that just kind of like you so you had a thousand people that really led the book and they were like dude we got to write a sequel so very next month before they get cold he writes a sequel by the way wall Wall's 530 Pages he did that in three weeks so then he uh he writes a sequel a month later he uh or like you know two months later whatever it is and he sells 3,000 copies of that one he's like all right I got to keep going so he writes two more and he sells 10,000 copies and finally he puts out the collection all five of the books that he's written in a very short period of time and the first month he sells 23,000 copies of the set and now he's selling it for $67.99 he makes basically 140 Grand that uh in in gross revenue that month and he's self-publishing this whole thing so he's keeping 70% of it um whereas a normal author is going to keep 10% maybe 15% of it and all of a sudden um you know the months Roll by he's now sold 500,000 books uh before H you know before anybody knows it which is a [ __ ] ton of books to sell that's like you know you're in the top top you know percent of a percent uh that are of authors at that stage and he's getting approached by Publishers and they're like he's like okay what's the deal and they're like we'll give you you know $250,000 like I'm already making $250,000 they're like okay we'll give you more money he's like well I'm what why would I give you why would I take some money today for like now I give up all my upside and they're like well we can help you get distribution he's like I've sold 500,000 copies myself and they're like how the hell did you do that and he's like and so his strategy his like gorilla tactics to get this book out there where he's like all right I need to influence the influencers so he sent basically like copies of the book to bloggers and reviewers at Goodreads so not like influencers but book influencers so people who books and good reads like high rank and good good reads people so then he's like all right that's good Next Step he goes on Reddit and he's got uh he does an AMA on Reddit for 12 hours and so he's just like I'm just gonna like soak up all the Reddit love for this day on on Reddit all right does that then he starts encouraging fan fiction and Fan Art whereas most authors are pretty again precious about like it's my IP they try to like you know take down anybody who writes like variations of their book he's like no no no go crazy I built the universe but you guys can fill up all the stories and he would basically incentivize people to design other alternative book covers for it so now their little audience would you know their art that artist audience would see them designing a book cover for this book called wool that was pretty cool he picks 30 of the Diehard readers and he's like okay how do I get my die hards to help me and become like you know super evangelist and so he made them beta readers again everybody's so precious they keep everything under lock and key he took his super fans and was like you're going to be readers of the of the early editions of new books before they come out so he did a bunch of community building essentially like stuff that doesn't really scale that each one individually wasn't a game changer but if you add up that and the 20 other things that he did you could see how he like that's not what made it successful but he did start turning the crank at the beginning the crank is pretty hard to turn but eventually you know you you you if you power through that first part of the crank it'll start to move on its own and that's basically what happened for this guy and so then someone comes up to him and they're like look I don't think you should sell your book rights but I do think you should sell your film rights you haven't actually you're not going to make a film yourself so he sold his film rights and um and he kept his his uh book writs you know as an independent person for a while I I think maybe he sold it now I'm not sure but he uh he also Met George R Martin once he went to a book signing for uh for George R Martin and he's like hey George like um it's me you know Hugh Hoy and the guy's like never heard of you and he's like I'm the number six guy on the Sci-Fi list like you know it's your five books and I'm number six and George AR Martin he posted this thing that George AR Martin signed his book and said to number six keep trying and then a couple months later a couple months later he actually hit number one and so uh just a pretty cool story of like a self-published author that that really made it happen like entrepreneurial hustle story that's a great story do you use Goodreads do you know anything about Goodreads I've used Goodreads yeah I bet the founders of Goodreads uh and I was like Yeah o is Chandler yeah they're they're really cool people really nice people it's a cool product but but it's old now it's been around for a long time but it's got a great Mo I I can tell you a little bit about good reads but this guy Hugh Hol he has so I'm I use good reads religiously I'm I'm I'm that's kind of like my it's where my library I keep everything this guy has 750,000 ratings which is huge and if you're in the hundreds of thousands of ratings and you have over a fourstar review you're like the best the best he has a 4.15 review uh out of five for almost a million reviews it's a amazing yeah it all started with a standalone short story basically it wasn't even like a full book it was like a short story that he published at the at the beginning of that first three weeks but again that's kind of what you want it's a prototype right he treated it like an entrepreneur would not like a author would he's like the blue collar version of sci-fi this guy's like the Larry Bird of sci-fi you know what I mean like from French Lick Indiana yeah dude how insane is it that Larry Bird was so amazing and would just literally drink beers like on the bust to the game and like people used to smoke cigarettes at halftime of those games like isn't that absolutely insane now like now LeBron James sleeps in like a hyperbaric chamber but like the guy who was basically the LeBron James of his time was literally just like Downing Bud Lights after games and he was like so skinny and so pale had the worst haircut the shortest shorts the best mustache the best mustache but he like kind of looked like a like a human version of like big bird and he just killed and he's considered one of the top five yeah that guy's amazing he he gives uh he gives the weirdos hope uh this story is amazing Hugh Holly um that's a good story um you want to do one or two more thing yeah uh Mill you Shepherd it's great you need to hire somebody go check it out it's how I hire a bunch of people if you want to hire people like I do use Shepherd how's that all right there that's there was no thrill in that chill but I kept it short do you have one more thing oh well I guess we didn't talk about this uh this is kind of cool James Clear just launched an app yesterday which I think was the stimulus for this whole thing that we didn't we didn't talk about Andrew Wilkinson he put out this tweet where he said uh we partner with James Clear tiny owns 40% James owns 60% we made this app I actually didn't look at the app it's a productivity app or a habit tracking app yeah what if it was just something completely different it's just a social media app just a network photo sharing app James just some like stupid game it's like you like they recreated like snake from Nokia that's so funny by the way okay so let's talk about a couple things here great idea to release a habits app uh you want an app to be habit forming literally that's like only successful apps are ones that you use habitually so creating a habits app is a good idea there's lots of there's habits apps but they're not made by James clear so I think this is like no no brain or idea he just created anything that was a habit like just like some supplement or drug like like I'm going to get you addicted we're going to make this habit watch this we're going to call it crack so I think genius idea by him maybe doubly genius idea by Andrew to pull this off I think it's amazing what he's doing he's done this now with huberman so he launched uh the Yerba mate drink with huberman which I think is also a genius idea I think what Andrew is doing now is the new playbook of what chernin did remember I was saying like chernin's Playbook with the content to Commerce they did it with bar stool they did it with eer they did it with like a bunch of these media media Publications that was a really good model and it's played out over the last 10 years I think what Andrew doing now is going to play out over the next 10 years which is he's partnering with these experts and authorities and he's like look I already have metalab that can do the design the engineering uh I have I I own a portfolio of businesses I've you know made a billion dollars doing this whole thing so let me find a CEO we'll build the whole thing you just have to promote it and it's a perfect fit with what you do I think it's is like such a good model it's also really fun for him right cuz he's going to get to hang out and rub shoulders with people who he likes and respects he's got like a cool cocktail story of being like Oh yeah we built the James Clear app we did the huberman drink we did the whatever right um they've done a bunch of these these apps now so I just think it's an awesome win all around like I'm I'm really happy for it we should have Andrew on to talk about it but my prediction is that this won't make nearly as much money as some of his other boring things that no one would ever talk about but it's cooler than all of the other ones like it's significantly cooler it won't make as much money but it's way cooler like to be able to like I think this thing is gonna make a lot of money why do you think this is not gonna make money well I just think that it's his other stuff just does so much better if I had to guess I think the can do like hundreds of Millions on meditation I'm pretty sure that you can get like 30 40 million of ARR on a habit app I think maybe you can but Andrew also owns all these boring agencies that are like the thousandth most popular agency and they also make t many many tens of millions a year in profit no no if you add them all up they do but each individually does not right like if you add them all up they do his his agency if you add up what he's going to do with huberman with James Clear in the next five that he's going to do like this those are going to add up to be much bigger the hubman drink is a brilliant idea that is a absolutely brilliant idea the James Clear app like he's getting the right type of things like you don't want necessarily the A-list celebr because the A-list celebrity for every you know George Clooney or Ryan Reynolds that you get that that have a hit there's tons of others that they don't really care about promoting it they're too busy but it's not a fit they don't have like a direct relationship with their audience because they're actually on in Hollywood they're not like have a direct Channel Through social media and so the people that he's finding are like this is Meaningful for them it's a perfect fit with them they have a direct relationship with their audience and they haven't like um they have like love from Their audience it's not just like people who are fans of them it's people who have deep trust in them and I think that that is a I think he's picking the right influencers to do these I I would bet that he's going to make hundreds of millions off of these plays if you if you add up the you know three to five that he's going to do in this category I would bet that that's a three to three uh like a300 million prize I guess we'll have to have him on and uh ask him about it I'm he he's like a Spider Man he's or like an octopus he's has his tentacles like all over the place I see this I'm like how the [ __ ] did you weasle your way into that thing like just like he knows everything like he not knows everything he knows everyone I don't know how he gets his fingers on all these things I'll be like I'll be like hey uh where's our email we're influencers Andrew where you at well where's our offer he also plays Dumb with me all the time I go like you're I I'd probably be like hey have you heard of this guy named hberman I've been loving his podcast and Wilkinson would be like yeah I think it's a nice podcast I also enjoy it and then like weeks later like yeah we partnered with him and launched this company on this deal for 18 months yeah I'm like okay like he does that he does that kind of on a regular basis with me where I'll be like if you heard of this thing it's kind of neat and I'll be like yeah I agree that is neat he he is a super networker he is a absolutely P like incredible networker I am I I I am I admire his networking skills like he's like cool I like Bill Amman now I'm friends with Bill Amman and he's an investor in my company oh Charlie munger's my hero years later I'm having dinner with Charlie merer and he's offering me you know XYZ it's like he is really able when he puts his mind to it with who he wants to meet he is able to make that [ __ ] happen and um and I think he does it in a way that's mutually beneficial it's not like uh you most people when they're like oh I want to meet this person it's like just begging for you know time or attention in a way that's not additive to the other person I think he does it in a good way that's additive to the other person yeah he's he's fascinating in the way that he's able but he also he also turns a weird networking opportunity into like real businesses like usually more often than not when I meet people I'm like that was nice to meet you I'll see you never again uh this is awesome right high five and that's like where my brain stops yeah what a guy yeah that's like I'm literally like you know Dumb and Dumber when he's walking out of the 7-Eleven he's like big gulps huh all right catch you later that's that's me at every networking event same that's exactly how I am where it starts and ends right there and it's just like a passing memory and yes Andrew somehow like makes it into money and turns it into dollars I don't know how he does it but he's very good at it he told one story on the Pod where he was like I wanted to meet Dan Gilbert I met Dan Gilbert and then they had this challenge with this like or he had a product I have a design agency so we just made him a website for free that was really nice because he like used that as his currency to like you know hey I think you're awesome and we did this thing this is awesome right oh it's cuz my agency's awesome cuz I'm awesome and he just uses it to sort of like open the door he'll put in the work basically and he's he'd be like oh whenever you're free I'll fly there and let's you know I'll meet you you know I'll make the effort to come to come make this happen the takeaway is to have an agency to either have like an agency or like a sick house it's like oh you're in town come stay in my home and then you know what I mean you have to have like some like awesome ex should I do that anytime someone's traing like oh do you want to stay in my house and I just rent an Airbnb they can stay in they're just absolutely indebted to me well it's kind of a good tactic Chris sacka said that had this house in trucky and uh you know he would like lure which sounds weird more weird than it actually is he would lure these like inter house in truy come to my bed yeah I got AWS credits come over and he would like get these guys to come up and become friends with them and it was like they're they're like well I would love to hang out in trucky and just what happens you have a house and that's how we become friends with them but maybe great line about he goes uh when I lived in San Francisco I was just constantly getting like meeting requests or event invitations and it was like a good problem to have but at it's still a problem he's like I was playing defense I was just reacting to whatever was going on he's like when I moved to trucky then I played offense I would figure out who who it is that I want to actually spend time with and then I would proactively plan and like set it up so that Travis Callin came for the weekend and stayed with him he's like we're not going to just get coffee we're gonna hang out for a weekend and like for every 50 coffee meetings I do like one weekend is just so much more powerful than 50 coffee meetings and so he's like we hang out we spend time together they meet my family we chill in the hot tub we brainstorm in the morning then later that evening we a new idea comes and I'm just very helpful for these people that's how he did his Uber investment he did the same thing with the founder of Instagram that's how he did his Instagram investment too was he invited Kevin syrm to come stay at his place in trucky and he stayed there for whatever few days a week or whatever it was and by the end of that like they were kind of bonded and I think that was kraka did a lot of cool things and that's definitely one of them I don't know if a a three-bedroom place in the BBS is going to do the trick I think both of us are going to have to step it up can I interest you in Walnut Creek yeah we'll go to Safeway we'll come back like the only appeal you like marble countertops I got I got marble countertops like um all right is that it is that the pod that's the [Music] pod h

it's insane I think it's insane and Brilliant that's a good nobody knows about this account by the way this account only has 750 followers so I kind of maybe I'm blowing up my own spot [Music] here all right what's up it's time for the first ever Friday quickie this is a little idea me and Sam had where we share basically the little things that we saw this week that were either the best article the best Tweets the best um you know a little video that we saw normally this is stuff we just only share in our group chat um and we wanted to try it out on the podt showing it to each other I don't know what he's gonna say he doesn't know what I'm gonna say we each have three so we're going to do a list of six things let's run through it uh Sam you wantan to go first you wantan to go first oh Jinx I'll do I'll do when I have a quick one so this is a genius deal flow hack you ever heard about how hedge fund Traders will like move their servers to be as close as possible to the the pipe or they'll use a certain kind of wire so that the trades get executed faster I used to hear all these things about like how in traditional Finance people would go to Crazy lengths just to get that little Edge that little extra Edge and I always felt a little sad that us you know the soft boys of Silicon Valley we don't really do that we're all nice paying it forward just blogging everything that we know there's no like kind of uh you know real secrecy real ruthless secrecy about things until I saw this so our buddy suly tweeted this out that there is a company that started to help VC's improve their deal flow so he was like basically every VC knows deal flow matters normally the way you do it is you're hosting dinners or conferences or you go on podcasts or you make you know a Patagonia vest that you give away like that but they were like the problem is you're you're you don't know what deals you're not hearing about so what if there was a way where you could know about the deals you're not hearing about so what they did was some company basically puts a photographer in front of the offices of like Kya and andrees and all these like the top funds is this real or an idea I think this is real so when people are leaving the office they like hey do you want a picture in front of the seoa thing I'll send it to you they take a picture because it's a great moment for the entrepreneur oh this is when we pitch seoa and they're like great what's the name of your company and they're like awesome and they basically sell that list to all the other funds it's like hey did you know these guys are out raising they were talking to Sequoia and um he's like he's like I heard about this and I thought it was amazing genius deal flow hack he's like the VC who told me about it was like we don't pay for this but I know it exists and others do um I think that's brilliant what do you think I think it's brilliant I think it's insane I think it's insane and Brilliant there there's another version of this that I follow there's a Twitter account called like stealth something and it's anytime somebody who had like working on something new or stealth blah blah blah anytime they change that to like the name of a project it immediately tweets out this person just announced they're doing this thing and so you could reach out to them be like hey you know that's really cool I I like what you're doing what's the name of that handle all right so that account is called stealth coy so if you go to stealth Coy it's a realtime notification of any time like people it also tracks like LinkedIn like if you leave a company that they consider like a high trajectory like Fast growth startup it's like this version's leaving to do something new and you could see it so like for example the last tweet was Julia is now building in stealth mode uh she's the ex data science director from GitHub and now and she lives in Boston here's her LinkedIn she just announced or she just posted that she's she's working on something new that's in stealth this is awesome or it'll be like Noah comes out of stealth he's got a platform for no code SDK tooling for Enterprise llm applications here's the link here's his LinkedIn this is awesome all right that's a good find nobody knows about this account by the way this account only has 750 followers so I kind of maybe I'm blowing up my own spot here this is a good find there's also that for when people um remove their employer off of their Twitter handle or their LinkedIn and they'll be like this person is now available I like this um all right let me give you another one so I was reading Reddit the other day and I found this Old Post it's over a year old do you remember Jake kasan or cassen I don't actually know how to say his last name but Jake so we started movement watches watches and they were one of the first like d Toc guys to go big and so they started this company where they sold watches they got popular on Instagram I think he sold it for $100 million then there was another $100 million earnout which I'm not sure if they hit or not but the company was bootstrapped so he made north of 50 million I would imagine I found this post I don't know why he did this but he did and I think it's great but he didn't really talk about it on social media but I found this on uh this subreddit called find a path for those who have a hobby passion or a passing whim that they want to make a living out of but don't know how they can get there so that's the the description of the subreddit but he's got this description or this post on the subreddit and says I sold my company movement a few years ago for a lot of money and thought all my problems would be solved I made my life really cushy and comfortable and I optimize to be as stress-free as possible and then he goes on to say that he's new to this subreddit and he's still trying to find out what he's what he wants to do to his with his life and that he's set up his life to be easy and now it's been two years since he sold the company and he's 31 single he never has to work again but he's never been lonier and depressed or depressed than ever and he basically talks about what he's trying to do in order to find his passion and I think that what's interesting about this post is a people never talk about this type of stuff like publicly where they put their name on it and they truly say how they feel that's fascinating and B he like you see his replies of people saying like asking him different questions and he goes through really detailed replies of what he's trying to do so he's like I love video editing and making movies so now I bought a camera and I've been and I took a YouTube class and I'm trying to learn how to take pictures and film new videos and chop them up or whatever and it's super fascinating to see behind the scenes of someone who's young I think he was 29 when he sold so 29 worth tens of millions of dollars he's pretty lonely he's depressed and it's really fascinating to see someone break all this down I thought this was a really really fascinating Reddit post that I didn't see shared anywhere I love this um I thought it was awesome I saw it because somebody on Twitter goes I wonder what the guys who like crushed it in the early wave of Ecom are doing now I bet they're just killing it this some somebody tweeted this and then this other guy goes actually I just saw this post on Reddit and this is a year ago he's like I saw this post on Reddit from the founder of movement saying exactly what he's been doing and actually you know he's been kind of wandering and trying to figure it out um and then I read this thing I was like dude that's the magic of the internet someone just tweeting a random question somebody else being like oh here's the Obscure Reddit post that's like filled with know the answer to your question and also just that this guy you know I almost felt bad I didn't bring this up on the Pod because I was like it's kind of personal it's kind of personal maybe he doesn't want this like you know on blast I mean he posted it publicly on Reddit so I guess it's a fair game but you know he's being very vulnerable he's like you know I'm loner than ever I'm deeply depressed and I'm trying to figure it out um but props to him for for doing that and doing it with his name on it because he could have very easily just like done this same thing and just say I sold my company he didn't have to say who he was um so you know respect to him for doing that I really really appreciated that I think it's awesome aome I think that this is a problem that not a lot of people go through but it's really fun to for people who are dreaming of making money or who want to sell their company what happens on the other side you know I think someone described this thing as called the second Mountain so you've climbed the first Mountain but you still need another mountain to climb and and he talks about they're like why don't you start another company he was like well in the past money and ego were the huge motivators for me and I kind of those motivators are gone now and so whatever I do next I need to find fulfillment and to help others in some way and so I think it's really interesting um all right what do you guys all right number three I'm G to do the horoi bump okay so uh Alex horos uh friend of the Pod good dude he bought a company recently school from another guy who has been on the Pod talking about school the original founder of it Sam ovens so that's like his new thing and that was like the he's he tweeted out he's like this is the biggest bet I've ever made uh you know I'm investing a bunch of money into this and now he's wearing a school hat on every interview he goes on and every video he creates and he's you know trying to promote School it's an awesome product school's really good I haven't uh I've never used it you actually used it yeah it's a good product that guy Sam is very Savvy and it's a very good product yeah and so basically it's a um it's like a community building tool so people you can make create a paid community and people can join it uh on there um it looks like it's heavy in like the like affiliate marketing like Drop Shipping type of game when I I went and browse like the top communities that were on the site or whatever um anyways I think it's a it's a good good investment so I was curious how much of a bump do you think school got in web traffic after heroi did it because obviously he's doing it with this belief that hey I've just spent two years plus building my audience huge audience um of entrepreneurial people and I'm gonna invest in this thing and then I'm going to try to use my weight to drive traffic so I can you know this is very much the same strategy I've used which is you could buy something at a fair price knowing that you have a growth lever to bring more traffic to the site so I'm curious how much do you you think it went up so I'll give you the um yeah what was the before before was let's say uh web traffic was in let's say three months ago I let's say no one two three four five five months ago was at about eight million in in monthly monthly visitors what do you think it is um I would guess I would have guess 10 or 12 all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis vuon or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just changed the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM okay so it went from eight million to in January it looks like spiked at almost 17 million according to like similar web which is not exactly accurate but directionally correct um so almost double the about about double double the traffic for that month now a lot of it is people just coming and checking it out because of the announcement it's not like necessarily the most sustainable thing but let's now look uh wow so go mostly through February so what's the February numbers looking like but check this out so Circle do Circle doso I think they're called circle. Co or circle. so they're a community platform that's a competitor to school they've raised I think tens of millions of dollars school has more than doubled their traffic they had doubled their traffic before they even took the money right that's insane and Sam actually told me and he posted it on their about page that he has invested $10 million of his own money which I I think was a large percentage of his money that he had into making School reality yeah it's interesting what these are so I just sorted by paid so you can see it's the digital growth community which is like basically internet marketing number two Mark's manifestation thing pay $49 a month and you join his thing it's got 284 members um digital wealth Academy right it's like it's a lot of the like uh the Adonis School how like-minded men who want to live the Adonis lifestyle right it's like a lot of like Andrew taty type stuff uh which I find interesting but it's cool because you know I think you've done a bunch of paid communities on Facebook and now slack and other places uh you didn't use this for Hampton right no because when we started I didn't know enough about it and I didn't think it would be any good but then I met Sam the guy who started it and we were already on slack but I was like oh you actually are really smart I should have I I kind of regret not using it and I have nothing to do with this company but I thought it was awesome but they have a bunch of like non- busy stuff so there's like a stuff on like style and clothing and then there's one on meditation so there's stuff on non business stuff it just it's like anything aspirational you would want right so what do you whatever you want you want a better body you want a better style you want better you know finances whatever it is that's how you you get there I think it's a great move also just in general the business model of I take a kind of crappy but high volume business model which is let's say media but I use it to buy Assets in the best business model SAS which is what he did right so he converted his YouTube Fame which doesn't pay very well into owning a SAS asset which is like one of the Sass is one of the best business models out there so good move by Alex uh on that one and congrats to to all involved on the on the big spike I hung out with Sam ens once my wife and I we were at a restaurant with him or some type of bar or something and we were just talking and Sam ovens is he's a wonderful person but he's uh he's almost a little awkward like he's he's really in awkward in the sense of he's comfortable with silence and it got to the part conversation you're like turns out I'm awkward yeah yeah he's he's the he's actually kind of normal I guess yeah it was me and it got to the point in the conversation where there was some silence and I was just like I was just like I'm gonna sit in this for a minute let's just see what this feels like let's sit in the silence and so we sit and we finish a conversation and there's about 5 seconds and he goes I delivered my baby you know and he's he's from New Zealand and I was like uh what what what do you mean you delivered your baby with what he goes my hands and he tells a story about how like his wife went into labor and uh like the paramedics couldn't make it in time and he's like I just he delivered it on his own and uh it was a and he just thre that out there and I was like ohg I would join a paid community of him just sending me a voice note every morning of that that was like that was like the silence breaker was I delivered my baby and I just thought it was awesome I was like you're the best person I've ever met all right let me show you another one there's this tweet I saw her name is Julia Chang all right so this uh she just shared this woman uh on Instagram named Amanda wolf so she goes through what she does is she gets people to share their finances and then she like is a personal uh Finance Wizard or something like that and so she writes out all the all I don't know what do they call these people she's some sort of magician she's a witch personal finance witch I don't know whatever you call these people but it's normally like people who are making like 80 grand a year and then she talks about like you know this looks normal this doesn't work look normal she got this couple that's 39 and 37 years old the husband and wife one's an attorney one's a CIO their net income or their uh personal income is $3.7 million they live in Alpine New Jersey and their expenses each month are roughly $77,000 and they break through or they break down what their expenses are so the biggest one being mortgage $29,000 utilities $1,200 but then it gets to like some wild stuff so where does it say their uh oh the $29,000 mortgage wasn't wild that's wild that's wild but but but but a $29,000 mortgage I think that's what it costs to have a like $4 million house I mean so that I I guess that makes sense but their personal trainers are four grand a month and she breaks down all these expenses and I thought it was really fascinating to see kind of like what these people are spending on and like basically how you can make almost $4 million a year and you're not really saving a lot of money at all it's pretty ridiculous how much these people spend and so they they are able to invest so they invest like something like a million dollars a year so that's a ton of money but then she kind of like p uh shows that off in a weird way where she's like look they only have $2,300 left over each month after they invest a million dollars each year uh but it's kind of ridiculous to see like these expenses sorry the mortgage for $29,000 is $5.2 million at a 4.25% uh interest rate but pretty crazy right to like see these expenses of 80 grand a month and so what does she do I see it all written out with nice handwriting here does she just like cross it out at the end and be like no start over change change this like what is the what's the punchline of this what does she take what's the takeaway well her takeaway was just basically like I don't think her takeaway is important she just like crazy right yeah it was just like crazy I mean I don't think that the the takeaway her takeaway is actually that interesting to me but I do think that four grand a month of personal trainers is ridiculous but a nanny $110,000 uh their kids school $2,500 kids tutors and Coach is $3,000 my takeaway is just I if they live in Alpine New Jersey I bet they work in Manhattan then just that lifestyle out there even if you are making close to $4 million a year it is really hard to get uh terminal velocity out to the point where you don't actually have to work anymore so in order to uh in order to not work and spend a million dollars a year you have to have something like $25 million liquid I think that would be the number so right around there if you want to withdraw 3% of your money every month a year sorry a year and so in order to like actually save up that amount of money even when you are earning almost $4 million in the Manhattan area really really challenging if you live the life like these types of people and I thought that was wild yeah I think that's the key is if you if you want to spend $29,000 a month on your mortgage if you want to spend 10 grand on your Nanny another you know basically eight grand on miscellaneous and personal trainer 6,000 a month on shopping right like the shopping is separate from like just on shopping fun and dining out is four grand four grand and six grand right so like 14 Grand a month on shopping fun and dining out um I don't know if you're not having fun with the shopping and dining out maybe don't have another maybe don't spend another 4k on the fun right like you gotta this is just excessive spending for that level of income I think I agree but it's just interesting I think a lot of people who earn that amount of money by the way I think they spend that way I think the real takeaway of this is whoever posted this is just good at social media they're like how do I enrage everybody okay let me post this um because all this does this is just engagement bait right you're just everyone in the comments is just like oh man what the like I can't believe this this is not real these people are so out of touch they get like so angry about it dude I know so many people who live like this by the way I know a lot of people who live like this who make multi-millions and they spend almost all of it I know a lot of people who earn millions of dollars a year and they still live almost paycheck to paycheck it sounds crazy but I know people like having Dumb Friends you know you are the average of those five people you're spending time with those five idiots that are somehow burning four million a year dude isn't insane man if you live in the east coast man it's insane you spend a lot um all right you do one and then I have one more all right my last one's uh quick one did you see this liquid death marketing campaign that they did no oh okay genius so Super Bowl was a couple weeks ago and they were like hey all right how do we we want to do an ad we want to hijack this moment of this marketing moment but we don't want to buy a $6 million super ad so they there you go they put on eBay um the they called it the biggest ad ever and they go we have a national run of half a million liquid death cases and it's the side of this box and uh you can have this ad bace it costs you six million bucks to get in front of 110 million people on the Super Bowl but 200 million people are going to walk through the doors of these retailers and see see our uh our liquid debt thing pretty big leap of faith by the way that all of those people who attend a grocery store will look at this ad but whatever and they auctioned it off coinbase ends up buying this thing for half a million bucks so they get first like pump one of PR in the marketing Community um because marketers are like oh so smart then pump two was coinbase actually pays them $500,000 to buy the ad space so they got 500 Grand off this thing that was just excess inventory for them anyways and then pump three was the news that somebody actually bought it uh and they got three hits out of this thing very smart marketing by liquid death dude the guy who started liquid death he came on our podcast I think two years ago so they were getting going but they were still big but they weren't this big and if I remember correctly his background was he worked at an agency and my takeaway from the podcast was basically when you're selling water the products not that important it's just water and I don't think it tastes particularly different than any other water but he was just like I'm really good at advertising and I'm going to do all of these funny things in order to get eyeballs and I would not have predicted that that would have worked and it has he's he's he's he's completely crushed it his name's Mike uh I don't know his last name actually I just remember him being how you pronounce it uh but if you can go back and listen to that pot it's really good he was really fascinating yeah that was a few years ago and they were a lot smaller then now they're like prepping for an IPO or something like that it's pretty crazy um I don't know how healthy the business is but it definitely went way further than I ever thought it would probably way further than you ever thought it would too because it's basically the BET was we're just going to be incredible at marketing like that was the entire bet was uh yeah it's water um and then we're going to be absolutely incredible World Class of marketing and that'll be the thing and they pulled it off props to them all right here's the last one so I found this article it was from houseof fresh.com so if you if you Google House of fresh and then David and Goliath you'll see this article but I'm going to tell you what uh why I was interested in this so do you ever use review sites to like decide which product you want to buy not anymore but I did for a long time me too I did for a long time and I started diving deep on on this and I was like okay so how does BuzzFeed like which is like a I don't even know what their specialty is know which air purifier is best like I don't know if they can actually test all this stuff and I started noticing that there's all these websites like men's health.com and a whole bunch of other stuff reviewing products or posting like this is the 10 best these items and I'm like I don't think that they actually review these things but maybe I'll trust them well I read this article and at this point I'm not going to could to trust any of them so let me give you like a little breakdown so this company that wrote this houseof fresh.com they're a small company and all they do is they review Air Purifiers and that's all they do and they're like a missionary in the mercenary game meaning most of the people who review Air Purifiers they're just like BuzzFeed and they're just like look we can rank on Google so we're just GNA like read a bunch of Amazon reviews and we're GNA like whatever pick the one that looks best and we're going to put that at the top of our list whereas these other guys house of fresh they actually buy the products and they don't they're not giv it so they're not like owed uh good coverage to any of the uh manufacturers and they test it out whatever well they did this big article explaining how review sites work and so the takeaway is basically 16 companies so it's like Meredith uh which owns a whole bunch of uh different magazines Dash which owns a whole bunch of stuff BuzzFeed um Pensky media who we talked about in a podcast that they own all the stuff and they basically 16 media companies get three billion clicks per month and they basically d Nate uh Google and it's really hard for any small company getting into the review space in order to they can't actually rank high because these 16 companies control the whole thing but this article went and dive deep into how they're doing reviews they basically hire a freelancer just to like go out and do whatever and then they post the article on their websites but then they own like they each own like 50 different websites they'll post it across all the other websites and they don't actually show how they're doing the reviews and the takeaway is that they're really likely what they're doing is they they just go to and they just review what Amazon people have actually said and they just aggregate those curate them and put that into their article and it's not a great way in order to like find out actually what's best because you're trusting someone else versus going out and doing the research and I read this article and my takeaway was two things one I don't trust any website now that's doing reviews but number two I only trust a few of them there are a few so I used to trust wire cutter now I'm nervous about trusting them because they're owned by the New York Times and so it's owned by much larger company so I think they have different incentives besides that there's very few companies out there who I trust for reviews I go to Reddit but that's even hard but I think there's actually an opportunity to create some type of trusted review website I don't know how exactly you could do that and get big but I'm pretty certain you could still do that while remaining small but there's a whole bunch of like these Niche websites that used to uh talk about really interesting stuff there was one for VPN there was one for mattress companies and then the mattress company like Casper did or the large VPN companies they go and actually buy the review sites and they put their link up top and so at this point I'm skeptical of the entire industry and this made me not trust any reviews and I've already written written lots of articles about how Amazon reviews most of them or a lot of them are total I used to have friends that would make products and they' be like hey I'm G to make this product free on Amazon will you buy it so you it says that you're a proper uh customer and then just give me five stars it's all a circle jerk and I don't trust any of the reviews online at this point and it's very it makes me very skeptical 100% agree this is crazy um it's gotten completely out of hand this is uh so it's the main way that like or not the main way it's one of the major ways that news sites actually stay in business is that they basically sell their SEO juice to the highest bidder um this is for everything like what you're talking about air purifiers but also mattresses but also everything it's it's all just SEO hacks so for example if you want to find the best mattress and you Google best mattress you're not going to find the best mattress you're going to find who is the best at SEO which mattress company is the most aggressive at SEO is the only answer you get when you Google best mattress and I'm totally with you I wish there was a better solution to this because there's more products than ever and you do want to find out if they're any good or which one to buy it's just that you can't really trust any of the current Solutions I actually think that there's probably something you could do with a combination of video and subscription so what I would do is I would say hey we're coming out we're calling out the BS that exists in this space we're going to do a subscription product you pay for this and you're going to get access to like the super high quality reviews only like conscious consumers will do it and so you start small but again it's like the athletic it's like you're gonna get people to actually care enough to pay um and then you tell them like look because you pay now you get no bias in the uh in the results we are not going to take affiliate commissions anywhere and I think if you drew the line there there would be a market for that um maybe you can even let people sort of share their subscriptions so that a bunch of people could you know chip in and basically say cool I want access to and it's 100 bucks for all of us in order to make the economics work um that's the solution is somebody's got to say I'm I'm gonna choose a different business model I'm not going to get paid on my affiliate links and that's the person that would end up getting trusted because their incentive is not to just push you know affiliate products you know how there's that uh infographic or image where it's uh where it shows that like four companies or five companies own like 80% of the food in the grocery store yes that's what this article has they have one of those infographics where it's basically 16 Media or 16 media companies Herz dasbel zi Davis the arena group Red Ventures and a handful of others and it shows all of the companies and titles that they own and you scroll through this and you're like those are all supposed to be the reputable ones and I'm like I don't trust any of this anymore and so it almost makes me a little bit of a conspiracy theorist when it comes to this stuff and it completely ruins like my my browsing experience because now I see this stuff and I'm like I can never go to those websites in order to get reviews and so it kind of opened up my eyes it's kind of interesting uh you could see it House of fresh just Google House of fresh David vers Goliath very fascinating article that has kind of changed my opinion on review sites and they do a huge breakdown all right is that the Pod for our what are we calling it Quicky Friday the quickie the quickie all right that's it that's the [Music] pod for

all right you ready to do this yeah hold on I'm just uh I'm just executing a stock trade right now I'm I am The Wolf of Wall Street right now Sam I we are live on this podcast but I'm not here I'm not here talking to you I'm in Wall Street right now I'm on the stock market floor shaking my money saying take my money because I'm buying a stock I don't think the Wolf of Wall Street used Robin Hood but that's okay if you want here's here's what we're going to do if you want to find out how to lose money like I do you should stick around [Music] all right so what is it you've been on a stock kick you you're really on a stock kick which is just bad news for me I anytime I get on a stock kick bad things happen um I just don't realize till three years later so let me just show you these two charts so take a look at this chart the fir it's about this stock called pyo Alta networks I don't think you're following too much of palal to networks am I right in assuming that I'm not following right now but I know like it's one of the Silicon Valley ogs it's been around for a long time and yeah yeah okay good that's pretty good all right so look at the stock first I know a bullshitter when I hear one and you don't know a about the stock I I know I know whatever you can learn reading the Wikipedia I've read the Wikipedia tell me this what do they sell what's the product no no no why you looking at your screen look at me look me in the eyes and tell me what they sell n working in Data Solutions I believe so some type something like they used to be like one of the ogs that had servers didn't they dude here's the reality I don't know what they sell either it doesn't matter what they sell look at this chart for a second so this chart shows last five days damn down 14% 15% basically that's pretty bad uh and actually it would be worse than that except for there's this little uptick so look at the second chart this is today up 10% you might ask yourself did they just have like an earnings call did they announce a new product did they announce a big AI breakthrough what is causing the stock in the first two hours of trading today to be up 10% the answer is our girl friend of the Pod Nancy Pelosi just made a trade she just bought a million dollars Fout to networks of stock and immediately people start following her action and start buying this thing blind because they don't know what she knows but they know that she knows something isn't that so funny that that's what's happening nowadays like I follow this account I don't know if follow the Pelosi tracker and they were like it says breaking the queen is back at it again she just bought a$ 1.25 million of palta network calls and then it says and then like there's a sub headline palta networks is one of the leading cyber security companies in the nation like in case you need to know but here's the reality you don't need to know you just need to know that Nancy Pelosi who has one of the greatest stock trading track records of our time just bought this and she are you actually buying this no I'm not buying the I was going to say we just did this amazing whole thing on Buffett a couple episodes ago two months ago when uh Munger died we did a whole episode on that and I was gonna say you did a great job of remembering what he said which is like invest blindly in things you don't understand right yeah invest blindly off random Twitter Anonymous accounts uh you know claims about you know 90-year-old women's trades so so that's what I'm doing uh no I didn't buy this one but I did find it I was kind of curious I was like I saw this tweet and I was like I've seen her track record or like the data analysis of her track record it's like really really impressive I don't have it offand here but it's like better than most hedge funds it's better than most like famous investors that you know of and so I was wondering are people just fast following her trades that's why I looked at what's happened today and the you know the share price is up 27 bucks this morning because the the sort of the she had to disclose what she bought and so uh people were tracking that so I just find that I I was curious do does the stock actually move when Pelosi um uh makes a trade and our girl moves weight all right she makes she makes waves in the market all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we Ed we just Chang the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM I'm an idiot and I don't know anything about politics but but what I would say is if I'm like in charge what I would say to all these folks who are uh you know high up in the government is I would pay them a huge sum like two or3 million a year right because there's only like 500 how many how many people are I don't even know this is how how ignorant I am how many people are in the Senate and Cong con I would pay them a ton of money and say there now you can't speak you can't consult and also all of your money has to be in this political ETF or whatever it's called so we know every trade you're doing and you can't actually buy individual stocks it's kind of ridiculous that she's able to do this right it's actually her husband her husband's able to do it and it's their money but it is kind of crazy well I think well she can't she's allowed to do it too it's not it's not only well her husband's a a PE guy I mean he's like this is his job I would imagine all right so let me just tell you this the last big trade that I saw from her was in I believe 2022 so July 2022 Nancy Pelosi um and her husband Paul who's a VC decided to buy 25,000 shares of Nvidia H they said what's the best stock in the world right now since 2022 what is almost the most valuable company in the world right now Nvidia oh that's right so they bought it at 165 bucks it's currently trading at $800 oh that's pretty good uh a little 4.8x for our girl Nancy that's that's pretty impressive good trade I when I first yeah great trade when I first moved to San Francisco I I told you the story how I lived in this Warehouse it was like a dirt cheap Warehouse it was horrible it was an awful place to live I lived with four other guys one of the guys worked there at Nvidia when I lived in this Warehouse he worked at Nvidia I believe from 2009 to 2014 and I was doing the math if he had $150,000 of Equity given to him over four years which seems reasonable um that's 30,000 40,000 a year if he didn't sell his net worth would be something like $35 million is that insane or what and he wasn't he wasn't an early employee he would have been employee I don't know how big they were at the time but it was thousands of people back then a't that insane that someone could do that Nvidia has been insane uh so what was the s&p500 gain last year last year last year the S&P 500 was up 24% in 23 okay Nancy Pelosi was up 65% she just tripled the stock the S&P 500 performance with her trads you know as her side hustle while she's the whatever the speaker of the house whatever the hell she is um pretty crazy you know what else has grown a mere you know 25% in the last year what our YouTube subscriber base we

The Gentleman's Agreement we're not there to actually see it you do it but we hope you do that's why it's the gentleman's agreement um what do you got what's the trade that you just did that you actually are excited about because you said when we started you said we got you got a trade that you're doing as we speak what is it disclaimer not Financial advice disclaimer I'm very bad at stock trading but I I persist because I'm the little Ling that could I'll never give up and so I noticed um I don't know if you noticed but over the weekend there's like a lot of negative sentiment around Google and which is why because their AI product is uh like woke super woke Yeah so basically they released Gemini which is their uh answer to chat GPT formerly known as Bard which by the way there's a hilarious tweet that goes around every time Google releases a new product or renames something and people are like cool should I um I would love to check this out on um on meet formerly known as Google meet forly known as Google Hangouts formerly known as Google Hangouts plus formerly known as Google Duo they're like they'd show how many times Google renames its product so it renamed Bard which was an awful name to to Gemini better name um and it came out basically it was Bard B was their Bard was their their you know the next great Act of their company they like the thing about Google is it sound the word Google sounds like a noise which is fine I'm okay with that it sounds more like a noise than a name and they just tooked out a little bit too far the bar yeah they were like what are we GNA call it and somebody burped on the call and they're like okay we can go with that and the guy didn't know what to do so he just anything so um yeah basically if you went to Bard and you were like hey um can you it started off when people were like hey you know can you um generate an image of spaghetti and it generated a great image of spaghetti they're like cool can you generate an image of a Viking and then it generated an image of a black Viking and people like huh that's weird why is the Viking black hey can you generate an image of a white Viking and it was like gave you like a Mexican Viking you're like hold on can you give me an image of a white person and it was like nah I can't do that really it was basically either saying no or it was showing a picture of a black person it's like what ethnicity was George Washington they're like well it's highly debated he might be might be black and it's like you they would just do or it would be like uh who did more damage to society Elon Musk or Hitler and it's like it's hard to say who did more damage to society Elon Musk or Hitler Elon Musk tweeted these things about the stock price and Hitler committed genocide it is really a tough call and it's like and so people were taking the stuff and running with it it's like the perfect it's the the way I think about it is there's two tribes and if you can if you can get one tribe riled up you're going to get that that storyline is going to get some legs but if you can get two tribes riled up then you got like a real story and so this was basically the anti- big company um anti- big Tech tribe it's like yo babe wake up big big Tech made a mistake and then there was the anti- um anti-woke and the anti anti- AI tribes all three tribes got together and basically had a fiesta around this and so people were sharing this like crazy and then people are like the CEO of Google needs to be fired um they were like you know Google is too bloated it's too bureaucratic it's too woke it's like it's got the woke virus it will never recover blah blah blah uh you know suale the you know the guy who created mix panel awesome guy he's like Google has lost its way then I read my next tweet Elon Musk says the bureaucratic you know a Google exec called me and promised to change it but I told him I don't think the bureau the bureaucratic blob inside Google will even let him make these changes it's hopeless basically is what what these guys are saying you go on the all-in podcast and they're like I can't believe this you know basically like our rights freedom of speech is at at risk here it needs to tell the truth look at this crazy woke bias and everybody's anti-google so I woke up today and I was like pretty sure Google still owns Gmail YouTube Google search Chrome Android wayo okay I think I'll just go ahead and buy Google stock today because Google's on this dip right now on the negative PR and I think it's just that old quote of like the shortterm you know the stock market's a popularity contest and in the long term it's a weighing machine and I just think that they have tremendous assets right like uh you know YouTube does YouTube alone which is not even Google's like main product um does 32 billion a year in Revenue which is more than Snapchat Pinterest Twitter Tik Tok all combined and that's just YouTube right then you take like Google Cloud which is like does you know 36 billion in Revenue that's just like their cloud service not not Google Search right not Android not the play store not not any of this stuff and so I just think they have too many assets and so I have know I don't really do much analysis aside from I was like I don't know seems like everybody's overreacting to this because it's a really good social media storyline to be like Google's lost its way uh it's woke it it's gonna lose in AI blah blah blah maybe it's true I don't know to me seemed like a bit of an overreaction I don't think you're wrong um I think that you're right in this particular instance but I subscribe to the subreddit called money r/ money and it's basically people it's a big subreddit and it's people complaining mostly there a lot of it not complaining but a lot of it is like I see all these posts of people in college who are like I'm now 20 grand in the hole because I was buying options on Robin Hood and doing all this stuff on on these apps where they trade and in general I am so against individual trading even though I think you're right with Google it ain't going anywhere I we I buy ads on Google it freaking works so good uh but it's just I just will I refuse to go down this path it's such a slippery slope that I don't want to get addicted to it and I feel like I would and you've won a few times I know you've won a few times recently oh I'll tell you every time I win don't worry but but but have you lost a bunch of course of course uh yeah you can't trade without having bad trades right like what is the number one rule for having a few good trades is have many trades that's insane that you're doing this but you're not wrong with this I'm not doing it with a lot a lot of money and also um it's an excuse to learn for me too so I uh I don't know I think that I think a lot of learning just comes from trial and error and trying things when you build businesses is a really expensive slow way to it's like it's the it's the highest price way to learn right because takes a long time takes a lot of effort takes a lot of focus but there are things where you're like all right well like you know very simple uh I wanted to learn about Ai and so I pay this guy $500 an hour once a week to to just teach me about AI yeah and I wanted to I wanted to be uh I wanted to be up to speed with what's going on what are the new tools what are the limitations what are some of the bottlenecks and so you know I in general I have a very uh a I want to have some fun in my life B I want to learn and for me the only way to learn is like Andrew Wilkinson said this once he's like I like to walk around with a fork finding sockets to put put my fork in basically it's like um you know the only way he learns is by getting electrocuted and I kind of feel I'm the same way uh you know I hear things and I hear wisdom but it's never actually SNS in until I go and do something and maybe the real learning here by the way maybe the real learning is just don't pick don't trade individual stocks you might actually be at the correct Final Answer um and so you know I'm not saying that you're wrong about that I philosophically I agree with what you're saying but I just carve out a small fun budget that I use to do this I uh my partner Joe he trades individual stocks in this week or last week he was like I'm screwed I'm going back to indexing cuz he like looked at all the money that he I like did a calculator I go show me what you had 15 years ago show me what you have today now let's I'm going to put it in this calculator I'm going to show you what you would have had if you would would have done this and let's see and compare and the index fun funding uh index investing was so much higher and he's like yeah I'm gon to switch and so he like mies the switch this week by way I did the same calculation and it was 100% true for me too that if I had just bought the index and or just added a consistent amount to the index over time that would have been perfect but the funny thing is it's not uh the the thing in my analysis I was like okay went through every single trade again how do you learn you go back and reflect so I went through every every single trade and I said what do what story does this tell me and I had thought the story would be my prediction going in was um you would have made a little more money if you had done the index but you know whatever actually I would have made a lot more money just doing the index that was learning one number two learn learning was interesting which was I thought I would find you're not as smart as you think Buddy like you know you buy this thing cuz you have all these reasons but you're wrong and in actuality I think I only lost money buying in a very small number of of of stocks I think it was like less than five stocks that I what I bought it for versus what it currently is um is less or even less than it would have been if I had just been in the in the mar uh in the in the index like it's pretty comparable returns um the two situations where I got it wrong were um number one when I during covid I um bought some momentums like I just like bought Zoom or something at some moment I had bought Zoom like early and it was working so well and I had bought more that was stupid I shouldn't have done that but the second one was uh you know random tips from our friends you know friend says oh man I'm doing this they yeah they're a smart friend and so I B so those are the only times that I bought and lost all of my actual losses of where I where I made less than I would have in the market was just selling early because I sold a bunch of things and I sold a bunch of things some some I sold early when they had a lot more room to run some I sold when I was uh you know the market sentiment was down or I was feeling fearful and I just wanted to move to cash and I would just sell and so I actually lost the all of my losses were in the cell not the buy which was surprising to me I've been making fun of Joe because he's going on all in on indexing and I'm like great you you picked a really good month all time highs record highs you this the best month ever decide to do it and now he's like second guessing it uh let me show you a company that launched uh I think this week or last week and I want to know what your opinion of it is so it's called Harbor So harbor. Co and I want to tell you what this company is and why it's interesting to me but I'm not sure if it's going to work or not but I want to hear your opinion of it do you remember deep Sentinel we had uh s uh on the Pod so deep Sentinel I thought it was going to be huge TBD verdict still out and it was basically I like these businesses where people are monitoring things so let me give you an example so deep Sentinel their tagline is or I don't know if it's their tagline but the guy said it on the Pod he goes ring is a great way to watch your get stolen uh which is how it typically works at ring like something like I've had a bike get stolen before and I'm like oh I'll let me look at the ring yep there's the guy who did it it is in fact stolen uh and so deep Sentinel is different because it's these C it's cameras similar to ring but there's someone on the other end watching the cameras and they'll call the police and I've had like a drunk Airbnb think that my house was their Airbnb like knocking on the door at 2 a.m. and they called the police on him and like you know took care of it whatever uh there's this other thing called Harbor So harbor. Co it's basically that but for baby monitors and I shared the deck with you let me know what you think but basically have you ever heard of like sleep training so basically when you when your kid gets to be like three or four months old and they start crying sometimes you got to let them cry it out a little bit in order to like you know figure out what's real and what's not real and it eventually they quit whining and they go back to sleep they did this but for baby monitors so there's someone monitoring the baby monitor and I think they'll call you or like Ping your the monitor that they give you to let you know all right now you actually should get up the baby's been crying for like nine or 10 minutes it's time to get up you know your baby's crying I know well yeah that's the end of the commercial this product this product makes no sense how big is your house have no idea want to hear your opinion on this because we had Jack Smith on the Pod do you remember when we had him on the Pod and he did the same thing where he set up like a ring camera for his baby monitor and then he hired someone in India to watch the monitor I think he used Shepherd actually he hired someone to watch the Monitor and to call a dedicated cell phone just to let him know when the baby's been crying for 10 minutes or something like that and these guys turn that into a product uh what do you think about this well I have a couple thoughts first is I love how Sam the new dad is like you ever heard about sleep training talking to me father of two it's like if I went and worked out and I was like bro you ever heard of bicep curls and you're like uh dude what welcome to the gym uh so yes I I've UND I'm familiar with the idea that babies cry and you know sleep can get a little hard for parents all right second thing this whole class of products is like what I call like it's supposed to be anxiety reduction but actually it's somewhat anxiety inducing so you know the idea would be hey you could sleep well knowing that somebody's monitoring your baby at night and there's a whole bunch of products like this like I don't know if you ever bought like the owlet which is like this like ankle monitor uh for your baby or like there's like a sock version of this there's like a there's like another one that's like measuring their Like Oxygen like at all times or whatever hey I know all about ankle monitors been there done that know I can tell you all about ankle monit I'm guilty again preaching to the choir there yeah I didn't know you could put them on children but yeah I know a thing or two about AO monitors exactly so um so those all exist and they actually have done well I think allet did allet did pretty well I know they got in some some trouble but they I think they ended up going public what is it allet is is that's what it is it's the it's the that's the ankle monitor for babies but with the key thing being like it's measuring I think their oxygen levels so you know if the baby you know like because you know SIDS is obviously uh you know the biggest like you know nightmare for a parent um would be if your baby you know suddenly in their sleep you know stops breathing and so the idea was with Outlet you would get notified if the oxygen um levels go down which is to me makes way more sense than the let me know if my baby's crying because I know if my baby's crying typically um you know through a traditional baby monitor or like you know my house is not that big or the baby sleeps in the crib in the same room like you know that's I guess I think this I think the outlet stuff makes a lot more sense than Harbor so yeah I'm not like super into this idea and that's kind of where I stand no offense to the people behind Harbor I'm sure they're great smart people the guy who started it started mizen and Maine that clothing company remember that the clothing company that uh it's like golf people wear it it's like a popular thing not it's not popular among in our lives but it is very popular in other pretty successful right yeah it's huge it's like a 100 million plus it's like a big thing but he came out with this thing and I didn't I I invested very very small sum $1,000 he's a friend of mine and I was like all right I'll just do $1,000 just to play that that's my version of you buying Google is just doing small small Investments but I saw this and I was like I don't know this might actually work we'll see what happens but I'm into these things that monitor things uh another one and this is this is a little bit of a shill this is actually totally a shill but do you remember my body tutor I told you all about my body tutor I use my body tutor happy to plug them for free I'm not a we don't get paid for this just a Happy C customer I get a little bit paid for it I'm a small stakeholder in this company I get a little bit paid for it because because here's what they do they you I use my fitness pal but you could use their app but I use my fitness pal and I upload like the calories that I've eaten and all the food that I've eaten and they basically call me every morning to like criticize me and be like why the hell did you eat this is this part of your plan or what's your plan today or what are you going to do this week and what type of protein are you going to eat what today what type of carbs you going to eat today and they actually like hold you accountable for what you're eating I'm actually am getting paid for this I am a stakeholder in this company I'm not getting paid directly but I do have a small stake in this company and so we did this thing called mybody tutor.com Sam it's a little bit of a discount for our listeners because I do love this stuff has it worked with you uh yeah it's going great I love the product genuinely uh even though I'm not a not a uh you know not promoting there's no slash Sean um but yeah happy customer my coach Hal is awesome and uh you know it's a it's a good reminder so so most things in life I I always get surprised when the answer to most things if you if you trace back you're like all right how do I make this thing happen you're like well you got to take a bunch of action it's cool non-negotiable right you got to take a bunch of action whatever the thing you want in life is you got to take a bunch of action okay well how do you get take yourself to take a bunch of action well you got to have the you maybe a strategy or you maybe have a motivation those are some of the elements that go into action okay where do you get the strategy the motivation if you just keep going back down the chain the number one thing is simply awareness like a lot of things in life that aren't happening aren't happening because you haven't actually put your focus on it right the laser beam that's in your brain is pointed elsewhere and you haven't actually brought your awareness to to the situation at hand and you're not bringing your awareness to it regularly enough as a startup Sam I'm sure you used to do the same thing I used to put like every day when I would come to the office I draw a giant zero on the Whiteboard it's like that's how many paying customers I have and and you know I was like I don't need a dashboard I will write this number here every day of how many paying customers I have and I would write zero every day because I had to look at that I had to bring my awareness to the fact that I currently have zero paying customers because otherwise it was very easy to get distracted by a whole bunch of random tasks but if I started with well my main goal is to hit you know this many pay customers and I currently have zero if I start my day without awareness then I'm likely to take actions that are in line with changing that number to be what I want in the same way you get a phone call on the morning that's like hey what's your plan for eating today and you're like I don't know I don't have a plan I'm just going to eat whatever comes up in front of me right like you know whatever I see I'll eat like well that's not right so then you bring your awareness to okay that's right I do have this goal I am committed to making this happen I'm gonna make a plan and I'm going to just decide up front I'm G to bring my awareness to that early and often or when you take pictures or you log your meals you're bringing your awareness to what am I eating is this in line with what I've said I want to be eating or not right so I think awareness is actually like massive L underrated both in diet but really any goal you have in life I think everything is Downstream of first bringing a bunch of awareness to the thing yeah dude it's changed my life and that's why I've invested in some of these companies where they like monitor stuff for you and so you're either forced to focus on it or someone else is focusing on it for you um let me tell you one more thing have you heard of Pensky media no what is that you've never heard of that okay so most people haven't that's why I wanted to bring this up I've been found this guy a few years ago and I've been following him and I spoke to someone who worked at the company and I didn't realize how big this company is so let me tell you the story so there's this's guy named Jay Pensky his father is Roger Pensky Roger Pensky do you remember in San Francisco remember those yellow trucks they were yellow moving trucks and they used to say pensy yeah so Roger Pensky he was a race car driver he was like a professional race car driver and then he started a whole bunch of things including a moving company he also owns a CH uh uh a chain of auto part store and so he's the self-made billionaire he's probably close to 90 at this point but he's like a big deal well he has this son named Jay and Google Jay Pensky when I Googled Jay Pensky I wanted to hate this guy so much tell me what you see when you Google him let me guess he's too handsome and too rich for you he's too handsome he's too rich I think his wife is a beauty pageant be one or the other he's he's yeah he's got both of them if this guy has any handyman skills he's out of here for us dude if he can build anything with his bare hands too much get out of here I immediately Googled like J Pensky shirtless in order to like be like does he have that too which he does I think uh but I looked this guy up and I wanted to hate him and I did research on him and I completely love him I think he has it all so check this out so you've never heard of Pensky media but let me tell you all the things that they own so they own uh South by South Southwest they own the Golden Globes Rolling Stone The Hollywood Reporter now they own a large chunk maybe most of Vox they own variety he owns South by Southwest and rolling stone this guy yes yes he owns the Hollywood Reporter billboard women's wear daily New York Magazine eater uh The Verge um art news art form art in America the Rob report have you been to the Rob report yeah it's like this this article says he is the rert Murdoch of inter mment yes exactly he's really under the radar not a lot of people talk about this guy but Pensky media I think it's called the uh PMC peny media Corporation they're pretty under the radar they own enough Publications that something like one and two Americans go to their websites every month it's massive they get hundreds of millions of of monthly uniques and they're one of the few media companies that's large that is consistently profitable they've been killing it for years and years and years he's originally how did they get started how did he build this Empire yeah so he originally started uh his first like getting into the digital business was when he was in his 20s he bought mail.com and he was like I'm going to create a new email service it didn't work out and so he eventually sold the domain mail.com to someone else and he made a little bit of money doing that and then he was like all right but I still want to get into digital I still want to get into media and so he started I believe it's actually hard to find the the origins of the story but he started something like an ad Network and he starts an ad Network in the 2000s and uh it's going okay and then they eventually start buying Publications to put ads on and then slowly slowly slowly it starts they start gaining momentum and over the last 20 years I think it's the company's like 20 years old at this point they buy more and more Publications and this guy's like he's got a chip on his shoulder because he's the son of a billionaire and allegedly that's what he says he says I've taken no money from my parents I started this with a very small sum my own money and I've just slowly rolled this into another thing another thing and another thing and now it's this massive business and I think two or three years ago they raised $200 million in order to further fund Acquisitions but people aren't talking about this guy at all and I asked this guy who sold this company uh to Pensky and I'm like what is he so special at and he says uh here's a few quotes that people have said about him they go I think he has a chip on his shoulder wants to prove himself he was hustling uh back then not to be known as Pensky to prove himself not to the world but to his family and another guy said uh that he when he hires people at this point they have something like a thousand plus people he interviews every single person who they hire and when he buys a company he wants to interview every single person who works there and they say he's a steward of the brand and he truly cares there's this one story about I think it was uh H what was it it was um a real estate publication owned by this woman that was notoriously rude to everyone she was like hard to uh work with she was kind of a diva and she was just rude constantly she was one of these Hollywood real estate reporters and she kind of thought she was on top of the world and J J peny comes in and he's like this good-looking privileged guy so immediately she thinks she's going to hate him and he totally toned her down and won her over with kindness and like being polite and like having her back constantly and that's been a trend I've noticed with this guy is all these people say that he's just really kind he's really nice he's a really really Savvy operator and he's super low-key and under the radar but this guy Jay he's one of the biggest names in media and very few people are talking about him I love how he's like I want to make a name for myself he's like Pensky Media Group used the same name also hilarious uh this is fascinating so he didn't take money from his dad that's interesting he took money from the Saudis and he took money from that guy Daniel lobe who's like that like the legendary uh Trader yeah but but I think that was like 15 years into the business I I think that they actually bootstrapped it for a long time I think they raised $200 million at a billion dollar valuation how would he bootstrap it like what was the first what was the Cash Cow well the First Cash Cow was their ad Network that they made so if you I used web archive and I went and looked at what their website used to look like and it was basically it it reminded me of an ad Network now this was like 15 years old I believe uh and so like a lot of the terminology was even different and like the type of stuff that they were doing isn't really relevant anymore but it was from like owning mail.com that he bought for cheap and he sold that for a profit and then it was like an ad network is what it was but they' they've run profitable for a really really long time so I think this super cool find I'd never heard of this guy um and I did not know that you know the same family owns Pensky the truck thing they own the Indie 500 they own like the Indie Car Raceway and all that and then he bought all these Brands like South by Southwest and and whatnot that's super interesting would you want to do this because this sounds really hard to do uh in fact there's a quote here from someone who's like he's the hardest working guy I know he's always on planes he's always on calls he never he never stops and it's been that way for 15 years this seems like like rolling up kind of like old school media properties seems like both one of the more dangerous things you could do because media is like I we just saw Vice shut down the other day media is like not the most stable um industry it's not the most profitable industry either and owning a portfolio of 15 things in general and operating them is is you know like just a hard way to go a hard way to live no I would not want to do this uh I think that this is the worst way to one of the 2,000 employees yeah and not only do they have 2,000 employees but it's 2,000 like La based uh you know so they own or they operate so like do you know uh Dick Clark Studios have you ever seen like the Golden Globes or uh you remember like when the ball drops on uh on like NBC I forget even what network it's on and it says like this is brought to you by Dick Clark Studios or whatever they own that and so having to host all those things no I would never in a million years want to do that but someone is doing it and they're actually doing it successfully so if you look at Vox or how about BuzzFeed BuzzFeed has a horrible market cap and they they just sold complex media for less than I think they paid for it or um I mean what other Media company did you just mention um Vice vice.com they just shut down no I think this is an awful way to do it however it can be done and this is the only guy who's proving that it can be done at that size and so the way that he's doing it is through just being a really good operator and so he balances letting people do their thing but also he he is like pretty strict about operations so he expects a certain amount of profit things like that and he still owns 60% of the company and so would I want to do this absolutely not but do I still think it's cool yes he and if you by the way if you Google his name I was trying to figure out like where's chinx in this guy's armor like where's he screwing up uh the only thing that I could find was he got arrested for pissing outside when he was drunk on like n Tucket or Martha's Vineyard uh it's so that like that that was like the only time that I've noticed that that people really have disliked him in general he's gotcha yeah see you're not perfect by the way I said that his uh wife was a like a Miss America winner she's actually a Victoria Secret model so he's doing great in many different aspects of his life but I I thought that this guy actually better to just pause after just like so he's doing all right let it all be just let let the air answer the question there how he's doing all right but you know have you ever heard of Sai new house do you know who Sai new house is no but I have an idea for you real quick um I have noticed and many of the listeners have noticed that you love a good-look man I think you should create the Forbes 30 I think you should create the par 30 studs under 30 and it's just greatl looking businessmen just dreamy hunks dude so many times so many times people in the comments they think I'm gay or they'll comment on how I comment I wonder why dude you're like I googled this guy shirtless that was my research for the record I'm not gay but I can appreciate when someone's really handsome so sue me so sue me I love art long walks on the beach and a nice body who's it on dude it's pretty uh yeah a lot of people do think I'm gay because I remember we were talking about this one track athlete and I was like look at his calves you see those calves I'm sorry I I could admire you know I could admire well your hand was like making a cupping motion while you were saying it so that was just too much that's all right I'm fine with people thinking I'm gay that's okay

have you ever heard of the phrase shower thoughts where you like think of silly things in the shower there's some science behind this when you're out riding a bike and you're out going for a walk where you're just sitting I think it's called passive thinking you actually get great breakthroughs what I like to do is I draft my first thing and I know that it's bad I don't show anyone then I go for a walk or I'll just sit sometimes that will take 48 Hours sometimes that will take 1 hour sometimes 10 minutes sometimes a week here's where the last part and the most important part is Olie one of my favorite writers he's got this great line he goes I'm a lousy writer but I'm a good editor and this is where greatness happens Stephen King calls it killing your darling the editing phase is where all the great stuff happens and this is actually where the gold happens and a lot of people don't do this process what they do is they write their draft and that's the final bit and they get afraid and nervous and they never write it and they don't actually incubate and they don't actually edit

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
Egan is great he has a very aggressive bedside Manner and aggressive bedside manner is like the nicest way possible of calling the guy a dick uh this guy's definitely an [ __ ] and you know they're like oh you know it's like he's just very direct he's very he's very honest he's a straight shooter and those are all just ways of being like this guy will trample [Music] you what's up Sam are you I don't know if you're ready but I'm going to ratchet up the intensity a little bit here I'm going to start high intensity on the podcast I'm G to talk about some high-intensity individuals would you like to hear about some high-intensity individuals I wore my High School letterman jacket if you're not if you haven't noticed I'm shocked you haven't made fun of me so I'm ready for high intensity if you can't tell I look like a like the big man a campus you look like Al Bundy right now like just dreaming about the good old days so I I don't know if you're ready for for this I want to be I I wish I could have took State that's the vibe I'm in and so I'm ready for some intense stuff I'm going to tell you about some people that I think you know of a couple of them I think you know a lot about but they're all tied together and they are all what I will call Allin individuals they're all insane they're all kind of insane and they're insane in the same way which is that they are all the way in on what they're doing and I was reading their stories and I was kind of inspired they're all very different stories but then I realized no no no it's actually the same story it's about being all in okay so who are these people first I want to start with a guy named Egan Durban I think you know who Egan Durban is but I don't know do you know his full story I don't know his full story he kind of is shrouded in mystery a little bit I know that he's been on top of the game since he was probably 30 or 35 and he kind of controls it seems like almost La a little bit a little bit yeah so he is the manager ing director of Silver Lake and Silver Lake is a giant private Equity investor that invests in technology so they have 72 billion in assets under management which is I'm pretty sure that's bigger than every Venture fund combined did you say 72 yeah 72 so if you take out the vision fund I'm pretty sure this is bigger than like almost all VCS combined okay so who is this guy and you know he's got a crazy track record I want to talk through but like first I just want to give you a few quotes again about these all-in individuals and I give you these quotes because even though I don't do anything like this guy I'm not fund manager I'm not a managing director of a private Equity Fund I have no desire to be so I do see some of these descriptions of him and I'm like it'd be nice to be called that it'd be nice to to have that be a true thing somebody could say about me and sometimes you just got to hear it you just got to hear that level 12 exists for you to even like unlock that part of your brain okay so let me tell you some things so he goes go goes to school goes to Georgetown he goes to Morgan Stanley and then he is known immediately in the like banking World they interviewed some people and they go he came in as an entry-level Junior guy right early 20s and they go Egan was immediately comfortable at the grown-ups table and they go he just carried himself very differently it's not that he had the experience it's not even that he was smarter than anybody but he carried himself like I belong in that conversation and I'm going to show up that way and I'm not going to just like label myself as a as a junior here and I'm just here to learn I'm just happy to be here didn't ever have that energy the next thing that that I heard Egan is great he has a very aggressive bedside Manor and aggressive bedside Manor is like the nicest way possible of calling the guy a dick uh these guy's definitely an [ __ ] and you know they're like oh you know it's like he's just very direct he's very he's very honest he's a straight shooter and those are all just ways of being like this guy will trample you um and aggressive bedside manner is the next thing I learn so 1999 he leaves uh his banking the banking world to join Silver Lake and he's like I think technology the internet this is 1999 the do do com boom is happening he's like I think this is the next big thing I'm gonna go here so he goes and he's like he does a very smart career move and if you see this career move you know this person's a winner which is they join a thing that's working but instead of staying at the mothership they're like hey what's the next Frontier and they're like oh we need to expand into Europe he's like cool you got like plans or like a person in charge of that they're like uh not yet we want to do that next year and we're going to do a search to find somebody he's like cool I'll move there now and I'll do it and so he moves to Europe and he builds out the whole European business investing in European tech companies exactly and one of the big tech companies that he invested in Europe is Skype so Skype was a European company Skype had already had its runup but then it had um you know kind of faltered and so he partners with a A6 a6z at one point and he bu Skype out for one $1.9 billion and people were like this is like it's hard to turn a technology company around it's kind of on the decline it's riddled with lawsuits right now this is a messy buy and he goes in and he basically like all right we're gonna do two things we're gonna hire a great CEO we're going to settle all these lawsuits and we're going to actually invest in making our product better because the product's just been atrophying for whatever for so long and so he immediately settles a lawsuits hires a great CEO starts investing in the product and in 18 months he sells the thing all cash m for 8 half billion doar so 1.9 to8 half billion he basically triples their money but on a like billion doll base like uh principal amount and so immediately makes a name for himself uh after doing the EUR thing with that and he's doing this at a time when there's like a bit of a power struggle at uh Silver Lake and by the way he's only like 35 at this point I don't know how old he is exactly yeah he's probably let's see yeah he's probably 30 30 or early 30s uh my guess so 2008 financial crisis happening and the founder of Silver Lake this guy Glenn Hutchins one of the founders and he's like this crazy guy if you go watch interviews of him he's like mustached he comes into the office with like Barefoot he never wears shoes he's kind of like one of those like you know one with nature founder type guys but he's in private equity which is usually like suits and uh you know cut you know Cutthroat type of guys all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how Revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it and a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM by the way I think the other guy I think all three of the founders are like hippies the other one Roger uh uh mamy I think his name is do you know who he is I didn't look him up too much but yeah I saw him he's a little bit of a hippie like he's in like a Grateful Dead cover band like if you like more people know him I think as the as a musician than founding this multi kind of had to be because if you're if you're in the 90s and you're doing technology then you're early right and you're early because you're a believer in something and you're usually an early adopter you're not you usually it's like the nb's come later right the the business school kids come later and once once the opportunity is already to find which is crazy because Silver Lake now is known as this like buttoned up place of course as as as is Microsoft now and Facebook now and all the things that at one time was just like college kids just living in a hacker house type of thing so it's 2008 uh financial crisis happens that guy Glenn he's getting real stressed out he's like I just need to take a step back Ean durban's like I'm here I've been here I'm ready for this and so he starts to step forward he just done the big he just does the big um Skype deal so he's kind of riding the wind of that that's that's like the big news basically in the in the industry they're they're out to raise a fund and he's like I'll help you raise that fund you can use this track record in my name and I I'll be one of the but I need to see it at the top and so there's a bit of a power struggle the other Founders don't really want to step back he wants a seat at the table power struggle there's sort of the coup and Egan and four new guys basically become the new managing directors and the founders basically all end up stepping back but a PE firm there's not like one owner are PE firms a little bit like law firms where there isn't ever like an owner but as you rides you get an equity stake and so it almost becomes a partnership not like it's a partnership either way but uh usually you raise a new fund and when you raise a new fund you define who are going to be the how's the pi going to get split up and so as they raise fund after fund the guys who were the main principles of the first might now have a smaller stake because the new people who are doing all the work are going to have the big stake and the new fund so that's kind of what happened um so anyways he gets it and then he starts doing just crazy aggressive stuff just if you hear this guy's strategy here's what he says so in 16 years they've basically grown the thing like crazy uh since since that all happened um they've they've you know added like I don't know 25 30 billion of of assets under management during that time and he says my goal is to be the best risk adjusted risk adjusted investor Tech investor in the world what I'm trying to do is find one or two bets per year on looking for Allin bets opportunities that I can't say no to one or two bets per year and that's it I spend my whole year just trying to find one deal that is worth doing and then when he finds it he just pushes all the chips in so he did this like with Alibaba they put in like a whole bunch of money at 35 billion in market cap and then they 6X their money from there because Alibaba became a multi hundred billion dollar market cap company and he was like just at the time they were like we see this as a Google sized opportunity and this is like this is the Google of China we need to be in this and other people thought 35 billion was pretty overvalued at the time he didn't think so another example of this is he went to some conference and he spoke on stage and he's like yeah I don't usually do this but uh you know whatever it'll be worth it I'm sure so he gets off stage and he bumps into Michael Dell backstage first time he meets the guy about a year later he does the biggest Tech buyout deal in the ever uh which was taking Dell private uh where it's like a a multi-billion dollar buyout where they took it private and ended up you know revamping it it was the biggest deal uh I think ever at the time um he's also made some pretty like crazy bets so some of the some of the some of the crazier things this guy's done so first I'll give you some personality crazy things so he sucked at golf but he wanted to be good he's like golf is like you know the businessman Sport and I want to be good so do you know what he did to get good at golf no you heard the story so they had a gym for all the like employees or analysts at the company and he just goes and he just locks the gym he shuts the gym down he's like there's no more gym I I'm going to convert this into like kind of like over a weekend or whatever he converts the gym into a golf practice like a practice facility essentially and then the employees like hey where do we what happened to our gym like that was a key perk where where do we go now he's like I don't know go across the street go ask Black Rock if you could use theirs so for years the analysts all went across the street to other firms like hey can we can we use your gym youan turned it into his own private golf simulator we can't do it anymore that's kind of an [ __ ] move right I mean kind of kind of an aggressive move I mean what did his I wonder what his employees said like hey uh that's kind of lame right like what about us now he's like eight handicap golford he's got memberships at golf clubs around the world that's the ending of that story another one he's kind of like um he gets criticized because he kind of wants like power in uh like the Hollywood world like you said I think he's like a power player in La I don't know if that's true or not but he became the biggest backer of WME he also did a bunch of other things like the joke was you know he's buying things so he can get you know access to the Oscars like this guy is just like an absolute you know uh sort of like Savage individual um another thing that he said so he goes he goes I'm not trying to take the most risk but I am trying to be very concentrated in my bets he says just the way he phrased this I like he goes we get paid to hit singles and doubles then we steal third and we come in we come into home on a passed ball and it's just a different mindset than I'm trying to hit home runs he's like no no no we hit singles and doubles then through our kind of good operations we steal third and then we we we get to score we get to home on a pass ball just basically like you know the market kind of continues to grow and we benefit from that is is how I read into that so I really like that he he did not like people were like you haven't done any Investments recently uh this was back in like 2021 and he was like I think everything in Tech is overvalued all the unicorns I think it's going to be really rough for them he goes every private tech company in the world right now if you combine them is $350 billion if I could buy that whole asset class I would I would do it tomorrow because I'm pretty sure that that will two or 3x but picking any individual company is really hard companies that are valued at a billion dollars they might not go down just 30% on a correction it'll go down to zero there will be no bid for these companies which is kind of what what exactly played out in the coming year um until he stayed away from late stage Tech so I just really thought this guy was great he's done a few other deals that are interesting so in April of 2020 so two months into the pandemic he invested a billion dollars into AA BNB I don't remember the exact valuation but my wife worked at worked there at the time and at the time we were at home thinking oh well Airbnb is going out of business they that that whole company is dead and they and when they invested it was crazy and I think it was what was an18 billion valuation yeah was something like that it was like somewhere between like 10 and 20 and it was also like he structured it intelligently I think I think there was like it was like debt they had like you know like a warrant or something like that it was like a good structure I don't I don't know they didn't release all the details but the one interesting thing was he got criticized because he had never met Brian chesky the CEO he made the investment sort of side un scene and um injected a bunch of capital to the business when it needed it people were like that was a is that a rash move people doubted it but airbnb's done a Fant he done fantastic since then um you know he owns you know he you know they they own 500 million dollars of Manchester City soccer club like they own a lot of different stuff um which is kind of you know I don't know it's interesting to me um let me tell you one other thing about this guy so he said something that I found interesting they talked about the WME deal and he goes I love Ari Manuel he goes I talk to aranu every single day which is just crazy like I don't even talk to my own business partner every single day let alone some investment I made and he goes um and people were like you talk to Ari every day about what and he's like they're like what are you guys talking about he goes well you know Ari Ari averages a 90c phone call he's like so we have a 90c phone call but we're texting and calling every day and it's usually 90 seconds he goes sometimes it's a specific ask like hey we need this and introduction or we need this this analysis or whatever um he's like but I don't like to do formal board meetings every quarter too slow I like the pace that Ari moves these 90c phone calls every day which takes me to the next all an individual Ari Emanuel so you you know AR Emanuel and a lot of people know him because the character in entourage is based off of him but there was some things that about him that I didn't didn't fully know that that was kind of interesting uh did you know he's one of three brothers and all three brothers do really interesting stuff so there's a book that I read years ago it's called um what's it called something America the brothers Emanuel I believe it's called Brothers Emanuel A Memoir of an American family and I think it's in that book Ari Emanuel so Ari Emanuel is uh probably a billionaire he he's one of probably the the shot caller in La his brother is RA Emanuel who I think was the mayor of Chicago and on Obama's cabinet or something like that a political power player and in the book Ari and rag Rah I think r is his name they go yeah they go a lot of people know us but they don't know that our third brother Zeke Ezekiel he's the smartest and the more successful brother and his brother Ezekiel I believe I'm gonna screw up the titles he was head of what's the head of like health for the government under Obama he basically made the the Obama Obama care right like he was the architect of the Affordable Care Act I think he also has done some major things I don't remember exactly so don't quote me on this don't turn this into a shorts but I think he helped Pioneer the heart transplant and things like that like he invented like things that save lives and he and the two brothers are like Zeke's the smart one we're just more like stubborn and bullheaded a little bit so that's hilarious um they asked him they were like hey do you watch like Entourage like what do you think of Ari Gold is that is that you and he's like well they got some things right you know I am very aggressive and there and there he's like you know I didn't go into an office with a paintball gun and shoot everybody so like you know I didn't do that but you know they they got a lot of things right unfortunately and he's like um they're like you how have you changed over the years are you still as aggressive he goes look here's what here's what I have to say you need to know when you're on the field when you're on the field you're there to compete you're there to win and you're you're there to kill but you he's like the one thing I have learned is I've learned that I'm not always on the field and sometimes I'm off the field and I need to behave a little bit differently he because that's the only change that's happened to me in like 30 years um I thought that was also funny as an aggressive person we know somebody who worked with them and they told some pretty hilarious stories so apparently this guy's day is like this so growing up he was like dyslexic I think so he he had to go to like a reading teacher for like three hours a day or something like that and he's like I hated it I used to cry all the time I used to feel so embarrassed by it he's like then I just realized whatever this is my superpower I'm gonna win a different way okay I can't read these contracts I can't read this stuff so I'm gonna surround myself with I'm gonna basically work differently and I'm going to surround myself with people who could do those things for me and I'm going to do other things that only I could do well and so so his day is basically he's like walking on a treadmill he's got the earpiece in his ear and his assistant is just call he just has like a call list his assistant is just getting people on the phone that he wants to talk to for like 30 to 90 seconds at a time and he just immediately hits someone up calls him and in 90 seconds makes the point hangs up and then he's on to the the next call is ready in his ear and he just goes to the next one which is it starts at like 600 am I think I've read an article where he's famous for he would do something like 200 calls a day and it starts at 6:00 a.m. and he's talking to people all day just making deals somebody told me he was like they're in his office and he's just has a bag of almonds and he just whatever he wants his assistant attention he was throwing the almonds bag of almonds at her he just hit her in the head with an almond and she would turn around he's like next call I need the next call what a douche exactly all these guys all of them all of them have the same trait all three of the people I'm going to talk about okay so he also had the classic story the same but there's it's like there's something about working in the mail room so like David geffin Barry Diller AR Emanuel all have the same story which is basically started off in the Hollywood mail room and use that as their like feeding ground and I was thinking about this I was like what is it about the mail room and if you think about it what is the mail room so the mail room is basically it's the [ __ ] nobody else wants to do so it's already a filter it's going to filter out anybody who doesn't really want it because it's so unglamorous that's interesting thing number one interesting thing number two is the way it works is you're basically making copies of scripts and stuff then you got to drive it around town give it to clients you deliver the paperwork you get the you go fetch lunches you hand off the lunches to somebody who's a meeting um and if if you do good at that then you can become an assistant then you can become an agent and then whatever but you like you learn the town and you're working seven days a week and so the guys who ended up making it they basically used that as their opportunity to build like an incredible Network because the job is kind of networking and so they used that like used every rep of that instead of just being like H whatever I'm gonna just mentally check out to actually build their power Network and that's kind of like you know part of how all three of those guys um you know Rose to power can I tell you the last one now the last all in individual yeah yeah for sure I'm I'm I'm into this okay so you know this person well but I don't know if you know the full story I didn't know the full full story till I researched this but Dana White um so I want you to tell me kind of like a little bit about what you know and then I want to fill in some gaps of new things I learned when I was looking at this all right so Dana White I think he was a boxing instructor but not like coaching real boxers like it was like a jazzer siiz class in Boston he was in Boston and he moves into this bad neighborhood and Whitey buer who's a big gangster at the time he comes to Dana's office or his jazzer siiz gym or whatever and he goes hey man you're in my hood you owe me a thousand a month or something like that and Dana White doesn't pay him because he's like oh I'm a tough guy I don't need to pay this guy and then eventually he realizes that W's the real deal and he owes him 10 or 20 grand and Dana's like dude I have nothing so he moves to Vegas to flee he went to high school with these two Rich Brothers the fatita brothers the fatita brothers um they uh they come from a wealthy fam so they owned like Penny casinos like where like people like at it was like a low class thing at first where it was like their parents owned this this casino and it's almost at a gas station I think where like people would put in like penny slots from there they owned a few other casinos I think the Station Casino or Golden Nugget I forget what they're called and uh so they get money it starts working and so the two sons Lorenzo and fatita they uh or no Lorenzo and what's the other one Frank Frank they uh they become kind of guys in Vegas they actually start a few companies and they buy a few companies one of them was Gordon beers which was a cider and beer company they were one of our first advertisers at the hustle and they so they start making deals Dana comes to them and goes hey man this thing called the UFC it's kind of a sport I know you guys you brothers are somewhat into Jiu-Jitsu I went to one of these events they're pretty amazing the guy's selling the brand in reality what we're going to get is a crappy little octagon and just the name UFC it's $2 million let's buy it they get to do it to do it Dana gets 4% of the equity the other guys get the rest but they fail for four or five years so they're in the whole like $35 million they come up with this brilliant idea to have a TV show called The Ultimate Fighter in order to promote the events the events are kind of popular but like it's not really making money they create this event called the uh this TV show called The Ultimate Fighter they convinced Spike TV to air it at the time Spike TV was a pretty big deal but not that big of a deal and they do this series and they're like dude we're gonna run out of money we can't afford this series anymore then Forest Griffin and Stephen Bonner have their famous fight and at the time it was a huge deal I was a kid I remember watching this fight I get a phone call from a friend being like dude you got to turn this fight on this is so amazing at the end of that fight their the winner is supposed to get a thousand contract at the time it was or 100,000 they called it a sixf figure contract back then that was a big deal to get a six figure contract the fight is so good even though one guy won but it was so great they give both of them six figure contracts from there the UFC kind of took off that was like the Turning moment moment and so Dana and these two brothers two brothers are kind of the business like brains behind it and they're really lowkey behind the scenes but they run this business and eventually it sells for four billion dollar to Ari emanuel's company and uh now it's like the hottest thing going is that did I that very good very good off the cuff I like it I want to fill in a couple of little details here that I thought were interesting stuff I didn't know so you're right Dana grows up in Boston but he and he goes to college twice drops out twice in the first semester like this [ __ ] just ain't for me and so he goes to college drops out twice he ends up as a bellhop so he's a he's a bell he's a bouncer he's a bell hop he's like doing asphalt laying like you know that's what he's that's what he's doing with his life he wants to be a boxer but he sees a guy come in who he knew as a boxer and he looked up to and that guy was just totally punch drunk and he's like oh [ __ ] I can't do this so he's like maybe I should teach like boxing classes like Boxer size instead of uh instead of actually trying to be a boxer so that's kind of like the opening now he's doing all that and he describes that he wants to he's like I want to maybe get into boxing promotion and he's like I'm not sure exactly maybe I could be a boxing promoter but he's a bellhop at the at the whatever the hotel and he describes the day that he quit and he's like I was just sitting there and he's like actually we used to get paid pretty well for being a bellhop I forgot what it was it's like you know 22 bucks an hour or something back then he's like it's not that the money was so bad he's like and I like the guys that I worked with but he's like am I just gonna do this [ __ ] forever and he's like I had the realization that every day that I do this I'm not doing that's another day that I'm not doing the thing I want he's like because before I used to feel like you know I could always someday go do something and he's like you know what screw it he go he says uh so here's here's what he says about it he goes um he goes if I had to tell you one thing and he's given a talk later he goes it would be to take the risk he's like because when I quit and I actually went for my thing guess what I realized I can always come back and be a bell hop like this life I have is always here because it's the bottom it's not where I want to be anyways what do I have to lose I wor scar I could just come back and just get another job like this he goes but I will never get back this window of time I have right now in my 20s that like I can go and take a shot at something and so that was kind of like his mindset and his mentality so he quits and he's like I want to start so he starts trying to he's doing the boxing thing he's trying to trying to be become a promoter and then you're right the the mob thing happens here's what he said about it he goes um these guys show up and they're like hey you owe us $2,500 and he's like uh he's like in the movies it's cool when you see like mobsters and Mafia if it's real life and they want you shit's super scary he's like that is not cool and he's like so I he's like I was like I have no way of paying this he's like so I'm just gonna he goes I go home that night I just go to delta.com and I bought a one-way ticket to Vegas he goes I left all my [ __ ] there there like my TV my dresser like I just left her there I know I couldn't do anything I just ran away basically basically from these guys once I realized that they're pretty serious I bought a one-way ticket to Vegas and the guys who were behind it it was it was WHYY Bulger who's like the real deal he's uh from that movie Black Mass with and he's the the character Behind The Departed yeah exactly like when he first when they first came in they were like hey you owe us $2500 he's like I don't owe you that for what I don't have it like what do you want me to do and then a couple weeks go by and then they call him and they're like you owe this money by tomorrow 1 p.m. or else and he was like oh [ __ ] okay I got to get out of here so he left basically that night um a couple other things I thought he was friends with the fertitas they actually didn't know each other like they they only knew of each other in high school but they weren't friends and what he said was basically they they knew of each other and they knew they they liked Dana because Dana was kind of like like basically he tells the story he's like we had this class that we all hated and he's like Dana realized that the teacher was like really like uptight and so it was kind of suck to be in that class but because the teacher was uptight like one little thing could distract the teacher and throw them off so he's like Dana would go to the restroom and he would kick this door really hard and he kicked the door really hard make this huge sound the teacher would go like become irate like who the what is that who's doing that and it would go try to find the person Dana would run away but the class would basically half of the class would go by with no teacher because like teacher would be looking for somebody so he used to do that like every week and then one day he did it but his shoe like flew off and he was like oh [ __ ] uh I don't like he's like he just had a jet so the teacher found the shoe and realized it was Dana and Dana got in trouble but the fra is always like logged that in their mind they're like man he took a bullet for us basically so years later they're at a wedding and they meet meet up and they're like dude I haven't talked to you in so long you know how what what do you do and he like learns what the fatias do he learns what he does one of the things Dana says he's like yeah I teach this like Boxer size class I'm doing Jiu-Jitsu and I think Lorenzo was like you know what I'm doing good in business but like I'm not really doing anything fitness-wise like I want to train jiujitsu and Dana's like all right sure I've heard that a million times nobody actually shows up Lorenzo the next morning is there ready to do jit that's how they actually got to know each other that's how the fatia started to fall in love with like you know fighting or MMA so what happens is while he's doing that he becomes an agent same thing as AR Emanuel becomes an agent first before he becomes a business owner he starts representing or Tito and Chuck Liddell but the UFC is like so small back then even though these guys are the big stars they're so small but that in doing that he's negotiating a contract with the owner of the UFC like you got to pay Tito more look at how much money this guy's bringing in he's the face of this you gotta you got to you got to step up and the guys like the guy's negotiating negotiating he's like finally he's just like look Dana there's no money all right this whole thing's going to fall over like you're not wrong but I have nothing to give and Dana's like in that moment like basically should have been a disadvantage like [ __ ] my main business is going to go down the drain uh you know the owner can't pay him can't pay my fighter he's like this is over but he turned that disadvantage to an advantage he's like then he that's when he approached the fatias to be like hey let's buy this thing and one funny thing is that owner had mismanaged the business so bad that they didn't even own ufc.com he had sold it to just get a little bit of cash to userfriendly computers and then Dana had to go buy it back from userfriendly computers.com and like getback ufc.com domain which I thought was amazing and I think when they bought it Dana was like what did someone asked Dana they go what did you get when you bought it he goes well he had this like octagon basically just like a cage and like mats which is not very expensive but it was really just that name I Lov that name UFC so much we had to have the name exactly and then he's like you know they had put $40 million more dollars into it he felt so bad he's losing his friends money and they were trying to make it work but it just wasn't working yet and Lorenzo calls him he's like dude I can't do this anymore like I can't keep bleeding money like this if you could like can you try to sell this thing and Dan is like okay my buddy needs me to sell this and so he's like he calls everybody and he calls back Lorenzo the next day he's like there's not a lot of appetite for this thing I think the best we could do is get six or seven million bucks for this and Lorenzo is like okay let me uh let me call you tomorrow next day he calls him who knows what he had from morning that bre that morning for breakfast but he's like [ __ ] it let's keep going uh like you know let's put in another 10 million one last chance to turn this business around and then that's what they used to create the ultimate fighter that last 10 million he's in 50 they were 50 in they were 50 million in well it was all funded by the family's casino and previous successes which I think they were really rich but I think they were not rich enough that 50 was I mean 50 was a significant sum and when it sold for 4 billion those guys the brothers each owned 40 40% of the the business basically at that time Dana made 360 million on the sale and like had a you know 10% kicker some other crazy things about Dana so it takes a pretty rough dude to like build the UFC and I think this guy's kind of like a no holds bar kind of guy well have you ever met any of the UFC fighters I think you and I have been around them because we have a friend that has been around them they're they're they're all insane because if you think about what it takes so what what's it take to get in your underwear and fight to the death in front of a million people you have to be an animal you don't have all your screws doing that no and and so Dana has talked about he goes I don't think you guys understand like someone will say something homophobic or racist and he's like dude that's like not even close to as bad as it gets when when you're working with these guys they're they're insane and the drama happens every single day you only hear about a small portion of it but it UFC would not be it would not exist it would not be what it is if it wasn't d as like force of will some other ways that he's just all in so do you know he's like a banned blackjack player from multiple casinos and which is funny because it's like you can't really have an edge playing Blackjack the only Edge he has is that he's willing to bet absurd amounts of money and then he wants to walk away there well there there's stories about him like before that was hugely hugely successful where he's like I made a million dollars last night at a casino yeah exactly uh of course as anybody's ever gambled knows you never tell the stories about losing the million dollars you only tell the ones where you you made the million but his strategy one things he'll do he goes and he bets 75 to 100,000 per hand and if he just wins the first two hands he'll walk away which is just like infuriates the casino because they you know they're they need the the large law of large numbers to catch up and he's like if he makes 200 Grand he'll just immediately bounce and like ha I got him but when he starts to get in the hole that's when they you know that's when they get him so you know it's just kind of an impulsive individual a couple of other things that that I thought were kind of interesting so he's like growing up his dad was alcoholic and here's what he said he goes my dad was never around and if he was around you didn't want him to be around he goes he was not a good guy he goes but I wouldn't change anything if I didn't grow up like that I would not be me right I the toughness that that built in me would not I wouldn't have that if if I had just had like a nice you know safe upbringing the other thing he says he's like I didn't have a car so he's like I just biked everywhere I went in Boston he's like so I bought a Walkman and I would put on Tony Robbins and I would listen to you know the giant within he's like and every day I would just ride around on my bike kind of like working myself into a frenzy listening to that thing just getting anywhere I needed to go and he's like it was my kind of escape from like the shittiness of my life he's like and then I started buying those tapes for anybody as gifts because it was like so impactful to me which I thought was interesting dude isn't that funny though so Dana Dana White is is a tough guy right like I think that he's the type of guy who you don't want to mess with physically or in business like he's he's he's a he's a legit tough guy and even he listens to self-help stuff I always thought it was funny I was I used to be ashamed of like listening to a Tony Robbins or something I was like I don't want to talk about it and then you realized that like even the bad the badasses like consume a lot of this stuff in order to get pumped yeah the people who have improved themselves seem to have done something to improve themselves it's insane um one other thing he had the same thing like the mail room thing so he said I didn't know this part of the story but for three years that he doesn't really talk too much about he's like I worked under a guy he's like I basically did an apprenticeship and he's like I told myself I'm going to spend three years with this guy cuz I know if I spend three years with this guy I will know everything there is to know about the the fight business he's like today I'm not the guy who can go be the next Don King or go become the next big promoter of the fight business I know that's where I want to go but I gotta learn I got to earn my stripes and so he did his version of the mail room he's like he worked for this guy he's like for three years I worked harder he's like you know the whatever my actual wage was like per hour must have been just ridiculously low with the number of hours I put in he's like but I did every job there is he's like I was a cutman I was a corner man I was a referee I managed the talent I would read all the contracts even though he never even asked me to he's like I put in three years so I could know the ins and outs of the entire business so that that prepared me to do what I wanted to do and he's like I I knew that's what I needed you haven't actually explained how they're all the same they're all just Maniac Allin individuals right they're people who basically Ari is a good example of this so Ari kind of had already made it WME was the biggest agency one of the big one of the top two agencies in Hollywood right and he' already made it and I talked to somebody who knew him I'm like why did he buy the UFC like and to buy the UFC he raised like he tapped his Network he raised every dollar he could but then he basically had to like Leverage and mortgage WME so he kind of put everything he had worked for at risk to buy a very high-risk asset at a very high price uh you know Silver Lake was the to title in I think Silver Lake was the funer or one of the bigger funders exactly so Silver Lake sees what Ari's doing and they're like if Ari Emanuel is going all in on something he will not lose he will not let this fail AR Emanuel mortgages every he's worked for to go all in on this bet Dana has options to sell the business and actually had an option to sell for almost a billion dollars more he said but he turned it down because he wanted to work with Ari because he knew Ari is the guy who's Allin and the future upside of this thing is going to be bigger with Ari even if today's payout is a billion dollars less and so they all shared that trait of why they all wanted to be in business with each other and why they all wanted to back each other and the F Brothers no different same reason they wanted to back Dana and do this deal was they're also wired like this so to me that was the commonality amongst all these people and if you watch a big UFC fight you're going to see Ari Emanuel you're going to see his girlfriend to his left and then to his right you're GNA see Egon and then a few seats down is going to be Dana they're always they always sit in the exact same spots for all the big fights and you see them and I remember seeing Egon there and I'm like who's that guy that's always there and that's how I learned about him and Dana said when he sold the UFC he's like it kind of [ __ ] with my head he's like I spent two days I just like he's like I just had like a bender in my hotel room cuz I was like what do I do I have $300 million in my bank account my best friends who have been doing this with me are gone now I'm doing this on my own and we kind of made it but I'm used to being the guy who is fighting for fighting to make it what happens when you make it he's like it really screwed my head for two days and I was like all right well I guess I'm just I'll just go back to doing exactly what what I know how to do and just go back to doing exact like just don't change anything just keep operating the same way and so how what do you know about the fertitas the fertitas I didn't look up their history too much but I I wanted to know their personality a little bit a couple little bullet points I have here they work out every day together the brothers at 7:00 a.m. I like that I just like that as a brotherly thing to do the second thing they attend all meetings together so they're not like delegate divide and conquer they're like no bro we're going to all the meetings together they both sit there they drink a diet Dr Pepper and they attend almost every meeting together as well and then they like ball out they got yachts and planes and art and their cousin Tillman F also is a baller and so like they're just kind of a crazy family that made it this uh Wild Wild West time of Vegas I was going to say do you know who their cousin is their cousin cousin is Tillman Tillman got famous because he I think he bought in to Landry's which is a I think is it a steak steak restaurant in Texas from there he bought many many other things including like bubble Gump Shrimp and like a ton of like those not fast casual but like Applebees like not nice but like kind of nice if you're broke and you want to go out to eat type of situation and then eventually he bought out the whole company after taking it public and I believe now it's one of the most profitable privately held companies where he owns 100% of it so there's a lot of a lot of privately held companies that are quite huge his company is 100% owned by him I think it I read his biography I think it does something like $3 million a year in iida and he bought the Houston Rockets as well so he's like but he's he's known as being a real [ __ ] the other fatita guys all the interviews I've seen with them they seem shockingly they're still sharks but they seem shockingly well well-mannered and calm and and and they seem like really easygoing if that is such a word that could be described these types of sharks yeah they are incredibly respected um I'll leave you one last little quote I liked from Dana so he said uh he goes you know uh about the risk taking thing he's like you he's like you can always go back to your job but here's what you can't do you can't go back and get this opportunity again you can't rewind time you can't get back your youth to take risks he's like I realized that I didn't want to be on my deathbed with a bunch of I Shas he goes he goes and he goes not everything I've done has worked and what I've learned is that even if it turns out she it's not just that you learn how to win sometimes the most important learning is I thought I wanted to do this but it turns out that's not what I want to do and I thought that was a really wise thing that most people don't say what's he referring to walking away from the UFC it might have been like it could have been anything it could have been like when he wanted thought he wanted to be a boxer then he goes in and he realizes oh actually like only through trying this did I learn that that's not the thing I want to do oh this is Dana this is Dana talking and so I thought that was good because everybody talks about oh it's okay if you fail you'll still learn but rarely do they explain this that one of the most important things in general in life is just figure out what is the thing you actually want to be doing most people go their whole life never never finding that and then they're in their 30s or 40s or 50s and they feel like it's too late to even try a new thing they're so far down One path they don't want to go back to the bottom of the mountain and try A New Path and so I thought this is so important to know is like like early on when you're not that far up the mountain use that to your advantage because you can go back to the beginning and choose A New Path and that sometimes going down the path it's not just about becoming a better hiker it's about learning this isn't a path I like and the only way I could have known that was by trying my biggest takeaway from these stories is loyalty so I've heard Dana and the Lorenzo Brothers talk about their little Trio their their three-person team they're crazy loyal to one another and I was always envious that I didn't have like a brother that was about my age who I wanted to uh partner with or work with and so I read about the Lorenzo Brothers a lot and I'm very envious of that relationship that they've had they seem like they've had a healthy relationship with their parents who were business people and then when they brought in Dana they are all crazy loyal to one another and they never disrespect one another publicly uh it's all it's seems like a great partnership and that's been my biggest takeaway from from these guys is loyalty even Dana I don't like many of the things that he's done and I'm actually not a trump supporter but he was like Trump was nice to me in 2008 or something like that nobody else was he's like no one would no one would help us Trump helped us I remember that therefore I I'm gonna repay him now I don't think Dana is a straightup guy all the time like I said I think he's done a lot of messed up stuff but his value of Loy his his how he looks at loyalty I appreciate at least when it comes to those three those two brothers yeah you're kind of like that too where like loyalty is a um Dee rooted value I feel like if someone's loyal to you or disloyal to you even in a small way I feel like that goes really deep in your core is that right I don't forget so someone will do something someone like do you remember that story that um I explained about how I asked a reporter if she wanted to freelance for the hustle and she said that's cute and I like have always held the garage and I want to destroy her I went and re reread the email she didn't say that's cute she said that's so sweet I appreciate you so much but I'm not interested but for some reason at the time I read it and I went reread it the other day when I was talking to Sarah and I was like maybe she actually wasn't being rude but for the last 10 years I've been waiting for this woman to make a mistake and I wanted to pounce on it just to get revenge because she dismissed me I've been wanting to do that so bad and I'm so thankful that that hasn't happened yet because she actually wasn't rude me uh I reread it but the point being is if someone's disloyal to me I want to destroy them and the people who are loyal to me yes I I go all in on them because if you don't look I moved to San Francisco with not knowing anyone the way that you get ahead is you have to have a a group of people who you do everything for and you expect them to do everything in return and once you find that group of people it helps you so much not just in life but or not just in business but for everything else it helps so much and we have a friend who is so incredibly loyal that it like sets a standard of it's almost annoying you know who it's almost annoying he he buys the best gifts and I feel like I got the gift it's not even about the gifts it's like I know that if I was in trouble this guy would drop everything he would drop everything more than my dad would drop everything to come to come help he would he would say send location send me location exactly he say send location I'm there this guy his loyalty his level of loyalty is like next level and I don't even know why it's not like it's ever even been tested in that way I've never had to send me location but why do I feel that way I have no idea but the fact but I do you can't convince me otherwise uh because he has shown it in a bunch of like small ways that you know that the big way would always be there and but man it's paid off wonderfully for him he was successful on his own but he's been he's definitely gotten ahead but then there's been times I was with him one time and he wanted to ride a skateboard I go Ron don't ride the skateboard dude you're 40 years old you're about to hit your head do not do this he does it anyway he gets a concussion I we got to take him to the hospital we have to we take care of his kid while he's in the hospital for two or three days and so he's been repaid a little bit in his loyalty but it's paid off and and I and I've seen I'm like I feel like I owe you so much that I will do anything in return to to get you back and so it's helped him so much uh and so anyway I respect that about these guys is that how loyal they are I was thinking about here's a little philosophical thought experiment for you you know you know the phrase Fu money like oh he's got Fu money and I think a lot of people aspire to have that but an interesting question is what are the other Fus like you know maybe um you know Sam you could be like I have Fu Health right because if if you're in absolute pristine Health you have physical fitness you're you're you're extremely athletic you're mobile you're whatever right you can have Fu Health like what else could you have and I think Ramone has he has Fu loyalty right we're like it is is he is just full fully abundant in the Loyalty that he has for others and that others will have for him because me and you and everyone I'm sure that he's friends with we would all go to bat for him completely and I just as a thought experiment it's like what are the other versions of Fu that actually are more valuable than having Fu money have you ever thought about something like this that's a great question so what else what are the other options besides loyalty like my trainer uh my personal trainer he's got like Fu happiness where like the gu happy no matter what's going on which is kind of the way that Fu money works it's like dude he'll do whatever cuz he's like he just doesn't give a [ __ ] he just doesn't care my trainer is like that where he just doesn't give a [ __ ] there's traffic oh I'm having a party in my car oh this person cut me off well oh I'm you know whatever he just makes his own version of of like he's always in a good mood no matter what is going on he's completely unconditional he's completely Invincible I think you have it I think you have that I aspire to have that well in my opinion from my perspective you have that I was thinking the other day I'm like what does sea ever get rattled uh or does he ever get like stressed and unhappy and there's been stories and I've seen it firsthand where someone has said something to you rude or you've had something didn't break your way and and it was a tough break and you're you're hard to like get down I mean I've been with you when you've lost a bunch I've been I've seen you make a bunch but I've seen you lose in a variety of bets that you've taken you don't get rattled you tweeted out something the other day you said um your your pucker butthole what was it uh I was like everybody's got a butt clench number it's it's an amount of money where it makes your butthole pucker up a little bit and it's good to know where your pucker number is right now and just keep note of that and I was like because I had just wired a bunch of money and like it's not even that I was like wor it's not even I was like worried oh I'm going to lose it but I was literally like let me just double check the routing number let me just make sure I got that right which I don't usually like I don't usually bother to be like okay uh Palms are a little sweaty let's go ahead and hit the button like if you ever I do that with thousand best like animation when you're going to send an email you know you know the one I'm talking about where it's the monkey's finger about to push the SC and it's sweating and it's trembling because it's like you're about to email your whole list let's just are you sure you got all the details right that's like that's the pucker number for for some people with their email list and so I think everybody's got to know it your number was high I I I'm like that with a thousand and so when I think about like why am I stressed about certain things I definitely try to think you know um there was a who was it I think it was JFK he had a photo of Abe Lincoln on his desk and he goes I just always try to ask myself what what would Abe do sometimes when I get stressed I think what would Neville madora do and what would sha Pur do like how would they handle this Neville madora is another person who has no stress there was one time when he was trying to he had never owned a house and he was thinking about buying a house and he had never thought about finances because he's been making a great living for years and years and years and he never thought about money he could buy whatever he wants and he was thinking about what house he wanted and he was just going to pay cash like or something like that where it was like a big investment his first big investment and he was talking to my wife and I and he goes I couldn't go to bed last night I because I was thinking about buying this house and I can't buy exactly everything I want and I actually have to like second guess some of the things and then we were just sitting there we didn't say a word and he looked at Sarah and he goes is that stress and we were like yeah dude that's what stress is like finally you experienced it at the age of 38 years old and uh goes to the doctor he's like I have a tinging sensation what is this thing where I stayed up like for an hour last night just thinking about this and you and Neville have that same thing where you have a very high tolerance it's crazy when you see it because people take pride they're like man I don't tolerate no disrespect and it's like what are you really saying there what you're really saying is like what are you say you you tolerate it you can't disrespect me if you say something that says something about you not me what well you can't bother me like you know there's a great way Tony Robin said this he go goes um how cheap is your happiness meaning if all it takes is somebody doing something really little to take your happiness away your happiness is cheap you you got the TJ Maxx of Happiness right you are the low you are the dollar store of your of your your mood is in the dollar store right anybody can go get it for so little someone could just take the grocery cart in front of you that you wanted and now you're a little bit piff right like don't be cheap with your happiness be expensive be luxury I heard a very funny story about you and if this violates anything we'll delete it so I was with Ben last night for at Ramon's birthday we did a little birthday thing for Ramon Ben told me this funny story about how you were thinking about writing a book and you meet with this amazing author and the author asks you something or maybe he was like why do you need my help and you were like well I think I could do it I think I'm I'm talented enough to do it I just don't have the time right now and I just would rather you do it and you said something that I guess this guy thought that you were being rude and the guy in the middle of the meeting goes well stop the conversation I'm out of here this is not a good fit and instead of being insulted your your takeaway was wow I really respect that about you you did a great job of like standing up for yourself where that's not what happened here's the here the expensively here's the story of what happened um we meet with this guy he's a book development guy so basically there's there's somebody in between an editor a publisher a writer a book development guy just the guy who's going to help you think through the concept and flush it out right so I'm like who's the best in the world of this right and a question will always ask who's the best in the world of doing this I want to talk to them so I meet this guy who's the best in the world of doing this and what he asked me was not why do you want to write this I didn't say I don't have time what he said was what do you want to write about and I go oh I go I think I could write about anything I was like I could write a book about storytelling I could write a book about marketing I was like I feel like that's actually the the problem and maybe I'll write multiple books I don't know but I want to I was like I have so many ideas I want you to help me think through which of those ideas and he goes That's a nightmare he goes he goes uh he goes that's probably the worst answer you could give to somebody like me he goes I want somebody who spent 10 years 20 years of their life only thinking about one thing and that's the thing that they need to pour into a book the guy who was like oh I can write about any anything and everything oh God that's gonna be miserable for me to figure out and and he like ended the meeting like he didn't end the meeting no he but he goes that would not he's like he's like that I don't want to do that that's not a fit for me so he didn't end the meeting but he's just he's just was like I'm gonna be honest with you and I go I I was like all you did was make me want you more I was like that's exactly what I want out of my development guy yeah push back because the speech I had given about what are the things I could write about and why it was a good speech it was an A+ speech it was only 60 seconds long but I was like I made a strong point there and whenever ever whenever somebody can say the truth in the face of my persuasion I have an extreme amount of respect for them it's not about generic push back it's about truth the guy said the true thing which was that's not what you want when you're writing a book what you want is I my whole life has been building up to this one book in this one moment and this one thing that I can't wait to pour out of me because I've I've refined it in my head for 10 years and I was like that's actually right and I want to work with you even more now but I also agree with you and that you're completely right thank you and I was like I I like thanked him profusely for that the same thing happened the other day on a tax call well by the way my my point being is I think that's a really healthy way that you approached it let me tell you about a more offensive thing uh that happened that was uh also not offensive to me I have been looking for a tax person and I was like um so I created this whole like tax data room and I sent it to a couple people I was like hey I heard you're good take a look at my situation and tell me what you think and most of them they're like hey took a look at so I did three calls first call door number one guy goes um hey took a look at everything looks really good I have two suggestions of maybe if you did this instead you could save some money so okay thank you for your suggestion person number two says hey this looks uh this looks great you know congratulations on all your success um you know I think we can handle this for you we have other clients that are similar and I feel really confident about it I said okay thank you for that uh cool not quite what I'm looking for but but okay thank you third third door I get on the call this guy goes all right I took a look at everything and um I'll be honest with you you have way too much complexity for how much money you make I was like thank you I feel the same way but a part of me my ego was like uh uh did you look at the numbers they they're going up that's actually 2022 2023 is BET better and 2024 is going to be great like my ego wanted to be like are you saying I'm a broke little [ __ ] cuz like that's what I heard the way you heard that lady like that writer say that's cute and she didn't actually say that in my head what I heard was you're too poor for me thank you like you know I I don't really want to do this and I felt that for like 15 seconds but then more than that you know and I let myself have the feeling for 15 seconds of like my ego like being deflated like a you know a pin pricking my balloon there but I was like what do I actually want let me remember what I actually want and I hired the third guy of course I was like I totally agree can you help me fix this up and he's like and then as we were talking he's like actually now that you've told me more a lot of this does make sense because of the tra trajectory but like you know I still think we need to simplify and I still think that like you know you really got to ask yourself do I really want to optimize all this for taxes or would I rather just spend my time making you know actually growing the business of making more money and I'm like you sir are exactly what I've been looking for and even though that first punch hit me right in the gut and I wanted to get defensive I have learned that that gets me no absolutely nowhere and I just let that feeling go in 15 seconds and that's actually the tip by the way everybody has the same feelings it's just that some people hold that for like 10 years some people get mad for three days and then the goal is like can you just have the feeling for 30 seconds and move on and like I don't think that should be the goal dude rage is an amazing motivator I have achieved a whole lot remembering being dumped by a high school girlfriend you've had Great accomplishments but you should probably remember that like you want all those accomplishments because you think they're going to make you feel better and feeling rage is not the better you seek so using deal with that we can deal with that is not way right just remember you never want the thing you want the feeling you think the thing is gonna give you and using rage to get there is not the way ABS aren't built in the kitchen they're built by an eighth grade girlfriend telling you that you're not good enough just remember that abs are built by a crumbled up Valentine c yeah yeah bro can I tell you a funny story I was in seventh sixth or seventh grade and I really liked this girl Rachel and I was like uh I wrote this like poem valentiny thing like basically like folded it up I cut it out I write this thing and I show it to her and she I I show it I I I don't know what I did but like I basically gave it to her I think I was so nervous that I didn't even say anything I just like handed her a note and I'm standing there she opens it up and she reads it and she's like oh my God Sean this is so sweet and I'm like it worked and she's like this is amazing um who's this for and I was like God and I'm like and in my head I was like I could just be courageous and be like this is for you I love you actually turns out that I seventh grade love you and instead I was like it's for Chelsea I just made up a name and she's like who's Chelsea I was like she doesn't here she's like and I was like and I was like she was like what and I'm like yeah you know that um that improv cont she was at that I met her she goes to another school she's like did she just made the most elaborate lie and for three months I kept up this charade that there's some girl that I met that likes me and I like her and that note I showed you that was for her that's that's where I was that's where I was I don't know how I don't have ABS by now that was pretty devastating somehow that didn't even work for me see you got to use that rage to get those Habs although she doesn't know I hope she listen to this Rachel I hope you're listening to this there was no Chelsea there was you were Chelsea there was no Chelsea now she knows that's awesome um that's it that's the episode that's the [Music] pod

did you watch the Super Bowl at all I watched it just cuz it was a big deal that Travis guy seemed pretty likable in his post game interview he seemed like a big Goofy idiot in the best possible way it was really bad for him I don't know if you saw during the game he got super angry at his coach and almost knocked him over and was yelling at him the reason it wasn't cool was because his coach is old enough that you kind of pushed an old guy he kind of lost his balance he almost pushed him down and it was like that's say everyone felt bad for like their own dad and that moment but they hugged it out and it seemed like they were fine afterwards but definitely all of the Taylor Swift fans were like red flag all the have an emergency meeting we're like I'm worried about Taylor

I mean how many times have has has someone proposed something everyone's like h i don't get it but then someone else is like look what this is really about is blah blah blah everyone's like oh that sounds great that I want well you just said you know it's not bad information it's bad presentation I made my whole career doing [Music] that all right Jason we're live this is how we start we just jumped right into it can I give the can I give my like brag about you intro of what I know about you and then you can kind of correct anything that I get wrong of course we have Jason Cohen so Jason Cohen originally started you had a bunch of smaller businesses but in the early 2000s you started was it called uh it's just called smart bear or smarter Bear Just Smart bear that was 22 years ago believe it or not smart so 22 years ago you started smart bear you grew it for like seven years bootstrapped it making millions of dollars in profit sold it that company now has a thousand plus employees has sold recently or traded recently for like two billion is that right yeah it actually doesn't have that many employees it's more like hundreds which is part of why it's impressive because it's yeah it was sold in 2020 for two billion and it doesn't have a th000 employees it's super profitable like it was publicly said then um what the profits were it's 50% bottom line profit God so just just a a printing a cash printing machine then you started WP engine of which I'm a customer of WP engine is one of the large web hosting companies in the world uh that company you bootstrap for two or three years then you now you've raised I think2 or $300 million it makes many hundreds of millions of dollars it's worth billions of dollars and all along the way you've been blogging at uh as smartbear.com I've been reading that for years you are not the loudest person and that's the reason why I wanted to have you on is because you're not the loudest person but anyone who's like in the thick of it and trying to build great companies everyone reads your blog like the the the the 1% the 1% read your blog you've got a really good audience of people actually building it and the reason I like you is you and daresh are a little bit of the same personality to me there's like this Vin diagram and it's like it's like people who are wildly successful like we're talking billionaire successful but then also are just do just because it's fun and at the same time have this weird like logical way of thinking but then can like disregard that logical way of thinking and just do what's cool and what's exciting which is really rare to have someone who's both an engineer but also understands like ah it I'm just going to do it because this is cool and you do that so like Sean he just dm'd me on Twitter and I was like dude I just got this automated DM from you he's like oh yeah I built this script that automatically DMS everyone who follows me on Twitter so he's that type of guy where like he's got like a thousand projects that he will never even talk about but it's like a little thing that he had to get on the weekend but you also have WP engine which is this massive unicorn and so that's why we wanted to have you on the Pod well yeah I mean WP engine's a like one of the top 10 web Platforms in the world and then you're also tinkering with like these DM autod DM scripts because you're like yeah this is useful I like this and so that's the that combo we've we've come to find is a really good fit with us on the Pod somebody who has ambition in scale but also is a tinkerer at heart I want to talk to you about some different ideas so check this out Sean uh on your computer and Jason if you have a computer do this too go to z. apppp so it's the word deck but with the Z so zeec doapp okay so it says zeex reimagine how CEOs collaborate with their board you scroll down whose face is that yeah Ed Norton Ed Norton the actor is the founder of this company that's funny he's I believe he's like if you Google like this company Zack and you see like them doing presentations on CNBC and like that he's talking he's the founder of this company dude I just booked a demo call in 45 minutes just in case it's Ed Norton who's going to I just might get a free call with Ed Norton this might be great if it's not Ed Norton I'm immediately hanging up this Zoom I saw an interview with him and he said he's super active but these guys are they're like I guess Ed Norton's father I think was like business person and he was a raised around business and he uh he was I saw him give this interview and he was like yeah the thing about when I work with all these companies I invested is they're horrible at telling me back the story they're horrible at giving a presentation and I so I just I wanted to create software that would just help them be better at that at telling the story explaining how the company's going and to make our meetings more productive and to teach them how to do presentation and I think this company I don't know if it's software yet I think it's still a service I'm not I'm not entirely sure uh but I I saw this site and I was like what the is Ed Norton doing on this little like software site but Ed Norton is this is his company doing it and you know it's not just the experience of the viewer and and just wanting people's time to not be wasted which it also is that but it's also more compelling like if you're trying to propose something if you do a better job it's more likely that it'll happen I mean how many times have has someone provoked post something everyone's like h i don't get it but then someone else is like look what this is really about is blah blah blah everyone's like oh that sounds great that I want well you just said you know like what I mean that's just bad present it's not bad information it's bad presentation I made my whole career doing that well yeah we have like we have these college we have these college kids come on once a year twice a year and they like pitch their company and Sean's very good at hearing what they said he goes that's actually a great idea you've explained it horribly here's how I would retell that and you will tell this beautiful story and then everyone's jaw is dropping and we're like yeah we're in and uh he does that all the time he's very good at that you know we've done pitch competitions at Capital Factory for 15 or 16 years and it always goes like that so can AI magically fix it all I don't know about that but like Could It Could It Go from like negative 10 to at least like a two out of 10 you know maybe well I think you said three I I thought of three interesting things while you were talking I think you you prompted three really interesting ideas the first is you're right that most decks are terrible and they're not and everybody attacks us from a how do we make the slides fancier pre's like hey what if you were hangliding while you were looking at the slide deck it's like no no prey just chill out it's not that's not what we need and other people pitch is like you know what what if a designer just designed everything it's like cool but the actual message is the the part that's out of order jumbled up and unclear it's foggy and that's why this deck is no good not because the background color needs to be soft pastel pink and so you you start to look at this and one thing that I've done is uh whenever somebody on my team makes a presentation I inevitably will try to like try to make it better and the easiest way to make it better is just to ask a couple of questions right like a couple of simple questions one is like if people are going to remember one thing from this presentation what should it be what's what is the number one takeaway oh it's the thing on slide 37 cool let's make that slide one and then that thing you want them to take away let's make that the title right like that that'll be the title of that slide and you just sort of go on you know you ask like five questions and you can make a presentation much better with five questions I've also started using AI in this way so instead of going to Ai and basically go to chat GPT instead of asking a question and getting an answer which I think is how most people use it I'll go to chat GPD and I basically say I'm trying to do x uh but I'm not sure where to start what are some questions like ask me some questions so that I could start thinking about this the right way and it' be like well it seemed like you know we did this when we we did an episode where we were picking us we did a fake like stock of paloa we're picking a stock it's like pick one stock that you know just like for fun like we're all horrible stock Pickers but let's do it just for fun and I went and I I wrote that how should I be thinking about this like well if you're picking a stock what you want to do is this right and you might want to ask yourself the following questions what's an area I really know about what's a thing that I really believe in what am I looking for something short-term or longterm right and it asked me a bunch of questions that made me get more clear and I think if AI was going to do anything it would what it wouldn't do is just take my input and make it better it would actually stop stop me before I even vomit and it would just say cool let's just establish a couple of ground you know how long is this supposed to be absolutely getting getting interviewed and getting interviewed by it makes a lot of sense especially if it has some context of what you're saying and so the the questions can be even more pointed another thing I've heard once which I really like I haven't used this a lot but it's it's neat which is one thing that AI is good at right now is just giving you the Bland neutral summary of the topic right it definitely can do that so if you ask it for the Bland neutral summary the topic it will tell you the most obvious boring stuff so that's what you don't say it's like a negative space so like well this isn't interesting anything that's not this might be interesting now maybe that's on you to think of what that is but maybe there's some like multi-step process where the AI could be like H okay I heard all their crap now I'm gonna go ask myself what the then I'm gonna go try to find the stuff that they said that's not in there then I'm going to try to enhance that then I'm going to try to build like maybe a multi-step I could do that maybe not again there's a lot of maybe and could have I know but if it were obvious and easy it wouldn't be a good startup idea this has to be something a good startup idea has to be at least somewhat difficult to pull off you know so you have a little running start anyway that's interesting and then the second thing is you said about titles that's a huge pet peeve of mine I I agree completely people will say uh they'll they'll use the title to label what is on the page which is usually not useful because I can see what's on the page it should be the message you want them to take from that one slide that should be the title so it shouldn't say our team I can see it's our team because there's three heads and their stuff let's just say something like you know our team has had three successful exits or our team has to collect you know Collective 30 years of experience is the most boring thing you could say but at least it's something you know like what is it that you want me to know about the team that's so special that's what the title again AI could prompt or even force that and it also then helps your it goes the other way too now it helps your narrative oh yeah so I should put on the screen where we all went to college and stuff I shouldn't read that I should talk about the title which says we've had two exits so I should say yeah we exited this thing in this space this thing and that space and we work together there we've been through the trenches that's why this this team is totally drisk in terms of people which you don't see every day so we have plenty of risk but the team's not one of them whoa that's a good that's a good thing to say on a team slide to an investor Investor's like okay tick like I I don't quite believe you that there's no risk but like I'm with you I'm with you this isn't when I'm gonna lose sleep over it I love that um you know that should be the title so like AI could help and that goes both ways uh and and if you don't have good titles you could say what should what do you really want to say here oh let's make a title this long okay now let's go back to the text this is something you could be prompted for and any presentation is improved if you do that all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM here's what's funny is that you know I've no idea if you are but you you might be a billionaire or you're in that realm and you've started multi-billion dollar companies we asked you about ideas the idea that you spent most on is on how you manage Twitter I find that to be hilarious give us the second idea your your so your Twitter social media management tool idea yeah well it's not just Twitter like part of what's neat about it is uh I the same tool does LinkedIn and threads and uh and uh Mastodon which isn't isn't really working but okay here's some stuff I think is is special and and also other people could just do this even manually if you want so one is um there's certain people that I uh that I want to have more interactions with so I have them in a Twitter list because then you can search for it right but I do a search where it's the P people on that list and they've posted in the last 20 minutes which is a pretty small window and there might be a couple of things like they have some favorites or I don't know some whatever okay and I'll look at that and sometimes there's nothing in it sometimes just one or two but I'll try to if it's relevant to me then I'll respond somehow and because it was just it just got posted it's much more likely that they will respond or see it also if it's a good comment like if I spend time making it really good then their followers who might see this over the course of the next 10 hours they may see my comment and upload it I may be one of those comments near the top that ends up with a lot of likes and maybe some follows I've seen times where I have the follow B because of a reply to someone with a lot of other followers right by doing it early I get that so if I just scanned everybody that time frame is important so it really focuses my attention on that so I spend almost no time on this and yet I have this big outsized impact of what those what those are whether I'm talking to that person or the supplies um so that's something you can just take like my system does that but you can just take that the other effect it has which is funny is people are like dude you're always online like I saw daresh post and like bam you were there like in two minutes what they don't know is yeah but I see like 1 15th of what dares posts it's just whatever it happens to be exactly what he posted I'll see it so you your perception is quote unquote I'm always online but the fact is no it's this trick and so it's like a really funny trick that that has that effect why do you care why do you care because you you you had you had this one thing well no I I asked that because you wrote this other thing that I totally agree with so uh let me let me say it this way I have a bunch of buddies that are very successful you have no idea who they are they'll see me get popular on Twitter and they go hey Sam can you uh can you help me write some tweets and I'm like dude why who gives a like you you're winning who cares about this he go I don't know it seems fun so I so I help him write some stuff and every once in a while it'll go viral and they get whatever and they get addicted to it and I'm like dude don't get addicted to this get addicted to the thing you're already doing that's way better and you have you have this post or it was a sentence somewhere in one of your blog posts where you're like uh I actually think that people who have audiences that then launch software products to those audiences I think that's really dumb because they're actually not going to get that they're not going to get that many customers that doesn't work but that's not why I'm doing it I'm not I'm not launching another product because of social media okay so then why do you care so I mean when I followed you I got an automated DM from you you told me that you built to do that why do you care about building something like this for social media it's strictly for fun now what I have done for even longer than WP engine is right and so that is at this point just a part of who I am and I get a lot of fulfillment out of it and like you said you're like wow there's a lot of good stuff here um every time I hear that it feels good and also it's really just the craft of it like I like to try to get the thoughts that I have as clear as possible or as interesting as possible but there's so much that gets triggered that way that's useful to me and fun for me too and Sam sent me this blog post that you wrote that I loved um and I think it's called Rich vers King and this is great because we talk about money and we are honest about the fact that many people get into entrepreneurship because they want to make a bunch of money and that's okay you don't have you don't have to pretend you don't have to like lie about that part which is I think is is common unfortunately um but you also built bootstrap companies that enabled a great lifestyle for you and your employees and so I'm curious um can you explain for people who haven't read richers King post what is the premise of this post and then how it's played out for you I think the key thing that people really like out of it is this uh two box problem that I put near the end that was my final decision of why to sell smart bear which is let's say there's two boxes in front of you and let's say if you are wealthy suppose try to remember when you weren't in one box there's $10 million like period that's what's in the box in the second box which is opaque there's either $20 million or nothing and let's just say it's a 50-50 chance of which one it is and the question is which box do you want you have to pick just one which one do you want well if you don't have money yet I mean almost everyone's going to pick the 10 million for sure because it changes your life permanently now you could argue you know what kind of Lifestyle blah blah blah but like that's a life-changing amount of money whereas the other one is even more money but it's actually not that much more life-changing and there's a good chance that you won't get it at all that's silly this is why when you get offered some money to sell the company it's often a good idea to take it of course it could be big in the future but if you haven't crossed over to this life-changing amount of money yet what I was in that post called the freedom line You could argue how free how much money okay but will you cross over some sort of line which maybe you should decide for yourself it's it's awfully hard not to take it now what's interesting about the box game is if you're a statistician or you're an economist what you would say is there's no difference between the two boxes because the expected value of both box is 10 million so they're the same and my point is no they're not expected value is not the right way to evaluate the situation furthermore in real life I said that one box was 50/50 in real life you don't know what the probabilities are what's the chance the company will grow and sell and be huge what's the chance it's stagnant and it doesn't sell what's the chance that it goes to zero like nobody knows so it's worse than that it's uncertainty meaning I don't even know what the probabilities are are much less risky which means I do know what the probabilities are so it's actually far worse so why know you know yeah some people might take the other box it's okay you can do whatever you want obviously but most people will take that sure thing when it's real money now if it's $10 versus $20 you know whatever you might as well take a flyer on 20 because who cares so the magnitudes relative to your net worth also matter which I didn't really talk about there in that post because I wasn't getting into that but that's also true that it is it changing something substantially for you or not is actually a critical question so you're a great writer and there's two or three great sentences that I like out of this post it was uh you very bluntly you say I was always in it for the money especially in the form of an acquisition I would tell everyone here we're here to make money and if someone offers to buy the company someday I'm going to sell it and then you said after you sold it you go I have the freedom to work on any project I want for the rest of my life while simultaneously providing for my family never again worrying about bills debt having a place to sleep or sending my daughter to any college she wants and I particularly the I was in it for the money I think that's just great to just be very clear and knowing exactly what you want uh in that post I thought that I thought that was beautiful how you said that also it's not incompatible with things like I want our customers to be happy I want our employees to also make that much money blah blah blah like it's not incompatible with other positive things that you want to do there's a big difference between I want to make money and do ethical things and create products that actually have value and are not just uh middlemen or something like that or Arbitrage um you can say both in fact you probably should so you wrote that post in ' 09 I think originally and you have this cool graph where you show like there's like a threshold of that matters uh in 2023 24 what's that threshold you think now and what do you think it was then well what's interesting is um I it's this is not relative so at this point at at at WP engine also we've had a few secondary rounds which by the way all employees got to participate uh in as well um and so now I have enough money that uh I don't have a line anymore like it's okay if I don't make any more money ever again I really don't care you know I don't care like oh can I get a a jet or not it's not interesting to me just this is personal right everyone's different when it comes to money or what they want in lifestyle I have the lifestyle that I want I don't need more money so there's no line like I just don't that that's not what's motivating or what will make a decision for me anymore well what about Jason Cohen and' 06 when you sold like was there what was the number where you were like anything above is gravy and that's that's a threshold for me I think then I was thinking uh like 10 million um I think I think nowadays it's it's much more clear that you need something like 20 million this is all in the US by the way to have what would be considered to be like a rich lifestyle in America because okay you know people say things like um well I only spend you know 80 to 100K a year right now so if I had 10 million I I could live off of that and you'd be right but that's not how people are I mean I'm not very materialistic and even I wouldn't want to do that oh I'm going to continue to live at that rate forever isn't usually what people want to do it could be again if that's you then that's that's amaz that's awesome perfect you know what to do that's not really what happens so probably more like 20 million because you have to you have to there's a lot of things to do but you have to think about um averages and having a portfolio that's balanced and then taxes and then inflation and so even 4% of of Interest taking out per year is actually kind of a lot given that you want to maintain it and keep up with inflation Etc and that's where the 20 million sometimes comes from is is H you know 4% of that is like a little under a m a million after tax and then you can have quite what you what anyone in America would consider a rich lifestyle I'm happy that you put a number on it one thing I think is cool we should put this chart up are the graph on on our YouTube channel so basically it's like there's like the levels he's like you can't afford to lose your job you know at some point you're at that where losing your job would be detrimental to you okay then you can own your own house then you can and you wrot never look at the right side of a menu right so you only look at the dish you don't look at the price uh never have to work again and then it's like private jet and you can see that like it's Asin totic the the the value of the cash is you know definitely flattening out the further you go and so you draw that line and the freedom line basically of like you never have to work again you could have total total control over your time as like the important threshold yeah but see so much also depends on things like I mean if you're 26 and you get this offer um and you know you do want to work like you don't want to not work again that's not what you're going to do you're GNA do something so it's like all right I don't need to never work again quote unquote what I would like to but but let's say you're burned out it's been six or seven years you just want to do something else and so well you know you do take a ton of money off the table then you can invest a couple million into your next venture while still keeping a couple million in the bank and so no you couldn't live off that for the rest of your life but you don't want to live off that for rest of your life you want enough to self fund something and do the next thing and so I mean you have to look at the goals of course that are in front of you um but certainly you don't want to adopt other people's goals I mean I think that's maybe the unspoken other message of the post is what is it that you want and how do you know that and how do you get that and if someone else says like no you should you should build a unicorn like it doesn't matter what anybody else says yeah play your game so uh you know your blog is basically like a a gold mine of startup with wisdom and I was mining it last night when I was doing my research for this going back through reading some of the stuff that I liked and there was a few things I had never read that I actually really really liked I wanted to read a couple of these get you to react to them because you had some uh like kind of just nuggets small small short things that I want you to elaborate a little bit on or maybe give an example about just to make it real for people um because they they rang true to me so here's one you said all startups are screwed up including the ones that work it's just that the ones that work have or two things that they're excellent at even though they screwed up a bunch of things that didn't uh it didn't kill them they didn't die um so explain this because I think people have a perception of my business is kind of screwed up that's maybe why I'm failing the ones that work it's all working it's all good it's you know that it's something different right explain that one yeah it makes sense that that's our perception number one because we all have like some form of imposter syndrome of like somehow everyone else has their figured out we don't um which of course isn't true but it makes sense that we all kind of feel that way um the other thing is we see every problem in our business and we only dwell on the problems like the things that are going well we're not spending time on those things because that's not what needs attention needs fixing so you know we're spending 90% of our time on all the problems of which there are many so we feel like we're just drowning in in bad things which we are that's the truth then you look at a competitor or whatever somebody on Tech Crunch and what are you seeing some weird varnished outside not true version of it where they're super confident everything's fine blah blah blah the the way I like to say it is um whenever you see a company kind of like immediately go out of business go look at what they posted on their Blog the previous week and go look at the last podcast they did I promise you it was 100% optimism everything's going well we're growing like crazy we're getting profitable we're hiring people are loving I guarantee it's all that the week before they went bankrupt that just proves that it's now that doesn't mean everyone's failing or everyone's not failing it just proves that what you're seeing is definitely not the truth but you are seeing your truth and dwelling on the bat so this disparity makes sense but once you so so it's logical once you know that you're like okay so it's not like every it's not true that everyone's public Persona is is the truth then the other thing you can do is read the more honest accounts of businesses like Twitter or you know Facebook all the stuff when they're coming up and it's just full of like it's just R stuff all the but what do you see in those things not that you should be like Facebook I'm not saying that but just as an interesting Factor but what is it about them it's like well here's this thing there was something about connecting people at on colleges with the faces and the whatever that was just so correct so good well we might say now had such good product Market fit that despite all of the other problems it was a raging success uh at Twitter like this idea that you're posting just the headline of your blog post why was that so perfect I don't know maybe no one does people have theories it does doesn't matter the point is it was so compelling that all those other problems just I mean there was a fail whell for years for years they couldn't keep the site up something about it again I maybe I can't put my finger on it but something about it was so compelling they they succeeded despite this obvious public massive year multi-year failures you know so that's what I mean by like okay so everything screwed up okay different ways different levels screwed up sure but everything's screwed up and if there's those or two things that are just so compelling whether it's delighting people or so useful or it's built into their workflow there's various reasons why something might be just so good and I have thoughts on that as well of course um then uh then it it you succeed despite those problems it doesn't mean the problems are like okay and you shouldn't attack them but it does mean a few things that are very useful one emotionally like get over it it's okay everyone else screw up too two you're not going to fix everything and you don't have to because success stories besides like Facebook blah blah blah but even boot St solo companies that person also does not fix every problem they have of course how could they there's just not enough hours in the day so you don't have to fix every problem oo that's a relief then it begs the question which couple of problems only should I be fixing right now that really are holding me back that really might lead me to go out of business that really is hindering my growth the most the most that's really why people are canceling the most you know these These are example things that might be that critical problem or two identifying that by answering questions like those that's what you should do and you should be seeking what that one or two you know critical things are that's the reason people don't cancel despite that crap the reason people sign up the fight the reason they advocate for you on Twitter review sites what are they saying in there that's so freaking good because whatever that is you need every every customer to experience that thing like maybe you can change your processes or your s your features or the onboarding process whatever so that more people will experience that amazing thing whatever it is so identifying those one to three key things the one to three problems that's what you've got to do then that's where you focus your time whether you're a solar preneur or whether you're WP engine you have uh 1,200 people those are the few things you focus on on you know how do I remove some of those barriers that I actually should how do I enhance these things that are the thing that's making it work and though all the rest of it you don't want to ignore you want to do it you see it but you must just for capacity and actually it's okay that you are and and again I gave you lots of examples of why it is okay in fact that you are so that's what to do about that dude I remember I used to host these events and I would have I would get to we'd have all these speakers come and they were founders of every startup you've heard of and I would hang out with them in the green room with about six of them at a time and it was nothing but complaining and fear and I remember we had this guy named Alex Alex started this company called the athletic you guys know the athletic it's like a um subscription sports blog or Media Company they and eventually sold to New York Times for hundreds of millions of dollars I was with him I think on a Friday and that Wednesday the Wednesday before they just released an article saying they had raised $100 million in funding everything was going great and they had this beautiful photo shoot and he was a ball of stress and I think he he was just kind of um venting a little bit to me of saying everything that was going wrong how he's so frustrated with this and that and I remember thinking I'm like dude you're in the New York Times like on Wednesday and you had this beautiful photo shoot sounds like everything was going great and he was just it was just the reality was that things were going mostly great obviously you turn out all right but he was just complaining so much to me because I was just kind of a sounding board for him and I remember like thinking after all of these events that I've hosted that was my major takeaway which is that the people I admire they were shows just like I was and that was like kind of a game-changing kind of mind altering belief that that happened doing those EV I gotta be careful I gotta be careful asking how's it going you you never know what don't ask yeah yeah yeah I was like how are you man and was like just bitching constantly and and and I also like I like EG I got to give these guys respect I was eging them on it's not like they were just like bitching I was something does change with scale so um before product Market fit it's obviously you don't know what you're doing yet that's the whole point and then you do and you're starting to scale up if you do um then it's just all a show all of it because everything's growing and weird and no one knows what to do and and the thing that got you to product Market are the wrong actions to take when you scale you're like all I'm doing is experimenting not when you scale you know what to do now you need to do more of it you need specialists in it you so it's a totally different Behavior it becomes more like a like a tumultuous ocean kind of thing where it's like some things are riding high and fine and and some things are not but it's not true that like a 100% of the things are broken it's just not true anymore because we've had the time and the people blah blah blah to build up to that and you need to like as you scale up you need it needs to not be a food fight forever like it has to mature into something because you can't you can't operate like you were just saying with a thousand people that's just complete chaos so that's that it can't be you had a good quote from the guy from box Aaron Levy he he said um he goes starting up is the act of doing as many jobs as possible to make sure your company doesn't die and then scaling up is the act of shedding as many jobs as possible to make sure that your company doesn't die to make sure it survives right I think that's uh very true you know another thing that Aaron Livy specifically said is uh um at any given time half of the company isn't working I just don't know which half right dude Aaron Levy doesn't get nearly enough uh clout I think uh as he should so for those listening Aaron Levy started box it's box.com he started box which is uh it's like very similar to Dropbox but Enterprise he started that company when he was like 18 or was it 18 was he that young like he was just out of high school I think and he's and it's now a publicly traded company and he's still the CEO he's been doing this now for 15 plus years maybe that guy does not get nearly enough credit that guy's the man we should have that guy on yeah Erin you're welcome on uh I have a few few other spicy takes I want to get your get your reaction to because I was like reading this I was like oh I've been guilty of that because a lot of your advice even though WP is this huge company and you could talk about like scaling this big thing a lot of the stuff that resonated with me was the early stuff like the I don't have product Market fit just pulling me yet um you said one thing you know most Founders who are doing customer Discovery or like that early stage research about an idea you go it's just a Founder who's in love with their idea essentially doing like fake sales calls like just looking for evidence to support their belief um I've definitely done that I'm sure Sam we all have that's why it Ring's true because of course we all have done that yeah and you asked like the stupidest question ever which is like does this interest you would would you buy this you know what I mean useless question yeah yeah you're into this aren't you yeah you just ask these like leading dumb questions you have another one I think is pretty good you go sell more value not more time customers don't value their time they do crazy things to save $2 don't sell them time because they don't even value it um sell them more more value yeah that's especially true in consumer consumers really don't value their time um but even in business it's true and so like a classic example is uh if you you you could have a product let's say that um makes it less expensive to get marketing leads and so you could say this Hales your cost because it does but what are you they going to do with the money they might just save it it's possible what they could do is buy more leads so it also could you could say the same thing is double your leads so that's the same thing half your costs or double your leads same product but how much will I pay for having the cost I will pay some percentage of the cost that I saved 25% that's actually kind of high usually people won't pay quite that much they should they should pay pay up to 80% you know cuz why not but that's not really how people think about it um so you could you could maybe uh charge 25% of the cost you save but if you say double the leads what will they pay what were they paying now for leads a lot what will they pay to double the leads the same amount they'll pay 100% more to double the leads because they are already willing to pay that for leads they're as demonstrated by they're doing it right now so it's a difference between 25% of one half of their spend which is an eighth or 100% of their spend same product so it's just now now yes that's idealized and so forth but it just goes to show saving money saving time it's not a bad proposition but often the same product can be shown to generate value instead of Saving Time and all of a sudden it's literally in order of magnitude more valuable now you could take all of that in price but as a a quote that I took from Michael mausen who's amazing um in finance but startup folks haven't heard of him um he has this great thing about this which is the thing to do I'm paraphrasing but the thing to do is to generate customer as much value as you can for the customer and then decide how to split it with them so you could split it with them by charging more you could split it with them by higher retention they just love you and they stay they're getting so much value or getting new customers or advocacy they love you so much they talk like these are all ways you get value harder to measure than price I grant you that but they're they're very real it's very real andur are their healthier business and the risk and the growth like very real and all those things so um of course that's a that's a something of a subjective statement I I get that but nevertheless it's it's really useful to think first generate a lot of value then think now how do I split that with the customer whether that's some price some not and if so what how even if it is price how am I positioning that with them as in more value versus less you know saving money or less cost or less time something like that the only way that this story not ends but uh the exit you guys have to take this public right there's a there's a variety of things you can do when you're our siiz one is going public one is that uh another PE firm another one is getting purchased by a sufficiently large company either directly or due to another uh um investment which again could either be a private thing like PE or they could be on the they might be on the public markets and and therefore have a stock sale or something like that you would you wouldn't want that though right so the the way I think uh you should build a good company is you want optionality the ability to sell and at good terms but not not have to the ability to raise more money at good terms but not have to right the ability to go public but not have to like optionality is power so how do you do that you build a good company in the usual ways a company that's growing and is profitable and the employees are happy as evidence as by they stay and customers are happy as evidence by they stay you know like these very obvious things of like what's a good company you do that and that maximizes your options because you have because it's good therefore you drive that's what I've said all along and still believe this very day that's the right thing for us to do is that can I ask you one quick question as we wrap up we talked about um TKO Sean and I both love them but this was the we were talking about stocks he picked the company that owns UFC and WWE uh TKO is uh I don't know majority minority owned or you know one of the brainchild behind TKO is uh Silver Lake partners and their CEO I think his name is uh aan Durban is that how you say his name um I was looking him up the other day real fascinating guy does he sit on your board is that right did I see that no the no no there's there's um we have several people from Silver Lake on the board um really impressive interesting people who have really helped the company yeah what are those guys like on the finance side um it's just this level above what You' ever see otherwise right because in finance you either go to Wall Street to make a lot of money or or you could do PE but like this is the cream of the crop like they have you know the you know um valid Victorian from Warden doing like spreadsheets right so and that and then it goes up from there so it's just like this amazing analysis and insight to things plus of course they see a lot of different companies so they can bring a lot of like this is happening to a lot of our companies now that sort of thing another thing I will say that's special is you think PE and you think okay well they just take the companies apart and don't care and of course there are those kinds of PE that that absolutely exist that reputation is earned with Silver Lake though that's not the case that's not the reputation they have so when you have a a an investor who on the one hand sure they can they can do all the Cutthroat stuff um they're capable of all of it but also they have that sort of a view on what is product what a success how do you build value that's incredible so so solake has been really amazing but obviously it it there two things one is a lot of firms aren't like that the other thing is it depends on the person if a different set of people on the board we have a different experience and that's true of all investors everywhere so uh a lot of times people are like should I should I raise money from X where X is some Venture firm and the answer is always who at X because the firm is is there is something because there's a culture and there's an attitude it's not nothing it's not nothing but the number one thing is who at the firm that's what makes all the difference and unfortunately that can change well we appreciate you doing this man Jason Cohen a smart bear on Twitter a smart bear uh on a smartbear.com your blog it's the best man you're the man we appreciate this this is fun that's the [Music] pod

all right we've got our buddy sah balk on today if you don't know s he is one of the few people on Earth who has bootstrapped a company to a unicorn status a billion dollar company without ever taking outside money the guy's a legend he's in his 30s and he's done all this what I liked about this episode is most people we talked to a lot of guys who have made it but they're kind of just like you you ask them what would you do today and they kind of just shrug like I don't know that's what worked for me back then but good luck to you and you're like [ __ ] all right I got to figure this out myself say's the opposite he didn't close the door behind him he kind of just puts a ladder down and he's like hey here's three specific opportunities that I see and what I liked about these opportunities is he's very specific he says exactly what he would do and actually that he's looked into doing some of these things uh the second thing is that he these are not like moonshell ideas it's not like oh invent the next big AI thing these are just ideas that will just work like if you execute them well they will work this is one of those episodes where I actually was like writing down what he was saying I was like oh I should do that I literally slack B I was like Ben Ben call me when you're free call me I got to talk about some of these ideas and by the way at the end we talk about money and we ask a little bit about what people's numbers are you'll understand when we get to that part about what your number is I want you guys to do me a favor if you're listening on uh your your podcast app go to our YouTube page obviously you have to subscribe because that's the gentleman's agreement you subscribe when you when when we create valuable content for you all we ask is just for a subscribe but tell us in the comment section what your number is you'll understand when you get to that part and also you can view what other people's numbers are so this will be like a little bit of a social [Music] experiment S I don't know if you've seen this do you recognize this from the camp I haven't seen s since uh since Camp MFM I don't know if you see this yeah aquapa so Sam when we were at the camp um first of all microplastics all the rage right now in rich guy circles and so people are like oh yeah I had my gut tested I my microplastics are like off the charts and they're they're like what but you're so like you're so conscious about it and the person was like yeah I know and I'm conscious about it and I still have like a credit card in my belly of like plastic and uh we were like damn and so then I noticed Joe gbia the the Airbnb guy and we are all drinking water bottle like Fiji water bottles they had like a thousand Fiji and I was like dude I'm living large everywhere I look I could just grab ice cold Fiji but Fiji comes and plastic and I noticed he's only drinking from his own bottle that he's sourced from somewhere I was like do this man bring his own water on the trip and he's like and he doesn't say anything of course not preaching to anybody but I'm like I notice you're only drinking that like is there something good about that he's like I just try to avoid you know Plastics and you know everywhere I was like he only drinks glass water I only drink glass water immediately immediately went home ordered it and so since then I've only been drinking this and we uh we have to do an intro Sean yeah so Sayad was on the the podcast like six months ago you were a hit people loved you basically the gist of the Pod is you have this Empire that you own that you've not raised money for it mostly started as a WordPress blog on WP beginner and then you saw which WordPress plugins among other types of businesses were most popular you bought them or invested in them now your Empire is doing something like over a 100 million I think you were somewhat vague but I think you said over a 100 million in Revenue the whole thing you own gas stations I think you own um tons of real estate so you're just a uh you kind of have your hands in everything the title last time the catchy title which I thought was really cool s is one of the few very few people on Earth who is a bootstrapped billionaire meaning or has built a billion dollar company sorry as a Bo bootstrap so not taking external money um and did it kind of slow and steady and in a really unique way where you you really uh grew inside this WordPress ecosystem and WordPress turned out to be really big Andrew Wilkinson came on and called this strategy the Barnacle on the whale so there's you know a whale and it's a it's a growing whale and if you can be the right Barnacle you can actually just kind of grow with it and you can ride that you could surf that wave and actually build a large business yourself and by the way for the record we have to protect Sayad here he never said billionaire I think I think we said that so that's us he could he he doesn't have to deny or confirm it I I tend not to focus on the valuation the the goal is to keep building cool things that our users are loving um and with the team that I enjoy working with and have a good time and if you want s's like backstory you know from we were talked about like when you were a kid what you were doing in your teens to how you built this Empire like we did that episode so this one we're going to do something different which was just we were like hey come back on you're like well I kind of told my story already but we said actually just come and just hang out with us like we do a normal MFM where we're going to talk about five different things it'd be great to have you here just to talk about those whatever random things that come up uh along the way so if you want the backstory go there if you want to hang out come here so sad where you made this amazing document you have another topic on here that I know that's just gonna get uh that's gonna it's gonna make Shawn just super horny because he's gonna be able to promote his own thing uh what do you have here about let me get warmed up while you do this go ahead I'll stretch well I I see you know there there's a massive opportunity in in product High Services uh with offshore Market um especially in industry where the Tam is really really high uh I believe this is greatly underestimated everybody's trying to go build this massive big idea business and spending years and years building software um which may or may not work or if you're good at sales and you have some sort of audience taking this model and going to town where as a matter of fact I was evaluating a business earlier today that just came to my table that that's doing product I Services all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like 250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net worths and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what the payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year and their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM what's an example yeah give an example because I don't think most people know product I service offshore Market that's a lot of words sure sure so we took an investment stake in a company called Seahawk media uh and they offer custom WordPress development Website Maintenance basically other Web Master related services at affordable prices and we can also do it white label so this is like if you're a small business and you can't afford to hire a full-time developer you can go here you know basically get a developer for hire kind of thing at very very low rat because a team is based out of in India um and you know there's a white label offer there as well so other agencies by hosting companies businesses can add like add-on Revenue uh you know by reselling Seahawk but other example could be take like very large market like bookkeeping right there's this company called bench I use some yeah they charge you between like $299 or $499 and then more right per month to do your bookkeeping and they're really really slow um one of our portfolio companies were using it and super and we brought this thing in house um but I know that many accounting firms now have offices in Pakistan India latam Etc uh where they're doing this fractional CFO task like very very basic task like bookkeeping in basic panl um at super low cost so someone can go in and say hey we will do the bookkeeping for you at this rate uh I know of course like Shephard right this is this is one of the companies um I think that there there's a large opportunity here where you take a market where Tam is really high especially a Services market and then you turn it into a product High service you offshore the talent and then you add like a reseller or a white label model I think the uh the one that I I was looking at was bookkeeping and I think the The Tam there so so large and the key is is is the reseller and white labeling model um which is what we learn from Seahawk media so let's let's talk about Seahawk right because you have a tactical example here so Seahawk is basically your Outsource WordPress development agency and how much does it cost roughly let's say it costs like $1,000 to build a website I'm just making this up um and you're a web hosting company and a bunch of your clients are coming to you and saying Hey I want you to maintain my website and you're like well we just do hosting I don't want to build a services department so they will go to Seahawk partner with Seahawk and say hey can you manage these clients for me and we do a ref split um so now there are many web hosting companies that are effectively wh labeling Seahawk media's team um and offering add-on services to their customers like custom website design um maintenance by the hour you know site optimization hack site repair all sorts of these Services um have been productized and delivered with without you ever building your own team so in that in that same way by the way this is something that we're going to do on on WP beginner I know team is working on it and it's going to go live is we will start offering professional websites so anybody who comes to WP beginner um can get a website done and so on but you can do the same exact thing in every space so let's say bookkeeping I can go to all the smaller CPA firms that don't have the economics to build on their own bookkeeping and just say why don't you just white label my services and this is like you know now Joe's CPA bookkeeping you're getting all the clients you charge whatever markup you want um you're paying the X uh so on the back end still works the same way so if you're like for example Shephard uh can can like instead of doing a traditional affiliate model you can do this white labeled model where other people or or just becomes like your lead I have a question for both of you guys Sean with Shepard and s i I'm sure you you know a bit about this as well when you guys are out so I think Sean you guys have people in Latin America I think you also have people in Asia yeah uh when you are going out and I don't know how many people you guys have but let's just say hundreds when you're going out and you're like finding these people how hard is it to find them how hard is it to train them and how hard is it to keep the quality High um I mean it's the main thing right if you don't provide quality Talent or if you're not able to provide higher quality Talent than somebody could just easily search for then you don't really have a business so for example with Shephard they have a hundred recruiters like I remember when I was doing the investment I was like hey what's this like Giant payroll thing I thought there's like nobody here like what's what are these hundred people who are these hundred people where where's your office he's like we have an office in the Philippines we have an office in ladam and what's in that office is just recruiters who are constantly searching for talent and then basically testing them filtering them and trying to because you're like the whole game is people want to hire overseas they want the cost savings but what you don't want is the average person in the Philippines or the average developer in ladam you want the top 1% the top 5% and so who's going to do that filtering and that's the that is the whole service of what Shephard does is goes to find that so to in order to do that is it hard I don't know if I would say it's like it's not like rocket science but it did take somebody on the ground in the Philippines who started an office has 100 recruiters there and then they have a whole system and process how they intake talent and so they're getting thousands of resum√©s and then they're trying to filter down okay when somebody comes to us asking for a designer or bookkeeper how do we give them the best and not the average person so you do want to have that so that's the like that what s saying is you've already built that hard infrastructure now you could go to Joe the CPA and say you need a bookkeeper well I actually already have the good bookkeepers here um you already have a customer relationship why don't you create an add-on service it's extra revenue for you without extra work that's really smart right yeah and you know same to Echo Sean's Point quality is very very important if you can't deliver quality doesn't work but the good thing over the years that we've seeing is that Talent across the world is getting better so if if you go 10 years ago and you're trying to hire uh overseas whether it's Philippines India you may not have had that same level talent but the new generation much better English uh you know more techn technologically adapt and so on so when we're hiring in Seahawk for example this this is you know super bettered Talent we know they can build WordPress website or you know if you're a business owner you're like how do I know when I go to upwork that this person actually knows what they're doing anybody can go make a profile on upwork there's not a lot of vetting being done here you know that this is a vetted person who can do it and it's in Seahawk's best interest to vet that person because if that person is working on a a client's website for some big hosting company you're not just going to lose that one client you you might lose a contract right of white labeling the service for that big hosting company and so are you s are you going to start this for accounting the product I service of accounting or uh bookkeeping no I'm not I'm not actively uh looking to start it but I'm studying it um right now and I talked with one of the influencers in in the accounting space uh to see what if there's a JB potential I bet that guy's just a thrill to be around accounting influencers yeah it's like oh he's got his he's got his top button on button you like to party like that guy's just a thrill so you have another one here which is ecosystems and this is the kind of Barnacle on the whale idea that we were talking about earlier so you were like here's what you wrote you go I'll be the first to admit I've benefited tremendously off WordPress and the growth of Wordpress and I'm grateful for that Andrew has talked about how he with wec Commerce benefited from the growth of Shopify he got in early started making Shopify themes and then as Shopify grew his themes business grew and then they bought more Shopify apps and you said there's got to be more of these basically that this there there's not just those two there are more so what are some other ecosystems that you see that you think are exciting uh the one that I'm excited about is uh QuickBooks and the Zero apps so these accounting uh platforms are very very sticky I missed the deal here it was a really really good business um they're doing like $3 million in Revenue extremely profitable uh and I believe there's a lot of value in someone acquiring multiple one of the these uh QuickBooks apps or zero apps or maybe QuickBooks apps and then you port it over zero and and so on uh and and then you cross sell so it doesn't matter if the user switched from QuickBooks to zero or wice Versa you're still keeping that customer um you can even multiply that effect by going and tying multiple ecosystems so you can say uh QuickBooks and Shopify or in WordPress and and so on I think there there's uh serious potential here uh when you're looking at these businesses dude this episode I know this episode is good because s is saying ideas and I'm literally like opening up an email thread being like we got to do this we got to do this right now and like it looks like I'm sitting I'm almost like on my toes up ready to like go Sprint because I like he's saying things that immediately I could see the opportunity this this is good Sean do you know how many us this is shocking do you know how many users or how many customers QuickBooks has I would guess like two million I would just guess a crazy number say do you know go ahead I believe 30 I think it's 30 million people wow 30 million 30 million customers QuickBooks have which is insane what does zero have it's smaller but it's it's in the millions as well am I right is is it about 30 or is it even more I my number could be old I think I think you're you're you're you're you're spot on there and what do you think's the play is it software plugins or is it agencies that manage service I think the the software play the one I was looking at was software play and I've seen like other software plays in this not like the one that I really wanted I missed it is so stupid um I can see the regret in your face dude I've never seen you have like fomo this is amazing but like you know there there there are other you know implementation Partners um around these that have Bill adjacent apps uh that you can go in and then use that as distribution this is is a very essential tool like you're not going to not get rid of so he's had two great loves of his life his wife and then whatever this app is that got away he'll never stop thinking about this app no I'm I'm studying the ecosystem um and I think this ecosystem you can find like wonderful businesses that they're not going to be Venture growth right they they're not going to have Venture growth but they're going to be extremely profitable and you know that people are going to keep using uh quick booster zero because they as long as they have a business Okay so I'm what you're talking about is the QuickBooks I just Googled QuickBooks plugins so you're just talking about something like that so there's like um that's right there's a a variety of plugins that you can buy I imagine they cost money um yes how much uh are are you the biggest WordPress uh plug-in business on WordPress I think collectively when you look at it um after automatic we would be the the biggest who okay and I I we promised that we're not going to dive deep on numbers can you say like the second or third place like what how big of a business would they have also tens of millions of dollars yeah um and so how big of a business do you think you could build just on the QuickBooks uh platform or the QuickBooks ecosystem I think if you look at the App Store you know just like Shopify has an app store QuickBooks have an app store um and if you take couple of apps that might be doing three million four million $2 million dollar in in that range and you tative by five and you buy five of those 2 million doing 2 million you just built a $10 million a business that may not be cross- selling enough so you can unlock more value they might be mismanaged gems uh by the way if someone wants to do it reach out to me I would like to invest in it yeah yeah I'm studying this and if you have a if you're listening and you have a quick se.com I'll forward you to say you don't worry yeah you're GNA be like the mafia like where's my cut [ __ ] there's no direct access here yeah yeah yeah what uh what um so like when you do I imagine that there's so there's software like jungle Scout I think for or there's a bunch for Amazon where you could see which services or products are selling the highest I imagine there's the same for Shopify when you're studying QuickBooks I can't imagine that that software exists what does studying mean think you're you're looking at the number of reviews that the a specific app has you know all the signals they might be featuring something that's in the popular um looking at what's in the new you can Google or search in in the QuickBooks like a category uh you know the tags they're using and see how many uh Solutions show up in that and Gauge by okay if only three or four% of users are going to leave a review that's probably how many users that they actually have so if somebody has like 100 reviews that's only 4% of their user base potentially um so you can you can sort of make a hypothesis there and say okay this category or this keyword uh maybe receipt management or whatever it may be um has 20 apps and that's that's how big the market size is for a receipt app in QuickBooks if that makes you're gonna you're you're basically a billionaire building these like plugins basically and I think that that's I mean that's that's awesome like that's just so funny because the people listening to this you guys should actually go to the YouTube because you're smiling as if it's like too good to be true you're like no one's talking about this I can't believe why is no one talking about this like that's of the vibe I'm getting from your facial expressions I enjoy the game of business and I enjoy find finding these opportunities that allows uh us to compound and and that's what's exciting dude anytime I hear a billionaire talking about where he's founding compounding I'm like talk dirty to me baby yeah like like you're you keep saying billionaire which is not by the way I'm completely making that up I want to I want to respect that I'm I was being hyperbolic there it's a state of mind baby it's a state of mind it's not a so um yeah let's do open source because I was reading today why combinator put out a like request for startups they like kind of update this once a year and one of the things one of the top requests that they had was more four profit open source companies and they were like we funded gitlab and they they named like five they we we funded 150 of these and we want to do more like we like this model this is a good model and I was reading it and I was like I think I like I know what it is but I don't know why it's in why it's like particularly interesting or why it's unique and special and so tell us about the open source stuff what what is intriguing to you about open source I believe that open source is one of the most powerful ideas of Our Generation because it gives you many freedoms so anyone from anywhere in the world can look at the code and learn from it imagine like you know having some of the best programmers in the world writing code and then you some some new kid um in India or Pakistan or us wherever you are be able to read that code and then when you see something that maybe there's an idea that you have you want to contribute back to it you can just write a patch and commit that patch and then the project maintainers can say okay this is great um they can adapt your code and all of a sudden your code is now being used on millions of websites can you explain because this is a kind of counterintuitive idea right like normal business would be it's our product we hire people they build the product we would never want others to see our secret sauce our code or be able to use it or Fork it which means just basically remix it for themselves and so like I do I don't know is there anything interesting about the origins of this like when it came out was this a controversial idea because it to me it's pretty anti- the way you would normally build a business can you paint that picture kind of from first principles and and why would anyone want to contribute so well one it's it's very very controversial in the beginning right it was copy you have copyright and this is copy left like hey everything we're building is for the good of society for progressing technology for Innovation um so there's a lot of people that get behind that Vision the freedoms that it offers um in in countries like a lot of people can't afford some of the more expensive enterprise software maybe they're in in Pakistan or maybe they're in Africa somewhere where they don't have the resources to have those kind of tools to build their business and now you have this open source platform let's say WordPress it gives you the freedom to publish anywhere maybe there's censorship happening on on any other social media platform or publishing platform and you can self host your own WordPress site and you know put your take out there so that Vision uh you becomes really really important I think when you look at longterm anybody can write code you can hire developers anywhere so it most markets will get competitive and your vision becomes a USP okay and and that's what open source brings to to the table and it's going to disrupt basically every established Market that exists and um there are startups that are coming out I was I was looking at this guy I talked to this guy named Joseph he runs OSS capital and he's deep into the open source Community he's looking at you know various GitHub projects uh and he he has a pretty cool method right he sorts them by the number of stars that means how many developers are really liking that code um and then Gets behind them so one of the things that he invested in was app flowy which is a notion competitor but open source and affordable so now I can make my own notion and use it maybe I can self-host it uh and significantly reduce cost in my business let's do some examples so there's Windows the operating system then you had Linux the the open source counterpart and Linux is like a what like 20 billion or something like that it's like a big very big like kind of Enterprise and they make their money off just the services right because the product is free that's kind of the whole point point of open sources you could just use this self hosted for free but if you want the like is that all that they do with red hat is is it just services that generates so much revenue services add-ons uh you know pre premium versions of that so like engine X for example there's a free version of engine X and then there's the pro version of engine X which gives you a lot more features Etc um to save you time and convenience same thing in WordPress the core of Wordpress is free and does many many things and there's then there's plugins and many of the plugins are free which gives you a lot of cool things but then if you want more convenience you pay for um additional updates and support so you have WordPress which is the free you open source publisher I don't even know what the closed Source version of of Wordpress is maybe it's just social media um but then you have like uh Android open source iOS the the Apple you know operating system closed Source there's always this kind of like dual winner and um it's so people have this strategy of just like X but open source like slack but open source notion but open source is that generally like a good um like I like blueprints when it comes to business somebody told me about a blueprint they were like just superum for X the way superhuman just took one piece of work software and was like pay 20 bucks a month but I'm gonna make it like really slick and like incredible ux and just way better design and like uh linear was a good example of that linear was basically super human for jira for the ticketing system and it worked it's like a very successful company is a blue is a successful blueprint in your mind like popular thing but open source does that work absolutely I think you take something that has a large t uh and then you make open source version out of it that is cost effective affordable and now you grow with the community over long term like I don't think anybody could build what WordPress did as a proprietary software but the reason why WordPress was so successful was because all the other website building platforms uh or all other hosting companies as should say that didn't want to have their own website builder they started contributing to it so go at instead of building their own website builder I mean they have one but they went in WordPress and start contributing to Wordpress uh and and and many other hosting companies did too so Shopify which is essentially a hosting company uh same thing with wi at the core of it they're hosting um they have their own proprietary platforms versus WordPress is built by and built on top of by many many many other hosting companies and the sheer number of contributors are a lot and you you see the same thing um in in Chrome as well and and others but can't you say that okay so WordPress Powers how much 35% of the internet probably a little more like 40% okay so 40% okay so Shopify has a today they're at worth a hundred billion dollar I don't know what WordPress is worth I don't know what their revenue is because they're a privately held company but for controlling 30 or 40% of the internet you you should be making many tens of billions of dollars a year in Revenue you think the WordPress has over a billion in Revenue I would think no so I think when you think about WordPress WordPress is a community project and there is a uh proprietary company that the founder of Wordpress uh Matt MWI started called automatic automatic has good size revenues they're private company so I don't know what what those revenues are um but I it would be fair to say that it's not as high as as Shopify but when you look at the collective ecosystem of Wordpress and all the companies that are in it um you take godadi how big is godadi you take many many many other hosting companies or WP engine and so on and you put collectively together I would say that the market cap will be bigger yeah Auto so automatic was valued at three billion and it was valued at 7 billion at some point in its private these are I don't know if this is rumors or confirmed but it's like published in a bunch of different places and so that's what the automatic is kind of the the uh the company that like kind of I what would you call the steward of the open source program or the open source project I'm not sure what you would call it they're essentially the red hat what red hat was for Linux automatic is that for WordPress right they have the same Founders yes yeah and plus Sam you you get all the developer Street K cred bro like I mean Matt Mullen that guy's right he's a made man he's Untouchable there's no doubt that it's awesome I think actually when I think of like internet Heroes I think Matt mwag is is is up there I actually used WordPress so check this out let me explain the difference in business models I used WordPress for the hustle the hustle ended up being worth tens of millions of dollars it reaches hundreds of millions of people uh and we are small compared to many of the others on WordPress you know so I know I had a friend that had a WordPress site that was doing 100 million monthly uniques um and so there's no doubt that it's the best but check this out I bought wordpress's software called the woo Commerce woo commerce was uh $300 a year I had a business on there that was doing five million a year in recurring revenue and I paid them $300 every single year If This Were Shopify or something else I would have been paying them I believe 50 thou I think is it 10% or 5% so i' have been paying them 25 to 50 Grand a year and I was like this is a [ __ ] steal I'm stealing from these guys and I I was like I don't understand this business I'm getting all of the value and they're getting virtually none well well I think the value is disproportionately favored in in in for the consumer and that's what you want in a business right you want your users to have disproportional value uh coming from you and I think like if when you look at products and this happens you're studying long term when your product can't be 10x better in a specific space uh it it it really becomes all about the brand uh and the value that you're delivering when customers aren't using your product like actively so having that value being so disproportional makes your business far more stickier uh than your competitor who might be charging an arm like I have a bad idea for you say so where where else have we seen this where oh the customer is just getting an incredible deal deal uh one idea that comes to mind is Costco and Costco is basically like hey we'll sell you the goods at Cost Plus 10% and that's just going to cover the kind of the carrying cost of putting these items on the Shelf so like if whatever that bag of rice actually costs it's that plus 10% that's the that's always the price and we're going to negotiate the [ __ ] out of these vendors by the way to get the lowest possible version of that price and we're going to use our scale to do that and all you got to do is pay us $120 a year that's like $120 I'm saving that in one grocery trip two grocery trips this is a no-brainer and they've built a like you know huge subscription business off this do you think somebody could do that in the software world because I've I've seen a couple examples of this where I bought this um screenshotting tool that's really good it's called cleanshot X and uh free free shout out for those guys they uh so it's really good like screenshot tool but one of the ways you can buy it is off some some service that like it's like it has all the random software tools put there on the Shelf like a like a Costco like an Amazon for random software tools and it's usually at a lower price than if you go buy direct than on the site and I think it's if you have a if you have a membership to the overall thing then you can just get these tools for free I kind of wonder if somebody could do this with the open source community and just say all right pay us ,000 a year and then you're going to get you know woocommerce you're gonna get all these things at the lowest possible price or you're just gonna get go go round up all of the software and say hey you're going to be selling at cost plus 10% and we're going to have this uh um uh you know the subscription Revenue to for our members who who want to shop there is that a how bad how bad on a scale of one to terrible what where is that idea two-sided marketplaces are generally a tough business to to build so look there are challenges in there challenges in in the model but uh but you know you can you can try it and I think there there are companies doing it I think if you focus it on a maybe a sub subset let's say um agencies and you say hey development agencies we can get you access to these softwares uh at a lower price probably that's where I would start and then you try to make it broader verus saying we have every software Under the Sun um because you have to do some backend integration of sdks a lot of Indie softwares don't have the ability to have reseller models and versus like hey here's here's my thing take the payment give me money in the back end that's generally not how software provisioning works so that there's uh a little bit more Nuance there than what Costco has so what is this OSS Capital doing they basically you said they go through GitHub projects and they look at like which things have like some combination of engaged users large Tam and what do they do they invest in them or they add they build products for them they're they're investing in them um and and investing the open source Community he's like what they just give them hugs and [ __ ] what where's the money of this whole business what's going on they invested five high fives no I no they're they're investing um capital in in those businesses and helping them come into market like I mean if you look at at gitlab for example it's like 11 billion market cap right now so like app flow going after the notion Market or or like cal.com going after the scheduling Market I think we're going to see many of these establish uh companies that might be unicorns right now in the project management spaces and such get disrupted by an open source solution uh and then what's going to happen is like you and I can take app Floy and say we're making notion for doctors and we can take the code Fork it make it better and then contribute back to it because the way the licensing is done so there will be flavors of these open source softwares that that will get created like there flavors of Wordpress that are created um and that's what makes it so disruptive uh because like a doctor who might be using notion will say well I want to go use this tool because it's it does like the extra 5% that notion won't do well which categories and products do you think you think this model would work for where you're like you see a particular product category you say if we if we did if we attacked that category with this open source blueprint or framework I think that could be a winning combination I think uh the open source CRM that that does a well good enough job will will will be quite disruptive um perfect segue to our sponsor play the ad baby that but but I think uh you you take you take any you know large uh Tam market and software and you add open source component but like Sam Doo stability AI they're basically open AI but open source they're the ones who make stable diffusion right so how big are they they're multi-billion dollar right it's like AI hype cycle they're they're very big right but but people actually use you know stable diffusion a lot right it's like a it's a big project um we invested I think Sam you invested with me right in cal.com which is like the call Kenly but open source uh competitor because C Le is like really expensive and the cal.com guys have done a good job of building the open source version of that I really like this thesis in fact I think this OSS Capital thing is really smart like there's a few like strategic Venture fund ideas that I really liked this is one of them um another one that I had heard was somebody who's just taking prattas so they're like oh you do all the work of finding the company uh you know 30% of them are going to die or whatever before they raise their next round but of the ones that raise their next round you have prata you could top up and keep your percentage but most investors don't want to do it or don't have the capital to do it so these guys are just pra and pretty smart I think there's a few like like strategic Venture funds one I really wanted to do was just a flipper so you basically you would say hey I want to invest but I'll be out when you raise your series a I'm gonna do I'm really helpful in this zero to one but as soon as you get to your series a I'm out because a normal Venture fund is like seven to 10 years and you're hoping for this like thousand X outcome but the seed to series a valuation lift is like 3x and it's usually in 12 to 18 months and so if you could just pick well of like what SE startups are most likely to get to a series a or you're just in an environment where a lot of companies are able to raise their next round you can flip and for the founder it's great because you're like cool I could take this Capital today but it's actually non-dilutive like they're going to be out by the next round and that same those same shares go to the next investor so it's actually less dilutive than normal Capital but wouldn't you be accused of a like a pumping dump but you're not pumping it though like when somebody buys a home and and then sells it a year later is that a pump and dump like no well no because well I would argue a a home has uh like realized value which is that's what happens from a seed startup when you invest or precede startup 18 months later they've now built a product they have customers they have some traction they their story is so much better right like they are a Dr risk startup in some way if they're able to raise theoretically but not always usually you're right you're right but but the risk goes a little bit lower um and you were in the you entered the riskiest stage at seed so the problem is it's just like a faux PA like uh startup investing is supposed to be this like True Believers I I I was in and I'm here for the Long Hall and like you're going to change the world whereas when you sell at the series a you're like you might change the world but probably not uh all I know is you change my bank account you know by 3x if I if I sell this right and so I think that's the problem is it's so like it's an anti- signal like nobody wants to see that your first investor wants out right away it's such a bad signal so you would have to first build your brand of this is what we do it's not like for any company we do this it doesn't mean anything about them we do this with every company we invest in and you'd have to frame it not as like a quick flip because that sounds like self-serving you'd have to phrase it as like non-dilutive it's like we are the early stage guys we're really helpful early we don't know anything after that and like we want you to not dilute yourself so much so take our Capital because we're going to basically give you back those shares to sell to the next guy rather than just losing more and more Equity as you go yes still still very very high risk you have to be a very good picker and say yes this is going to go from C to a but like I looked at my portfolio so I looked at like a 100 companies I don't remember the exact numbers top of my head but basically it was like out of a 100 Angel Investments that I did uh then I looked at what percentage of them raised the next round and what was the average multiple of the companies that raised the next round you just multiply those together and it'll tell you like what's your expected value and the the math math when I did it last time which was basically that enough companies raise the next round at enough of a multiple where you would be getting a good return I think it was like 30% I was I the the math was basically that I would be making 30% on my money uh which was fantastic and better than almost every Venture fund out there but I didn't I didn't actually do that strategy because I thought of it later and also it's really hard to get around that perception problem I thought of it when one of my PR companies raised the series a and I was like this company's not going to work I wish I could just sell right now and uh bro that's ex you're proving my point you You' just proven my point uh Point there's no point no that proves my point that you could you could well you're not pumping you are dumping though yeah you're dumping yeah exactly yeah uh that's you that's what you should call it your dumping scheme speaking of numbers I tweeted this out this morning I want I'm curious what you guys will guess so I asked a question I'll tell you I guess I'll give you the background so I was talking to I heard this like coach like a exec coach or whatever and I was telling him I was like yeah I'm trying to do he's like what are your goals for the years I was like yeah I'm trying to do this this and this and one of the things I said I was like yeah if I sell this business I think I'll make and I I don't know what I said I was like I think I could make 20 million bucks and I was like and then I was like that'll be great because then then I paused I was like I was like I don't actually I have no idea what I have no idea what will change and I was like I was like because no it'll be cool because then I can um then my life will be better because I'll uh what will change and I was like wait what am I doing what is there any benefit to incremental and so I I started thinking about this I was like I do want this however I do think it's a little silly that I can't point to maybe an area of life that I want to improve using the money money's a tool I believe that but I have no idea what I'm going to use this tool for I'm just going to Home Depot trying to get a tool and it's I you what do you need this drill for and I'm like I have no idea so I thought was a little silly so I tweeted out a question today I said how much money do you think you need to live your desired lifestyle because I think I'm very close to just living the exact desired I have I don't really have any more like desires of what I want to change so what is money good for in that sense and so I asked people I said Z to 1 million 1 to 10 million 10 to 50 or more than 50 50 plus and I said how much money do you think you need in your bank account in order to be living your desired lifestyle one of the anwers got 47 or 48% which one do you think it is say and what's your answer yeah well I think if if you're if you're looking at between those four choices most people probably said at 10 to 50 that's what I would have guessed um okay that's what I would have said myself also I think that's like the like kind of my my nothing think it's per not Utopia where somebody's feeding me grapes and [ __ ] like that but like the what I actually want what I actually care about I think is is totally achievable in that range so do you uh and so Sam's question was a good one what what would your answer be like you've surpassed all these great what what but what do you think actually made a difference in your lifestyle where you're like oh I now have the money to live the lifestyle I want I call it the threshold number you know I have a very simple life I don't I don't have these crazy desires of wearing the fanciest clothes or any of those things um for me the the $10 million number was more than enough uh to have a good life um you know I do what I do because I enjoy it what would you know I want to be productive member of society and this is fun for me but you know people might say their number is uh more do do you think anything changes uh like maybe like as you go as you go up what gets unlocked at those levels of the game the only ones I could think of I'll just give you my answer so I was like I think if you go above 50 or go above a 100 you know private travel is like you know the big unlock where you know you don't have to think you just fly private everywhere do do all that I think that's the biggest one and the second one is if if you really care about you being the one to give to charitable causes I think that's the other thing that you could do is you could make large charitable donations I don't really know what else gets unlocked past that but you know you might have other ideas am I missing anything what gets unlocked over 50 I think it's it's just the level of convenience uh that you get whe whether it is and whether it is through private travel whether it is through um private he home and so on and then then the level of that that you can you know access just just get get elevated also you think there's a difference between 50 and 500 like is there like a number where you think the level of convenience is mostly quite similar like is it more convenient to have a significantly larger plane than a smaller private plane yeah yeah I mean it makes a difference on how far you're trying to go uh the poor rich guy in his small plane just puttering out he couldn't make it across the Atlantic just I mean yeah yeah like you know you can spend any amount of money that you want if if you have money you can spend it do you really need it I don't know um and that's that based on each person but even if you look at Taylor Swift right she had to take she took a private jet but it was not hars like she contracted a service to fly from Japan or wherever she was to Super Bowl because her own jet can't fly that far right um now does that mean that she she can't afford a bigger jet no I'm pretty sure she can um but it just doesn't make Financial sense for her to maybe have a global 8,000 or something like this what was your number Sean mine was in the 10 to 50 I thought 10 to 50 like that's that is past that there's there's very few things that are as appealing or just like big diminishing returns but this is my persective my my number my perspective 10 years ago would have been 1 to 10 um you know I would have been like oh 10 past 10 what does it matter and now past 10 you're like it kind of matters and maybe that same thing happens again I'm not sure that's why I kind of like I say I want to ask other people's opinions um because again I think a doesn't get talked out talked about much uh but clearly we're all acting on it everybody who's listening to this podcast everybody on Twitter you're all playing a money game and you're spending a huge portion of your life earning earning money and it is probably worth knowing what's wor uh where does money really improve the quality of your life and what are those thresholds where and what are the things you can unlock and so you could decide for yourself if it's really worth devoting this much energy and this much time to accumulating more I think 10 10 10 gives you a a a base you've got your Fortress of Solitude 10 is enough that you could tell most people to [ __ ] off because you don't need much from anyone um I actually still think you can lose 10 if you make a handful of bad Investments um uh what s you're gonna look at me stupid because I you can lose 100 if you make a handful of B investment there's no no no number you can't lose that's true um and I think I think a threshold is 10 I think another threshold is 50 that that's my current thinking what do you think happens at 50 what's the difference I think at 50 you can fly private safely uh like with that like it's no big deal you can fly private most every time you want and that and that's the only difference um well you could have a you know at with $10 million liquid I wouldn't buy a $5 million house a certain number your Nanny speaks Spanish and the next number she speaks English and Spanish next number she speaks English Spanish and French right that's what else changes but like SE where where you live you live in one of the most expensive like 50 m radius parts of the world uh like a really sick house is probably $6 million right yeah you're not going to buy that if you're worth 10 but you would buy that if you're worth 30 probably right challenge accepted something I will but you know no matter how big your house is you can you'll only ever be sitting in one seat at a time so it's it's important to have like perspective to not let the let the gold post keep moving you know forward and then for what like I mean there's a house here that's $170 million for sale like you know not too far away from so somebody who was at the camp with us I won't say their name but they uh they have a like a probably like A52 million home and they called me yesterday and they were talking and they were like oh sorry I've been on like I because I called them they were like oh sorry I've been house hunting all day house hunting you just bought like your dream home last year and you told me like we went crazy on this house because it's our dream home and it's it's it's what we've been working for all these years why we we made all this money and then they were like he's like God he's like yeah but he's like our HVAC broke and he's like he's like you know that's 50 Grand to fix that he's like my the guy fixing our fixing our AC he's got like engineering degrees I play pay two grand a month to our our pool guy our pool gu making two grand a month he's like and another four grand for landscaping he's like it's just annoying he's like everything that's it's all my problem he's like he's like yeah it's great when we entertain people but most of the time I'm like you said I'm just sitting in one chair I'm sitting in the same chair and I have whatever 10,000 extra square feet or 20,000 extra square feet of like empty house and so and it was just like such a visceral reminder of the like the age-old wisdom of like first you own your things and then they own you and it was like he was just explaining all the ways that his thing now owned him and he had this like reaction where he's like I gotta change this because like this is not my dream actually I thought this was my dream it is not my dream actually because I don't want to be owned by this where now my monthly nut is so High I have to stress about you know about all these things or when things break it's such a colossal break I feel so wasteful you know that I'm spending this much just fixing our whatever pool or whatever it is when in reality that money could like I remember what that money could do for me I used to live a whole year off that money and now it's just you know going to to one little thing how many square feet was this place uh I don't know it's probably like 15,000 square feet or something like that that's [ __ ] insane that is so insane is it 15,000 it's more than 10 less than 20 I think dude you need that's a commercial property basically you need like a property manager that's insane I think it's important one of the things that a lot of people don't think about is the holding cost of anything that you're that you're acquiring uh whether it's a property or a business or what you know understanding the holding cost the real holding cost uh may help you not make certain decisions there's other there's other hidden cost do right holding cost is one opportunity cost is another that people usually discount there's a great tweet that was going viral I don't if you you saw yesterday but the guy said he goes he goes I think making between 150 and 250k is the worst it's like what he's like is he's like it's the worst because it's too much money to just say [ __ ] it I'm just going to go do this thing I really want so it's like too much money to walk away from but it's not enough to ever like actually get escape velocity financially because you're paying like a huge amount of taxes and then you probably live in a your lifestyle creeps up and so and I and I saw like I see this so often which is that there's some range I don't know what the like the numbers depend on where you live and what industry you're in but something like 200 Grand to 500 Grand is like the it's that's the real golden handcuffs and that's the real like danger zone that doesn't sound like a danger zone it's a hit but it's a hidden danger usually because if you're making that much you're probably very talented however it is so hard to walk away from that amount of money if you once you get to that and take a risk maybe start a business or take another job that might give you all kinds of other things but maybe have less certainty or less annual guaranteed pay um and I could see that tweet going viral because I think it resonated with so many people the guy had like no followers but the Tweet had like 20,000 likes you know uh I mean it also depends on your personality my uncle who moved to us 40 years ago he's a teacher um and you know teachers in America don't make a lot of money but he's still retired millionaire so I think it's all about how you invest that and yeah compounding I think that tweet is really [ __ ] stupid um why do you think I think that if you make $250,000 a year you can live a very rich life um I think that you could have a beautiful rich life I think you can retire by a certain age I think I think that that is an outof touch tweet I think that tweet is true if your goal is to make tens of millions of dollars or Be Your Own Boss at a young age I think it's I think it's true for the people it's true for right which is if you want to be an entrepreneur or you want to uh be financially free and not have to trade your time for for a salary right no you can be financially free on 250 a year 60 and I I live in California I'm using California as my frame of reference here right yeah where you live definitely changes things and what your burn is but New York California like a lot of places like stuff I don't know like what's the amount of money you need even if you're living in Texas like what do you think is the real amount of money you make 250 a year and then you have taxes so you're taking home I don't know what the Nath is but like something like 175 or 180 something like that and then you pay for life and you might be stashing away 100K a year how many years do you have to stash away 100K in order to like be financially be be financially free it takes a decade plus yeah a decade least right and even to get to 250 that takes you usually seven to 10 years to get to making that much right seven years to get to that that salary threshold too right so now you're 17 to 20 years in that's a lot that's a long time s what are you gonna say I you don't like what Sean saying right now I can tell I think it's there there's certain something about the guaranteed payment and it really depends on your personality like the folks that are going to become an entrepreneur they don't need to walk away from 250 a lot of times like I mean when I started I had nothing no salary right um so a lot of folks start out and they don't have a salary and they they just kind of go and pursue it the few if that's what you want to do you go do it you have you have to have conviction and I think that's that's key to the success anyways um I'll clarify one thing I'm not giving advice to other people for what they should do or what the average person should do I'm saying from my perspective of what I would want and my life which is the only thing I can really speak on is the things that I know about myself and I know that most of the people who listen to this podcast are going to be people who are like-minded otherwise how did you get to episode 500 if you weren't into entrepreneurship or you weren't like-minded in in in some way with with our ethos and for people in our world I think then it's a valuable message right like um I think there's a lot I know I have a lot of friends personally who are in this situation I know what they actually want out of life I know where they where they live and the lifestyle they desire and for them that is a very dangerous thing of course to an if I'm just speaking generically that advice totally doesn't apply it's totally out of touch and it's it's a total Overkill I get that I think that's fair we I I wanted to give you an Al I wanted to give you an Alo it's like I shot myself in the foot and then I put a Band-Aid on at the very end uh where do we want to go from here let's do a couple other ones that you have on this doc so you have um let's go to the bottom here with the strong strong opinions or philosophies and so you talked about acquiring a business versus paid marketing I think this is kind of interesting I think most people don't really think about this I know when I was running my company I never thought like hey let me grow through acquisition that wasn't just wasn't on my radar uh what's your point here what what do you what do you think is the the takeaway I think uh when when you think about growing a subscription business there's only three three ways to grow it you get new customers you expand the existing customers you reduce churn and in the new customer bucket most of the people are always looking at um PPC and especially a certain scale you might be spending a lot of money in PPC paperclick paperclick exactly paperclick advertising um and your C might be high especially in a very very competitive market um in that sense it makes sense to just go pay a revenue multiplier to buy a business that has the customers that you that you're Target getting anyways and then cross out um and I would say that that's that's something that more CEOs need to think about um when they're thinking about gr you know who knows about this your boy I sold the hustle to HubSpot because I actually didn't know about this they knew about it they they made the right I know about it in that I know a guy I I know a guy no I know a guy who did this and they bought my business that was the whole point of SP that was the whole point of this podcast now I don't have too much information I haven't been part of it forever but I think it's working so are you talking about buying other like products or like content sites anything and everything I I was looking at this publicly traded company um and where I was looking to potentially establish a sizable stake and their revenues were growing steadily but not exponentially because they couldn't compete with the larger competitors um but the reseller side of their business was great one of their resellers were actually making more money than this company was what's a reseller like C can you give an example that isn't related to this company sure so like I could for example resell uh hopspot or any any other you know hosting I can be a hosting reseller uh I can make my own hosting company selling Amazon I can be Amazon reseller and so on um so so for this business they basically just uh acquired one of their resellers and boosted their revenue so it's just like the same customer that they had that and bringing it in I wanted to work with the management and just kind of fund their acquisition of the reseller because the margins if it was in house would be much much better how can a reseller make more than the main thing if you're just reselling and then presumably giving a cut back to the the mothership how does the reseller ever make more money no it's it all depends on the pricing and how you're licensing and what you're charging on on your end okay um so like let's say we we both could be Drop Shipping the same thing and I could charge like five times premium because I know how to Market better and you're charging only 2x okay right so but but that's just one example that you can you can look into your own ecosystem and start acquiring your resellers and bring that customer in house but also what HubSpot did with the content site makes total sense what um what zenes just recently did um with K clous uh makes total sense um and and so on so I think that when when you're looking at you know acquisition and growth like you know I'm talking about acquisition from like new customer acquisition think about m&a as a uh as a viable option especially when your PPC budget is is high could your WordPress Empire have existed Without You owning WP beginner so WP beginner for The Listener by the way it's like a Blog if you Google how to set up an email service on WordPress WP beginner which say owns always shows up number one so would your Empire have existed without WP beginner well no the answer is no but for many reasons no I think you can't build solutions to solve problem that you don't fully understand and for me to be able to build the best solution in the market I had to communicate with the audience I had to understand their pain points um and that I believe was our biggest advantage of course the marketing and having the audience is very important too uh very very important but um I think that understanding of the paino is crucial like for example uh in talking to their customers and also my various company Founders and GMS I realized that uh we were not happy with a help that software so we went and and acquired uh stake in groove right which is a help software that will uh drastically reduce cost for anybody who's using zenas or anybody using helpscout but now I know that like certain customers that are that are using Groove also want our other Solutions and I know that many of our customers and agencies and so on they're all using a help you know help that software so I can uh you know cross promote group to them and say hey if you switch from uh zenes or whatever you'll say 40% if you if you're an agency you using front for your communication switch here and you'll save 80% so that level of synergy um gets unlocked um and can be quite lucrative can we finish with these two like life uh life lesson type things I think they're both good and I know we're on time but I want to do it anyways compounding Goodwill is the best form of compounding what do you mean by that I think uh too many times we are very transactional in the relationships that we're in uh in you know we're doing something nice and saying hey do something back and return for me I think just giving um with no expectation return a lot of us are very smart uh and sometimes in that we can be kind of you know a holy you know and and not so nice so I think intellect is a gift and kindness is a choice and if if we choose to be kind um over long term this this comes back multi multi multifold so not letting your ego or the keyboard Warrior get to you and and you know I'm smarter than you you're 100% wrong you know just just go going along and trying to help out wherever you can even if you feel like you're in the right sometimes it's better to just be kind anyways uh you know sometimes I I get stuck on that where I'm like this is but this is right that's what what we said and actually it doesn't matter what we said I should just in that moment it's it matters more to them than it does to me to just let it to just be kind and just go their way rather than than mine I've learned that lesson the hard way a couple times absolutely you wrote this guy's named gu spear I've seen this guy around but I don't know him who is this guy he's got something special he host some conference thing right that people really like who is this guy why is he the example of that yeah so he he's a really good friend now um and we're in a forum together so he his conference is called value X very well-known value investor um has a book as well and you know he talks about compounding Goodwill um in his book uh and the intelligent investor uh educational value investor actually um and I'm always really really Amazed by his level of generosity the amount of like hey you need this let me just connect you with X and Y and Z and longterm what he's been able to do is build this amazing Network work of super duper talented people that like you know if he Rings they'll pick up and you help out whatever and nothing nothing in in returns I think he is an amazing example and uh I learned a ton from him even you know in Chicago couple months ago and he gave me an idea to acquire like the very cool deal idea um of doing Acquisitions and then long story short I was able to actually use it deal came and use that exact tactic to make a make a purchase in a very tax efficient way so I think his ability to just you know do that is really good but I you know I don't know you that well we're friends but we don't hang out too much if I had to guess I would say that you're a very shrewd negotiator and I would say that you're probably a very disciplined and firm manager I think you're probably quite nice but I think that like you're a very disciplined person which sometimes times people would say well you're just being an [ __ ] or something like that you know if you have enough employees some of them are going to think that about you how are you balancing being a nice person and also like trying to get the best of a deal or uh trying to capture uh a little bit more value for yourself than for the other person I think not all juice have to be squeezed if you think about value on a very long-term way so part of the discipline is to say okay well we don't have to squeeze all the juice today you know that that's the whole point about compounding Goodwill you know if if I acquire something from a Founder um and let go of a few percentages because that helps me have a great long-term relationship with this person um that's a worthwhile decision rather than saying you know what you're down and I'm going to like you know kind of crush it and that that that's not good for reputation long term go into do you go into a negotiation saying here's my threshold of I can no longer do or I won't do it at this number but I will do it anything below this and then you go with like a number and you leave room for that negotiation or for that threshold and then you just don't ever cross that particular number like good and you're like super calculating about it you're like negotiation like a trick well because I know I know that he's a value investor and a value investor they like at some point they're like you you make money on the buy you make money when you buy at a low price and so like there has to be like a threshold of like it doesn't make sense after this and so I just can't be a nice guy anymore just because you're winning it doesn't mean the other person has to lose and I think that's a very important uh aspect of compounding Goodwill you know that that's also the example of like you know just because you know you're very smart you don't have to prove the other person wrong you can you can agree to disagree or move on and just saying okay you know this is fine maybe it's worthwhile considering this and you know letting that conversation be and and and going away and of course in business you have to be very very disciplined if especially as a capital allocator um and that's that that's that let me tell you guys a quick story as we wrap up here uh that was like the best good guy story that I heard I heard it on another podcast but apparently Adam Sandler Adam Sandler was uh in New York he was taking acting class classes and the uh the teacher was like Hey I want to take you out for a beer let's talk so teacher takes him out and he goes look Adam you don't have what it takes and I just want you to quit doing it now because I don't

what I'm about to say will win you the respect of your friends a lifetime full of Happiness a villa and the Bahamas and maybe a really good hair day too I I don't know if it's gonna do any of those things who's to say but here's what it will do it'll definitely make you a better writer that's my promise you will be a better writer in the next 60 [Music] Minutes this week somebody asked us a question they said hey I really love your guys' writing I don't know why I have trouble with writing and uh I would love if you guys just did an episode with the the 8020 so what is the just the stuff I need to know to help me be a better writer so me and Sam sat down and we wrote down all of our secrets about how we've we've used writing to grow our careers which by by the way by the way I wouldn't even say we're necessarily great writers I would say that you and I are really good writers but what we've been great at is getting results from it would you agree yeah that's right I don't think I don't look at my stuff I'm like wow this is beautiful Pros but I do feel confident that if I needed to I can use my writing to either you know grow an audience or sell a product or convince people of something I I I feel confident in that after you know trying for 15 years and both of us have have done it right so the credibility here you know before you ever listen to any advice you should ask yourself why should I listen to this person well both me and Sam have built and sold newsletter businesses for tens of millions of dollars we've tweeted our way you know just typing little short sentences to you know a million person audience between the two of us um you know I've sold maybe $20 million worth of product online in the e-commerce world just through email um we both have taught writing courses or in some form or fashion I know I used to charge a thousand dollars a seat for my class and it was the highest rated class on Maven but here today you get the quick version for free we're charging you nothing except for there is one thing they got to do what's what do they have to do this is free right Sam it's totally free except for one thing you have to subscribe so whether you're listening on Apple on Spotify wherever you're listening or if you're already on YouTube you just got to click that button we spend all this time doing this and unlike the rest of the YouTube world where everything is completely free we're mostly free all we want in exchange is a subscribe on YouTube that's all we want we can't check if you do it we call it the gentleman's agreement it's just Honor Code amongst two legendary individuals us and you and uh we we just trust that you're going to do it all right so let's let's jump in how does somebody become a better writer how can we teach them in the next I don't know 45 minutes to become you know twice as good or three times as good as the writing I believe that that is possible if they actually do these things where do you want to start Sam so let's start with before you guys start writing and so someone asked us why write or someone asked us how do you get better at writing I actually want to change it to why you should even care about being a better writer and so there's a few bullet points that we have so the first being is this is the most self-serving thing but I want to say it up front it's persuasion in the most scalable way the reason I got into writing was I was uh selling street meat hot dogs on the side of the road and I was selling one to one and I got pretty good at it but then I realized this is really hard and so I learned about copywriting and I figured look now I can write something and it could scale to an infinite amount of people I never have to change it and I can convince people to do something now we're not just talking about copywriting we're talking about all types of writing so I can convince someone to feel a certain way whether I'm writing a short story or I'm writing a blog post I can convince someone to join my company I used copywriting on Tinder when I want to convince the girl to give me a chance and go on a date with me we're talking about all types of writing but at the end of the day we're always typically trying to persuade someone to do something so it's persuasion in the most scalable way and that's one of the reasons one of the most important self- serving reasons why I think people should care about writing what else yeah that's that's the first one the second one is is more internal and wholesome right some people are like ah I don't know if I want to do persuasion truth is you do any anything anything you're trying to make happen you're usually going to need to persuade either people to come join your company customers Partners whatever it is the second one is to write clearly you must think clearly and the reverse is true too if you want to be a great thinker you want to have Clarity of thought writing is essential tool for that so writing is a forcing function for you to be able to think clearly um you can't hide behind bad writing bad bad writing will show bad thinking uh whereas if you have great thinking and you write it'll come through and so writing is this uh it's a truth tell potion it will reveal how clear your thinking is and the the trick is most people think about it as in writing is a way for me to communicate my ideas to you and they think that oh writing is the bottleneck they're like ah I'm just not a good writer nobody ever says I'm not a great thinker but the truth is if you actually get down to it people who struggle with writing it's because they don't have the idea clear in their mind and so writing helps you clear up the fog in your brain and get Crystal Clear Clarity on what are you actually trying to say what are the ideas but it also works to not just communicate ideas but to generate them I think Paul Graham said this and it so true he goes people think that writing is only about communicating the ideas you already have but actually the truth is when you sit down to write you will generate new ideas writing is an incredible idea generator and so it's like you know starting a little fire in your brain and uh you know those Sparks can lead to new thoughts new ideas that are quite powerful and if you're not writing regularly you're missing out on some of those ideas and I think that when we say writing I'm particularly referring to longer form it could be shorter form a handful of sentences a twe whatever but often times it's longer form and the reason why I prefer that when I'm running out my ideas is you can't really hide a bad idea or you can't hide bad thinking in Long writing you know where where you can hide bad thinking in a PowerPoint now that doesn't mean that you're ideas in Long writing are going to be good but you just can't hide it you can't hide that it's bad and so that's why I prefer mapping it all out and then the third point of writing creates new ideas uh I think like you said Paul Graham said it best he has this great blog post he wrote in 2005 he said something like um 80% of your writing will be bad and then you'll have to cut cut it down to the 20% that's good and when you start writing you'll probably generate 50% more new ideas right and so it's a really great forcing function where it gives you the lanes of the road and you have to stay within those lanes and oftentimes you can change your opinion as you go and you could evolves your idea and your thinking all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM and we've all seen Jeff basos banned PowerPoint from Amazon he realized that uh PowerPoint point was this thing that sort of the most charismatic loudest voice in the room or somebody with good slide design skills could kind of like create an illusion of good thinking by using PowerPoint and actually uh he forced everybody instead to write long long form memos basically narratives and he's like in the long form written word there's no place to hide there's no way to use design or good presentation skills to uh to make it seem like this is more well thought through than it is it either is or it isn't you find out so I think it works inside of companies as well as it does out externally to your customers and potential customers so all right now let's get down to the actual tactics so that's the that's the theory now how do you actually do it so for me all the work begins before I've typed a single word and I I always say you want to begin with the end in mind what I mean by this is I before I write anything I first decide what is the reaction I want I learned this from a guy named Chris Quigley I don't know if you know Chris Quigley but he was a um just this character he came to town in San Francisco from from the UK and he was he host he had an ad agency and his Ad Agency did one specific thing they would make videos go viral and I remember talking to Chris and I was like wow it would be awesome to do a viral video that sounds like kind of like a lottery ticket thing like what if my YouTube video just went viral and got millions of views how crazy would that be and I asked him like go what's your hit rate like you know out of every hundred videos you do how many go viral one two three videos out of a hundred and he's like no if we do 10 videos eight or nine will go viral really and I was like what he's like well for two reasons and he said number one we have a large blog audience so we we can guarantee the first like 100,000 views like it will get seen it won't just get lost in the abyss of the internet of content like whatever we have it'll get seen he's like but that doesn't make it go viral that just makes sure it gets a chance it goes the second thing is we always work backwards from an emotion he goes people will only share or act if they feel something at the end so he he created this thing that he had like lol WTF OMG uh a like you know something so cute uh heartwarming and so he's like these are the only emotions that you can tap into there's like seven or eight emotions that people can can tap into and he would work backwards he would say we don't write a script until we first pick the emotion we're going for Wow or we're going for WTF outrage oh WTF outrage uh you know I'll give you example of one that I just saw yesterday Elon mus tweeted out this thing that was uh some hidden like language in a bill like a bill that's going through Senate right now that was like if the next president gets elected and they decide to stop spending on the war in Ukraine they could be up for impeachment because of the way this bill is written and and he was like oh my God the Democrats are baking this in to the bill they're trying to pass this on page 140 they're trying to slip this right under your nose without telling anybody and they're going to try to impeach Trump Trump if he got elected and tried to stop tried to you know if he got peace in the in in the in the Ukraine and stop the spending he could be up for impeachment and of course the post goes Super viral because it's outrage it's outrage from the Democrats it's outrage from the Republicans that is engineered to go viral and so similarly Chris used to have a search engine he used to be able he created a tool internally for them where they could just search by emotion and it would show them YouTube videos that are targeting that emotion and they would use it when they would brainstorm and so I stole this and I would start with I ask myself three questions what is the reaction I want that's always an emotion the next one is what is the action I want so what do I want them to do after they read this like click the buy button click the share button forward this to a friend sign my petition whatever it is who knows what it is but what's the reaction what's the action and the last thing I say is at the end of this if they could just remember one line or one takeaway one sentence what would it be what would I pick out of the whole thing that I just wrote because people remember sentences not books and so you have to think about that so I always begin with the end in mind I decide those before I ever write a word do you do something similar I do the exact same thing and typically I start with a headline and I start with the sub headline so if you share on Facebook the headlines the big text the sub headline is the 180 character thing underneath that oftentimes I go back and I rech and I change the headline a ton but that one sentence what I call the sub headline that doesn't change and that one sentence is helps like clarify what I'm going to write so I actually don't do outlines so there's a lot of things that I think you're taught in fifth grade that I think are really stupid one of them is an outline I I guess I I guess it's okay to teach that but I don't use outlines anymore and my outline instead is that one sub headline um that's what I use in fact you brought up a good point which is to be a great writer in the world like as an adult on the internet the internet world the internet world you have to unlearn pretty much everything you learned in school so in school you learned like what do they what do they reward in school they're like uh minimum of this word count so they're trying to get you you must write at least this length and they're trying to get you to like so people are writing long words and double spacing their thing and trying to like add a bunch of filler and fluff well you got to do the exact opposite when you write on the internet you want to be concise you want to be quick you want to eliminate a bunch of the fluff shorter is better on the internet in terms of adding just extra crft but when you're in school they almost Force you and teach you to write these long form things they also want you to write f with fancy fancy vocabulary so you're you get bonus points if you use you know amarate rather than you know heal or help or whatever and and so you rewarded for using fancy words but the reality is you want to be writing at a at a very like accessible language if you want uh reading level if you want to do well on the internet so you know both you and I we target kind of like fifth to eighth grade reading levels and you can use these tools these Checkers like Hemingway is an app that you could use where you could put in your text and it'll tell you you're writing at a 12th grade level or you're writing at a fifth grade level and the lower the better is better on the internet yeah and in the in the second half of this episode let's go through all those like tips and tricks um in terms of in terms of writing my process is I I do copy work and then I draft then I incubate and then I edit so what that means is copy work it's the same way it's this old technique that people have learned how to write um we don't do it anymore but I found it to be the most effective way I I sat myself a room for like two hours a day and did this for like eight months in order to learn how to write and copy work is basically when you take write writing that you love it could be a full book it could be a script for SNL if you want to learn how to write comedy it could be a blogger that you like when I'm writing an important piece I'll just write maybe for 10 minutes I literally take my pen and by hand I copy someone else's writing that I really like and that helps me get into the flow so we what we said was before you've written a word you like most people just sit down they start trying to write what we've told you is do two two different things instead begin with the end in mind you know the what is the action the reaction you want and what's the what would be the headline that would grab somebody and then the second thing Sam's saying is you don't just jump in like a you know if you're GNA go do a workout you don't just go start sprinting right away you warm up I do warm-up sets and you do the same thing before you write a word of your own you start by writing but not your own words you take some writing that you really like that maybe you want to almost like through osmosis just steal their little writing Juju it's going to go into your brain you'll start to talk like them write like them if you do this and you literally write word for word exactly what they said it's even more effective if you handw write it but at worst type it but you want to don't don't think don't add your own stuff don't improve it just literally write word for word and do it for like even 10 15 minutes I still do this today this is not like advice that I tell other people to do I don't do I still do this today and Sam you don't know this I use one of your posts as one of my I have like three go one of yours is one that I use for my copy work it's this one where you I forgot the name of the blog but it's I always search for it with the same headline which is uh let me be perfectly clear you're reading this because I want because I want you to um and you're like I have engineered the start of this to and you basically talk about how you've mesmerized them you're like every word of this was chosen every sentence to lead you to the next sentence and I love that it's we call it the slippery slope and so you uh I use one of yours whenever I want to write like in a really persuasive copyrighted way if I want to write more like business serious then I have a different one I use this one that the CEO of slack did where he wrote an internal memo that I really like called we don't s Saddles here but you literally just write it word forward so that's your warmup so again two things before you ever write your own stuff it's exactly like playing music okay so if you're whether when you're a beginner playing music you just play other people's songs and then you steal a little bit you're like oh I like I like this genre this genre this genre I'm G to combine it to my own thing same way where you're writing a new song you kind of warm up maybe playing The Beatles and then eventually you're like all right I'm in the mood to write something beautiful this is what I'm going to do you take someone's recipe and you make their recipe before you go make your own thing you play a cover before you write your own songs same way you do copy work before you write your own stuff the second step is actually where a lot of people get screwed up so it's the drafting step and the reason people get screwed up here is because they're afraid to look stupid and the drafting step is actually where you're supposed to look stupid and so whenever I draft something I just bang it out as fast as I can and it sounds really dumb and I accept that it sounds dumb and I and here's why because after the draft set is the incubation period you know like um have you ever heard of like the phrase like shower thoughts where you like think of silly things in the shower I actually I think there's like some science behind this I think I forget what it's called but it's like when you're out riding a bike when you're out going for a walk where you're just sitting things I think it's called passive thinking you actually get great breakthroughs and so what I like to do is I draft my first thing they doesn't take very long and I know that it's bad but I don't show anyone then I go for a walk or I'll just sit sometimes that will take 4 48 Hours sometimes that will take one hour sometimes 10 minutes sometimes a week I just let it sit and then I do nothing now here's where the the last part and the most important part is uh Olie one of my favorite writers what's his first name David David Ogie he's got this great line he goes I'm a lousy writer but I'm a good editor and this is where greatness happens happens Stephen King calls it killing Your Darlings he says when the editing phase where all the great stuff happens and this is actually where the gold happens and a lot of people don't do this process what they do is they write their dress and that's the final bit and they get afraid and nervous and they never write it and they don't actually incubate and they don't actually edit do you do these things 100% you I learned this from you uh the incubate part so I used to draft and then try to edit in the same session because I knew editing is where the value is right great writing is great editing let's be perfectly clear great writing is great editing however the mistake I was making before was I would write and then I would immediately try to edit and power through and I didn't have that break that Gap to actually go I can improve my ideas passively just load the problem in my brain and go do something else go for a walk go for a run go for a workout go shower go cook some food chop some vegetables doesn't matter what it is but I give myself actually like at least 90 minutes away from it sometimes six hours away from it and then when I come back I look at it and it's just so obvious to me oh strike this delete this move this to the top that's actually the best part oh you know what I should say here I should say this oh that analogy I was missing here it is and so you immedi it starts to come together when I do that that part right and I also realize I need to shift my time ratio because like you like you said I used to be a overthinker drafter where I would overthink how much I need to how much time to spend in the draft phase so I try to make a good draft bad idea you actually just want to have a like like quick and dirty draft like a brain dump draft and so I used to try to make a good draft that would take me way too long and I get fatigued and i' feel bad about it and I'd be like I hate this this is stupid should I even do this and all the doubts creep in and then I'll try to edit right away now short draft and then high energy edit after I have that incubation period so this is um 100% what I do and it is extremely effective and once you get good and once you find a process sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and I think of an idea and I just write that sentence in my phone and then I just forget about it but then I see something else in the world and I'm like oh that reminds me of this concept I was I was thinking about he wake up figured it out yeah I figured out the CTA is it weird if I sign off with cyanara suckers yeah wait what do you think about I love you at the end would that be a thing but I I actually do like well I'll have like a a do you have like a Notes app or a notes folder in your phone where it's like you just have like a sentence and you're like that's a beautiful sentence I'm just I don't I don't know where I'm going to use that but that was a beautiful sentence or a lot of times I get it from podcasters or you YouTubers I'm like you you hear how he phrased that that word that was a sharp phrase that cut to me one of the things we didn't say in the before phase is having a swipe file so yes classic thing that all writers have and all marketers have which is a swipe file it's basically a stash whenever you see something dope something that's well done something that's good you just stash it away so that when it comes time for you to make one you could be like I need to make a landing page and you would go and you'd look at your stash of great landing pages you've seen and you would have so much inspiration right there ready for you at your fingertips because you did the work before befor hand and so that's another one of the before is you got to have a swipe file we I have one for phrases for headlines for connecting words for sign for hellos and goodbyes because for some reason whenever IID write my newsletter I knew what I wanted to say but the start always was so awkward it was like a hello you know hello there friends and I was like God this sucks and then I started keeping a a file of like anytime I liked an lik an opener or a closer so I have one opener's file one closer file and I have a whole bunch in there that I can use to riff off of because that for whatever reason that was my my blocker when I would write I I'll just hear a beautiful phrase and I'll write it down so like I went to this guy's website and uh he was talking about the best like speaker system or something and he started off the paragraph with well folks it doesn't get any better than this and I was like oh in beautiful that's mine yes and like I I just have this whole Bank of like these things of people saying like cute phrases I'm like oh that's a be like I just felt an emotion when I read that basically you have to think every people are scrolling through thousands of Articles every day and I if I see a line that grabs my attention I know that's good that's mine that's mine and I just have this whole Bank of these so let's move on to um some more tips about talking about the actual writing part because I think that what you're taught in school we're basically going to say do the opposite of a lot yeah here's right here's the mistakes common mistakes mistake number one they start with a bunch of intro context background fluff uh you wrote a the tip is actually don't bury the lead so the first sentence should punch so try putting the most important sentence at the top try putting the most provocative statement at the top try putting the promise at the top or the the bait the hook at the top so as an example you have one here that when when you were building the hustle one of the things you tried to do was these viral blog posts you were like I'm gonna write these blog posts if I can get a million views on those blog posts and you know some percentage of them will subscribe that's how I'll grow my subscriber base right and I remember reading this which was first sentence I spent the last 30 days eating nothing but soilent a new age powered powdered meal replacement why would I do something so stupid I'll explain but first if you're not familiar with soent here's the gist a great opener right because rather than saying you know um you know the last few days have been uh you know really tough for me because I've been doing this new experiment to give you background who I am I'm Steve I'm a programmer here at this company and you know I'm blah blah blah boring right so instead I spent the last 30 days eating nothing with soilent why would I do something so stupid let me explain Curiosity has been created and now I want to know yeah typically when you're thinking about the lead so I found it helps with a few things one if you're new what I tell people is let me see your opener cut it in like cut almost all of it except for like the last couple sentences and that's typically a good trick and the reason why I say that is when you're taught in school how to write have you ever heard of like a a thesis statement where you have like a opening paragraph with the thesis at the bottom 0.1 point two three and then a closer I'm like just tell me your thesis statement right off the right off like just just say that just punch me in the face with that that should be your that should be your opening line another thing is I like to think of um have you ever been to England and have you ever noticed they have signs that say mind the gap right I guess that's like when you're I always say mind the Curiosity Gap so mind so with the Curiosity Gap means I'm gonna I'm gonna punch you in the face to grab your attention because that gets you to fall down the slippery slope and the more that you fall down that slope the further you're going to continue to read and so I I want to grab your attention but I don't want to tell you exactly everything but I want to grab your attention by not bearing the lead and I'm going to get you to fall down this slope a little further yeah that's simple test is take your hand cover up all of the text except for the first two sentences read those first two sentences and be like would if I didn't know me if I didn't care about me if I didn't if I didn't have to read this would I want to read would I need to read the next sentence not would I need to read the whole thing but I need to read the next sentence if it's yes you've created a curiosity app then you drag your hand down you reveal that next sentence you say if I read this sentence would I need to read the next sentence right would I want to know what what's the next sentence and then by the third or fourth time you've done that now they're in now they're invested now you have a little more leeway to let it breathe and and and cre and create a little bit of background because they're they're have they're invested in getting to the end of the of the outcome but like the reason this sounds so brutal where you're going to cover up I like I'm G to cover up 85 90% of the text yes because the reality is that's actually how the reader eyes work 80 90% of people are only ever going to read the headline and if the headline is no good they're never going to get to any of the other stuff and so some people are resistant to write a juicy headline but the reality is if it's not juicy enough they'll never get to that those great ideas that you have inside you're sort of doing your own ideas of disservice and so you want to find that line between like without completely whing yourself out or making a false promise still find a way to make it juicy enough where you created that Curiosity Gap where I have to read the next sentence and that's it what I what I used to say was it ain't clickbait if if you're actually getting something like it bait means it's fake so as long as I can say the truth but I say it is sens Sensational or clicky way we us to say clicky it ain't bait if I actually deliver on the promise you have to pay it off if you don't pay it off then then it's bad but if you're paying it off and you're paying it off soon you can't pay it off like you know 10 minutes later you have to you have to be able to do that all right next one is write like you talk so so many times people are like I can't really like I'm not good at I'm not a good writer and again I'm not a good writer is actually code for I'm not a good thinker and the way you test this is cool forget about writing it down just tell me like explain it to me either they just say it out loud and I'm like great you wrote it just write that down now like write down literally what you just said you don't have to have like this second character this Shakespeare inside you that writes in a completely different style and communicates completely differently than you actually talk you don't need that you actually want them to be very similar it's actually the most engaging type of writing is when you feel like the author's just talking to having a conversation with you specifically and so right like you talk is a good good method but it also reveals if you can't even talk about it you're not ready to write it yet you got to First be able to like explain it just in plain language yourself what I tell my team so they'll like write this huge thing and ask me to read it and I'm like I don't really want to read this just tell me what it means and they'll say in one sentence I go okay cool that's your first sentence um and that's probably all you need to say for this thing uh but like there's a few ways to figure out what not to do one is you go to people's uh LinkedIn if they use the word utilize that's probably not good have you ever heard someone say they utilized or they did like what are other like LinkedIn jargon LinkedIn like that's that's so good we should make a LinkedIn hit list of just uh [ __ ] words that nobody ever says but people think it's okay to write yeah it's like dude I've never heard you you use that word utilize right the the second thing to remember is there's informal is or rather informal can be professional a lot of times people think informal is the opposite of professional and I actually say that's that's nonsense and I'm going to actually show examples of how that's not true in a few minutes but and another good line that I think about is uh it was Stephen King he says any word you have to hunt in a thesaurus is the wrong word there's no exceptions to this rule uh and so like if you have to like look up like what a word means you don't use it you want to use words that most everyone uses and I'm again I'm going to show you examples of really complicated stuff explained in a really simple way like here's a really good example of writing like you talk so one of my favorite pieces of writing is Louis CK so Louis CK about 10 or 15 years ago he used to release his own specials like on his website and if you Google Louis CK Neville madora or something like that you'll see my friend Neville wrote a blog post about some of his stuff because it's it's actually not up anymore but he's got this great uh line in one of his bits he says or one of his landing pages he goes please please don't tore it in the special if you want to share it direct people here it's so easy just to drop $ five do we don't make you join anything we let you download any file you want it costs a shitload of money to make these specials and I do it myself I love off offering directly for so cheap and so easily and I would like for that to continue being a good idea that's a great simple way just to say don't steal uh and and and that makes me feel I'm like all right you're right this is I should abide by this you are exactly right there is no jargon simple language yeah 100% agree I also think that uh you know this also works for choosing what to write about so for example sometimes people will write about [ __ ] that they would never talk to you about we had this problem early on at the milk road so when we did the milk Road I was the initial writer so I created the initial voice and milroad was a a newsletter that we built in the crypto space and we went from zero subscribers and never have written a daily newsletter before to the biggest crypto newsletter in the world and sold it for millions of dollars that in one year so that was the the success outcome so how did we actually do it and more importantly how did I train other people to write it instead of me because I didn't want to wake up every morning and stress about sending this email out at 500 a.m. to you know a couple hundred thousand people that that was not the idea of a good life for me so I was like me see if I can train people to do this one of the hacks to training people to do this was I I was like God I feel like they're writing this both with too much extra fluff and jargon and secondly they're writing about stuff that's kind of boring so like the topic is boring I'm like what's happening I was like and I told him I was like I feel like you would never just tell me about this like if I was just talking to you if I was your your friend and you were like oh did you hear what happened today which is what a news what a new what the news is trying to tell you right hey did you hear what happened today this crazy thing happened this interesting thing happened this big event happened I was like you're writing about stuff that wouldn't even make that filter you wouldn't even tell me about it so why are you doing this so what I had them do I was like forget writing a draft and having me be the editor instead I want you to send me a voice memo no more than 60 seconds in the morning which is basically oh do you hear what happened today uh this guy said this thing and people are freaking out because of blah blah blah and this announcement was made and people think it's going to be a big deal and the price is going to go up because that would mean this and as soon as they started doing that I was like yep that sounds perfect just write that down and it just was such a good filter and so one way to think about what to write about and how to write it is do this little kind of voice memo test so can you just if you were just to tell your friend about this you know hey I have this idea blah blah blah or you know I noticed this thing I found it really interesting because blah blah blah blah and if you can't if it's not interesting to your friend guess what it's not gonna be interesting to a stranger right like you have to be able to to explain it in a way that's simple and use that as a filter if you would never talk about it don't write about it well and the the tip that I used to give so when I sold the hustle we had close to 2 million subscribers I believe and for new writers they would they like would kick ass in their audition and then they would get nervous like when they're I'm like yeah two million is a lot of people I get it but here's the tip write to me write to Sam just literally you are only writing to me and that's what I tell people when they're writing blog posts when they're writing anything else just write to one person you're only writing to one human being it's just coincidence that many others might read it but just only write to one one person Direct to that one person and that's the way to go uh and so it makes it a lot easier right uh let's go to let's go to uh WR simply what I found is around you can go as low as fourth grade but around sixth seventh and eighth grade reading level is the way that you want to write now to give you guys perspective I think USA news.com USA news the newspaper I believe that's at a fourth grade reading level New York Times which is highly regarded by a lot of people that's at a seventh grade reading level and I actually went and put Warren Buffett Warren Buffett writes about insurance companies a very complicated topic I went and put his stuff through Hemingway app as well same thing sixth seventh eighth grade reading level and it teaches you how to write at that level and there's tactics on how to do that like don't use adverbs keep sentences short but Heming Way app is an awesome way to um check yeah to check to do it for you yeah I think that's a great one um another one that you wrote in here is about storytelling and so I think storytelling is now like kind of in the more advanced uh a little more advanced category of how to be a great writer is being able to use use the artst storytelling uh do you want to give an example of that uh or how do you want to talk about storytelling here so here's an example of Storytelling so about 10 years ago there was this company called hint hint water it's you see it's like a beverage that you guys see in the stores it's called um and the the lady named Cara she had this great story she went and gave this talk uh at one of my events and there was at the very end there was one question that someone asked her and I heard that story and of the 60-minute talk I was like oh that's a that's a hit because that just made me feel something so the headline was getting called sweee help this entrepreneur create a multi-million dollar business sweetie the executive said and I just dropped the phone for a minute last week at pizza and 4S Cara golden the founder of hint told me a story that fired me up the setup goes like this and it explains a story about how she was drinking 10 Cokes a day she was on the phone with an executive of Co Coca-Cola and she said I'm going to create a new version of water that just has a a little bit of fruit in it and no sugar an executive at Coke goes listen sweetie americaas love sweet this is never going to work by the way that's a great example of working backwards from an emotion even if you didn't consciously do it in this case you you knew that story would hit because it has outrage it has a WTF OMG type of reaction of like [ __ ] but let me fill you in on the results so I wrote the blog post not in order to promote hint I wrote the blog post because I thought this was just a cool story of a this entrepreneur getting like it was a sexist moment and she was getting hated on whatever hint saw the article they ended up spending millions of dollars to promote this article and at the very bottom of the article and it it says something like this conversation inspired golden now 17 laters 17 years later to found hint and they do 100 million in sales uh here's the flavors they have this article made them tens of millions of dollars in sales we used to get so much traffic to this article because they ended up promoting it I wasn't selling hint water I was just telling a cool story about the founder and in exchange it made all these people want to buy this stuff and if in fact if you Google hint waterer sweetie article you'll see articles written about this article about how it was a huge success and this was sort of an accident I just wrote something cool and they actually were like oh let's promote this but it worked wonderfully because it was a story that grabbed your attention you want to say a few words on on how to how to write a great story I have a couple of tips you do it so a couple of tips on on writing a great story or tell telling a great story so go look at the greatest storytellers ever uh one of them is uh Aaron sorin he's known for writing great dialogue he wrote you know the The Social Network movie he wrote uh what is it westwing he wrote The Newsroom he great writer famous right famous Hollywood writer he says I worship at the altar of intention and obstacle so what he says is a story is just two things somebody has an intention some somebody wants something and there's obstacle in their way by the way that line I worship at blank altar at the altar of blank yeah so that that is going into my bank to your bank H that's F all right so uh so intention and obstacle intention is some character wants something and then there's an obstacle in their way the more they want it like their daughter was just taken hostage huge huge intention obstacle They Don't Know by who where they are and all they have to go on is this one 5-second call that they were on or whatever right like obstacle they they have no way to find them and they're just a Dad how are they going to ever you know get their daughter back and so intention and obstacle is the core element of any good story so somebody wants something in in the case that you just said not only does Cara want to make her business successful she wants to be taken seriously as a female entrepreneur obstacle Coke executive men men are pigs nobody believes in her right that's a core that's a core of a story and so any story if you can't they say like in a movie you should be able to pause at any moment of any story and say what does that character want and what's in their way and if you can't pause and name that right now you have failed as a Storyteller because the audience you you think they're you're going to tell them later what the they want no no you've lost their attention the the initial stakes and if you watch any movie they establish this right and even like silly romcoms it'll be uh she wakes up she's got her assistant and chauffeur driving her to work she's clearly high powerered but her but she's alone and she's doesn't have a relationship right like that'll be it'll be obvious to her she'll see somebody out the window while she's driving to work in her chafford limousine and it's this girl in love with her boyfriend and she looks at it kind of longingly and then she just goes back to her her you know Palm Pilot or whatever before back to work and so you know what the character wants and you know what's in her way she's she doesn't have somebody because she hasn't find the route guy and she's so busy with work and so everything is always this intentional obstacle the second thing is you have to establish like how do you make a story Better or Worse Stakes is the next thing so what is at stake uh what do you have to lose if this doesn't go well and Stakes doesn't have like Stakes initially the beginner version of stakes is life or death but the true art and some if you like some of the stories that I've told on this podcast the true art is when you can establish high stakes emotions in a low stakes environment so if I can tell you how I was feeling and if I can get you to believe that I thought everything was on the line just with some little interaction I was having with the like this person in the grocery store line and how I didn't want them to win cuz [ __ ] them and they can't cut they cut in front of me but I'm not going to I'm not going to cut in front of them but I need them to know that it wasn't okay but I don't know how to do it without being an [ __ ] myself and if I can establish the stakes that this matters to me I can get you to care about the outcome of it but it can be in a low Stak situation now you're really cooking with gas if you can do something like that because otherwise you're limited to just life or death stories the best example you have done of that you're very good at this is um I I distinctly remember this story of you do you doing a shirtless workout on your driveway and your HOA being like no we we can't have this and you're like we're going to Petty Court we're going to Ho like I just that was a I let this go or I could fight to the death as a matter of principle here because you know what are you trying to say and what does this mean right and if it means something to me that I can make it mean something to you so that sort of thing so Larry David's great at this too like when never I watched that show Kirby Your Enthusiasm like they're making a story out of something so silly and small uh you know it's it's 10 times more likable when it's something relatable or small but it still carries the emotional impact and if you could do that you have infinite supply of stories he notices that people don't talk people don't talk to someone if they're wearing a Maga hat and so he starts wearing a Maga hat all the time he's like I don't want anyone to talk to me I'm just gonna wear this hat yeah uh that that's a really good example of a high stakes uh high stakes and a low stakes environment where like it doesn't really matter but it's very funny um and then let's talk about uh tactical stuff so short sentences um I'm a firm believer in short sentences and so the I'll give you I'll explain why but Warren Buffett owns you know runs birkshire halfway birkshire owns dozens and dozens of companies arguably the most complicated one is Geico insurance companies are very very very hard to understand however I don't remember if the hustle did analysis on this or someone else did but he writes these famous annual shareholder letters every single year he he's a very good writer and listen to this from uh 1974 to 2013 someone analyzed this and the letters per or sorry the words per sentence dropped from 17 to 13 if you look at like we actually did an analysis on this every year it gets shorter and shorter and shorter and the reading level dropped from a 10th grade to a fourth grade reading level so the Richer he got and the more complicated his businesses got the simpler the writing got because he just got better at explaining it a really easy to understand way and he's probably once kind of somewhat the average show to be able to understand this and so short simple sentences are key even in complicated environments and here's a really good example so if you go to hey.com so hey.com is an alternative to Gmail it's a it's a service that makes you pay though so it's even they they've raised the stakes there so you have to pay for their email there's a letter from the CEO and that's one of my favorite uh like tactics by the way in a sales page is letter from a CEO and he says hey everyone I'm Jason CEO of 37 signals email gets a bad rap but it shouldn't email is a treasure and he goes on to explain why uh email is awesome and why it should be more special than it is and it's the most simple language to explain email and I love it and there's lots of examples of simple language and and simple ways to explain complicated things and if you're able to do that often times they will have shorter sentences less words and it it's significantly more in uh effective than longer stuff related to that it doesn't have to be only one length so there's this great graphic that's gone viral many times you probably seen it great writing has Rhythm so there's a an example so I'll just read this out loud he goes this sentence has five words here are five more words five word sentences are fine but several together become monotonous listen to what is happening this writing is getting boring the sound of it drones it's like a stuck record the ear demands some variety now listen I vary the sentence length and I create music music the writing sings it has a pleasant Rhythm a lilt a Harmony I use short sentences and I use sentences of medium length and sometimes when I'm certain that the reader is rested I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length a sentence that burns with energy and builds with the impetus of a crescendo the role of the drums the crash of the symbols and sounds that say listen to this this is important so write with a combination of short medium and long sentences create sound that pleases the reader ears don't just write words write music that I love that it is amazing and so you want to have short by default but then like he says when the reader is rested and ready use a long sentence to great effect and so that's like an advanced move when it comes to writing most people's problem is every every sentence is too long and so you start with short sentences but then you figure out how to vary it so that you're writing sings whenever I uh sometimes when I write something that I get really into I I almost feel like uh I'm like I Channel like my inner Eminem or like some rapper or something where I'm like what type of Rhythm could get people flowing like I need to have a Rhythm that gets people to fall down this and like there's small tactics like anytime you want to use a comma use a period and then start the next sentence with and or but um or there's other things like put your internal dialogue like um or like or or the reader's internal dialogue like so why would I do this you're asking yourself right now right or who the hell is this person talking to me through my computer screen telling me what to do and why on Earth should I trust them like you can do these little things to change the Rhythm grab people's attention yeah 100% uh that's a that's a great way of putting it I also think like the Rhythm thing is uh it comes from the copy work so back to the copy work at the beginning if you do copy work on something that has Rhythm like I will write that that same thing that I just read out loud I'll write that in my copy work takes whatever 55 seconds but now I'm already kind of revved up to write in that style to have that that variety that Rhythm when I write the next thing should we wrap up by saying some resources that we both Ed in order to get influenced yeah yeah how do you learn how do you get better from here because this was the crash course just hit on a bunch of bunch of the big topics there's obviously a lot of nuance and subtlety and like doing it takes both practice as well as like a little bit of deeper understanding but where where should people go so what I'll start with some some books that I like I like onw writing by Stephen King that changed my life um I like that one a lot um what do you like about that by the way I read that book I didn't love it what what was so good about it I just felt that he was teaching me how to write better and but he was living it as he was going and so the first half of the book I believe is his biography and the second half is tool he calls it the the toolkit where he explains like how he does stuff and I just felt in the biography part he was doing it and then the in the toolit part te me yeah and so I really appreciate that but then I also get a lot of inspiration from funny original thinkers you know who one of the most original like people with words right now is theovon so I'll hear theovon like for example he had an ad for athletic greens and he goes today's sponsors athletic greens I know what you thinking what is this just a bunch of aliens playing track and field and like like he he does these like silly things and unexpected silly things and he's like a treasure Trove of like interesting phrases so I'm a big fan of like listening to what he's saying and why I also listen to a ton of comedians because they've perfected this so like Dave Chappelle is really great with timing Shane Gillis really good with timing and so I pay attention to lot of those guys on how they get people's attention so I like onw writing I like Theo van um I listen to a lot of True Crime podcasts and True Crime podcasts because they're supposed to be thrilling they are excellent at storytelling and setting up tension and so I love uh there's this company called parcast they've got serial killers unsolved murders and I really love how they set up tension what do you like I like a lot of those same things you said I I also like to consume them in a different way so I think everybody likes Dave Chappelle or Lis c k but you know when I wanted to get good at this I started to study what they do not just laugh and move on right so I would there's there's an amazing amazing thing what I think is the I have two two things I've learned from comedians I think are the best examples of both storytelling to win people on your side and of apologizing so the apologizing one is after Louis CK got cancelled he basically disappeared for like a year and a half and he came back and he did his first show on stage and there's a big question in my my head it's like how is he going to address this what's he say you people should go listen to it in in full but basically first he doesn't address he's he's doing his normal act and he pauses just in the middle of like doing a thing and he's just like so should we talk about it all right we could talk about it and he just brings it up like in the he makes it awkward because like what he did was like weird and pretty gross and bad whatever so what he did was instead of backpedaling and apologizing instead of denying instead of trying to spin it as good he was was like everybody's got a thing some people's things are weirder than others but everybody's got a thing that they like Barack Obama knows my thing B he makes fun of himself like it's basically poke like my thing is so weird that I liked and did and everybody knows about it and he kind of wins you on his side like just the ComEd the idea of even Obama knows my thing like everybody's got a thing but it's secret usually and so then he goes and and there's more to it but he does that Chappelle does one when when they took the Chappelle show they put it on Netflix and he wasn't getting any royalties from it he's like man they're using my name they're putting my show up there I have a fight with these guys and my fans are watching it and Netflix is winning and the studios everyone's winning except for Chappelle from the Chappelle show right so he goes on stage he does this 20 minute thing called I think it's called unforgivable or Unforgiven or something like that I'm going to do a full YouTube breakdown of this because it is to me it is like the Master Class class in how do you tell a story to win people on your side it is so well done I I I can't even do it J I'm going to do a full breakdown of like what I think he did that was so smart and I have studied this thing and I've been like I can't believe like I would have never come up with this as a way to to make that point to get people at the end to be totally on his side and willing to like boycott the show how did he get people to do that and the way he told the story where he's not giving you a lecture he's not just coming out and saying it outright he kind of baked it in at the end uh but he set the setup was so strong that you there's only one outcome you could have it's a maze that led you to one door which is I'm on Dave's side I'm gonna do exactly what this guy just said and to me when I saw that I was like that was the best example I've ever seen of using storytelling for Mass persuasion I uh I I want to go watch that another person I love have you ever read Joel on software Joel on software.com yeah you're going from Chappelle to to Joel the vaker of Trello nice dude I know that that like sounds ridiculous but he's this like nerdy guy who has started I think stack Overflow and Trello all these like companies dude his blogs are very funny on the dorkiest topics like I don't even understand a lot of the topics because it's like heavy engineering he does such a good job of writing on on these topics I love what I one of my favorite things to do is find the top post on Hacker News because typically these engineering types of people are particularly quirky and they kind of think outside the box yesterday I don't know if you saw it yesterday there's a great one a great example of this some guy wrote the Kroger app sucks or something like that and it was like the number 15 thing on Hacker News I click it and it's this like 10,000w blog post about Kroger's technology and he's just like he's like I like Kroger Kroger's the biggest Grocer in the world and he's like they should be good at technology they have all the money and they have the customers they have all the locations like they should not be getting their their you know they ass handed to them by instacart and these other like startups he's like look at this you open the Kroger app and it doesn't like you swipe and it doesn't he's like the whole internet is if you swipe it'll load more stuff for Kroger if you want to swipe to see more products it stops you and there's this tiny button that says like next page you have to go page after page it doesn't just load he's like that's terrible and he's like here's this other thing and he wrote this like 10,000w thing like nerding out about the Kroger app and I loved it I read every word of it I was like this is this is incredible nury right here I love this thing he's got a great opening line he says I'll start by saying I know nothing about the grocery industry but what I do know about is Tech and ux uh and so that's a great way to like kind of get people down your slippery slope but this is a really good article and I love it's not even that this is particularly good writing but what I would say is that this is effective writing because the best writing the biggest lesson of it all is that you want your content to just be you pushed out I think everybody thinks they have to like become some character in order for their content to hit to work to be to be a m to be a popular or whatever and you could kind of do that and you might even get some popularity but it'll never work in the long run because it's not you being you and uh those people are attracted to something that's not your actual brain your actual thoughts you got to let that freak flag fly baby you got Let it Fly flag fly and you know that's how this podcast worked is like I started with this interview format trying to emulate it's almost like copy work I was like emulating the Tim Ferris show or how I built this or whatever but then when it was just his me pushed out it's like I'm going to get on here we're going to talk some days about writing and some days about mindset some days about this Niche business that's uh you know tire rims in in North Carolina that's crushing it it's like that's the [ __ ] I'm into so that's the [ __ ] I talk about that's the thing I'm most passionate about that's the thing I can have I have the most interesting things to say about and because of that it's just me pushed out and then it's going to attract people who really like that and nobody can compete with me at that thing right like that that is a a personal Monopoly there is nobody else who could do what I'm doing as well as I'm doing you could do the same thing with your writing so just take the stuff you're most interested in or nerd out about the most and post that even if it seems like does anyone else really care about this you'll find the people that care about it if you just consistently do that which is what this episode is we're talking about a topic that you and I actually care a ton about and I guess we're going to find out if the rest care about it but it will find those who do next time for the next what what are we call this questionable advice next time are we doing business plans I think yeah we're doing a one on the next questionable advice which is we kind of laugh at like oh you don't need to write a business plan that's archaic but like we do do some ver version of planning before we just start a business so we're going to share what do we actually do in our planning before we start a business that we found is effective for us so that'll be the next one should we and we each got to plug our thing although I think your thing is no longer a thing uh yeah but I'm inspired by doing this I'm like I want to tell people about this and actually like because I have I have a course that does this but I have a ton of examples and the examples are actually what's valuable because you might hear some of the things we talked about you're like okay I got to look that up I got to look that up look that up but in the course I basically put it all there where I'm like here's the principle here's the example you actually it's principle you try it then it's here's the example of it done well another example of it done well another example of done well try it again and literally if you just do that you'll get better as a writer that's like a a structured form of practice so my course is not so much me talking about it it was that and I'm like if somebody actually wanted to learn that you kind of need that you kind of need to have those gold star examples and you need to have like a place to go practice like try it learn it then try it again so I just Googled sha Perry power writing it takes me to Maven and you can join the weight list is that where people should go yeah but I'm gonna boot it back up so I have this weight list it's got I don't know it's got a lot of people on I think but I should I haven't done it in like a year and a half I kind of like retired from it but this episode made me fired up about it so maybe that'll fade in in an hour I'll be like no [ __ ] that I'm not doing it but uh if not I'll I'll do one more one more of these this year and then then I have a thing only on copywork I love copy workor it changed my life I got this thing I made it like in a weekend two years ago just for shits and giggles because I it just I like it it's fun for me it's called copy that.com and it's my best versions of what I think people should write and copy and then you copy it by hand and I break down why each point is interesting so you can check it out copy that it's got a ton of good reviews you could actually I actually try to post all the negative reviews and the positive reviews so you can see all the reviews it's copy that.com so Google Shan Pur power writing and you'll see his page on maven.com and then copy that.com we'll put them both in the description so it'll be at the top of the description here we'll put the links to the to the things we talked about in this episode because I think if you're listening to this you're driving or you're walking it's very hard and we're usually not that good with show notes but today Ari let's try to be good with the show notes where all the resources we talked about let's make it easy um and put it put it there for people so that they can just scroll down and get it dude there's 8,000 people on the white list for the course I didn't even I haven't looked at this in so long this was like 500 last time I looked that's crazy you should do that right that's actually too many I don't think I can do so many people at once because I'm pretty like I'm live with them and I'm like doing student feedback so that would be I don't think that's even doable I I couldn't possibly do even I've never the biggest one we ever did was like 400 so 8,000 people is just not gonna work you'll figure it out um is that the pod that's the pod [Music]

May 25th 2023 subject line he said it was a bad business idea dot dot dot emailed out to his whole list I think hey folks Alex here telling you telling people you run a mouth taping business isn't all sunshine and rainbows is does did anyone think that that was sunshine and rainow you know what they say running a mouth business everyone always ask me like how awesome is this [Music] business all right what's up everybody back to the greatest podcast of all time my first million where we talk about business ideas we talk about businesses that are under the radar crushing it that you haven't heard of and hopefully when you listen to this podcast you get a little inspiration you get a little wind in your sales so that you go out and kick a little more ass today Sam I have an ass kicking story for you you want to hear it I love ass kicking stories in fact this is to it it's it's stories of other people who are kicking ass and it's a story of me getting my ass kicked as an investor so here's two Investments that I passed on for two totally different reasons and I'm going to tell you the reason why I missed it and the really cool story of what what these companies did all right so this first one three year two or three years ago two years ago I think it was and it's this guy David and he's pitching me a startup called Jenny and it was at Peak AI time so this is 2021 um you know gpt3 was out everybody was excited about AI this guy had yet another AI startup idea and I didn't really know what to make of it it was small it was only doing 2,000 a month in Revenue so he's like hey we've got great traction I'm at 2K Mr and I'm like that's cute son 2K Mr oh you know like the pool guys make a 2K Mr come on we we got to do better than that but really nice guy we get on a call and um I don't remember what I said but he told me afterwards he was like yeah you were like one of the nicer people in terms of giving us feedback and telling us what to do at the time they had a pretty undifferentiated product so what they were doing was a product called Jenny Ai and what Jenny was doing was it was a writing tool so it was just like Jasper which was like you just say hey I need a blog post it writes you a blog post you need SEO content you need blog content you need email content and it was just like writing blogs for you and there was a bunch of starters doing this at the same time Jasper was doing it they were taking off so it was like a kind of a hot space but I was like dude I think you're late to that party and he's like no no no we're gonna make it and I like the guy he had told me that at age 16 he had basically if started being an entrepreneur age 16 trying to build companies like tried to build a t-shirt company failed but like you know that's a right of passage is start your first terrible idea he had gotten that out of the way and now he was on to this which was cool he's like yeah I saw he's like it's actually a funny story he goes we got on uh gpt2 when it was just like developer access mode only and we told it to like I don't know tell us a joke or say something wise but funny and it say gbt go to goes what's the darkest place in the world and they go what he goes a butthole they like this thing is this thing is crazy what is this TCH and so they're like we got to go all in on this so they start trying to make ideas for this and and how old are they when they start working on this so they're about 24 I think uh at time doing this right and he's like I got no money he's living in his mom's house he's like literally I have to ask my mom like hey can I get the credit card I want to get Chipotle and he's like you know she didn't make me feel bad which I get respect like I know she probably felt bad cuz like you know Asian parents like all their kids all friends kids are like at Stanford and getting a promotion he's like he's still in the bedroom he's I don't know also like 24 is the threshold where it's like cute from concern yeah cons exactly exactly endearing to concern who's making that transition and she's like I don't know he just keeps saying thanks for hopping on the call but nothing seems to happen after that like you know he's pitching people all day in his bedroom and it's not working but he makes a pivot and he makes a pivot that that made a lot of sense he did what I call a niche down a Zoomin pivot and so a zoom in pivot is when you basically say I have this thing today that's kind of meh for everybody but maybe for one set of people it's awesome and this is the same way that actually twitch started twitch was you had Justin TV which was broadcast anything it was a Grand Vision broadcast anything broadcast your life broadcast your backyard broadcast this sports game broadcast this video game and only 2% of it was people broadcasting video games and twitch was a zoom in Justin TV was failing and they said what if we just did the video games thing and it it sounds counterintuitive it's like well then we'll be too small it's only just that little bit it's only 2% of our current traffic but it actually had the potential to be quite big once you specialize the product in that so these guys did the same thing they did it around college students who need help writing essays specifically not like oh dude it's like one minute before the deadline just give me a full essay I just want to like hand it in to my teacher and make them trick them that it's AI it's like no no no it's actually like a writing assistant so you basically you're writing your essay and you don't just say give me an essay about the Industrial Revolution you start writing your essay and then it kind of like like I know auto correct it'll kind of like fill in the rest of the sentence so if you're writing it'll kind of like if you stop It'll like suggest what the next couple sentences could be it'll help you site stuff as well so there sources exactly like you need their example online is like is really well is really great so it's the effect of the kenic diet on human longevity and looks like he's talking about something and it's like hey by the way do you want to site this paper that's already mentioned this or that and it auto it generates the well formatted citation at the end or it'll run a plagiarism check for you it'll be like hey let's just make sure that this is not copying what's already out there because you know your teacher's not going to like that so has a couple of like specific tools and you could it's like a it's not like chat GPT where you're it's just a chat interface like you kind of Click buttons and you select what how you want this to help you and then it helps you do you know how like uh Microsoft used to have clippy who would like catch you making errors they just need like a little picture of Bill Amman that says like ah ah ah that's play is exactly exactly we Billy he told me that like basically at the end of the essay less than 30% has been written by AI so 70% is written by the student and 30% ends up getting filled in by the AI okay so he gets this idea but even still how do you know if this is gonna be successful so now he pitched me two years ago at 2,000 in Mr it's currently doing 300,000 in Mr so 3.6 million a year uh in fact last year he had an offer to sell the company I think for three million bucks and he thought about it he's like oh my God I Could Be A Millionaire I could have $3 million dollars I'm young I'm in you know my early 20s and he turned it down and now this company's probably worth 10 10 to 15 million million bucks today so in six six to 12 months he basically you know tripled the value of the company so that's that's great all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example so I've got this company called Hampton join hampton.com it's a community for Founders doing between 2 million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys and so we have a lot of Founders who have high net wors and we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask but provide a lot of value so things like how much the founders pay themselves each month how much money they're spending each month what their payroll looks like if they're optimistic about the next year in their business all these questions that people are afraid to ask but well we ask them anyway and they tell us in this Anonymous survey and so what we do is we created a landing page using hubspot's landing page tool and it basically has a landing page that says here's all the questions we asked give us your email if you want to access it and then I shared this page on Twitter and we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey and I could see did they come from social media I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from I'm able to track all of that and then I'm able to see over the next handful of weeks how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton in other words I can see how much revenue came from this survey how much revenue came from each traffic Source things like that but the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it but a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen HubSpot made that super super easy if you're interested in doing this you can check it out hubspot.com the Link's in the description and I also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that I'm just going to do that call to action then and it's free check it out in the description all right now back to MFM so I talked to him and I was like dude David what's uh what's the story here what happened he's like uh well you know we we talked to you we did we did a bunch of thing so here's here's kind of the story of how they figured it out so do you want to know the kind of like the startup survival part of it or do you want to know the strategy of how they made it big well the strategy I mean the startup survival mode of it like he was just probably floundering but he didn't have any expenses so like he was kind of default dead just not even in startup mode but default dead just his life I mean well he was but then uh actually Jason calacanis is uh incubator launch gave them 100K um just like over email like here's 100K and so then they moved to Malaysia to be like cool this will last forever here and so he's like just let's how do we just make this 100K last as long as we need to survive because we don't know if there's ever going to be another investor that they did end up raising more money that they raised like another 800k later but how did they make this big so I wanted to share a couple things so first he's like you know we do the obvious things we we post about it whatever it's not really going anywhere then three there's three interesting inflections for this business inflection one is he does the the the stuff that doesn't scale he goes and he fights for that first 100 customers with hand toand combat and the way he did it is a strategy that I'll the overall strategy of what what worked here is I'll call influence the influencers so he starts joining Facebook groups and he wrote a long Twitter post about this you can check it out so he joins Facebook groups he's like I join a group of like let's say 10,000 people and he's like what you can't do is join the group and then immediately post about your [ __ ] and then it just gets taken down or flagged as like promotion sales get out of here dude so he's like I basically did a strategy where I was like I'm going to warm up these groups so that like if I do ever want to post how would it be like well received he would just work backwards from what situation would make this be well received he's like well it would be well received if the moderators and admins liked me and they were rooting for me and actually they liked my product they already used my product and that I was a familiar face in the community they had seen me around adding value and that even when I posted I was really posting actually just for feedback and not for like buy my [ __ ] so he's like let me work backwards from that so he joins the group and he starts posting just like very helpful content and in a Facebook group the bar is pretty low right because yeah nobody's like professionally trying in a Facebook group people are just very casual most people don't do anything at all this is like a like a Facebook group for researchers uh or it be for like college students it'd be for like grad St anything he had a hypothesis about so he's like oh I think it's should work really well for grad students got it so he joins some school's grad student Group which has like 6,000 people or whatever and then he would get in what he would do is he'd first start making helpful helpful post so he's just very visible and very helpful people start to see him as like a regular he's a regular at the bar okay then he hits up the admin and the admin's like oh you're one of the regulars yeah sure what's up he's like hey man I wanted to get your feedback on something would you be down to do like a 15-minute call I know you talked about this in a previous post I think I actually have something that can help you with that and then the guy would be like all right sure I'll do it so he gets on the call with them he shows him the product and then he's like I'm he's like I'm not gonna promote this until I see the eyes light up he's like basically if they don't like it then I'm Dead on Arrival not if this if the Core Power users don't like it the Casual guys aren't going to like it so he's like I'm going to keep iterating on my product until those guys are like yeah this is actually awesome and I see that they're using it after the call like they keep using it so he does that he he asked them questions he was like I read the mom test like you guys said these guys are fans of the Pod so we learned how to do these customer calls then I'm doing the calls and I'm uh I'm finding out their pain points and then I try to build a product that solves them and then I'm seeing do they use it on their own organically afterwards once they did he's like I got got him he's like so then I would let them use it for a couple weeks and then he's like I would um oh by the way he's also like I'm going to circle back so I would do the call and he's like a week later he's like hey I took all your feedback and I made the product better which that's like a key part of of like winning the users over is making them feel like they're heard and what that you actually acted on what they said um finally he'd be like hey do you think I could post it in the group like do you think other people would like this they like yeah for sure actually I'll post it for you and they would go post it so now you get the the kind of like cosign from the group admin or moderator that everybody knows the leader saying hey this is awesome I've been using it the founders in the group if you have any questions uh check this out so we start getting a bunch of tracks so we got the first 100 customers through this like very manual process which was really not as much about getting customers as it was about getting the product right by winning over the customers this is very similar to you doing the first hundred calls with Hampton members right like you showed me your calendar and I called it the zebra calendar it just Stripes just 20 minute calls all day just like your whole calendar was striped and well I did this with Reddit too by the way I did that when when the hustle first got popular is because I posted on Reddit and I did the same thing I wasn't as eloquent as he was but I basically said 10% self- promotion 90% ad value so people start you start getting a reputation so did you see that there's a movie about the guy what's his name some roaring Kitty who like did the game stu okay so roaring Kitty the real person is like a really good-looking guy who would charismatic like he looks like he kind of looks like he could be an actor like when you see him talk and I remember watching that movie and I'm like dude the real the the real roaring Kitty is cooler looking than this actor right I'm looking at David Park do this video and I and I'm seeing how he dresses and I've seeing like some of the home videos that he's taken of himself I'm like this guy looks like an actor playing him do you know what I mean this guy's got the it Factor like I can't even hear him talk but I could just tell by his body language how he dresses like this guy's got Charisma like J haircut yeah guy yeah yeah yeah this guy looks he looks like the actor playing him yeah he's like one of those people where if they wear like clothes that don't fit it looks good but if you wear clothes that don't fit you look like a [ __ ] idiot he's one of those people who can actually wear clothes that don't fit now let me tell you okay so then Here Comes phase two get lucky and uh get lucky is you know we've done that thing before about the four levels of luck the first one is just dumb luck lightning strikes you the second one which is fortune favors the Bold he's taking a bunch of action and he puts himself in a position to get lucky so there there's two lucky breaks that happen the first uh is this guy Zayn who runs a AI newsletter I think it's called superum I think it is superpowered super human something like that he um does this Twitter thread and it's called 10 websites so useful it feels almost illegal to use them or something like that that's the thing that's so funny that's so funny classic like you know click thing and this thread goes so viral dude guess how many likes This Thread has I don't know 10,000 365,000 dude I could post a sex tape and not get 365,000 in fact I probably wouldn't get any likes but you can post a sex tape and not get 365,000 likes that was the joke that you had you're like I can't believe one of your friends are the porn Titan and it it isn't popular that's the worst job ever that's like you you release a sex tape and no one wants it I still talking about that later your friend who you said as a forite that's not that popular and I was like wow the worst Cas scenario how many downloads did he get from or how many users did he get from that so he's like dude every every minute he's like I'd get 10 customers he's like it was just insane and so he goes he gets like this huge boost like you know whatever I don't know exactly how much but like 10x or more you know is the revenue he's at he's at 2,000 before that and now so that the first thing I described is how he got to the first 2,000 in Mr then he gets the viral Twitter thing and now he's in the like tens of thousands of monthly recurring Revenue so what happens after that Jennifer Lopez does a commercial that's about AI with Virgin Air or something like that and in the commercial she's like oh I'm not Jennifer this is Jen Ai and so ji gets a bunch of searches he's the number one search for Jenny Ai and so he's like I got a bunch of free traffic from that that helped again he's like so I'm getting lucky he's like but I still don't know what to do to like really blow the top off this thing and then they start posting Tik toks now this is what I want to ask you Sam you did a great job early on with the hustle I'm gonna put you on the spot this is gonna be hard you at the hustle did some really cool ads uh you you basically were like instead of just saying here's my newsletter please read it it's it's very good I promise you were like my boss thinks I'm so smart but what he doesn't know is I just read the hustle every day right and it was like value based right and it kind of had that that hook which is what is the what is the end happy out happy ending for this customer it's not that your newsletter's great it's that your boss thinks you're smart everyone thinks you're so smart my boss thinks I'm smart I'm not my secret weapon is the hustle which I get every morning that was the ad right and you stole that from somebody and then now a 100 people have tried to copy that I was I wouldn't say I stole but you could say that you could say that I don't think I would say that uh I would say I was heavily influenced by a random ad that I saw from the skim and I changed it and now everyone else has since stole it a jury of our peers would say that so yeah so so this guy now now I want you to tell me um if you had to do an ad right you're making a little a short video a Tik Tok and you need to promote Jenny AI just let's brainstorm real quick right let's do this let's do it live as Bill O'Reilly used to say right tell me what how what you would think of I know this is a very hard prompt but if you come through just imagine how smart everyone's gonna think you are at this podcast what would you do how would you design this this Tik Tok ad well okay I actually think that I would steal that same premise which is like my teachers think I'm brilliant I'm not I'm really just using gen AI um video is harder so all of my ads were text and a photo on Facebook to do this on video that's like what young people are great at that I'm really bad at what would you do for the video I would do that same premise but I don't know how I would struggle to display that yeah watch this um this Tik Tok has four million views so the ad is basically it takes a for instead of saying um my boss thinks I'm so smart or my teacher thinks I'm so smart it a different format which is what I call the relatable struggle and it starts let's just break this ad down so it says it's a girl it doesn't look like an ad that's the first first thing you need to know looks like Starbucks if you want ads to work nowadays don't make them look like ads that's the the biggest thing as soon as I see an ad I'm insta swiping away so this needs to be relatable so it looks like a college girl at a Starbucks and it says doing an essay last minute my goal is to submit before 1200 a.m it's done two things relatable problem and it's established some some Stakes will this person or will they make it or won't they make it right all right that's the thing it's a it's a door closing Mission Impossible you got to slide under the door you hear I got to tell you the second thing I've my experience is like $15 million in ad spin I'm going to say something right now that's going to make me sound horrible but I'm just going to say the truth here's what I found my number mbers women that are so women get higher clicks amongst women women gets higher clicks amongst men and men are rather so so women that are like just women do better amongst men and women for getting clicks so we've always I've always had a higher clickthrough rate with women now here's the thing about the woman they have to look like you can approach them like I can have a conversation with them but they're aspirational if they're too like good-looking or too like fancy looking it doesn't work it has to be an approachable young woman and I found that that gets the most clicks amongst all demographics and they did that they did that wonderfully here I say that did I say love the level of nervousness in your voice as you're trying to say this without getting canceled you're like you're a fine approachable young woman you're a strapping L young lad like well so we used to have it was like it was like if you use like 1940s language you're like if you're a young lass who's Splendid and fine then then you're it's like dude you can't just avoid cancellation by using old language I'm going to call it nextto hot so whe whether you're a nextto guy or nextto girl next door hot always outperformed like beautiful or model or whatever yeah Runway hot so that's frame one relatable St go okay now two is oh and then by the way it says current time 1020 so it's here's 1020 got to submit this by by midnight last minute research and then it says then this is the key one 1050 mental breakdown and she's crying basically like so now you're like all right you kind of don't know is this going to be funny is this going to be like it's obviously kind of like it's planned but it still doesn't look like an ad for any product we're 10 seconds in no hint that this is an ad for product then it says coffee and Tik Tock break relatable uh it says back to it and then it basically is like [ __ ] gets serious and it's her like clipping up her hair again another relatable humorous like oh that's so me I get it I do that uh I'm guilty of that right we're now 30 seconds in and there's been no mention of the product and so this does two things number one the Tik Tok algorithm loves that it's you're watching full length videos rather than swiping away because it's like oh this is some ad the second thing is you're kind of invested you have sunk cost you need to see the ending even even once you realize and one of the top comments is for a second when you showed Jenny AI I was like I got Bamboozled by an ad all caps because you didn't realize it was an ad until you're basically what uh 35 seconds in and then even then it doesn't it's not some polished demo of the product it's a phone recording a laptop of someone typing in Jenny AI into like their Google search and then finally it tells you what the product does for you which is it'll help you write two times faster and the happy ending is she submits it on time okay so four million is this how is this how like my my doctor and lawyer and accountant are where they're just like at Starbucks at 11:50 trying to plagiarize a paper that's due at midnight well that's they were 8 years ago [ __ ] D you know that you went to college with people who are now doctors you're like that guy I know that guy I know the real I know the real version of that guy right like that guy only drinks Jagger M like this guy should not be a doctor uh and so right now these guys so that ad was great so David Park you're amazing so they're at $350,000 a month 300,000 a month so 3.6 million a year and uh doing really well so congrats to the Jenny guys uh did great by the way he gets cancer then and he says this in the in that starter Story video he goes he's like I felt like my dreams and nightmar both true at the same time what's that and he got that's a footnote to his story he got cancer he got cancer during that like last year or whatever and then he had a surgery and he got out and he's good now and so it's a crazy story dude it's a it's a really crazy story so congratul by the way I don't think I wouldn't say this is going to be a smart investment yet so I don't think it's going to be a good investment but I think it's going to be great for them you make 6 to8 million bucks that's fantastic below before 30 that's amazing you're you're set I I like so if I was David this is a company I would love to own this is not a company that I would love to invest in but it's going to make him very very rich I think at a very young age and it's going to make him like mildly famous amongst our little startup Community there is a business I would love to sell if I could sell this thing for anything above $1 million you won't see me the ne bye see you later I'm gone they be like wait the paperwork's not even signed I don't care bye it's over I'm out of here AI moves too fast dude I'm not trying to be in the middle of the hurricane of AI and hope that I'm not made obsolete by you know oneclick chat GPT or some big company adding this I think this is actually fairly protected like I don't think it's so Niche I don't think too many people are going to go for it but I just wouldn't want to mess with this also think that college student essay writing isn't like the biggest Tam either so you know I would want to sell on the way up and get out and go do something else yeah and also Sam Alman raised the equivalent of America's GDP like $5 trillion for whatever he like whenever I see this these numbers I'm like that just means nothing to me I hope I'm dead by the time this becomes a reality because is there any Sam Alman story you wouldn't believe no I believe I would believe it all if I told you the open AI headquarters is underwat would you be like that's [ __ ] or would you just be like where I would believe anything about yeah I mean like so like should we scuba up and like go visit him or like what do we do yeah I believe it all um I've got all right I've got a big one and I've got a short one I'm GNA give you the short one first and then and then I want to hear this thing about flow but do you remember I want to give an update and I'm gonna say with preference with this update last time I gave an update on this guy he took that update and he clipped our YouTube video and he turned it into an ad and I got super [ __ ] pissed so I just want to tell you don't turn this into an ad you do not have permission that's dumb it looked like I endorsed this product I don't a few years ago I think it was three years ago this guy started dming me telling me he has this idea for hostage tape do you remember I told you about this it's basically tape that you put over your mouth because mouth mouth breathing at night makes you a bad sleeper I guess is the premise it's just gross I don't know what it is but there's some health benefits and he just like got in right when the huberman's and the Brian Johnson's of the world and all this stuff so he he timed it perfectly he told me he was launching this and I was like oh this is this is really dumb th this is the stupidest thing I've seen in a long time and he kept dming me kept sending me updates I think in year one he did 2 million in Revenue now he just told me he ended 2023 with 14 million in revenue and then he's saying that this year in 24 he's like I think I can get 40 million in Revenue he's like we're buying all these ads on Joe Roan we're going to be sponsoring the UFC he's saying all this crazy stuff and I'm G to file this under the I cannot believe this worked I still can't believe it's worked and he's totally proven me wrong so far has this guy been sending you updates uh not I've talked to him a couple times about one specific deal he was going to I just Tred to help him out by the way May 25th 2023 subject line he said it was a bad business idea dot dot dot emailed out to his whole list I think hey folks Alex here telling you telling people you run a mouth taping business isn't all sunshine and rainbows is any does did anyone think that that was sunshine and rainbows you know what they say running a Ming business everyone always asks me like how awesome is this I didn't know anyone ever said that I recently got called out on a very popular business podcast called my first million maybe you listen to it anyways I reached out to one of the hosts Sam to tell him my idea he said it was a bad idea all bold that was over a year ago now 1,400 reviews hundreds of success stories later I couldn't help but message him again well he didn't and so he says um I don't know what I don't know what the what the thing is oh he goes um I thought it'd be really funny if the hostage tape Army if you're if you're a customer of this and you're in the hostage tape Army I mean none of these should be going together by the way the hostage none of these words should be lumped in the same sentence the hostage tape Army you know what I mean if that's on your bio like you're out but he said show up in the comments and say hey Sam hash shut your mouth I like that part that part's pretty good hostage tape shut your mouth I like I think that's yeah yeah that one's good he goes I don't want to start a a war but these guys appreciate a good prank we do we really do um so I don't know if he did do that I'm going to click this uh this link and by the way he's getting the last laugh if his tape is untaped he is getting the last laugh this guy this guy's winning he's making a lot of money people actually want his product I'm wrong here he's right I still think it's stupid though I'm looking at the comments by the way I don't see one hashtag shuty mouth Sam so I don't think hostage type Army showed up the Cavalry did not appear for this one but I think it's funny that he's doing this and I think think it's great that he's he's winning so uh God bless him I got so angry when I saw my face on these ads though I started getting these ads and I'm like it said like I and I was like well what the [ __ ] I was making fun of you and you just totally Jiu-Jitsu me and now I'm promoting you all right you shared an L you took I'll tell you about an L I take it's 20 it's 2020 and I'm getting dinner with a friend and we're only like I want to say 40 minutes into the dinner and he's like I got to go and I'm like was it me was it something I said am I chewing too much what's going on why why you got to leave he's like no no no he's like I hate to leave but I gotta I gotta go meet with this founder from bellus it was just you two at the dinner it was us two at the dinner and he just bounces and I'm like bellus I don't know where belus is but I was like all right that's uh I don't know if this is something you know elaborate excuse or what but he leaves so I finish up dinner go home I see an email from my friend he says sorry I had to Jet so early but this company's really interesting he tell tells me about this company called flow and he's investing in this company called flow and he's like if you want in I can get you in and I remember this because today or yesterday I'm scrolling on Twitter and I see flow is one of the biggest success stories in consumer startups today 192 million in ARR with 60 million active users and it's been the fastest growing Health app uh for like you know four years and I'm like $192 million in AR I was like why does this app sounds familiar I go back and look at my email and I see that I could have invested in this thing years ago had I just replied to this email from my friend what valuation I don't know what it was back then because I didn't even reply to ask but uh whatever it was I should have done it because you know obviously the thing has been growing so fast that it is uh you know it's clearly it's become a billion- dollar company and it's it's done really really well but this company's really interesting last pod you talked about I forgot what ammo or whatever it is like some Eastern European like app builder Factory yeah they make a variety of apps like one is muscle for men and then another one was working out for women while the men the women are on their period Well I see your Eastern European women's Period app and I raise you because that's what Flo is started by these guys out in like bellarus Lithuania something like that two twin brothers by the way so the twin brothers one uh they're raised by a single mother who's a librarian and they're like yo we got to make money like they're 15 years old he's like I was going to school and then I would work a full-time job after school so I go to school for eight hours then I go work for eight hours and that's what I did every day as a teenager he's like and I just said this like deep like we have to figure something out he's like so I did two things he's like I taught myself how to code he's like and I was teaching myself using these like textbooks he's like so then I started actually writing books to make some money he's like whatever I learned I would then package up into a book and I would write it he's like I've written you know a bunch of books and then I started I became a book publisher I started publishing like I've published a thousand books now um so I'm like okay random he's like the other thing that happened is 2008 and the iPhone app store comes out and uh he's like I think this is going to be big I think this is going to be like you know the internet was big there was a bunch of winners I think there's going to be some here so he's like forget the book publishing let's start making apps and so they start a health app kind of fails start a second app kind of fails and people ask them they're like you know what' you learn you know was flow your first app or how how' you do he's like no no I started two things before that similar space but just didn't didn't fully hit he goes but I believe the that success is the sum of your attempts he's like and those first two attempts that I did for a couple years that is the success of flow and I just love that quote Success is the sum of your attempts I think that's an amazing quote and so he goes we start flow and they're like so you're a dude building a women's like period tracking app the number one period tracking app in the world like how does that happen how does a dude in bellarus do that I love I love this quote it's my not my job to build the product it's my job to build the company of people that are able to build the product exactly they're like how how do you have the product intuition of building this that's exactly say he goes I like I this is one thing I learned in those first two products was as a job as a CEO as a Founder my job is not to build the product it's to build the the company that will build these products and that's what they did and so they actually built two things they create this hold Co and the holdco owns like four apps that are all super successful so they own flow which itself does about 200 million a year in revenue and that's so it's basically it's start off with just simple like period tracking so it's like a a monthly kind of like tracker uh but then off that they they go into other things so they created what they call a woman's health super app and this was the pitch that I saw at the time when my friend went and got dinner with them they were like look we built the number one period tracking app and that's great uh and at the time they had like 30 million users using this and they said that in the US 10% of adult women were using their tracker so like we built the best tracker but a Tracker is not going to be like the most monetizable thing but they're like well why do people track well often they track because of health reasons they track because they're trying to get pregnant they track because um maybe they're entering menopause like there's all these other things that maybe they need health coaching maybe they need these other things there's a bunch of May from there and they turned out to be right and so they were like we're going to make more money than any of these other health apps so they're bigger than Comm or these other like meditation apps that that are like in that kind of Health and Wellness space u this is a bigger app than all of those and it's run by these guys in Eastern Europe who you know have basically dominated the world in this one category they're the number one in this category and so they but they also own a couple of other companies they own another app called zing and they know another app called Prisma which is like a photo editor and they own do you remember when Prisma went viral a little while back and like was cool looking filters um yeah the holdco has raised a hundred million series B and that's called uh that's called paa paa yeah and are they in America no they're in Lithuania really and they have like hundreds of employees and this is like in the pitch deck was like yeah we we can hire like 10 super talented European coders for the cost of one you know mediocre engineer in San Francisco they didn't say it like that but that I added the mediocre part but that's that's the implication is basically we have this like Talent Advantage we're the we're the big fish in the small pond but the small pond is highly talented with really good programmers and uh were super super coste efficient and so they were able to to be very um very efficient as they've as they've grown you could have invested in this yeah so this one that one sucks so so I would say the first one was not really a Miss in that like even now I don't think that would been a great investment but great business to own not a great business to invest in this one would have been a great business invested but it just didn't hit any of my patterns it's like you have Eastern European company versus a Silicon Valley company you have it's in the you know period tracking I don't know how big that space can be uh you know I I don't don't really I I underestimated I'm sure many people underestimated how big that app could be and in fact that's why they said they're like I love that these guys didn't [ __ ] like they didn't do the thing that all Sil Valley startups do where they make up their origin story where they're like well the reason I got into this was that my my aunt was having trouble like you know like Jack dorsy with square he's like um you know I was uh I was I was trying to buy this uh this vase that was being you know this glass this this guy was blowing glass and making this vase for me wanted to buy but he couldn't take a credit card and I thought wow the small business of America are like you know underserved I should really change this in fact actually I think part of that story is true that the co-founder did do that as a as a hobby but I think most startups make up their origin story where they're like you know like native deodorant he's like my sister was pregnant I just did not want her to be having aluminum in her armpits and so I created a pregnancy safe yeah right dude you just the shipping cost of deodorant was just a lot cheaper than mattresses and you just exact that's why you did it econom is not as good of a story or like I went to Etsy and I was hunting for the most most highly sold product that didn't have competition that was under one pound to sh and had 80% gross margins it's like that's not as good of a PR story so these guys they didn't do that they were like why'd you do this he's like well we just wanted to find the most underserved Market he's like we just knew that no talented Builders were building in this space and we thought well half the world's population has this problem uh they're completely underserved and we can build a you know a simple product that might have legs uh to to grow from there and that's that's what they did this guy's amazing we got to get him on the podt so it's the one of the founders I guess it's you said two brothers his name is Yuri gersi I guess uh he's from bellus but I think they kind of live in Poland it looks in in Cypress they're all over the place but he he's really successful so like you kind of acted like he was like a young kid just like blogging and packaging his blogs into books no no these guys are gangsters yeah like these guys are ballers and he's had multiple companies that he sold sold one he sold to Facebook one to uh I actually don't know how to pronounce this what's mail. Ru it's the Russian guy mil um yes yes yes uh he sold one to Google like these guys are hardcore these guys are awesome yeah these guys are kicking ass and so they um and you know he's he's basically like they're like what do you think contributed to the success of this he's like well the biggest thing is we picked the right market and I love that he said this because I think this is where he even said this he's like most people he's like you need three things the right target Market the right timing and then the right people to execute on it it's like most people don't get the first two right but that's your Rising tide if you could pick the right market and the right timing he's like we picked basically this underserved Women's Health Market and we started in 2008 right when the apps came out that's when we started making apps so we were early and we went to to the underserved Market that had demand from there all we had to do is just hire good people and it would it would work out um and I think that most people when you talk to entrepreneurs of the way their brain works if you had to make like a pie chart it would be like number one is like you know the um how cool is my idea so it's like not Market but it's more product they focus on the product then they focus on the people and then last is like they kind of think about what Market they're in and they try what they try to do which I think is a bad strategy one I mistake I made many times is like build the best product in the in a whatever Market in a meth Market but you'd rather go into an amazing market and build a good enough product that's like where a lot more success comes the best example of that I believe it was uh coinbase they were like our website early on sucked like it went down all of the time but we we picked a market that people were beging for it and that they were willing to put up with a really crappy product and another speaking of these apps Michael uh Acton Smith from CM he gave me this great like sound bite one time we were just talking and he was like I launched these other things and I kind of had to push the rock up the hill in order to make it work but I knew that I picked the right I knew that I picked the right Market being calm in meditation he was like it was as if I had just was surfing and I just happen to catch this massive tidal wave and my job was not to push the rock up the hill it was just to hang onto this surfboard and hope I don't crash because it's pushing me and it's doing all of the work and that's the difference between something really working and something not working because he's like I had all these amazing things and he's like I'm a really good entrepreneur but I and I kind of brute forced it into reality but it was really really really hard and I learned that when you pick the right market and you catch the right Title Wave that makes life a thousand times easier and the hard part is what people get wrong is okay I want to pick the right market so they just go to the biggest flashiest market right say right now ai I gotta go into Ai and they go into Super competitive market that's uh it is a hot Market there are going to be huge winners there but the trick the like you know Peter teal one time went to a a a Meetup and they were like what's the key to investing he do he drew two circles like a vend diagram and he's like like um seems like a bad idea and then the other hero is a good idea he's like the problem is most people just do things that sound like a good idea the problem is everybody else is also doing things that sound like good idea so you're just it's tons of competition and uh you might be too late by the time it seems like a good idea he's like so the secret is can you find something that today seems like a bad idea but is actually a good idea coinbase started back when Bitcoin was like not considered like an obvious crypto wasn't the wave back then it wasn't the trendy thing to do it was actually an underserved Market but it wasn't and it was turned out to be a great Market but it wasn't considered already a great Market where all the smartest people in the world went and we're fighting this like War over there that's what you know AI is today it's everybody agrees it's an incredible market so they're all going to go fight this battle over there so you really have to if you're going to have something you have to Niche down and find some section of that that's underserved or go somewhere that's today not seen as that not like forget AI find the thing three years from now that's AI this seems like the hostage tape guy giving his Ted talk you know know he's going to be standing there like this talking about the event diagram of bad ideas and good ideas and then his idea is just going to be in the circle of the bad ideas yeah like you got to be in the middle I'm sorry hostage tape guy you're right I'm wrong you're the one winning um the this is amazing these guys are amazing uh I I would love to get this guy in the podcast is he's speaking he's I imagine he's an English speaker right or part dude he probably speaks better English than us is there anything this guy can't do like would you if one guy had to save my life and they were like how about this guy like yeah sure I'm sure he could do it yeah yeah and if you Google this guy so his name's Yuri gersi sorry I'm I'm probably pronouncing it a little bit incorrect he's got the perfect balance he's got that next door that next door hot look you know what I'm saying it looks like he could you could chill with him a little bit but he also looks like he could really mess you up physically like he's he does a good job of of having that that nexts you want him to mess you up physically a little bit dude I get so many messages or comments of people making fun of me and they they either think I'm gay or they're just like dude why are you commenting about people's Cals all the time and I'm totally just like giving into this uh by the way do you have something to promote today or what now it's time right now we're talking about some some of the best execution we've seen some of the best most talented people we've seen and are they sitting in America no they're overseas actually everyone has been overseas everybody we've talked about has been overseas and that's because the world has changed there's Talent everywhere and for you as an entrepreneur one of the things you should be doing is leveraging that Global Talent the way to do that is to go to Shephard and just tell them what you need all you do is you go there and you're like hey I think we need a developer I need an engineer or I need a designer or I need somebody who could do all of our influencer marketing whatever you don't have time for that's the bottleneck of your business go to Shephard tell them what you need and they will find you somebody couple weeks you will have have talent in place usually for five times less than you hire for in America this is a this is a not so secret secret anymore you know for my e-commerce company I think 40% of our staff is international uh we get tremendous cost savings and we get some of the best talent by just by looking overseas looking where other people aren't looking if you're hiring in the same place that everybody else is hiring you know you're not going to make it they're doing developers now they do developers yeah because they do latam so one of the things I've been using is all their like latam talents so Latin America where you get a lot more of two things one is a [ __ ] ton of mbas so like I needed an operations person I was like my coo is just like I feel like every coo is overworked like I don't know if you've ever had this but like the entrepreneur always just gives the COO everything they don't want to do which is like 85% of all the work in any business like just gets dumped on the COO it's like yeah that's operational you should figure that out and so I like dude my coo needs a COO and so we started hiring operations people from South America because they have basically people who are you know NBAs so they're like trained that way they've been doing consulting for years and they make like you know let's call it 3K a month and so compare that to in America you'd probably be paying 12 to 15K a month for that same Talent so you know four to five times more and so we found some awesome uh both developers and operations people in latam that's what I go for there and then like kind of like customer service design um anything that's like data marketing marketing assistant that's all Philippines for me wow all right well and what's the URL support shepard.com go to ship.com and then when you're there tell them I sent you they'll take care of you do we want to round up round out with the the three random things you have here yeah I got some random things I don't know uh which one we want to do did you watch the Super Bowl at all yeah I I'm not like a sports guy I I but I watched it just because it was a big deal and uh you have Jason how do you say the guy's last name Kelsey Kelsey Jason Kelce over Travis Kelsey that Travis guy seemed pretty likable in his post game like interview like he seemed like a big Goofy idiot in the best possible way yeah he kind of is although it was really bad for him I don't know if you saw during the game he like basically got super angry at his coach and like almost like knocked him over and was yelling at him the reason it wasn't cool was because his coach is old enough that you're like oh that a that's like you're you kind of pushed an old guy you know mean he like kind of lost his balance he like almost pushed him down and it was like say everyone felt bad for like their own dad in that moment that's what I mean why I was like oh he's a little bit too old but they like hugged it out and it seemed like they were fine afterwards yeah I think they're fine but definitely all of the Taylor Swift fans were like red flag we need an emergency meeting all the swifties had like an emergency meeting we're like I'm worried about Taylor do I don't like what I saw out there but did you see the I did see the brother so he has another brother in the in the NFL Jason his brother dressed up like Zack galanakis from uh hangover where he from Allen from The Hangover he looked hilarious yeah I basically want to do a TED Talk actually I want to prepare slides and be like here's why you should be Jason Kelce and not Travis Kelce cuz on paper you want to be Travis Kelce he's the receiver you know Jason Kel is a center like the most unglamorous position that there is uh so it's like you know you have Travis Kel he's a tight end he's always catching passes he's like he's good better looking like he's like you know more handsome he's like more stylish he can dance the other guy's kind of awkward um you know Travis Kel's dating Taylor Swift oh that's amazing right but Jason Kel's wife is a badass she's like greatl looking former athletes super fun she like joins this podcast all the time and she's like got a great personality and just seems like super down toe like she shows up to the to the Box because they know you're gonna show Taylor Swift like a hundred times during the game right and it's Taylor Swift and she's there with like that actress what's her name Blake whatever Blake Lively like Lively yeah and it's like and they know every time something happens they're like doing YouTube thumbnail face like they're so exaggerated with their emotions because they know we're performing here whereas like Jason Kel's wife is there in the background she's wearing like her College hoodie like her like Mama Mo hoodie no makeup and she's just super comfortable and she's having a great time she's like eating food and drinking she's like chilling out not trying to get attention all the time so it's like and then you know Jason shows up you thought about this a lot huh I did because last week they played uh or two weeks ago they played in Buffalo and the game I don't know if you saw it it was like crazy snow day and Jason Kelce was uh watching the game he watching his brother play and he went and he was like dude I don't want to sit in this like luxury Suite he's like I want to be out there with this is awesome this is like what you Grow Up Loving about football it's like a Snow Game this is crazy playoff football so he takes his shirt off he jumps into the crowd he jumps out of the Luxury Box into the crowd with the Buffalo fans and starts chugging beers and just like having a great time with them he's like that's the experience I want and his wife was like don't do this bab like Taylor Swift's here they're like people are gonna see you doing this he's like I don't care what people see I want to like this is what I grew up like you know admiring I want to have a great time so you could tell this guy's having a great time he's not in it for the show he's got the real relationship goals you should have not the Taylor Swift like high school you know the the cheerleaders dating the quarterback type of [ __ ] um and then he shows up to the Super Bowl dressed like Allen from The Hangover I love Jason Kel I all about Jason Kelce Jason Kelsey over Travis Kelce that's my case I'm looking at I just Googled uh Jason Kelsey's shirt list and you do see him in the Box wearing gray sweatpants taking a shirt off and he's like in the drunk guy mode where he's yelling what's hilarious about this guy is you see his face and you see some of the things where he sounds just like a goofy dummy like he's just joking like your fat friend but they show him shirtless and you see a can of beer in his hand and it is so small this guy is a giant this guy will kill you you yes this this Bud like looks like a 5H Hour Energy in his in his hand this guy is a freak how like they're they're both I guess huge this guy does not look huge when you just see him from the neck up on the podcast this guy and you know he's got gray hair right so he like doesn't like look like an athlete you see him shirtless this guy looks like a freak that's the amazing yes exactly and I I just think there's some life lesson there's some wisdom in this whole thing in fact another version of this by the way uh did you see like when the I don't know what it was the Grammys were on and the Tracy Chapman uh song was going super viral did you see this they did Fast Car her and she looked awesome too so do you know the back do you know her story or do you know the backstory of like Tracy Chapman and that song yeah she basically was uh just a normal person she was just your an average lady and she I think got discovered by like a friend of a friend so uh the friend being the writer of billions his dad yeah his dad was uh worked in the music industry and Brian went up to Tracy and was like look this they went same college so they were in college she's just playing like on campus and he's like you're amazing he calls his dad he's like Dad well he goes what he said was he goes look this is like lame usually and I never like ask my daddy for a favor that's kind of douchy right but you've got it would you care if I make an introduction to my father I actually think he might help you I'm not just like blowing smoke up your ass like you actually this actually could do something and I think it it became something it it did and so she she kind of gets a contract but she's the she's like the anti- artist right she's the anti- poop artist so she's not uh like she's just going to make the music she wants and she's not going to like just do what the record label wants they were like oh tell us about your relationship like N I prefer to keep that private yeah like but just tell us she's like on act as Hollywood they're like but there's got this song has to be about someone she's like well it is about someone but like you know I prefer not to share and I don't want them to feel bad about it or anything like that so I'm not gonna share and they're like well it's hard to promote this album if you're not gonna say anything and she's like I just want my music to speak for itself like she was just like to me I watched a couple I went down a rabbit hole after this and I watched her and I was like she is the beacon of authenticity her and Jason Kelsey are like you actually want to be them you don't want to be the pop answer and there's something to the to just being totally authentic and like not performing for everybody like she makes all the like little Tik Tock [ __ ] look like little Tik Tok [ __ ] of just like I don't know if you've seen the subreddit I am the main character it's basically full of people who like think they're the main character of Life they're like they put their camera somewhere on a flight they stand up and they're doing a Tik Tok dance and everyone else is like dude can I can I get to my seat like what are you doing like what is this it's just like these annoying people who are trying to do stuff for attention and so do you know do you know how old Tracy Chapman is she's like in her 50s probably I don't know what is she she's 60 she looks she looks awesome and she's like she just goes gray she's got no makeup on or whatever she's like uh they're like you know how do you um how do you promote your music she's like I don't know I don't have social media you don't have social media she's like no I mean I just hang out with my friends what do I why would I need that and they're like but because um because um and you sound like an idiot trying to explain why you need social media she's like I don't know I just make my music and I I I go outside and I play with I hang out with my friends like where would I need that and then they're like okay but like what do you do on your phone and she's like I don't have a smartphone either well haven't you heard the uh haven't you heard the story of like the Mexican fisherman and the banker it's like that where it's a you know a banker a rich Banker's on vacation and he's in Mexico and he's loving it and he meets this fisherman who brings him fresh fish every day and uh the F the fisherman basically brings the fish in the morning to the banker and then he spends the rest of the day chilling the banker goes to the fisherman he goes hey why don't you just go and like your fish is the best go hire more fisherman and like I'll help you let's build this into a thing and we're going to make so much money and the Mexican guy's like all right but then what he goes well then we're going to like get grow Revenue to like 15 million and then we're going to sell it and the guy's like then what he goes well then you're going to be rich and uh you can do anything you want and the Mexican guy's like what would I do the banker goes well then you just fish all day and just hang out and the Mexican guy's like I do that now and that's like the whole parable of like you know I actually don't know what it's trying to say other than like your great life a lot simpler all till the end and all that's nonsense whatever I'm not sure what it's all about why don't on the boat missing out what be the banker let's go on vacation be a fisherman your whole life yeah I think you you missed the ending of that one I think it's about knowing what you want and also knowing how to have it have enough uh that there is such a thing as enough um Tracy Chapman has enough J has enough by the way a couple other cool things about her story that I really like one um you know be prepared to you know take the chance when when luck presents itself so do you know how she got her big break like what kind of catapulted her to become a star because obviously she's not doing the normal stuff you do to promote yourself as a pop star she doesn't look like a pop star doesn't talk like a pop star doesn't have social media doesn't have a smartphone so how did she initi she get her break have you heard this story no so there was like a giant um televised music thing that was for Nel Mandela's 70th bir oh yeah yeah yeah and she's on the like the prelims the undercard of the undercard before the TV start stuff even turns on so she goes and she plays two songs or three songs and early in the day and then later in the day was supposed to be the headline ax and Stevie Wonder was supposed to go on and perform but Stevie Wonder um got lost no they messed up his backing tracks and so he's like I can't go on like my backing this is not going to work like I need the audio to work so they were like [ __ ] uh the audio is messed up we need somebody to go fill like you know six minutes of time here before the next ACT and give us some time to fix this who can go on and who can play with no backing tracks and just go on acoustic and kill it and they were like Tracy uh will you go on there and play a song and she's like okay and they're but it's just your you and your guitar nothing else she's like okay and so she goes out there and she plays fast car and you can see this video on YouTube her voice is like quaking at the beginning and she has no like autotune no no vocals no backtrack so it's like you can hear every imperfection in it but then she gets you know she kind of comes into her own she sings the song and people love it people go nuts for it and that's how she kind of got her break into started was by being prepared and being willing to go out there and take a risk and having obviously the talent to back it up her first album sells 10 million copies which is insane and then they're like amazing huge hit uh fast car still is considered like one of the like top hundred songs ever written or whatever they're like what are you gonna do for your second album hey the record Executives come to her with like some ideas they have like a pitch meeting they're like they're like you know presentation they like pull the curtain off the off the easel and they're like Tracy Chapman singing These pop songs she's like Noah I don't think I want to do that and they're like but Tracy you did 10 million your first time you could do 20 this time right like the the banker to the fish and she's like no I don't really want to do that they're like well what do you want to do she's like I'm not sure yet I'm going to experiment and figure it out they're like experiment what do you mean you have to go go to the studio and record she's like no no I'm not going to record what I'm going to do is she hired so normally what a musician does is they go they write their songs they go to a studio they hire like a studio musician to come and play the like the piano or the trumpet or whatever with them there they have no chemistry with them they record then later they go on tour and they perform she did it in reverse she's like what if I did the instead what if I hired a set of musicians that I really like I took the risk of hiring them and what if we tour for a year writing songs as we go and then through the tour we're going to see what music is resonating with people and at the end we'll just record the stuff that they liked almost like a comedian going to small clubs and working out their material she did that for music and so and that's how she did her second album and she was like I'm so proud of how it turned out blah blah blah I have no idea what the sales were but like you know I like that that approach and again I'm I'm I'm on an authenticity kick right now and to me I love that last year I said Sean I'm going to be having a baby do you um could you tell tell me what are some of the highlights of having a kid this was in private and you're like it's just great you know my my son and my daughter like I just I get so much joy out of seeing that they admire all these little things like they just love staring at the fan and it made me happier that like oh the fan actually is cool and I like I I like am interested now because they're interested and I love seeing them grow that's how I feel right now a few years ago a few years ago I asked you about really simple things that I just thought you would understand like dolly and you're like doly who now you're teaching me about Tracy Chapman next for all I know you're going to tell me who the Beatles are and you're going to do this wonderful breakdown and I just think that you have grown so much that you are now like Tracy Chapman like I didn't know everything about her but I can tell you a lot of her songs and and now you've just discovered her and I love that you are bringing a new perspective of this and you are actually teaching me about an artist that I love next we're going talk about you know Paul McCartney Eric Clapton let's talk about all this stuff tell me who MC Jagger is I used to stop believing but now I realize I should Don't Stop Believing this great song like I am getting so much joy and I'm learning now that you are new because you you probably didn't know much about her before this did you no I I mean I just heard the song in fact I didn't understand song you never heard that song No I heard I love the song but I don't know are you so there's two types of people I think there's people who listen to songs for the words and there's people who listen to songs for the meaning which one are you like I could hear a song a thousand times and not tell you I have no clue what the song is about I don't I've never even actually I've never even thought about the lyrics I might know some of the words but like I couldn't tell you what the song is about even though I I care about the meeting like like particularly like rock and roll by like a lot of black people in the 70s and 80s it's like Civil Right Stuff I enjoy like learning the story about it yeah I don't actually know what uh fast car is about though you should go listen to it uh go listen and like actually listen to the lyrics it's a it's an amazing story that she's telling in that thing so I kind of got into it for that reason also liked one other thing I watched an interview with her and I think both of us appreciate Poise as a as a trait I think Poise is something nobody ever talks about but we all notice it when we see it and those are things that I like to pick up on what are things that nobody says they are into or practice nobody ever says I'm practicing Poise but when we see it we all think it's badass and we appreciate well Tom Brady he's so poised or that leader he just has this way carries himself well it's Poise um under pressure right Poise and so she she did this Charlie Rose interview and Charlie Rose again she's kind of the worst interview ever because she doesn't say anything like she doesn't play the game yeah play the game and so he's like you know tell me you know when you were a young kid like when did you first start playing music she's like oh you know I got a guitar and I started playing music when I was like five she like by eight I was writing songs and he's like and he's like and that's when you knew you wanted to be a musician she goes I think that's when I knew I she didn't say I think she goes that's when I knew I was a musician oh yeah and was like just realizing kind of this she wasn't trying to say it to Onin but what a what a statement too and I think there's uh what a poised way of saying something that she just saying it as it is uh that's how it was I realized I was a musician and that's me that's a part of me that's how I am like that it wasn't I'm gonna try to do anything trying is like the least poised thing you could do I am a musician I think she's just she's a badass I really respect her and I think she lives in Ohio which is you know sort of like uh Dave Chappelle you know these guys that are like they could have it all they could be in the middle and the thick of it all but they're in [ __ ] Ohio just's another one on the authenticity Mount Rushmore right like walked away from $50 million because you know they were trying to control the the show and uh he's like then they made they called me crazy and said I was doing crack in Africa he's like no I'm not doing crack in Africa what the hell are you talking about he's like he's like I'm in Ohio I'm notna my image I'm just gonna go live my life and be happy I didn't know that that I I actually up until recently thought he was in Africa he was like CU that was the narrative it was Dave Dave Chappelle got like basically went crazy he's doing crack and then he went to Africa he lost his mind he's and he came out like years later was like no like they were offering me a [ __ ] contract I said no and then I just went home and like just did other things with my life I yeah he's like I didn't he's like and then they started saying this crazy [ __ ] but whatever okay whatever yeah he was like I was in Ohio that's where my my father's from there I was just hanging out with family right it's like you know the the Poise thing like when Mandela got locked up for whatever like he was like locked up for 30 years or something like that then he came out and like you know whatever solved the apart I don't know I don't know I don't know what history is he did something good for like you know black and people think he went to Mexico and he fished he was fishing with a bunch of mexic knows what he did but the thing that he said was badass he was like they were like you know aren't you angry or resentful at the people that put you in in jail for 20 30 years or whatever and he was like no I was preparing he I Was preparing for this and I was like that's awesome that's a cool way of saying it um Sean coming through big time this is the Shawn Pur episode that was a good good one from starting am I cultured now I think I'm cultur I think so I think the second you get props to Tracy Chapman and and Nelson medel I think that you are officially you've crossed the chasm my friend you know when you leave milk out for a while it becomes yogurt cultur that's what happened to me I just sat out for a while and it happened took you a couple dozen a few Dozen Years but you've officially you've crossed the threshold congratulations uh good job good pod if you're a fan of this you got to subscribe if you want more Tracy Chapman Stu but also the occasional joke about Mexican fisherman that we totally skipped over and don't understand the meaning of the story you got to subscribe uh that's the Pod [Music] thanks

your random tweet about your mother-in-law gets to him and he writes back dear Smithy sine both Bad Bath and Beyond and myself would like to invest in your business if these are your designs they are outstanding and then the best part and believe me I know [Music] pillows all right we're live Sean I've got three stories I want to tell you about to kick today's episode off you ready I'm ready first one years ago this is going to be fast years ago I was trying to get this one entrepreneur who is the CEO and founder of this very famous Media company that I'm I'm not going to call out and he ignored me he never got back to me I probably sent him 15 emails well I'm currently in Brooklyn staying at an Airbnb right now for a couple days not in Airbnb a different service and um visiting family and I log on to the nflix on the TV and guess whose house I'm renting right now that guy I am currently staying at his house right now should I do anything to like is there anything like should I look something up on YouTube so when he goes to his YouTube account he sees it like do the most the whatever the what is the most Petty thing you could do like just change his Wi-Fi password just send him for a loop he'll be like what what is happening right now I don't understand this so I'm in his house so I like go to I go to Netflix and I see his the image for like the or I go to some YouTube account or something and I see the image for like the thumbnail image for his account and I'm like I know this person and then I start picking up the other details I'm like oh he's logged into all the stuff I know exactly who this is so I'm gonna have to figure out a way to get his attention it's going to be borderline creepy regardless of how I do this even if I do it in the most tasteful way but I'm GNA take my shot I'm going to leave this guy a message it's not mean I'm very happy I'm happy but I'm going to leave him a m message hey man uh really love the place I'm trying to pee in the sink but there's no stool do you know where you keep it yes I'm G have to do something the second story that I've got to tell you about is that we need to get our people listening to this right now to subscribe we just crossed 400,000 followers you tweeted out that we're gonna make out when we get to a million is that right no I didn't say I did not say that I said specifically these other podcasters made out when they crossed 50k and it's a very uncom video watching them in slow-mo kiss and he's like the GU kissing they're kissing each other and one guy's like resisting it and the other guy's like trying to do the BET and he's like I'm just getting teeth there's just teeth can I can you can you move something I just I'm just getting a lot of teeth right now and by the way it's a finance podcast yeah and the video that they make out on it barely has any views and they never like it barely worked that is the funniest part of the whole thing was when I saw that the video has 25,000 views I was like my worst nightmare is not that I have to make out with you it's that I made out with you for the YouTube content didn't go anywhere which is exactly what would happen if I tried to you know oh this will definitely you know go viral and then it does it by the way there is a number for everything I don't know if a million subscribers is that number but please sub number ends in the word subscribers either I think the number have dollars instead of subscribers but there is a number so if you're listening on uh through the podcast apps just go ahead go to our YouTube And subscribe the the comment section is pretty fun we read every comment all right everyone a quick break to tell you about HubSpot and this one's easy because I'm going to show you an example of how I'm doing this at my company when I say I I mean not my team I mean I'm the one who actually made this so I've got this company called Hampton you can check it out join hampton.com it's a community for Founders and one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these surveys where we'll ask our members certain questions that a lot of people a lot of times people are afraid to ask so things like what their net worth is how their assets are allocated all these like interesting questions and then we'll put it in a survey and I went and made a landing page so you can check it out at join hampton.com wealth you can actually see the landing page that I made and the hard part with this is with Hampton we are appealing to a sort of a a higher-end customer sort of like like a Louis Vuitton or Ferrari so I needed the landing page to look a very particular way HubSpot has templates that's what we use we just change the colors a little bit to match our brand very easy they have this drag and drop version of their Landing Page Builder and it's super simple I'm not Technical and I'm the one who actually made it and once it's made I then shared it on social media and we had thousands of people see it and thousands of people who gave us their information and I can then see over the next handful of weeks this is how much revenue came in from this wealth survey that I did this is where the revenue came from so it came from Twitter it came from LinkedIn whatever it came from I can actually go and look at it and I can say oh well that worked that didn't work do more of that do less of that and if you're if you're interested in making landing pages like this I highly suggest it look I'm actually doing it but you can check it out go to the link in the description of YouTube and get started all right now back to MFM the third story I've got to tell you so I said this story a little bit I haven't given an update on it but about three years ago my mother-in-law who loves to sew she previously a long time ago like used to even sew wedding dresses and things like that for friends but uh now that her kids are grown and out of the house she starts sewing again she goes Sam I I think I want to start a business online can you like can I drive to the airport and uh you can like tell me how like the internet works basically and I gave her free ride to the airport sweet yeah yeah and I gave her like the most highlevel like advice ever so I I can't even remotely take credit for this because it was basically like well there's this thing called Shopify like that's basically what the advice was and like there's a thing called The Funnel where you get like this many eyeballs and a percentage of them buy whatever the most basic thing ever well 3 weeks after that she sends me this website I'm like Smithy this website looks beautiful is they named your company the same name that you were gonna name your company though what the hell and she goes that's my website and I'm like what she's like yeah in fact I already got my first sale uh and I was I was I was blown away well fast forward three years ago she's done over a million dollars in Revenue she's doing High six figures I think or she did High six figures in 23 and what's the store so it's a it's a pillow store right what is the name of it it's smithy's pillows or something so her birth name and the name of the store is slightly different so her name is Smithy but she smells her spells the store's name Smithy with a Y so the word Smith with a y at the end and then uh home the word home and then Co cotor so c u t r e if you go to her Etsy page that's where I think a lot of her sales come from you'll see on her Etsy page I think it's like 8,000 or 10,000 sales so basically what she sells is like really high-end throw pillows which is as a young man I was like throw pillows who the hell buys that well women love throw pillows do you see how does say how many sales cuz they're on the bed and then you have to throw them on the ground whenever you want to use the bed that's what is the name for I don't really understand this but I do see do you see that pillow you see that pillow you have behind you in that leather chair oh I got a throw over here okay you have a throw that's a throw pillow they're decorative fancy pillows 9,685 sales so that's how many transactions she's had or how many customers she's had check out so almost 10,000 star seller five star review very cool and then she so she's hand making these no yeah well she now she has a little wehouse in New Jersey and she's got like four ladies like sew it I just I just imagine her just like what was that movie where they like my fingers hurt from sewing well now your back's going to hurt you just got Landscaping Duty uh yeah she just has like these four like stome moms or I guess moms who aren't working anymore but like the sew and they have part-time work sew in these pillows and then she's got like the UPS guy coming to her office every day picking up these pillows she's got like a legit small business and I'm always like SMY scale scale scale spend more look at this uh the store if you go there every pillow says $2 under it and I'm like $2 this incredible deal then you go and it's like no $2 is for the Swatch sample if you want the pillow it's $79 so I think that's uh definitely bringing a lot of people in I like it it brings a ton of people in and uh they're great pillows I have them all over my house and people love them it's high quality stuff and so I'm like Smithy you got to grow this thing scale scale scale and she's like nope I'm really happy with how it's going and my my mother-in-law have you ever seen a photo of her no have you seen a photo of my mother-in-law no that's just not a thing people do well I tweeted out pictures of her I tweeted out pictures of her and so she's like a very pretty woman she like I call her like the Haitian Martha Stewart like she's always really well put together she just like dresses nice all the time so very charismatic like good energy type of person I tweeted out that story two days ago or maybe yesterday I tweeted out that story the Tweet got like viewed by like quarter of a million people but that guy Marcus from the propit what's his last name uh leonis something lonis he's now he's on that TV show The Profit I think he's the CEO and founder or CEO of camping world but does like a multi-billion dollar RV business and he's now on the board of directors at Bed Bath and Beyond so I think you just you said that whole sentence so casually like yeah I tweeted this out and then that guy Marcus from the propit replied do you know Marcus what what do you mean the guy from The Prophet replied like how did this even happen no idea I have no idea who he is I mean I know him as a celebrity I know him as a celebrity but I don't like I've never spoken to this person in my life your random tweet about your mother-in-law gets to him and he writes back dear Smithy sine right her her name yeah both Bed Bath and Beyond and myself would like to invest in your business if these are your designs they are outstanding and then the best part and believe me I know pillows and then the way that he originally communicated to me was he replied so he he tweeted that on his own like in front of his old audience of like 600,000 people he replied to my tweet and he goes um contact me I would love to sell this in Bad Bath meon and I I go here's my email he emails me it goes straight to spam for some reason so I'm thinking like this might be a what I don't know is this really you so anyway I connect him and now they're meeting and he shared it on his Twitter that he wants to like meet her pretty right so like I better be I I better get the [ __ ] will for this one I deserve something yeah you're gonna get like a loaf of pumpkin bread but um still pretty good yeah son-in-law of the Year Sam par I did not know that's what you were that was the New Year's resolution good good job this is crazy that it got picked up like that and good you know good for her this is such a cool story of you know how old is she right she's probably in her what like 50 yeah she's in her 50s and basically her you know uh my wife is uh uh 31 and then her other daughter's 27 and so she was just like my kids are grown I I've got time what what should I do and she loved to sew she always had an entrepreneurial Spirit her husband is an entrepreneur as well and she helped run their moving business and they were like let's uh you know my husband's retired I've got free time I got to figure out something and she she just starts sewing these pillows and she had the gumption to go and get this website built for like $3,000 like she found a developer to make the website she gets on Etsy and she I teach her when I say teach her I I don't actually teach her I was like yeah I think I bet I was like I bet you Etsy has a way that you could run like a hundred bucks worth of ads she runs like $100 worth of ads and gets a handful of customers and from there she spent no money basically on marketing I'm like how much you spending on marketing she's like 300 bucks I'm like a day she's like no no no like over the past like two months uh and I was like scale that suck her up baby and she's like nope I'm happy with the workload this is fine it's going good I like it and her customers are coming back and forth now what she does is she goes into all the door building or the in New York City there's Fancy highrises with Dorman and she goes to all those buildings and they're buying their her pillows to put in the lobbies of the so she's got like these like contracts wholes cont what I was going to ask you because most annoying thing in the world for me is any business story that's like I had this idea and then it worked it's it's like yo yo yo what about the middle part that I'm going to have to do of like getting it to work what what did you do how did you actually get the initial sales so do you know was it just post on Etsy and Etsy brought some traffic or did she sounds like maybe she went door to door and kind of was showing her product to some people well she did what she did what a lot of like she she she didn't do any like crazy hacks she basically had uh like 10 or 20 friends including me like buy her pillows at Cost through Etsy we left a review she started getting reviews she ran like I literally think it's $100 worth of ads the customers loved the pillows and they started telling their friends about it and it was mostly all word of mouth and then now she starts going to these dman buildings to get more sales but it was a very Word of Mouth business so like I'll be with her and like customers will call her and she'll just pick up her cell phone and just talk to them I mean it's it's like a small business where there's not really any hacks it's just been W to mouth dude so many amazing things about the story I'll tell you three of the amazing things number one that you tweeted this and it got in touch with uh the guy from Bed Bath and Beyond who's going to now get her to bed bath number two your mother-in-law in her 50s decides to like just like start a business become an entrepreneur that's the second most most impressive thing that she took the action and actually did it how many people do you know that would love to do it but count themselves out she didn't count herself out I really respect that number three um that she found her version of enough it's hard enough to win the even harder part is to actually enjoy the win and not let the win turn into a loss because you you start to stress out and try to keep up with the thing or try to grow it try to keep going because you feel some stupid pressure to keep going so being able to say no no no this is how I wanted my business to run on her terms even more respect for that and actually I got a fourth bonus one this guy saying and trust me I know pillows I am now gonna end every tweet with some version of that like if I'm like hey I really like this app and believe me I know a thing or two about apps like what a what a gangster just style of speaking I love this guy I'm totally stealing this you're G to see this my next 10 tweets I'm going to end like that it's like when Trump used to end twet with like the emotion like instead of emojis he would be like you know the border is not safe sad point he would always end his tweets like that well it's kind of smart to this guy this guy probably has no idea who you and I are and he doesn't give a [ __ ] but he probably saw the engagement of the tweet and he's like well if I could like pounce on this and just get like a little bit of like interesting press like this could or not real press but get impressions like it could be worth it to them and who knows if I told Smithy I was like have your hopes love like who knows if this is going to work out it's a huge company even though he's on the board or whatever he is like that doesn't mean anything's going to happen I don't think you need to be given her advice anymore I think she needs to be giving you advice from now on well I agree I agree with that I was it was a little more therapist session although she doesn't need that but it was more like oh who knows you know I don't want you don't get your hopes up all right well Sam makes the will congratulations dude yes congratulations to me I have a a bunch more interesting stuff do you want do you want me to dive in yeah yeah give me another one there's these ads I've been getting and it's buy this company called mad muscle so you actually it might be easier if you just go to Facebook ad library and type in Mad muscle and they have these animations it's the it's a popular ad I see all the time where it's these cartoon looking guys one picture is like a guy with kind of a beer belly at 20% body fat and then a guy that's ripped at 10% and like it's very eye-catching ads that grab your attention and they have got these other ads where it's like a guy doing a bicep curl very catchy ads they're very catchy ads I get this ad like crazy and so I was curious who's behind it and I found an very interesting thing I do this with every ad that's catchy I go to the website I scroll all the way to the bottom where it says like trademark and then it say like the real name of the company and then I'll research the company so check this out there's these two guys in Ukraine they started this company when they were 25 their name is Ivan and Demitri originally the company was called well the whole holding company is called Amo Soo but they've got three arms of the business and the first part of the business was Amo publishing listen to these numbers so they kind of created like these these uh little click baity like news websites and then again eventually they geared it toward moms and so they have headlines like elderly couple divorces after 53 years of marriage later man sees ex-wife dating in a cafe and it's an article then they switch to Facebook videos and they get crazy viral and so at this point they have 53 million followers on Facebook they have this thing called Amo Mama which has 14 million they have Amo Nostalgia they have Amo news it's almost sort of like I guess you could say like a [ __ ] Jerry where it's like a social first news company they get huge they get 53 million followers from there they create this thing called Amo pictures years or not years ago but a few months ago you mentioned these guys have soap operas on YouTube and that is exactly what Ivan and Demitri pivoted to next so they created this YouTube channel called dramatize me dramatize me has 2.4 million subscribers and 500 million views so a lot and the average video is something like 20 or 30 minutes and these it's these actors like acting out a soap opera and you could you could tell that a lot of the stuff is dubbed so they film it one time and then they have uh dramatized me in different in different languages and so they have different page for each for each uh language from there they started launching these apps and so their first big app that they launched it was to help women exercise on their periods which I guess when you're menstrating I guess like you feel crappy and you don't want to work out they created an app that helps you do that that's got to be the hardest sale to make it's like yo what kind of extra degree of difficulty did they take as an entrepreneur it's like we are going to help somebody do something they don't want to do right at the time that they don't want to do it wow yeah I don't know I you know I I obviously I don't understand that that how that feels but I guess there is a need then they launched this thing called yamal which is a healthy meal plan app that costs $20 a week so clearly they must have high churn if they're charging $20 a week right off the bat and then from there they create mad muscles which is the thing that I saw so their website this website for Mad muscles according to similar web is getting 11 million visits a month it's insane wow 500,000 followers on Instagram and the app has 35,000 reviews and so these young guys they started this company when they were 25 uh just like four or five years ago according to LinkedIn they now have close to 400 employees in Ukraine these young guys that nobody at least in America is talking about have this massive media Empire in the middle of Ukraine and they are like the scrappiest people that I've ever seen because they're just like Laing stuff and they're like oh that works let's do this spinoff oh looks like they all have a similar problem they want I guess to work out we have we have a lot of middle-aged women they want to work out on their periods let's create this thing oh looks like workout apps was cool let's create one for men and they are like it this is an example of what we've talked about many times of these just like Scrappy people who just they're I don't want to say soulless because that sounds negative but they just follow the numbers like crazy and they don't overthink it what what's that Meme that you were talking about the other day it's called like the the mid whip meme which is like the in the middle it's like create a beautiful product study the market whatever y y y the one on the left with is the idiot it's like H Just Launch it and just keep iterating and just do whatever the customers say and the you know the smart person also says that launch it and see what works yeah that's exactly what they're doing these guys it's are it's so fascinating how they're running their company this is a crazy find good on you props Sam with a s par special finding the random app in the Ukraine or this company I am impressed and Confused I'm impressed because clearly these guys are awesome and they're smart and they're figuring stuff out and they've built a really cool set of products and uh what looks like a pretty cool company um I'm confused because I'm like they are doing four separate hard things at the same time and I'm confused about that strategy but you know this is actually pretty common when it comes to to startups in Eastern Europe I I've actually seen this several times which is because they don't have a lot of venture capital it's like bootstrap driven and so they make businesses that are working and one business like unlocks the next or they discover the next opportunity or maybe one Taps out but it's still good enough to stay as a business and so they end up with this like conglomerate of like four different things and I've seen this like 10 times now so I'm actually not surprised that this is what's happened here but to go from publishing to then their pictures arm which is like you know their their Hollywood arm or whatever that's making movies and and shows or whatever to apps you know like those are not related really like you can kind of squint and be like oh we use the media to promote our apps okay cool but what about these like YouTube shows like or just in general like maybe just spend money on Facebook ads and don't do all the other stuff so I am I'm simultaneously impressed and confused by this well first of all I was not able to find any news about them there was just like even in Ukraine and Russia there was very little information about them I'm like what is going on this app has 35,000 reviews I can't find anything about them I had a search to find the owner I eventually found their LinkedIn uh profiles but it was really really hard and whenever I that happens I'm like all right I'm interested I gotta figure this out you can tell how successful an entrepreneur is like there's many ways let's say I said Sam I'm gonna give you an hour locked in a room with this entrepreneur you have to figure out if they're going to be successful or not or how successful they're going to be and there's many questions you could ask them there's many uh you know like you know ways you could quiz them to try to see if they're good or bad but one signal that just really never fails if you go to their um like videos their pictures um section and you go look at some of the thumb uh the titles and thumbnails for some of their things it's exactly what you talked about and people who do this these people never lose so here's the first one because they don't give a [ __ ] girl send girl sent selfies to her boss and that she's looking like worried next one gender reveal went wrong question mark third one right like grandpa in the gym dot dot dot nailed it and it's like these are things that human nature must click and must watch to find out how the payoff is and this is like universally broadly um appealing content right people love to hear see the heartwarming thing or the gossipy thing or the like you know the major screw up in some high stake situation those are things that people have to watch and you know that if somebody is creating content like this it's just a matter of time until they create a product that goes mainstream because they understand what makes people tick and what's going to get the click and what's going to get the conversion and eventually they'll stop making silly videos or they stop writing you know funny tweets or posting on a meme Instagram page and they'll work on a bigger product and I see this all the time I see this with younger people but just in general um if you're running that that goofy uh you know like a Tik Tok account that's going viral it makes no money but you figured out how to get people to watch your videos what makes people click eventually that's the same person that's going to have that really successful D Toc brand or create that app that goes you know to the top of the charts because they just get it when it comes to human nature well I remember when um I first started the hustle we we got 50,000 subscribers in a short amount of time and Tim Chen was the founder of nerd wallet nerdwallet's now a publicly traded company they write like articles for the best credit card or whatever and he was like Hey I want to invest and I'm like you don't even I was like dude I don't even know like how we're going to make money and he was like well look I know enough to know that if you're good at getting an audience making money off that is actually easier and I was like what what are you talking about like this this wasn't that hard to do he's like well it's hard for many people and nerdwalt is kind of that that answer where it took them three years to get to like I think five million or something like that in Revenue but in year four they got to like 30 million in Revenue because it took them three years to rank and Google for people searching best credit card it's one of the hardest terms to to rank for and now I as I've grown and I've understood this that if you can get an audience and you can get eyeballs as long as they're ideally it's a math equation where it's like you want it's like a the equation would be like values equals the amount of influence you have over them times their spending power multiplied by uh the amount they're willing to spend uh if you can like do maximize that equation you can build a big business and actually making the product often times is easier than getting the audience 100% And um people who understand how to get an audience they're going to win it's the same way that uh when I meet people who are like Elite at a video game like a like a a hard a worldwide video game it's just a matter of time till they're fatigued of that game and they decide to play the next game called business and guess what the same you know willingness to grind ability to F figure out the meta strategy ability to coordinate and collaborate with their team and communicate at very fast speed like that's all going to work once they once they just pick a different game um so it's like you know that or the the sneaker flippers the eBay flippers you know when we started this podcast it's called my first million I was interviewing people how' you make your first million and one of the things I always asked them my one of my favorite questions is if I had you know if I was filming a documentary of you back when you were 13 12 13 do you think I would have known that maybe you would go on to do such interesting things like was there anything would I have seen at that time you were doing something unusual for a 13 14y old and at first the reac is like no I was just a normal kid but then you ask you're like so what were you doing for fun and they're like well actually I was uh you know my neighbor had these extra golf clubs and uh so I actually realized that you could sell them on eBay and so I was I would go to old people's houses I would knock on the door ask if I could see their golf clubs and I would buy their golf clubs to go flip them on eBay you're like okay it's just just a matter of time until you elevate from flipping golf clubs to whatever it is SAS software whatever whatever the next the bigger game is but that's like such a high like likelihood of success are so highly correlated with with success um for people who have that background all right let me can I go can I give you one more we're GNA do one more a little small business one yeah let's do it all right so go to this website called it's dumpster enterprises.com all right so should I is this sa for work okay here we go it's safe it's exactly what it sounds like so this guy joined Hampton and I saw that his uh company was called dumpster Enterprises and I was like dude what the hell is this tell me everything about this and so I was like we're on the record I want to talk about this in the Pod so whatever you tell me is that okay and he's like yeah I I would love to do it so I got his permission and so this guy named Ian uh his background is basically that he he learned a little bit about SEO and web design and he started making like just a handful of like how to make money websites and it was like H this is all kind of only going okay and so he like randomly met this guy because he was trying to rent this guy Ian was trying to rent a dumpster and he started like looking up the best like vendors to find in order to bring like a dumpster to his house we're talking like dumpsters when you move like you want a little bit of a bigger dumpster to that you keep for like two weeks and he meets this guy and he's like dude I don't know how to do any of this SEO stuff but I know all these vendors that are similar to me and this guy's Ian like well can I have the vendors and maybe we can work out a deal where I'll like pay you for like giving me this vendor list and so he does that and so after two years he builds this website called dumpster enterprises.com and if you scroll down to the uh our notes document this guy was pretty crazy he gave me his full p&l for 2023 and I was like can I can I read this he's like yeah I don't care so he gave me his full p&l so in year two of the business he did $2.1 million in Revenue and the way that the business works is he ranks a little bit on search it looks like he only spent $26,000 in U advertising and marketing so he's not spending that much money on ads but some money in ads and so he did 2.1 million in revenue and the way his business works is you type in which area code or zip code you need a dumpster in and then he forwards that lead to a handful of vendors or dumpster providers that he has vetted they pay him let's say $100 for that lead he's able to profit 50 because that's how much it costs him to get the leads and he made about it looks like he paid himself but the business also made about $280,000 in profit and he was like this is a business it didn't take me a long time to set up he goes I I work a few hours a day and I travel a lot and it's like it's a very it's kind of a a business that's been on cruise control a little bit but I saw this and I was like dude there's a freaking business built in every Niche that I never even would have thought and so this is like a little little example people in our YouTube comments criticized us for talking about like big companies billion dollar100 million dollar companies I wanted to give an example of an interesting small business we've done that twice smiy uh home Couture and now dumpster rental Enterprises this is super cool this is a a good blueprint by the way we've seen this now several times here as we've been doing the pod which is you take a industry that is well established and local like it could be dumpster rentals it could be um you know uh Road painting or parking lot painting it could be senior living facilities where they need customers but the typical owner of those businesses knows nothing about SEO or sem and if you just say cool I'll create the website that just does the lead gen for whatever it is and you're like I'll bid on the Google keywords I'll create the easy to use website I'll grab the customer contact info and then I will pass you the lead and you're going to pay me some fixed amount per lead that's it's just a blueprint we've seen work over and over again and it works even better the higher the ticket right so like Senior Living For example the people who people will end up spending hundreds of thousands in rent over you know a three or four year time period of of of you renting a bed in in a facility or pool construction it's like a you know $30,000 project or something like that and so we had a friend you and I had a friend or I don't know if you knew him Dave gplat he had swimmingpool quotes.com and he was making 2 million a year getting and it was basically like he only made his money four months out of the year and so the the other months he would just chill without having to do the swimming pool stuff right he's not actually going and doing the thing right it's like the that quote you know like the biggest taxi company taxi company in the world owns no taxis the biggest hotel company in the world owns no hotels like Airbnb or Uber well the medium the medium siiz the most medium po pool Mogul makes no pools builds no pools um and so you know High ticket and then if that how old school that industry is so how much of it is Mom and Pop operators who don't know how to do Google ads and don't know how to do SEO and that Arbitrage right there is like such a formula for a510 million do business that you can build by yourself working you know very it's a very good lifestyle business it's not hard work you don't need a big team you don't need a lot of funding you don't need any of that but sometimes they can be huge so I've been doing research in this industry for a long time because I was obsessed with Trucking I I talked about a ton I almost went into that business business and there's a bunch of people who are doing it for Trucking meaning uh the trucking industry truckers right yeah so the trucking industry has a huge short there's a a shortage of people who have their commercial driver's license and so if you can get someone who has their commercial dri's license and send them to a trucking company they give you this massive bers fee but the biggest industry that I found that this works in is lawyers so I found there's like a site called like superlawyers.com that's owned by Thomas reuter it's a huge multi-billion dollar tens billions of dollar company but there was like a lot of the early web 1.0 businesses that I looked up were Affiliates or leaden businesses for lawyers because if you look at what the most expensive and this is how you know it's a big industry you can just go to Google Keyword finder I forget what it's called now but it used to be called keyword finder you could type in the word lawyer and it will tell you how much you have to pay in order to get a click from Google for the word lawyer now if you type in something even crazier like mesophila lawyer it's like ,000 a click meaning only 5% of those will close so this company's having to spend I I can't do that math because I'm an idiot tens of thousands of dollars in order to acquire a client who wants to sue someone or whatever for mesophila issues like it has the highest cost per click I've seen is lawyer related and I I've seen multiple of these Leen companies for lawyers that are doing hundreds of millions in Revenue Leen yeah incredible business blueprint that uh really if you just have one skill you just need to figure out the niche to apply it in the one skill being you know sem search engine marketing and how do you use that search engine Marketing in a field where the people who run those businesses aren't great at it and if you can just become great at it it's it's a big winner there um I gotta ask you do you have you seen this apple Vision Pro thing man what do you think about this I haven't tested it yet but I've seen it uh what do I think of it um on one hand I have I have the Boomer ality of like this is sad this sucks we're all going to be in this but on the other hand I'm like it's pretty sick like they push they push the envelope it's pretty cool I think I think it's kind of cool knowing that the current version is going to be the worst version that ever comes about and that first version is pretty seems pretty awesome pretty dope yeah yeah what do you think one to 10 how bad do you want one uh I don't want to own one so not at all but uh nine out of 10 I I want to go to the Apple store and try one what what are you um yeah I didn't buy one and like the bar for me to buy something is pretty low like I'm a pretty impulse driven person like if I'm just curious I'll just usually get something it's not an Impulse impulse buy p uh price it's not but like you know I I kind of justify anything that's in you know trying new tech that that's kind of my that's kind of my job to do to do things like that so so I don't do that but I've been I have three VR headsets already sitting in the corner of my room just staring at me like really bro you're going to get another one of these um and each one I tried them on I was like wow this is so impressive all right again that's enough I guess I'll put this down and never put it back on and that's what's happened to me with every VR headset so I'm afraid that that's what's gonna happen with this I did watch a bunch of the videos I use my Oculus for hours a day on the day that I bought it right yeah every time I use it I use it for four hours it's just goes one time did you watch the Casey neistat like review video so good so he goes he puts it on and he's like I'm so excited about this he walks around New York and he basically goes on the subway and he goes to Time Square and then he goes to like a Crispy Cream and he's using it and he made a great video about it which is less like let me review the the features and be like H how good is the field of view is it 110 degrees the right number he doesn't do all that he's just like I actually want to just like use this for fun and go see like you know what it feels like and um it seems like everybody's takeaway is kind of the same which is kind of a magical experience you feel like you got a glimpse of the future but it's only a glimpse this isn't the future yet and but you see like oh okay five years from now this thing is going to be incredible because they're going to solve all these annoying problems it's going to become lighter weight they're going to get rid of this cord that's a battery that I have to put in my pocket while I'm using it they're going to make it so that I can see my phone while I'm using this if I want to it's going to be a small as a pair of glasses exactly and so that's pretty exciting um but it did remind me of something that I think is forget the Apple Vision Pro for a second because you know whatever it's just a device um there's an incredible blog post that this reminded me of and I think that this blog post is one of if I if I had a Mount Rushmore of blog posts that informed my way of thinking as an entrepreneur this is one of them and it's this post by Paul buite who is the creator of Gmail and the blog post I think is called if you're great you don't have to be good and what he's talking about was the iPad came out so the IP he wrote this right the day after the iPad was announced or released and all of the reviews were crushing Apple being like iPad what a what a flop right they're announcing this big deal but this thing it doesn't doesn't have a keyboard doesn't have a USB port you can't even do this with it you can't do this with it and he the guy who wrote the blog post makes a point he goes um people said the same thing about Gmail when we first came out and he's like we didn't have time to do certain things so he's like for example a dress book he's like we didn't have time to build it and so we shipped it without it and people were just killing us like oh my God this doesn't even have an address book oh it doesn't even have this it doesn't have this and he's like uh we thought oh man we might fail because of this he's like but what saved us and the same thing that's going to save the iPad is that when you like a hit product is not a hit product because it's good in every category it's a hit product because it's amazing it's great in one to three categories and he's like we he's like for Google for Gmail we were like cool we're going to do I don't remember what what they were exactly but I think it was like unlimited storage or like just like 10x more storage than the previous email provider well hot mail was giving you like hot mail was giving you 20 megabytes these guys were giving you like you know two gigabytes he's like the second thing was um super fast search so you could find any email so he's like even though we didn't have your address book if you just typed in somebody's name you'd immediately find the last email from them and that you could just use that email uh you know to to contact them again he's like in the last thing was like threaded conversations he's like you know basically the ability for each email not to just be its own thing but like every reply in one email thread you can just see it all together and he's like we just wanted to be great at those three things and we delivered we were great at those three things and it worked even though we were missing these things that the experts all told us we you know we would get slammed for he's like the iPad is the same way he goes the iPad does not have those ports it doesn't have the USB it can't connect to keyboard you can't do all this right now he's like you know what it's amazing at it is great in that if you turn on your computer it takes like a minute and a half to get to like being able to use a computer like it has to boot up and has to go to the login he's like with an iPad you literally click the button and it's ready for you to use instantaneous he's like number two it's great for watching videos on your couch it's like you can't it's not super good for productivity right now but man is it amazing just to hold be able to walk around with a screen that you can watch videos on he's like it's 10x better than the previous way and so I kind of when I looked at this apple Vision Pro there was a bunch of people that were like oh it can't do this and it can't do that and what I've learned is don't discount something because of those like kind of those limitations like basically find does it have any extreme strengths because if it has a couple of extreme strengths it's actually going to be a winner well does it there's this one ad that I think shows one of the extreme strength um watch that ad for a [Music] second yeah it's awesome so basically you see everyone else on their iPhone on a small screen and then they on an airplane across the rows on an airplane and then you see a guy with the Apple VIs Pro and it's at you you see what he's seeing and it's a movie theater he's watching a Napoleon and it looks like he's in a movie theater where everyone else is looking at a little three-inch screen exactly he's and so you think about what is the what is this thing great at because that's the signals of like is this gonna work is this the future or is it not I think one that you can identify is the ability to like why would you ever go to a movie theater if you had one of these really because you can have a even better than movie theater experience you're at home it's a full screen like everything you can see is the screen and even better you can like actually like change the surroundings you could be in the jungle with the theater or you could be on or you know in this case you could be sitting on an airplane and have the theater come to you are you imagining somebody in a jungle what I me with that was like you can change the scenery behind in the the thing but in this case it's where he's actually sitting is on an airplane where like nobody else can see what he's seeing so it's private which is cool because I hate kind of on an airplane when like you're working or whatever ever you're typing emails and the person next you could just read everything um so it's it's private I sat next to a guy on the airplane and he was an old guy and so his the text on his phone was huge yeah and I could see him talking to his assistant and I could see his name and I looked him up on Wikipedia and it was a famous producer and I'm like oh makes sense this producer lives in this city where I'm leaving from and so like I understood I knew like all about this guy just from seeing his text messages is weird so I think private private video is one way that this is great I think this second way that's great is like the theater experience I think the third is like any sports or Concert Experience so being able to sit Courtside and watch an NBA game with this thing from home it's like you take a $50,000 experience that only the richest of the rich can have and now anybody's gonna be able to have it with this and that I think is super super cool and I think there's a bunch of reasons why this thing is not great yet but I think that is is amazing I'm such a neck beard that like Sarah wanted to go to like Greece or something to like see whatever the famous stuff they have there and I just looked it up on street view and I was like got it it's it's all right like is that beautiful you have your camera take a picture and this would make it so much better I'm just not gonna leave my house ever again um no I think the I think it's gonna be cool I I just don't want I don't want to I don't have a need to own one yet but the flight thing actually is pretty convincing yeah that and I was like what an example of an ad that one ad is like 15 seconds there's no words there's no dialogue and it sells the thing for you right like that was the most convincing ad I've seen about this whole thing um more convincing than all the reviews and it was 15 seconds with no no words dude they crush it man Apple crushes it on those things um all right let me give you a quick followup so this followup is very well you'll see in a second but basically do you remember when we talked about about uome I feel like you talk about uome every fourth episode now what's going on with uome so uome they I talked about it in April of 2021 so it's been a few years so uome was launched uh I don't actually know when I think 2014 or so they started out actually as a Kickstarter and Indiegogo thing and the whole thing was that you pay 80 bucks and you send them a piece of your poop and they look at your poop and they tell you all about your your gut which I guess you can find illnesses through your poop and it was started by these three people but two of them eventually started dating and got married Well turns out they it was all well first of all they raised from Andre and horowits they raised from YC from 8 VC so they raised in September 2018 they raised $100 million at a $600 million valuation from white combinator as well from the best investors there are turns out it was all a scam and like their tests were nonsense and the way that it worked was basically they you would send them your poop they sent you back [ __ ] results [ __ ] results bad results that they like weren't legit yeah pun uh they they just completely made it up but then what they would do is they would Bill your insure $3,000 and so in doing this they made roughly $35 million from insurance companies so was insurance fraud because it was bull crap test and then they the the two husband and wife couple they sold $12 million worth of their shares well fast forward a few years after they raised their funding their office gets raid by the FBI and turns out the whole company was a fraud it was one big fraud it was nonsense and I was curious as to what happened to the founders I was like man did they get sentenced yet because I know that they were definitely were guilty um turns out they fled to Germany and here's the update to this to the case in the story that we did in 21 they're still on the lamb they're they're they're International felons in Germany they've never been caught totally worked crime does pay they did not get in trouble that's the update to the story I was curious I was like I was like what happened to these guys where are they now they're just chilling in Germany for some reason they got away with it they're about to get like a Netflix deal on top of it yeah they've completely gotten away with it nothing bad has happened to them they got the money they ran away and they're happily they're happily married and it worked in love Rich living in Europe it's an extended honeymoon they completely got away with it is that insane yeah that's crazy also I feel like Germany is not like the place I think about when I'm like they ran away and you know hid in some country and got away with it it's like German I feel like Germany should be able to like he should be able to find not like you know some small Island somewhere well I was reading their Wikipedia and at the bottom of the intro it said like they currently are international F fugitives living living in Germany and it said they have no intention of coming back to America like yeah duh duh and do you think how do they know they're living in Germany still like wouldn't they just leave if it's gery I I don't know I don't know but they know that they're in Germany and they've completely gotten away with it so they've raised $100 million they stole 35 million from insurance companies so we're talking $150 million close to uh they they know they're in Germany and they're just chilling they they've gotten away with it one of the most successful Indiegogo projects of all time is it really yeah given the outcome money marriage money love Fame great European lifestyle did you see that uh crypto documentary on Netflix about remember the uh the uh what was it called what Ico scam that these uh like two Brooklyn kids did in uh like 2020 remember that uh I didn't watch the the I know what you're talking about I didn't watch that one what was it called uh or what was their scam called I have no idea I just saw the Netflix like trailer that's all I saw I remember seen like 20 crypto scam movies and I'm like I think I'm good on that category for a little while well we were making fun of them because we were like no I don't want to give my I don't want to invest in any person who says they've got some amazing technology and they've got Perfect Teeth a red Ferrari and abs and we we were talking about this guy and obviously it was clearly a scam they paid Floyd May Mayweather to uh endorse it they paid uh what's that guy DJ khed to endorse it it was like clearly a scam and this founder of ubam Jessica Richmond her background Stanford Oxford Google and McKenzie it's crazy right by the way she lied about her age so on her like everyone was like dude you're not 30 you look 50 and her weight too no she completely lied about her age like it was like a known Secret in Silicon Valley at the time that this woman because she was no I know what it was she made Forbes 30 under 30 and everyone was like dude you are not under 30 years old that's that's hilarious the 43y old on the forbs 30 30 yeah she everybody um on their about us page on the Indi Yogo each person has like their back like where they went to school and then some people like so for her she's got Stanford Oxford Google Mackenzie but for other people they don't have like four impressive things they just went to undergrad and then that was it so they just added like random taglines under them so it's like Jennifer from customer care cool Under Pressure yeah no [ __ ] next Samantha customer care appetite for knowledge another one hunger for fraud just yeah absolutely no conscience great at hiding and you could like look Google her name and you could kind of see some pictures where she's not wearing makeup and she's just like a it's like a normal photo that's not like a press photo at the time of a lot of these photos I think she was supposed to be 29 years old and if you look at some of these like YouTube videos of her so there's a YouTube video in 2016 of her and I think at this time she was supposed to be like 28 she looks 40 she could be even higher than 40 it's obviously that this woman or it's obvious that this woman is not I'm an old soul and people are like no you're just old talking yeah it's like you are an old soul you're an old body too I mean everything yeah you're not under 30 this is crazy yeah that's a real yes and yes you are an old soul and also so she married the co-founder yeah the guy with the beard they like fell in love and got married and and now they're it's like they're Bonnie and Clyde it's just crazy they got away from we hopefully have someone who's listening to this has worked there can actually give us Insight but I looked for like any type of like update on this story that I could find and everyone just says yeah they're just hanging out in Germany they're just I mean it sounds like they're living a normal life and they completely got away with it the haters all said it was a fraud and the haters are right shout out to the haters yeah it says uh listen to this it says there's a headline says the poop testing startup founder who lied to get on the 30 under 30 list is now officially a fugitive uh yeah and so like guess everyone knew that she it was nonsense oh by the way here's her age she's 47 she's 47 years old and two years before that when she was 45 she was on Forbes 30 under 30 that's a caper man the husband I mean he just gets wrecked in this statement says defense lawyers have informed the government that Richmond is suffering from a serious medical condition and API is her caretaker I mean it's like you go to a party for the first time with your with your girlfriend and she's like oh yeah this is my uh this is my friend Sean my friend what and they're probably just and he's like yeah he's like he's like all [ __ ] up man he's [ __ ] all over himself he's in a wheelchair this guy's he's he's in a horrible spot you guys should see this mess he looks disgusting um I think we should do an annual update on these guys actually let's mark it down the calendar every February 7th we should just update still on the Run crime still pays I guess it is it is insane did Sam bankman free get sentenced yet dude I don't know I feel like the last thing I heard was like oh they just like removed five counts like real quick just like on a Friday news dump when other stuff was going on it was kind of BS yeah he's I think he's actually not going to serve a lot of time and then Holmes Elizabeth Holmes how much time did she get was it nine well she kept having babies and was like I can't go to jail I'm pregnant and they're like man you just keep like you just you can't keep this you can't have leave from prison like you can't just keep staying out of prison that way and So eventually she had to go by the way this is hilarious the wal stre J reporter um described the efforts by the newspaper to track them down believing to believing that they live somewhere in Central Berlin and it basically says they located a b a building that was used for um like the postal address for them and they were getting mail there however they were unable to find where they were actually living so I think it's the the building is in Germany that may now be where they're actually living which would uh that feels more right that that we don't know exactly where they are as they're on the Run maybe maybe who knows um but that's the update we're g to come back to it in a year dude they should just tra her they should do like a Honeypot they're like okay how do we get how do we get her uh we need her ego it needs to be like we're having a contest for the like you know 40 under 40 Berlin and it's like they know she's going to throw her hat in the ring she just can't resist she she's like I need the recognition yeah dude I watch Cops all the time that's my favorite show and one of the ways that they catch guys who have warrants is they mail them a thing that says you won free Yankees tickets you have to come you have to come pick it up at this location that's like a famous way to have you ever seen that no but they do is kind of the same thing yeah and they'll get like yeah and they'll get like 30 of these uh guys with warrants in like a ballroom they go everyone all right we're g you guys are all the lucky winners of the Yankees tickets congratulations here they are and then the police swarm in and arrest everyone and they do like a it's like a big thing yeah that's what they need to do with her as a uh a 35 or 35 and there's gonna get 34 dummies to come in to win this award and right they're gonna Honeypot this lady you shouldn't be allowed to lie like that though I mean shouldn't be allowed to lie about winning free tickets I I'm against that I'm all for catching these guys you shouldn't be able to get someone's hopes up like that damn that's harsh you know the cops can can lie about anything like for example if they're interrogating you and they're like all right we're going to turn off the camera this is off the Record it's never off the Record theyve got other like voice recorders in there they can lie police can lie about anything or they could say like we have your DNA there they're allowed to say that you could say anything you want yes you can say anything You' be like look here's uh this ZIP this bag we've got a hair of yours we found this at the crime scene yeah they could you could say anything you want so they can lie to you you can't lie to them they can lie to you correct an officer is allowed to lie like when you're when you're at when you're getting booked they 100% can lie to you rough it's a rough world out there all right I don't know where to end it but that's the PO all right that's the [Music] pod
