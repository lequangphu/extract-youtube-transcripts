well i remember we were drinking we were drinking water a little paper cup we were at this burrito place and you were like if uh if i could buy this cup for five cents and sell it to you for seven cents that's my passion yeah i feel like i can rule the world i [Music] episode the guest from episode 2 which was one of the best episodes ever of this podcast and then it was taken down for a bit i don't know what happened there was something we got to take down make a little edit people started hitting me up hey what happened to ramone's episode that's how much people cared they wanted to know that people were just keep attracted to that episode still in the library something happened some people noticed which was amazing to me and now you're twitter famous yeah as of today well because of you and sam yes because as of today because you and sam retweeted me and i got like almost 8 000 followers overnight i went from 2 000 to 11 000 uh within 24 hours so wow okay well it's not just because we retweeted i retweeted a lot of stuff you told a great story uh i'm just actually gonna i'm gonna find the hook here uh because you did a good job did sam write this for you uh or did you have him edit this because this was so well done i felt like you can't this can't be your first thread and you started off this good on your first thread how did that happen no well it's sam dripping off the whole uh tweet so sam actually helped me um okay this one would work this is the concept this is a little bit like how you format it then he gave a little bit like i would start with this i will do this and i will explain that uh then of course i you know explained it and then um so what's the difference this looks great how would you have started it normally and then i'll show i'll read what what the end result was what would you have normally said or what do you remember what your v1 might have been yeah well like you you and i are friends so you also know me personally sam too is like typically i would not start off with like i bought something for just little as x and now we're doing why uh i will not to brag yes and um but you know sam said like no that's you need to do that um and you know it's true as well right so why not just uh explain it that that's what people get people interested um and you know now i think we have seven thousand likes and a bunch of thousands here's what you're saying you said two and a half years ago i bought a dog ramp business for three hundred thousand dollars already interesting what the heck is the dollar grant business since then i've sold 35 million dollars of dog ramps boom that's the the hook right um yeah you know this little thing turned into a big thing and then the promise why you should read this thread i'm going to explain why i bought it how i scaled it and why i bought a business versus starting from scratch but first dog ramps question mark and then that is and then the little hand pointing down like come read more that is uh you didn't take my power writing class but that is exactly what you would have been my star student in this if you had done this as the example because it has all three elements right so it has the what i call the frame i bought it for 300k and i've sold 35 million so that's the wow factor why should i pay attention to this and why do i stop scrolling right so you have a scroll stopping number 35 million dollars of dog rams you have a curiosity gap which is what the heck is a dog ramp and how did this guy do it and then you have a promise which is i'm going to tell you a b and c but first dog ramps which is like you you give them a lightweight entry way that they they have even if they don't want to know how you bought it while you scale it all the operational stuff i do need to know what the heck dog ramps what the heck and so uh beautifully done and then you tell the story and the story is kind of amazing because people know that i people know that i don't talk about what my e-commerce business is but they know that i have an ecommerce business what they don't know is that it started because we were hanging out in your backyard and we were talking and the whole time we're talking uh your phone is just going to ching it's like the i didn't even know what this was it's the shopify shopify's like notification sound and um you didn't even notice it because it's always just normal to you your phone was sitting on the table and i was like do you need to get that like what is that sound and you go oh sorry that's like sales and i was just like you know people love this idea of make money while you sleep like passive income oh make money while you sleep that is a sexy idea this was this is even better it was like you were just chilling and having fun and money was just being made for you on the side and just like a little cha-ching every five minutes and it was literally in that moment i was like i'm gonna do this i'm gonna start an e-commerce business because i can't sit here and just let remote have all the fun this is too good so you inspired me to do it for sure that's awesome yeah i had to turn off that notification uh because it drove me crazy eventually like uh cheating teaching every time there's a cell uh but it was fun in the beginning i was really like almost like that uh you know endorphin release each time yeah exactly um and if you're on youtube if you're watching the youtube channel which is just i don't know what is it youtube.com my first million i think or hustlecon something like that just search my first million on youtube you'll find it but you can see the ramp behind ramone so he's got the uh all the products behind you so the company's called alpha paw that's your thing so we're gonna talk about uh a couple different things i thought it'd be fun to have you on your substitute teacher for sam and like any substitute teacher the class always has more fun when the sub comes in uh so so that's what we're going to do i think we're going to talk about a couple things i want to talk to you about kind of uh buying and selling buying businesses rather than starting businesses so how you do it and we'll go through some examples maybe of what's out there and then we'll jump back and we'll dig into kind of like your story so uh how the heck you got started but i first want to give the the the people and myself really kind of a crash course on this process of buying businesses because i was amazed when you told me you bought this business for 300 000 and did you buy this off of flippa or quiet light or where'd you had to buy this this one um yeah i bought this on a similar broker like quite light uh they're not around anymore but it was a similar broker uh not as flippa but it's uh it's more of a broker and when you bought it i was sort of like what the heck like who does that i didn't even know anybody who does like off these like random websites like i can see you buying something for a few thousand dollars but 300 grand i thought was a lot and i was like dog ramps what the heck and you had told me then that uh you're like yeah the business is doing good and the person really wasn't doing any marketing or they didn't run any facebook ads i think was the case and so you just saw like a clear clear growth level so break it down like what is your why do you do this and then how do you do this buying businesses thing yeah um like i me personally i think it's also like what's your personal preference what's your skill set some people are really good at going from zero to one are really builders others are really good at going from one to ten and those are you know scalars uh i'm not really good at building i'm better at scaling and so i like to buy versus build because it gives you a lot more speed it gives you history and data and it's similar like real estate where i try to find um crappy houses that you need to fix up but in a good up and coming neighborhood if that makes sense right right like you know like okay yes good market there's a market fit you know if this house was amazing you would be able to rent this out for two three four times more than the current uh owner does uh it's the same with with website so i look for websites that have a good product mix uh product fit um has history uh it doesn't have to be you know going really well i'm not looking for websites that are overly optimized so i tend to not buy websites from other internet marketers uh because they already did all the things that i probably would do for it so it's not really room for growth so i look for so what was the person what was the person like or what was the business like when you bought the dog ramp business so describe kind of what you saw and what made you decide yeah i'm gonna buy this one yeah um it solved a real problem i i wasn't aware that this is actually a problem um i have a dog but i have a pit bull i don't have a small dog um ben so there's a real problem for a niche audience that you really can target on facebook those were the good old days that you really could niche target still on facebook um it had not a lot of competition at that time not a lot of people were promoting ramps on facebook instagram uh or even amazon the website was a very crappy uh website where i knew that if we switched to shopify we'd increase or improve the copy the pictures etc the conversion rate would most likely increase um this case uh the two founders were not doing any facebook ads there was no paid acquisition happening at all and even though they had a decent-sized customer database they were not emailing even existing customers let alone trying to capture you know a card abandonment uh so this was a good market which is pets it's uh it's you know a house that you said okay if i renovate the kitchens the floorboards the the countertops which is like redoing the website and the branding of it the copywriting and then lastly they're not even trying to rent it out they don't rent they don't post it on craigslist they don't have flyers out in the neighborhood saying come rent my place which is they weren't doing paid advertising uh to get customers so you saw it you bought it and you grew it what's another example so let's walk through um let's walk through some real examples and you tell me kind of like what you like or dislike about some of these businesses because i know you did some research on on what's out there today yeah um so for example there's one out it's sort of a crossword puzzle website so think of like when i think a lot of people play these awards with friends games or cross or scrabble games um and then there's a website out there apparently that you can just put in your letters and it will give a bunch of awards recommendations website yeah exactly um and i kind of love it because it's so there's no nothing to do like you i think there's probably a database that's already pre-built that you can buy you build it basically once um and then it's just trying to get seo traffic you know uh to your website so for example there's one for sell now for nine million dollars they started it in 2017. um does 3.5 million in revenue and because there's no really team needed it's like it's almost all profit it's like three around three million dollars of profit and it's just you know printing money basically um i like these type of niches where not a lot of people think about but there's definitely a huge search volume um another one what would you do so give me two two pieces on that so the first is um with something like this would you how would you try to grow it or would you would you not buy this because you say i don't know how i would grow this where you know i get i get a faster payback on my money so what would you do how would you think about the growth levers for this one yeah that's a good question um i will personally not buy it at the moment but because the price tag typically i only buy you know things in a couple hundred thousand dollar range uh not millions um the old what i would without knowing too much of the current business model i definitely would try to increase rpms meaning how can we squeeze more advertising dollars out of the same traffic they get like tens of millions of visitors a month um and i looked at a couple of similar websites and i think there's a huge opportunity by uh placing ads differently just to increase um rpm similar if you have an e-commerce you want to increase conversion rates if you have a content site you want to increase rpms meaning how to get more people to click on the ads or things like that um so i would do that secondly i would look and do research like for sure if there's a huge segment of people that love scrabble what is this like what other games do they like and maybe build a sub uh sister website that does i don't know like what's it called sudoku uh or whatever um so that's that's the two the two things that i would uh if i would buy this type of website and and basically when you buy something like this most people say i don't have nine million dollars and i think when you started doing this when you first started looking at these websites you also didn't have enough money to buy one of these so tell tell the story of like how you first started going to these websites even when you didn't have enough money to buy buy one of these companies yeah like i've actually bought and sold uh websites that started with buying something for 500 and then sold it for you know 1500 i started on flippa 12 years ago um and you know i've bought an pinata website that sells uh pinatas you can send a picture uh of sam and uh it makes a pinata of him yes a company in mexi in texas texas would make a piano and then ship it directly to the customer so i bought that uh for five thousand dollars that i scraped together um improved the website traffic and uh made my money back in two and a half months and then sold it a month later for 22 000 right so it's not huge numbers but those really you know helped me to grow a little bit and really get a lot of experience um then um when i started soap up um i actually saw a similar website for sale on flippa that was for sell for a hundred thousand dollars was in the daytime uh tv uh era too and uh the topic was about daytime tv of course i didn't have money i had like um a couple of thousand dollars i was not able to buy that um but what i did is like hey let's see if there's something there let's do a small test build a fan page uh see how the engagement goes and then see really how you know if there is something there and then grow from there i guess we should explain you um you created if people have listened to episode two they know the full story uh we won't go the full story again this time but your claim to fame that what episode two is about is telling the story of how you created a soap opera um content site like a soap opera a website that was basically just saying hey you're watching days of our lives or you're watching uh you know i don't know the young and the restless um here's the recap here's the spoilers of what's coming next you kind of built like a spoiler site for daytime soap operas like who the heck thinks of that and then you ended up selling it for nine or ten million dollars cash and that's like an amazing amazing exit and this is from a guy who has never watched a soap opera episode in his life so i think people love that because it was so a random but b interesting and relatable how you did that and it sounds like one of the ways you were getting business ideas was you were going on these websites and you i think you told me at the time you're like i saw a website for sale that was also in the daytime tv niche that was like a hundred thousand dollars for sale and you're like cool like i don't have a hundred thousand dollars but if this is worth a hundred thousand dollars maybe i could make something like this and then you went through this process where you said okay how can i test these ideas because uh when i met you you i was like all right what's your passion uh you know silicon valley style and you were like you know what problem you really want to solve what topic what industry really passionate about and you were like there was a cup on the table i remember we were drinking we were drinking water a little paper cup we were at this burrito place and you were like if uh if i could buy this cup for five cents and sell it to you for seven cents that's my passion like i like to buy things and sell things for a little bit more and i'm basically an internet marketer and i don't care if it's cups or dog ramps or soap opera spoilers it doesn't matter to me i love the process of like business and selling things and i was like that's amazing uh you know i love the the sort of self-awareness and honesty and then when you were testing ideas for for before you created the soap opera site you went on facebook and if i remember correctly you basically made like 30 fan pages or something like that because at the time you could promote a page a fan page on facebook for like cents you could go get a bunch of likes of your facebook page and likes weren't worth too much but you could kind of test what topics are people most engaged with what what topics if i post content in this page will i get a bunch of likes for and i think it ended up being like the top three were something like what was it was like right wing politics uh like soap operas and what was the last one it was like wrestling or something like that yeah wrestling was really popular soap opera was very soaps and politics uh wrestling and uh cars were also pretty pretty high up right um and then you were like you know i hate politics i don't want to do politics what's the next best one soap operas okay great uh hire this woman in the midwest to write uh blogs every day about soap operas and then drive traffic baby uh selling yes to go sell some paper cups exactly and i just didn't really overthink it i didn't wrote a business plan i just like gone when on upwork.com hey looking for a writer that can write soap opera spoilers put a very simple blog up just to test to see would people go from facebook onto a blog and write the story and that's how it basically started and then you know started with 10 cents a day from making from google adsense and then a dollar a day and then 10 and that's how it grew right okay let's look at a couple more deals and then we'll we'll jump around again so give me give me another one that you saw before you came on the pod that you want to talk about yeah so this this is one i just saw uh an hour ago i just thought it was interesting interesting it was a goat milk soap website itself what the heck is that yes so apparently uh goat milk soap is better for the environment uh and it's better for they say it's cruelty free because apparently a lot of soaps the traditional soaps they do testing on animals etc uh so they claim and like forgive me for people that you know know about goats milk soap i this is the first time i heard about it and that's why i uh that intrigued me um but it could probably be a product that people that use this already passionate about it seem like you know people that are into keto are super passionate or you know there's tons of these examples where it's a pretty small niche but people are so passionate that they they will spread the word for you um so this is my website you can find it on flippa um just search goat milk soap it's it says four years old monthly profit 20 000 a month uh it's got a 29 profit margin and it's selling at a 1.8 x multiple right so okay so what is that so let's say 20 times 12 we don't do public math but we do type things in 240 240 times 1.8 so it's selling for 400 something thousand is that right correct 400 425 is the asking price right okay amazing so walk me through how do you think about something like this yeah so first um i look at i will do a little bit research about the product uh does goat milk really work is it more of an uh more of a gimmick or does it actually solve a problem or are people really you know interested is there a need for this um and again if it's a gimmick that's fine too right i mean this is not like oh the answer is no we'll not buy it uh it's just important to know right back to the pinata example exactly um how many because it's very important too for like not all bit ideas have to be a hundred million dollar idea like i think um a million dollar a year business is amazing as well uh right so uh maybe goat milk soap is you know um a very passionate niche um product uh i will look um i will do research like okay how many people in the us search for it uh you can use google trends or you can use uh all kinds of um search volume um trackers um that you can see how many people are searching for these keywords i will look on instagram or they're like is there a rabbit fan base you know like goat milk you know fans or facebook groups um then i'll also look on amazon is this sold on amazon if yes how is the trend and what is the sales and then you can use a tool called helium 10 to see how many uh how much revenue a listing is doing it's by the way really amazing tool uh to do research i do the same for pet products you know i look what is trending on amazon um what is you know blowing out the waters for sales and then i will do research if we should also start selling that um then i look of course on the business stuff like business um is the is the trend up or down or flat um and also like most the business i bought were either flat or down because that's how you know you get you know a good deal uh so even if it's flat even if it's not trending up i still would you know potentially buy it uh what is important are the traffic channels diversified is 100 or 90 coming from just facebook or is it just emails or is it just um seo that could be a little bit you know risky uh especially if it's all paid traffic from facebook uh because all the e-commerce founders or listeners uh on this podcast will know you know apple can make an update and suddenly you know the paid uh traffic landscape changed so i'm looking for diversified channels then of course i look at revenue profit margins so you can really calculate like okay if i pump is this going to be more of a skill where i can pump more money into facebook i put a dollar in i get three dollars back or is this more like a long term play where i have to create seo content um that you know is less costly but it's a longer game and then also what's important to understand what you're buying are the trademarks or the patents is there email subscribers or in this case they have a 43 000 email subscribers there's 33 000 sms subscribers i think there's a social media all these things um in my opinion are valuable because that's the same with when i bought alpha paw they had a huge instagram following the huge facebook following they had an email list they had trademarks and patent all that was you know uh included in the sale um and if you those are great those are the assets and so let's take a business like this let's say it's 400 000 listing um how does it work you know if you don't have 400 grand lying around you know in in a briefcase like a like a you know evil evil genius what do you what do you do how do you buy a business like this if you don't have 400 grand lying around yeah so um you can use um sba loans uh to buy internet businesses um sba loan is basically a business loan small business loan um that i don't know when they started um a few years ago where they now also fund internet businesses and you can borrow up to 90 so technically you can buy something for that is for sale for 400 000 and you only have to put down 40 000 um and the interest rate is is pretty low it's anywhere between five and seven so it's it's higher than a mortgage but it's much lower than a traditional you know a business loan um for you know for people like us um then the second thing you can do when you see the asking price of 400 000 um you can always there's a cash upfront offer and then you can offer like hey i will pay you 250 000 cash up front at closing uh the remaining 150k i will pay you spread out over the next 12 months interest-free um so every time i buy business that's never 100 hundred percent cash on closing i always have 60 to 80 percent cash in closing and remaining it's either seller's note or an earn out and that keeps the seller you know helpful because they're you know they need to help you out plus it lowers the amount that you have to loan so let's just say let's just do a little loan calculator so sba loan is what 10-year loan something like that yes so 10-year loan so let's say you did the full amount no seller financing just for simplicity uh simplicity here so you put down 40k you're going to take the other 360 k as a sba loan and let's say you're paying 6 a year for 10 years so your monthly payment on that loan is gonna be four thousand dollars this business makes twenty thousand dollars a month of profit so you take the twenty thousand dollars a month of profit you pay back your loan for four you're left with 16k of profit every month right now so you could buy this today and be making money and so that that difference let's say 16k you only put down you know you only put down 40 000 so it only takes two and a half months for you to get all your equity back and then you're p and you're profitable every single month and you can reinvest some of that into growth so that's like a pretty s uh sweet deal and that's more than most people are making at their quote-unquote safe job correct and sba the beauty with sba loans they of course they look at your personal credit history and etc but they really look and make a decision the the lenders on the business so they will never fund you if there's too high of a risk right if they think like oh if uh we cannot you know the the borrower cannot pay the the interest month over month um so it's amazing too i actually spoke with uh joe valley from quite light broker uh today and he told me story there was a a woman she bought a business for 1.25 million with an sba loan two years ago and just closed and sold the same business for 5.5 i believe it was in the five range um but put only 10 percent down so she only she didn't even put 200k down but her return was you know 4 million i don't know yeah um so if done right you know sba loans is a really great tool a good leverage tool uh to get into internet businesses or buy a business amazing uh yeah it's this is one of the tricks now uh what do you give people a sense of how do you know make sure you're not buying a lemon yes that's uh i get a question a lot um so when you go to flippa.com i would really um be careful because flippa.com is a marketplace anybody can just upload you know their listing or their website and basically claim whatever it's on you to do the due diligence if you go to a broker like white light brokers they basically do all the vetting for you they will like look at the business is everything legit um so the risk is much smaller um but regardless if you're new to this if you are you know it's your first business you can hire a due diligence company uh centaurikai's synterica.com is one i think those are the biggest uh well-known you pay you know it depends on the listing price but it's as cheap as a couple hundred dollars um and it goes up from there but they do all the due diligence for you they look through all the traffic is it legit is the revenue legit is whatever everything they claimed is at all legit and then they can come back to you with like well we looked at all the data all the numbers um you bought it for 1.2 but we think it's actually worth 900k because these are the reasons um so definitely recommend going with a due diligence company um like centurica gotcha okay and give okay so these are uh business you could buy what was the first kind of like how the heck did you become you right so how are you figuring out how to do this give people kind of the uh not not you don't go deep into anyone but just describe kind of the journey and then i might poke into some that sound interesting so okay you're you're ramon you're born and uh i don't know i don't know when you got your entrepreneurial start what was the first kind of like entrepreneurial venture you were in your teens or or 20s or what my first real business was an construction business um i've done things before that but were like nothing really significant um but i think the way how i started the construction company is really my dna that makes sense because if i look back a lot of other companies i started basically the same i didn't know anything about construction um and and uh the story um i will keep it very uh quick but i think it's maybe could be helpful for people that maybe are overthinking steps or overthinking things um so i was out of job was 20 years old had to pay my rent um co-worker of my mom said i need a painter to paint the inside of my house i can pay you x i forgot the number but it was worth like a month's worth of money that i made in three days so i thought oh this is amazing i can you know be my own boss it's a lot of money the harder i work the more money i make that was really what intrigued me right like if i can do this in one day i will actually you know have make the same amount of money than in a whole month so you got paid not your input correct and um and as you know like in my high school dropout right so there was not uh um officially 15 but i stopped really going when i was 14. um okay so that's basically we got a letter right that's u.s ninth grade i don't know what it my mom actually got a letter from the board of school to with an official waiver like okay your son doesn't have to go to school because in holland you have to go to school mandatory to 16. they actually gave me a pass because no high school wanted to accept me but that's a different story so that's a bad guy the on sunday night she paid me out i said this is amazing so on monday morning i came up with a name house improvements or home improvements one of those two um build some uh design a couple very ugly business cards made a one-page uh website and put an ad out on the dutch version of craigslist and i thought you know what let's just not do only painting let's do like we do everything construction like remodeling from a to z whatever you don't know how to do any of that by the way no no i don't know anything i barely said so so what gives you that confidence to say i'll i'll renovate everything a to z and yet i don't know how to do anything a to z i think that's the naive thing part of me that i still have is like let's just see first if i can get a job and then figure out like how to solve or do the job and so an hour later or two hours later i got an email uh from a guy saying hey i'm looking for an electrician uh and um i am rewiring the whole building blah blah i said sure no problem i'm a ninth grade dropout i'll be there in three hours i got this i went out to bought an official construction outfit um so i really looked like a construction guy or like you know um and i went there the next morning and um disclaimer of course i will not have done things that will you know potentially kill people but i just wanted to see like you know i don't know like maybe it was something simple so he gave me he gave me the tour and it was like he i couldn't even understand the words he was saying like oh we need to wire this and we need to do and the floors were open and the walls were open and uh i was still playing along but in my mind i was like and there's no way i can do this plus it's dangerous as [ __ ] um so he went out to run some errands i waited for him um because i didn't want to be like you know an [ __ ] just go left so i waited for an hour he came back and i was like listen i'm gonna be honest i don't know [ __ ] about the construction company i don't know [ __ ] about elektra i just started yesterday i want to build a construction company but i don't know anything and he was because he was an entrepreneur he laughed his ass off and he actually gave me work he said like you're hilarious um just help me with you know getting carry this box over here yeah yeah and he paid me the same amount of dollars or euros uh hourly rate than uh he would have done before um i think also by the way if we have young listeners i think it's so important to do those things when you're young because if i would do it now i'm 40 years old not endearing i don't think it's not endearing it's not like oh i appreciate your hustle no it's like hey you're con man like yeah yes so if you're young take advantage you know sam was also really genius of doing that as well right like you can't just get away with so much more of showing hustle but also like i think he appreciated that i waited for him and just be like honest like hey listen i don't know [ __ ] about this um but he gave me a really good tip he said in order to own a construction company you don't have to know everything or do yourself if i were you find freelancers you focus on getting the projects and then you outsource it to freelancers so that's what i did and found an electrician freelancer plumber you know everything you need a whole crew that you need um and two weeks later i got a second job and i didn't do anything i just had my you know cruise assembly yeah yeah i sold it for 10k my cut was like around 5k and that's how i basically grew the construction company and within a year a little over a year we were like at 20 to 24 people depending on how many projects we had um and at that time we did close to a million dollars or million euros sorry um a year uh in revenue and you're like 19 20 years old something like that at that time yeah 20 um 21 when we you know we're here in and so what happened to that happy ending or sad ending to the story well very quick maybe story about how i scaled the scaling part i think that's also uh maybe could be helpful for people is that um the big problem with construction is every like the job is two weeks and you have to find another job their job is four weeks they have to find another job right so it was really hard to keep the guys busy um and really you know make sure that um the the projects align if that makes sense so i thought hey who can i find what can i do so i don't have to find jobs anymore so real estate investors they buy apartment buildings all at once they all need to be renovated at once so i went to um local real estate uh meetups um that was actually horrible because i was a really out of my place i was way too young i was like you know blue collar guy uh with all these fancy pens but one thing lead to another that i met the biggest uh uh real estate investor um in my region that i lived and he was like literally built buying apartment buildings at the foreclosure every month between 20 and 100 buildings at the time so now he became my client and he was my client to the end basically i never had to search for a new uh customer the so that was all the good news then i made a bunch of mistakes uh cash flow projection was one where construction you really it's a similar a little bit similar like with e-commerce i think you could grow yourself into bankruptcy if that makes sense making for example you with a construction same with e-commerce you have to put a lot of money up front i have to pay every friday the crew i have to buy the supplies but i only get paid all the way at the end when the project is done so the faster you grow the more projects you have the more money you have to put out in open and you have to wait for it so that started um that was really uh and i was just not good at cash flow projections well i just didn't do it and another thing that really was bad was growing too fast that i have to hire people that i normally would not have hired um and really lost grip of the business that makes sense and you know it started to break and um i had to close the company uh and after three years more or less and our mutual buddy silly was at my house this weekend and he said something like uh i don't know if maybe you already maybe this is the guy you already talked about but he said he said you had some like mentor kind of help you early on uh somebody who really changed the course of your life i i i don't know is he talking about that guy that who gave you that first kind of insight to hire freelancers or is there somebody else no he's talking about no this is a different story okay tell that one um all right that story uh was before my construction company um i was um almost 18 or around that time my mother kicked me out the house you have to you know live um you have to figure your [ __ ] out so i have to pay rent so i had to find a job at a local best buy um the the dutch version of best buy um a couple weeks in i said like this sucks right like uh long hours whatever and um there was a guy came coming in in a nice expensive suit uh he wanted to buy something was not in stock he gave me a business card and said like software solutions um and i didn't know anything about software or programming or whatever but i need more solutions because poor solutions whatever i didn't know anything uh but i just knew like okay hey there's a lot of money to be made and a lot of opportunity in because this was like the early internet days right like you know i'm an old [ __ ] right this is like uh before 2001. uh before the internet bubble as people remember um and um so i didn't know what he was doing but it was something in software and solutions and how you knew it was good because he came in in a fancy suit or you separately had been thinking about the internet uh separately been thinking about because i always was like trying to you know um oh let's buy this type of product in germany and then try to sell it in holland like i was always trying to build these doing these schemes uh legal of course but um internet was just like this whole new like for me my like this was like amazing like there's so many upper so much opportunity um and so i knew that i just didn't know like exactly what how to get started how to even you know write a line of code or whatever um so i started stalking him and said hey um and this is again the benefit of being young um like hey i want to get a job at your company and he said no uh we don't we're not hiring but i kept stalking him respectfully but i did caught stalking him for months like three four months to a point where he said you know what um i'm so sick and tired of this in a good way um let's make a deal if i'm gonna give you a book on friday we have an internal exam for programmers if you uh pass that exam um i will give you i will hire the company will hire you and give you a six-month internal program to become a microsoft uh developer but you have to promise me if you fail this exam on friday you have to leave me alone for the rest of your life i said okay let's do it they know what it was expect he gave me a book about microsoft database access access database programming um study that if my life was depending on it did exam and i passed uh i didn't pass a plus but i passed enough and uh so they gave me a job like gave me a job um and for six the next six months they trained me i was able to become a microsoft software developer um within this company they gave me a lease card they gave me a laptop they gave me like phone like it was it was insane yeah so this guy really changed my life because i think learning how to code uh really is helpful also in other ways in in your life like because it really um you analyze problems in situations just different if um when when you know how to code that makes sense and you but today you don't consider yourself like a coder like let's say for your your ecommerce website you're not the one going and making changes is do you do it like sometimes or early on before you hire people do you just do stuff yourself or no you're just saying learning it back then and using it back then and learning how to think that way was helpful yeah and at the that time i had to learn visual basic that language doesn't even exist anymore so it's like uh i know how to read php and html and you know i know i know how to do it but i'm like i never i never do it basically i i think it's more of breaking down what was so frustrating as a programmer is like finding bugs so you have like you know a 10 000 line codes and there's one thing bro it breaks you have to go through like all the codes but it really trains your brain like okay how to um like circle that circle down but like um really try to narrow down what it could be where the problem could be and that mindset you can use in in all kinds of other right you know real life situations so i don't program right now no okay fair enough and we got five minutes left you had a game you wanted to play at the end let's do let's do the game okay so i wanted to ask you and why did you want to play this game by the way uh because i think your audience would like to know these questions like would you rather so it's a root your mother let's give the people what they want yes all right so here's the first one would you rather be the ceo of apple or the president of the ufc oh okay president of the ufc like dana white uh too much travel i'm traveling i'm on the road all the time dealing with with all kinds of head event planning like when i threw my wedding i was like this is the only event i'll ever throw like this and uh for the ufc every weekend they throw you know a mega wedding so no way i'm doing that i also wouldn't really want to be the ceo of apple so i'll take the job i'll go buy your company for half a trillion i'll buy my company for half a trillion and then i'll peace out all right that's awesome um i saw this on a meme actually would you rather have dinner with jay-z or take 500 000 cash uh five hundred thousand dollars cash easy uh what would you do would you take dinner with jay-z i feel like you might be a i want a unique experience person no yeah i will take the cash too there was there was a whole debate uh like people saying like you should take jay-z because like let's say i feel 50 000. 50 000 i think is a closer bet here yeah then i will in the situation right now i will take the dinner um if i have no money i will take the cash right yeah yeah i'm in the same boat i think the dinner is most likely going to be kind of lame but you know i get a good story who knows maybe maybe we hit it off maybe he's interesting uh 500 000 that's you could go buy your charity dinner with jay-z for for 90 000 and have the rest left over for goods after that or you can buy a goat milk soap website yeah exactly i mean whatever that's the question would i rather have that goat milk business today or this dinner with jc tomorrow i'll take the goat milk business today thank you yeah um let's do would you rather um would you rather bootstrap bootstrap a million dollar business or vc back 10 million a year business um i think i would rather have a vc backed 10 million your business i'll tell you why i think that once you can get a business to 10 million dollars i think the odds of you being able to get it to 50 or 100 are quite high i think 0 to 10 is a lot harder or more likely to to round down to zero then 10 will stay at 10. so i think 10 million really what you're saying is hey just stick with it for a little bit longer and you'll be at 30 40 50 70 something like that million within two three years so i think that's the case and then i'm i'm actually a lot of people think vc means you're vc forever and that you're in this endless uh chase they're like well the vcs say you need to grow the vcs say you know you'll have to raise your next round my experience with vcs has actually been quite different which is vcs give you the money they might want you to do something but it's your call what you do and like you can raise one round and never raise again from vc or you can raise one round and grow at the pace you want um they might strongly advise you to do something but it's on you to say look are you gonna fire me do you have the power to do that are you gonna fire me if not then i'm gonna need you to you know shut the [ __ ] up and stay in the back seat and like let me do what i'm gonna do here so i think the 10 million business is just better than the bootstrap to 1 million then a very quick for the listeners that have an idea but not the capital would you tell them to try to get vc money or try to get the company started uh get some revenue and then do the vc route or yeah i mean this is going to sound cliche but it's true and whoever is doing this needs to hear this which is the raising money is not the uh it's not the goal like so a lot of people are like hey i want to talk to you uh like i'll invest in a company and they'll say i want to talk to you about you know what metrics we need to do to be able to raise an a in nine months or you know we're starting planning for our series b i want to talk to you about what metrics we need to do to hit the b and i'm like i understand what they're saying and it's good to be thoughtful and plan but there's this sort of implication that raising money is the milestone and it's like oh what business what does this business need to do to be able to achieve this outcome and it's actually the opposite it's i have a business outcome i'm trying to get to i'm trying to get to 10 million in revenue with 20 ebitda i'm trying to get uh 20 market share in this market or 5 i want to grow 20 a month you have a business outcome in mind and then you just say do i need more money to make that happen yes or no um money is the fuel it is not the destination it is not the it's not the point of the journey uh uh for for raising money and so i would just say like yeah when you start when you have the idea uh the goal is okay well i need to get like one customer 10 customers 100 customers a thousand customers you start doing that and then at some point if you get stuck because you lack the money meaning you truly you need to go buy inventory or your you paid ads are working you just need to spend more to get to the next milestone then you raise the money don't raise don't raise as your excuse to go do the business yeah and you also see a lot of uh deals or people approaching you and you know me in a little bit lesser way but i do feel like there's a lot of people think they need money to launch a business but actually don't because they think oh it needs to be pretty or it has to have all these functionalities um but maybe they could just like start with one functionality and just have you know a fiverr designer just do it and you know do it at least get started yeah my favorite people to fund are people who have uh created a company and like made all the mistakes ended up with a small win where they got a taste of winning but you know not not not enough to go retire on a yacht because the next time they start they're like not going to waste those six months on design mock-ups and branding and getting the trademark and all this other stuff like they know what are the traps and they know what what you really need to do versus what you think you need to do and there's a big gap there but usually even if somebody tells you experience is the best teacher because uh the voice in your head typically from most entrepreneurs i meet the voice in your head typically is giving you some bad advice your first first time through and it's okay like just go do it learn those lessons and then the second time you're much better off yeah i agree then last question would you rather do a boxing match against sam or do an man with me and suli uh both i i'd rather do the boxing match with sam because that sounds more fun and exciting uh than like an endurance race but uh yeah so i would do a boxing match with sam i think that'd be great you know i've always wanted to like feel what it's like to be in a real fight like i think i got into like one or two little altercations when i was younger like in high school or middle school but it was always like i hit the kid and then he he ran away or like he hit me and then it got broken up and it's like it never was like okay let's do this let's get let's start no one's gonna break this up and the point is to actually get in a fight so i would do it although sam is definitely like you know on horse tranquilizers or whatever like horse you know growth hormone or whatever he's taking that guy's uh built like a absolute monster right now so uh you know i need a little training period but i would do it actually a lot of people because he's been posting videos of me and him sparring um you know he wants to become an uh uh fitness influencer now um to his credit by the way he posts pic he posts videos of you hitting him and him going down normally when people post they cherry pick what makes them look good he does the opposite he posts up you hitting him in the liver shots and him falling down over and over again like a compilation yeah and to be also to his credit he um he started four or five months ago um not super serious not that he's doing it every day but he he actually got really good really fast um you know i've been training much longer um but a lot of people on the twitter comments actually are voting for uh you versus sam so yeah maybe we should give us what they need let's give the fans what they want yeah we need we need like a kickstarter or gofundme or something it's like if uh if if certain number of people vote for this or buy the pre-buy a pay-per-view five dollar pay-per-view of this we'll do it we need like whatever ten thousand pre-buys okay ten thousand provides that's the goal ten thousand pre-buys of a ten dollar pay-per-view and then we'll do it okay let's set it up and then um [Music] you can give me like give me like i don't know four months to train and we'll fulfill the training yeah four to six whatever each one can get one uh good trainer boxing trainer uh do you do what you're going to do boxing or mma or no boxing is simple i don't have time to learn five martial arts so we'll get to the point where we're both shitty at boxing and then we'll do it yeah let's do it i think we should uh do it and then maybe silly and i can box too as though the free uh with that yeah we should we should get anybody it's a ceo boxing tournament yes and we stream it uh and we do it in a really small ratchet like boxing gym here so we can go there and then we'll just stream it for for the people right uh 10 000 free buys that's a lot but i think it's doable uh especially if you can get the support of your listeners yeah we're saying it now uh people will just have to see uh we'll just have to get them a link and let's get him a link and let's do it yes all right i can't wait all right perfect um okay i gotta run i gotta do a call with this guy ramon thanks for being on where should people find you so now you're twitter famous so is it ramon vanmir is that your your twitter handle right yeah ramone at ramon van meer all together ramon vanmir go buy if you have a small dog like i have a maltipoo uh i have four of your ramps in my house because it's a lifesaver uh otherwise your dogs get like you know injured backs and they're jumping off couches and stuff like that that's like imagine jumping onto something or off of something that's three times your height right that's what they're doing and so these ramps are onto the bed onto the couch up the stairs you know that's how i use them so go buy go buy some ramps from alpha paw [Music] you

i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back andrew is a great friend of ours has this big business called tiny uh where they own a bunch of different businesses north of 100 million ish or so in revenue took a company public you're whatever you're successful in terms of career and traditional sense of successful you're a good friend you normally come on a lot but you just tweeted how you kind of like took off for all of august and you kind of bailed because you were kind of having a meltdown in which we all have had before like a digital overload meltdown uh and you just bailed right totally it was really uh it was bad i mean it's interesting to think about like i think this happened to everyone over kovid like their life just shifted in a weird way um and my life just became crappy over covid which is weird because i had this amazing year like we took a business public we raised a big fund we got to work with all these interesting people we bought some great businesses i didn't die of covid like all these great things happened and yet i was totally miserable um and when i look at it when i kind of zoom out my old day i don't know if you guys you guys know but i live in victoria canada and i didn't even have an office so i actually liked just working out of cafes i would just go to the same cafe every day and i'd sit there with headphones on three or four of my friends would always work there so it's kind of like cheers there's always like interesting people to talk to and my day was just broken up into a bunch of chunks so any given day i wouldn't really be on the computer or in one place for more than an hour or two and my day went from that to sitting in a house on my computer all day on zoom and doing email and it just kind of made me miserable and so i i am you know when i look at like what i love about business i don't actually love you know doing business is great doing strategy coming up with ideas all that kind of stuff but the cool thing about business is you get to meet interesting people like business is just a hack right so like if you're interested in health you figure out like a health business you suddenly can meet all the most interesting people in that world um and i'm an extrovert so anyway just i was totally bummed and i started um you know going on twitter a lot because i was craving socializing um i and i i went from like 20 000 followers to 170 000 followers so i got totally hooked into that and like a good day would be like i have a viral tweet or i go on your podcast or something something exciting happens a bad day would be i say something on twitter i get dunked on i got misunderstood or it doesn't do well like what a ridiculous thing like i'd tweet and it would only get like 50 likes instead of 5000 likes it would like throw my day off so i got to a point where i was just like jesus christ like this is totally ridiculous i'm thinking about twitter constantly i'm checking twitter constantly and on top of that i'm you know email uh you know checking stats stocks uh if i went to the bathroom without my phone i feel like i feel i feel like i was going to freak out constantly listening to audio books constantly listening to pod podcasts no silence so i just like hit this weird breaking point august 1st where i woke up and i was like i'm not stoked to get her to bed i'm not depressed objectively everything is fine i'm like i'm just like i have like anhedonia like i'm just not excited about anything so i just said [ __ ] it i'm just gonna what what what's that word you just said that was a good one it means like an inability to feel pleasure right like not nothing would get me pumped nothing would give me a hit like you know you know when you like you're always you go on netflix you're like scrolling endlessly for the perfect thing you just can't find it that's how my life felt and so i basically you know is the middle august i live in british columbia it's super beautiful and so i just said to my wife you know what i'm out for the next month let's just go off to our cabin we'll you know we'll go on some trips and i'm just going to totally check out and i set a couple rules for myself i was like no phone no email no computer no podcasts uh no phone calls no social media no news i couldn't even read nonfiction business books right so it's pretty extreme and i put on my apple watch which has you know cellular so i was like okay if there's an emergency i can get a phone call and i put my phone in a drawer and i just disappeared i went up to my cabin and hung out with my kids and honestly for the first like three or four days it felt like there was like a bug in my brain like i was just like so like like something i i itch i couldn't scratch like just so irritable as being a huge [ __ ] uh i was like slapping my pocket every five seconds to check stuff i'd be sitting on the beach with my kids and i'd constantly be like oh i need to text this to a friend i gotta i gotta take a photo of this right so it's really weird horrible withdrawal but then after like three or four days i was like holy crap like this is really interesting i started reading fiction books and just sitting for hours uh you know enjoying a sunset taking a silent drive doing all this stuff and i think it's kind of like if you eat junk food all the time like you're drinking coke and having burgers and stuff all the time and then you eat broccoli it doesn't taste that good your brain is primed for like these extreme flavors and then if you switch to broccoli you know you don't eat those things for a month then you eat broccoli broccoli is like orgasmic it's amazing and so anyway i did this for four weeks and i was feeling really good and i came back to life like i kind of reintroduced myself into society and started going out and working and stuff and it was really bizarre like i you know would listen to a song that was playing in a cafe and it'd be like the greatest song i've ever heard i'd read some random article and it would be like fascinating and i'd just be completely uh like just you know engaged with it um and then problems i had to solve that would have pissed me off like seemed like no problem when i was excited to solve them and i was kind of going like man why why did that work like what was it about that and at the same time like around then i started listening to podcasts again and i listen to this podcast by uh andrew huberman huberman lab which i'm sure you guys have listened to he's amazing yeah he's uh he's coming on the podcast oh amazing that's that's awesome so he did this deep dive on addiction and he did it with this woman anna lemke who's a stanford addiction doctor and i was like oh this will be interesting it'll be about like heroin addiction or something and how they treat alcoholism so i'll start listening to it those other people who have those other bad problems it's fun it's fun to read about them totally i was like i was like oh this will be you know maybe philanthropic you know i can help fund the heroin addiction center in victoria or something so anyway and as i listen i just go like oh my god like you know this is not this is universal like basically the chemical of dopamine the neurotransmitter is the thing that makes you feel craving and pleasure when you do things and it motivates you to do things and i realized you know basically like she said you know something along the lines of if you eat chocolate cake once a month it tastes amazing and you don't really crave it that much you don't really think about it that much it's very pleasurable if you eat it once a week you know it's still enjoyable but it's not as good and you start having cravings you start wanting chocolate cake if you eat it every day your brain literally craves it and you're in pain until you eat it and when you eat it it's not even that enjoyable it just makes the pain go away for a little bit and she compares that to like heroin addiction or anything and so you know here we all are we're stimulating ourselves with social media 24 7 we're constantly taking these hits and the hits become less and less enjoyable and she talked about you know she's at stanford so she's treating students and she talked about these kids that would come in and they're addicted to social media and video games and they have no motivation and so she said look i basically recommend a dopamine fast for four weeks they can't do any of that stuff they got to go walk in silence drive in silence have quiet moments not avoid those things and i realized that you know i'd basically done that uh for myself and that's why i felt better and i you know i was an addict it's crazy [Music] you

took a business public we raised a big fund we got to work with all these interesting people we bought some great businesses i didn't die of covid like all these great things happened and yet i was totally miserable and when i look at it when i kind of zoom out my old day i don't know if you guys you guys know but i live in victoria canada and i didn't even have an office so i actually like just working out of cafes i would just go to the same cafe every day and i'd sit there with headphones on three or four of my friends would always work there so it's kind of like cheers there's always like interesting people to talk to and my day was just broken up into a bunch of chunks so any given day i wouldn't really be on the computer or in one place for more than an hour or two and my day went from that to sitting in a house on my computer all day on zoom and doing email and it just kind of made me miserable and so i i um you know when i look at like what i love about business i don't actually love you know doing business is great doing strategy coming up with ideas all that kind of stuff but the cool thing about business is you get to meet interesting people like business is just a hack right so like if you're interested in health you figure out like a health business you suddenly can meet all the most interesting people in that world um and i'm an extrovert so so anyway just i was totally bummed and i started um you know going on twitter a lot because i was craving socializing um i and i i went from like 20 000 followers to 170 000 followers so i got totally hooked into that and like a good day would be like i have a viral tweet or i go on your podcast or something something exciting happens a bad day would be i say something on twitter i get dunked on i got misunderstood or it doesn't do well like what a ridiculous thing like i'd tweet and it would only get like 50 likes instead of 5 000 likes it would like throw my day off so i got to a point where i was just like jesus christ like this is totally ridiculous i'm thinking about twitter constantly i'm checking twitter constantly and on top of that i'm you know email uh you know checking stats stocks uh if i went to the bathroom without my phone i feel like i feel i feel like i was going to freak out constantly listening to audiobooks constantly listening to podcasts no silence so i just like hit this weird breaking point august 1st where i woke up and i was like i'm not stoked to get out of bed i'm not depressed objectively everything is fine i'm like i'm just like i have like anthony like i'm just not excited about anything so i just said [ __ ] it i'm just gonna what what what's that word you just said that was a good one yeah it means like an inability to feel pleasure right like nothing nothing would get me pumped nothing would give me a hit like you know you know when you like you're always you go on netflix you're like scrolling endlessly for the perfect thing you just can't find it that's how my life felt and so i basically you know it's the middle of august i live in british columbia it's super beautiful and so i just said to my wife you know what i'm out for the next month let's just go off to our cabin we'll you know we'll go on some trips and i'm just going to totally check out and i set a couple rules for myself i was like no phone no email no computer no podcasts no phone calls no social media no news i couldn't even read non-fiction business books right so it's pretty extreme and i put on my apple watch which has you know cellular so i was like okay if there's an emergency i can get a phone call and i put my phone in a drawer and i just disappeared i went up to my cabin and hung out with my kids and honestly for the first like three or four days it felt like there was like a bug in my brain like i was just like so like like something i i itch i couldn't scratch like just so irritable as being a huge [ __ ] uh i was like slapping my pocket every five seconds to check stuff i'd be sitting on the beach with my kids and i'd constantly be like oh i need to text this to a friend i gotta i gotta take a photo of this right so it's really weird horrible withdrawal but then after like three or four days i was like holy crap like this is really interesting i started reading fiction books and just sitting for hours uh you know enjoying a sunset taking a silent drive doing all this stuff and i think it's kind of like if you eat junk food all the time like you're drinking coke and having burgers and stuff all the time and then you eat broccoli it doesn't taste that good your brain is primed for like these extreme flavors and then if you switch to broccoli you know you don't eat those things for a month then you eat broccoli broccoli is like orgasmic it's amazing and so anyway i did this for four weeks and i was feeling really good and i came back to life like i kind of reintroduced myself into society and started going out and working and stuff and it was really bizarre like i you know would listen to a song that was playing in a cafe and it'd be like the greatest song i've ever heard i'd read some random article and it would be like fascinating and i'd just be completely uh like just you know engaged with it um and then problems i had to solve that would have pissed me off like seemed like no problem when i was excited to solve them and i was kind of going like man why why did that work like what was it about that and at the same time like around then i started listening to podcasts again and i listened to this podcast by uh andrew huberman huberman lab which i'm sure you guys have listened to he's amazing yeah he's uh he's coming on the podcast oh amazing that's that's awesome so he did this deep dive on addiction and he did it with this woman anna lemke who's a stanford addiction doctor and i was like oh this will be interesting it'll be about like heroin addiction or something and how they treat alcoholism so let's start listening to it those other people who have those other bad problems it's fun it's fun to read about them totally i was like i was like oh this will be you know maybe philanthropic you know i can help fund the heroin addiction center in victoria or something so anyway and as i listen i just go like oh my god like you know this is not this is universal like basically the chemical of dopamine the neurotransmitter is the thing that makes you feel craving and pleasure when you do things and it motivates you to do things and i realized you know basically like she said you know something along the lines of if you eat chocolate cake once a month it tastes amazing and you don't really crave it that much you don't really think about it that much it's very pleasurable if you eat it once a week you know it's still enjoyable but it's not as good and you start having cravings you start wanting chocolate cake if you eat it every day your brain literally craves it and you're in pain until you eat it and when you eat it it's not even that enjoyable it just makes the pain go away for a little bit and she compares that to like heroin addiction or anything and so you know here we all are we're stimulating ourselves with social media 24 7 we're constantly taking these hits and the hits become less and less enjoyable and she talked about you know she's at stanford so she's treating students and she talked about these kids that would come in and they're addicted to social media and video games and they have no motivation and so she said look i basically recommend a dopamine fast for four weeks they can't do any of that stuff they got to go walk in silence drive in silence have quiet moments not avoid those things and i realized that you know i'd basically done that uh for myself and that's why i felt better and i you know i was an addict it's crazy how do you propose doing this though given like i hear everything you're saying and i think i actually i'm sure i have the exact same problem but i'm like i've got to record this podcast i've got to text i mean i guess i don't have to but you know it's easy for you to say a rich guy right like that right for somebody who's listening or even most people i would say the practicality of detaching for four weeks um is hard oh yeah and i think um my my version of it was extreme but there's many different forms of it i mean it could be as simple as you just wear your apple watch and you don't text and the only way you text is crappily on your apple watch you take calls on your apple watch and you know you do zooms on your laptop but you just don't have that constant 24 7 imessage coming in or maybe you just screen time your phone super aggressively i mean how do you not eat junk food all the time and have a good diet don't keep junk food in the house don't keep booze in the house right self-bind yourself um so i mean i just basically like screen time the hell out of my phone and like today for example i drove to my office i just have my apple watch i don't have my phone so i know if my kids fall down and hurt themselves my wife can call me but otherwise i'm not really texting do you do that sean because i think of you sean is someone who is connected a lot i am connected a lot i've consciously picked two parts of my day where i'm like these are my like disconnect days you know like these my disconnect hours at least because you know i think about it very much the same as andrea i heard two things that uh that kind of shifted my view on this so the first was naval had this great uh thing he used to say where he goes the ancient struggle was scarcity you know the ancient struggle was we just didn't have enough we didn't have enough food we didn't have enough water we didn't have enough um you know access to medicine entertainment whatever and uh the modern struggle is abundance which is where overloaded with cheap dopamine and like um and then the idea of cheap dopamine is something that a lot literally last night i was listening to hubermann a little clip that came up my youtube feed of andrew huberman and it's funny by the way because it's like i literally i have it's like the addict is like learning about rehab while like shooting up basically because it was 3 a.m i had just i was going to bed i had stayed up way too late already and i'm the type where you know if i get like you said i'm going to the bathroom and i don't have my phone with me i'm like oh i'm gonna miss out on like my entertainment like right now i could watch something listen to something do something while i'm just peeing or whatever like brushing my teeth and i had literally bought this uh headphone that i can wear to sleep because it's comfortable so it's like a headband it's like a soft headband that has small earbuds baked into it so you could sleep with headphones because i was like pipe that content into my ears baby while i'm falling asleep like i don't i don't even want to fall asleep i want to be entertained and pass out like that's kind of the way i was sleeping and so even last night i was doing that my bad habit and it was just like you know ultra connected too connected and i started listening to superman thing and he goes he said something that really struck me he goes he goes one way to think about addiction is it's a progressive narrowing of what gives you pleasure um so it's a it's a uh you are narrowing the things in your life that that will give you this rush of pleasure so andrew when you when you when you dopamine fasted you started getting pleasure from silence in the car from the sunset from fiction books but before that it's like twitter was this cheap fast instantaneous guaranteed source of pleasure and so it was it narrowed the number of places you were going to get that pleasure to like this most common over time it also became more painful though more like when i first started doing twitter it was pure pleasure so fun and then over time it took more and more of a hit to satisfy me the numbing and then yeah you get numb to the sort of like you you build up tolerance right like you would with alcohol or anything else and of course you had to turn your you turned your experience into a thread which probably became one of your most uh reached of course totally totally well and this is the debate right is do you want to engage like okay like obviously it's a good thing that we can all uh use imessage and use these devices like they're they're a bicycle for the mind there's all these amazing things you can do you can meet all these amazing people but the question is how to use them in a responsible way so like on twitter i have a one-way twitter client that i'm using so i don't actually see the results of my tweets right although in this case i'll admit i did when i did go and look but my goal is to actually fully screen time on every device so i can't access twitter only the uh the api i think there's here's a good way to look at it so have you guys heard of this person named uh earl nightingale so basically he probably died in the 60s maybe he died in the 70s and he was famous in the 50s and 60s and he basically was almost like a tony robbins of that era but he was a little bit more well known as like a writer he was like um almost like a like a like a dan rather's meets uh tony robbins mainstream famous guy and he told this famous story on this on his radio broadcast where he talked to a farmer and he went to this farmer's house and this was right when the telephone got popular he went to this farmer's house and he's talking and they're just having this conversation and the phone starts ringing and the farmer doesn't flinch he just keeps making eye contact and having uh the conversation and about five minutes later the phone rings again and does the same thing he keeps making eye eye contact and then a few minutes later it rings one more time and the guys uh the guests go earl goes hey do you need to answer that and the farmer goes what that thing no no that's just there for my convenience uh i i answer that whenever i want and whenever i heard that story a couple years ago i was like that's how i'm going to treat my phone it is there for me and so i don't feel guilty about clicking ignore deny or don't not replying it is this this thing this phone it exists for my convenience not the other way around i i own it well the other thing is you know do you ever think well like the 1950s so in the 1950s if you're an executive at a business you would a have a secretary right and the secretary would be keeping everyone away from you and then you'd get your mail once or twice a day and so you'd batch it right so you'd get 100 letters half of them would be done by your secretary you get 20 or 50 of them or whatever you just do that over an hour you write all your letter responses then you're done for the day whereas what we have is a mailman who's coming to the door every five minutes knock knock knock here throwing a bunch more letters in there and you're kind of doing it in the middle of everything so i think like batching also is incredibly helpful the other thing is like you know people who talk about being friends with their family with an alcoholic they talk about how the alcohol will will actually if someone gets in in between them and the alcohol they will always choose the alcohol and i think the hard part is you know you think about and think about all the arguments i've had with my with my wife where if i don't get to follow my routine my dopamine routine of well i like to listen to podcasts in the shower and then i like to do x and y and z and i've got my whole routine and process if she would mess with it like hey i've got i need you to go and do this or whatever i would like rage right and i just thought i was an [ __ ] or ocd or something and then now being off of that i'm not raging and getting frustrated in that same way so it's really fascinating all the addiction stuff just really flows through this i've created basically three two windows in the day so uh exercise is one exercise is beautiful because uh you know i have a very low urge to check my phone when i'm working out anyways so that becomes a full kind of like almost 90 minutes of uh of not looking at my phone and i don't care what's happening and i don't care who's i don't care how much sales we have i don't care you know who's mentioning me i don't care who's emailing me slacking me um and so sam i think you probably have the same where would you work out i don't think you are checking your phone uh during it yeah i don't i it means nothing to me i do look at it to mark down what i'm doing uh but typically what i've been doing lately is i'll mark down on a notepad with my workout and then i transfer it after the workout specifically so i don't touch my phone you guys listen to music while you work out because one of the things huberman talks about is you don't want a dopamine stack so people work out to experience pleasure and dopamine but if you start stacking it so you say i when i work out i watch game of thrones and i get a smoothie after and and and you start to not enjoy the actual workout whereas if you do it for intrinsic reasons you can actually train yourself to enjoy it right i do that because i listen to music too and i like i love the like that's i feel like that's music listening time you know what i mean we're basically i'm here i am training i am going to love your addiction you watching sorry go ahead that's funny andrew say i'm i'm getting between you in your addiction sam raged out immediately um you know the i'm i'm doing the opposite where uh like dan ariely the kind of like famous behavioral economist he was talking about this thing where he had this medicine he had to take because he has really bad burns he had really bad facial burns he had to take this one medicine all the time or apply this ointment it burned it was like really uncomfortable and so he was like instead of trying to wrestle the brain and convince the brain through logic that this is a good thing for me when the brain is just saying ew this i don't like the way this medicine makes me feel don't take this um he's like i just attached a really i think i really loved uh to taking the medicine so every time i take the medicine i would take it during the intro of my favorite movie and i would watch my favorite movie or my favorite show and he's like that helped me stick to my routine of taking the medicine actually get healthier and so for me that's almost like working out where working out wasn't something i found super pleasurable that's why i didn't work out for so long because it kind of felt like work and so i had to retrain myself using music having a great trainer who i like hanging out with you know like doing different types of workouts that are more sporty so that i would actually get pleasure from working out so i would actually like it so i stacked it intentionally i stacked things i knew i loved onto working out so that i started to love working out because i only got to do those things when i worked out yeah and i i'd also say though andrew um well you're taking the stance i don't know if you actually feel that way is addiction necessarily bad like all right so i had i've talked about this one i've had like alcohol problems and then i started like going to cigars like one way that i got off it is i started smoking and then like after smoking i like started doing sugar or something like that and i went to the doctor and she's like i was like you know i'm eating so much sugar and she's like well is it helping you not drink i go yeah she goes i'm gonna [ __ ] it just do it and uh i'm like yeah why wouldn't i just do that and so some addiction i i'm whenever i think of like i'm like just it's not necessarily bad like so like if you're addicted to one thing or the other well is that is that like does it kind of make you a little bit happy you know i think actually some addiction can be okay that's kind of there's there's a lot of different levels to it right like i think obviously heroin alcohol drug abuse that leads to a life of guaranteed misery very quickly and you die young and you're depressed and everything else but the fundamental question is if you're addicted to work and it's making you depressed then you know just because you're objectively achieving whatever you're achieving if you're depressed right so i think that's the way i would think about it um what's the highest order bit right if the highest order bit is that i'm feeling good on a daily basis i enjoy my life i feel i feel good then cool whatever your system is is serving you but as soon as that spirals out and it might start that way the same behavior might start feeling that way and then all of a sudden it's you stop feeling that that's what kind of happened with you andrew is like let's say like at first you were getting this great pleasure and rush from connecting with people on twitter and sharing your ideas and that's fun and you were helping people because people heard those ideas and took them for their own and then like you know everything in excess sort of has the the cons will sort of reveal themselves over time totally well another the other thing that's interesting is like i'm the kind of person where i'm always hacking everything right so i was like okay if i do the dishes i found a way to enjoy the dishes so i'm stacking on i've got my podcast i've got my music i get my treat after you know all those things and recently what i've been trying to do is just do the best job of doing the dishes i possibly can in silence it's almost a meditative practice and what i've noticed is again the first couple times i did it i was raging i was like this [ __ ] sucks i don't want to do the dishes you know this is bs and then after a while of just silently doing the dishes i started really enjoying it and now when my wife says can you do the dishes i don't get irritable and i'm not expecting a treat and i'm doing it because it's intrinsically enjoyable feeling the hot water and washing the pan and doing a good job which sounds ridiculous but it's no different than gardening or any other thing that people like it's just tuning your brain for it so can we talk about something that doesn't seem similar but kind of is but basically andrew you bought this company aeropress which is actually like in my opinion probably one of the best companies that you could own if you are trying not to get addicted to uh fast twitch uh notifications alerts because it's been around forever it you do you guys even sell anything do you even sell it online really other than amazon a little bit only i think it's like three percent of sales are online right now so like it's a pretty like low stress like because you haven't built anything new or aeropress is it's basically a if you don't know what aeropress is it's a coffee maker that's been the same way since the beginning is that right yeah it's been around since i think 2006 and it's like this it looks like a pvc tube and you press down on you put some coffee in the bottom of it you put some hot water and you press down and it makes like a concentrated coffee and uh it's been around yeah for for a long time and it was started by the guy who made the aerobee frisbee he's like a serial inventor so that those like neon pink frisbees from the 80s um yeah it's it's an amazing product can you say what you bought it for uh the deal was 70 million uh 70 million to buy it and can you say how big it i mean what can you say about it it wasn't for sale or this was one that you were like let me see if i can if they're willing to sell so i mean uh basically the story is four or five years ago i was making coffee i've been using aeropress for years we had one at our office someone brought brought one in like 10 years ago and i looked down at it and i was like oh man i wonder who owns this so i started googling i realized the founder still owned it and he is this 80 year old serial inventor who lives in palo alto so i sent him an email i looked up his email on voila norbert and i said hey can i come to palo alto and you know would you ever explore selling and he said i don't know if i want to sell but i'm happy to meet you and so i flew down and chris and i spent a whole day with him just kind of talking about the business um and there's just so much to love about this business so what was he like he's like this like really funny old guy he reminded me a little bit of my grandpa uh you know he had hearing aids he he like just clearly loved inventing and coming up with ideas and he started walking me through you know all the different inventions and ideas that he had and things he wanted to make did he actually work there yeah yeah yeah he um so he really like ran he was really responsible for inventing in the product and then he had a president who was running the day-to-day business um and so uh you know this is like it's such a crazy business so there's zero marketing so they spend absolutely nothing on marketing um it's sold in pretty much every single gourmet coffee shop in the world like you walk into anywhere blue bottle from down to like little independent ones everyone sells it um it's very very uh like um it's like it's a a category owner i would call it right so if you think about like a commodity product even like kleenex or band-aid right it is the it's it's the category defining brand right so no one searches like pneumatic tube coffee maker they just search aeropress so um and it's literally written on grinders right so like one of the settings on the grinders aeropress so basically this is an opportunity for us to buy a category of like making coffee a way of making coffee um and like people are fanatical there's like world aeropress championships baristas get like tattoos of aeropresses like it's totally nuts so anyway i spent four years trying to convince him to sell his business and i literally emailed him every single month for four years i'd call this the dennis the menace just like i have an email reminder and superhuman and i just kept asking and then finally uh you know over the last six months we negotiated a deal and got it done and the idea is very simple i mean this is an incredible product it's really just about selling it in more places and they really just didn't have a ddc strategy so we're basically coming in we're going to focus on d to c and keep the business as it is otherwise and just scale that channel so we're super excited about it what you just said that's wild to me when uh i think he said this on the podcast i think i could share it when uh when moyes ali was selling native and native at the time was just uh just a deodorant um that's all they sold one one one one product with a couple of uh scents or flavors and um and so it was like a you know here's this this um paraben free aluminum-free deodorant and he's going to be selling and like part of the sales pitch of like how to get more upside in the deal was hey right now we're doing so well with just deodorant imagine if we expanded or whatever that's kind of like the the high level idea but i thought the way he said it makes a big difference so like it was wonderful he and this is like i call this out because i you know when i teach this power writing course i live for these phrases these let's take the same information let's say it two different ways and watch what happens and so you know one is there's lots of room to expand into other product lines okay emotionally registers as a one and then the the uh the way he said it when he was meeting with somebody they were like well how big can this the other thing be and like you know what's the upside here for us he goes he goes um do you know how to write the word native on other bottles he's like like if could you write that on a shampoo bottle could you write that on a toothpaste bottle and he's like that's your upside and it's like you know obviously kind of a funny [ __ ] thing to say but it really like hits home and so when you when i was hearing about the aeropress thing i it reminded me of that which is like you know do you know how to make a website because right now if it's all if it's all done not through d2c not done online it's like it doesn't take a genius to make this like the genius thing was buying it not making it better and bigger than it is today and that's like your sweet spot right is you're not looking to be a genius yeah there's this period where factories went from being steam powered to powered by electricity right and you could basically go and you could buy a factory and convert it there's a lot of money being made to be made in just electrification in factories or products or anything and this is one of those things right where you find a business that's using a legacy sales process via retail which we're going to keep i mean it's an amazing advertising mechanism and we love all the distributors and everything but at the same time it's like hey we can also sell sddc awesome and it's such a simple insight that we don't need to be geniuses a even if we don't do as great as we think we'll still do fine we'll have a great business and if we do well we're going to blow the doors up one more point on that that you bought it for 70 million dollars what is the annual ruffle roughly the annual marketing and advertising spend that has created this business that you bought for 70 million dollars is it or less than one million dollars yeah so it's like 20 000 exactly so i mean here's the other one right if you include salaries there's there's a few people in the marketing but let's call it if you include salaries maybe let's call it 150 200 grand hold on how many people are in there why do you have a marketing person if you're spending twenty thousand dollars yeah why does there are salaries well they do do what they do is lots of like um i wouldn't even call it influencer but like they do a lot of pr and outreach but the company the company this company is it's like it's like [ __ ] carmex or something it's like you made it one time and then like what when i imagine a business like this what do the people do every day like do you have like like you know roughly how many orders the hustle i used to be like why do you have 25 people here you write one email and you're like yeah it just it takes a lot of people to like you know make this email great and like have ads well for us for us it was redundancy you needed redundancy because because it relied it was a it was a digital thing that people made every single day and i actually think you could run the whole business with 15 people or less but with aeropress you probably could do did you only need like ten or five or how many people did yesterday i think there's sub ten employees wow and they're managing the distributors and making sure manufacturing is good and all that kind of stuff that's crazy and so a five or ten person company for 70 million dollars that's freaking awesome that's so cool like you you know what carmex is andrew it's the like the challenge the lip balm yeah yeah this is it's like this is like one of those you i think you up here you call it a cruise ship this is one of those things where just it just does the same thing like you guys didn't create anything new after the initial thing right no no we haven't done anything explain this cruise ship investing philo framework what is this well okay so i think um when i talk to any young person and you know myself included i really glorified startups right and i i i like to kind of turn these into like um analogies or whatever just so they're easy to explain and i was like oh you know a startup is really like a speedboat right it's exhilarating it can go anywhere but at the end of the day you know you're driving over waves you're getting your you know body destroyed you're freezing cold you might hit a rock you might get drunk you really have to be white knuckling and pay attention and you're constantly worried you're going to run out of gas right so i was like okay so that's a startup a cruise ship is slow and steady it moves on a straight course so you can pretty much estimate where they're going you can make an educated guess that you'll end up in hawaii versus antarctica based on where they're going and what their course is and you can get a comfortable sleep lots of amenities there's very low odds of failure it's not dangerous at all and best of all you don't have to buy the whole boat you just buy a ticket and i was saying you know a stock certificate right so essentially i just as a mental model i go i when i look at a business i go is this a speed boat or a cruise ship do i need to be white knuckling this and do i need a you know amazing captain or can i just go and board a cruise ship that's already doing really well and it's much more boring to ride a cruise ship no one's going to give you an award or write a book about you for having an amazing crossing of the atlantic or whatever on a cruise ship but it's very comfortable and enjoyable so i've just been using that example when i talk to young entrepreneurs there's a similar example to that so this guy named joel uh what's the the guy who started um joel on software um yeah joel on software withdrawal and software what does it call it so what's the thing that ev everyone knows uh trello sack overflow yeah so this guy he's he's amazing so his name is joel on software his blog if you want to read good writing it's this guy it's called joelandsoftware.com it's amazing and he's got this amazing blog post where he talks about different strategies and he basically calls it the ben jerry's or the amazon and so with amazon it's new competition or sorry new technology and there's very little competition at first and you basically need to go balls to the wall like a speed boat you need to go as hard as you possibly can early on to grab as much market share you're okay with losing a lot of money and you know it's um and you gotta go fast otherwise you're gonna lose and it's a zero-sum game or there's ben and jerry's where there's already a lot of ice cream competition you can go to a bunch of different ice cream places throughout the week and it's no big deal and if you do a good job this could last for 50 or 100 years um and that's kind of like the different strategies although i would say that the cruise ship analogy is probably even better totally i wanted to ask you uh you said something about the cruise ship thing which was like you know you don't get to be the hero because you didn't you know white knuckle uh and like um survive the the crazy storm and come out the other side which is like you know the startup founder who pulls it off and disrupts the industry and blah blah and you had a thing on here which i think is more related to your twitter stuff but i think they're they're both the same they're both uh they're both related which is what's the perfect amount of notoriety so what's the perfect amount of fame and to what extent do you do you um do things in order to build your profile build your build your frame right so what are your kind of like most what's your most up-to-date thoughts on that because i think you've done a good job right you do have a high profile you have a higher profile than i don't know 99 of people who do what you do which is private equity um and you know so so you've done a good job in that and i think that's paid work dividends and it's probably had fun you know uh ego dividends too where you feel good about it um but you know there's downsides so what do you what do you think now what do you think's the perfect amount of notoriety well this one i'm trying to figure out and i i don't really know if i have the answer and i think you guys have probably gonna gone through this exact same thing as i have i mean i was sitting in a cafe my my wife was like hey you know go take go take a couple hours to yourself and so i went and i sat at a cafe and i was reading a book and a friend showed up i started talking to him your wife just said go take a couple hours for yourself could i just the mvp of uh look what's going on i need to tell my wife this is a thing this is because i haven't been irritable right because i'm not an addict right now um so anyways i'm sitting there and chatting with my friend and you know i'm sharing personal stuff and you know talking about what's going on in my life and maybe 20 minutes into our conversation there's this guy who's sitting to our left and he goes hey i'm really sorry to interrupt but i heard you on my first million and i've got a business over in vancouver and that was so cool right like that's i'm sure you guys have that too every once in a while someone else is that is that a real story by the way yes 100 real that's awesome there's the guy i'll mention the guy he runs a uh he runs the best gourmet coffee shop at ubc which is a big university in vancouver uh it's called bulldog coffee and i was like wow that's actually genius you've basically gotta capture you've captured a market that's smart but anyway what was going through my head after that is oh my god what did i say like you know here's this person who heard everything i was saying i don't think i said anything bad or you know overly personal but there is this sense of like oh there's a loss of privacy and not only that but you have to be consistent so if i go on this podcast and i say i'm about x and y and z now every time i talk to someone if i change my mind or i want to be kind of a chameleon and just be a different person or whatever like they almost like call you out or whatever so it's just it's it's very interesting and some of the other downside is that i'm sure you guys have had is consistency and commitment bias right so an example is i talked about the um sugar-free bakery thing i was doing and we ended up getting uh we weren't legally allowed to use a key ingredient in canada until it's approved so i was like okay i have to shut this down but i didn't shut it down for like two months longer than i should have because i'd gone on here and made a public statement to everyone hey everyone look i'm doing this this awesome thing and i felt ashamed it was like in a logi in a logical thing um there's this great quote by bill murray that said if you think you want to be rich and famous try being rich first and see if that covers it and i think that that's really interesting and i i think like you want to be respected in your world you want to be like in the in film you'd want to be like the coen brothers right where it's like no one knows what the coen brothers look like but if they're at the academy words they're like ballers and they can get the attention and do whatever they want i don't think do you know what dad do you know who daft punk is yeah oh dude dude i was like they've got the best job because i mean they don't even have to show up and they probably make 10 million each a year just help these concerts because the edm or whatever the genre is they've they're huge concerts i'm like they don't even have to show up they could be anyone underneath that mask that could be anyone totally i think it's super smart and i don't i don't know what i mean what do you guys think sam you've shared some stories about being stopped in the street and stuff yeah i get sean do you get stopped i get stopped probably uh once or twice a week i don't think our audience is big in uh the suburbs of california so you know my my neighbors like average age is like 70 probably or something so i don't think these guys are listening but what's cool is like my trainer he came to me the other day and he's like i met these two guys in the gym they're like 21 22 years old and they were telling me like oh dude you gotta listen to this podcast it's like we're hooked on it and then we're getting so many ideas we're going to quit our job we're going to do the stuff and um and they should they're like he's like what's the podcast and it was like my first million he's like bro that's my buddy like that's that's why trey i'm going there right after this and they're like no way and so it's more of these like secondhand stories that have either a happened to me or b like kind of light me up a little bit like i mentioned my cousin's name on the last podcast because jack a jack who was on the podcast had invested in him and uh he's like dude he's like i know you do a podcast or i know you mention me the podcast because i'll just get a bunch of messages being like oh somebody you know he shouted you out or can we invest in your thing he's like it's amazing how much instant like kind of um you know love i get if you just say my name or say our company's name on the pod and those are cool moments yeah the serendipity like i talked about this idea sam and i were riffing on like um you know what business would you start if you could start anything today or just throwing out ideas and one of them was ddc pregnancy health so how do you build a super baby using supplements and blood work and all that kind of stuff and now i'm in partnership with this woman named katie dewhurst and we're working on this business together and it's been super fun and i never would have been able to do that and i literally you know met the best possible person for that idea i never would have been able to do that so it's like the pros are huge but then the cons are those kind of odd things or for you guys i would assume you're probably addicted to your podcast stats right oh where are we ranking on the itunes no well i would say we do i'm more addicted to twitter i think yeah so like i i was like oh i'm gonna be slick and turn off my notifications but what i do is i search the sampar my twitter handle like i search that and then type in latest so it's like i see my face yeah like i'm like so uh that kind of like that's stupid podcast is not podcast is not designed to be addictive because you don't get these like viral spurts uh it's slow and steady compounding with no immediate feedback you don't get comments after every episode like and that makes it suck and there's a lot of bad things about that but the good thing is it's very zen and so like of all the things i've done newsletter twitter and i've like tried to be successful in them try to grow them gotten some growth gotten to success gotten made money off of them and they all i like fade out because i'm like you know i don't like what this does to me you know i i i think one of the most toxic things you can do is care too much what other people think of you and it's fundamentally the loop of what social media is is you post something and then other people react to your either your photo what i look like what i sound like or what i said or what i thought right and so karen you know i hate tweeting something and then wanting to go check the mentions check the reaction to it because fundamentally i'm putting all my awareness and attention to what do other people think about me and that's it that doesn't have to be that it doesn't have to be bad so let me give you an example andrew you probably don't know this but i'm a fitness influencer now i've got four thousand so i here like i was i kind of did it as a joke but kind of not so basically uh i this the year of 2021 i wanted to work really hard to get very very very fit and i had a hit a little bit of a plateau and i was joking with sean but i kind of wasn't joking i was like i'm just gonna start posting on instagram constantly and just because i'm gonna change my identity to become a fitness person and i've been doing it lately and it's obviously it's not a big deal like no one actually watches but it's made me not eat certain foods because i'm like i i said i posted that i was gonna hit this weight and these people are like it's not real but in my head these people are expecting me to do it i have to come with the results so i can make fill this make this story complete and you know like be like the love of their lives and like get their attention and is that unhealthy kind of but i'm getting a great result yeah well i think um we got to talk about this book i read called wanting have you guys heard of this book no no have you ever heard so peter thiel talks about mimesis or memetic desire have you guys heard about this concept yeah he talks about like renee's gerard or whatever renee gerard i buy the books and i'm like i can't [ __ ] read this it's so dense like i know it's like a french david david david perrell did a bunch of articles about it and even then it's just too dense it's too academic i didn't get it and finally you know one of my friends who's like super into peter thiel gave me this book wanting and it was kind of a revelation for me so the idea is basically that you want the things that are modeled to you by other people so you know you meet a friend at a bar you want a beer here there's a martini maybe you go oh maybe i do want a martini right so that's that's like the most generic example of like a meaningless thing what about if your friend tells you he just raised around from sequoia capital right you start asking yourself why didn't i raise from sequoia why don't you know why does his startup have more employees than mine does why didn't i get that job title he has a sailboat why don't i have a sailboat why don't i have a rolex he moves to brooklyn why don't i live in brooklyn right so basically when you surround yourself with peers you start competing with them and you start wanting those things and you know i see this in my own group of friends uh you know when one of us buys a new car within a year we've all bought a new car right there's these waves or the other thing you see is mirroring so you know let's say i buy a tesla my friend might say i'm buying a classic ford mustang and i'm going to constantly talk about how much i love the rumble of the engine or working on it right it's like this like counter mirror um so it's super interesting because you don't actually want these things these are not real desires these are modeled to you and so in this book they talk about thin desires so these are like extrinsic things coming from the modeling of others right so wanting a rolex because people you know that are your peers value rolexes and then there's thick desires which are intrinsic they come from inside of you so you enjoy working in your garden you don't need to tell anyone you don't post about it it's not part of your identity you don't do it to impress anyone it's just something you quietly enjoy and so i think the big thing is coming up with what are my thick desires what are real versus what come from wanting to be like my heroes or my friends or whoever it is because if you're not careful of pruning this you will become this and if you spend too much time around people who want things that you don't actually want you will still desire and achieve those things so i love what you're saying keep going so you read this book and then there's like the question of what are your models who are your models and what did you you know what did you take away from this so yeah i mean like are you jealous of jeff bezos no jeff bezos is not someone that you compete with right jeff bezos is off in this celebrity world right jay-z that's not someone you compete with right the people you compete with are people within your bubble like it could be each other us three maybe there's other things that there could be other things that people are more jealous i i guarantee you anyone who's on twitter for example anyone on twitter in business you know you and the morning brew guys like it doesn't matter if you like them or anything you're still in a memetic competition when i see sam's post as a fitness influencer you bet your ass i work out harder that day totally well and exactly he now values health so that's that's good if you want to be healthy hanging out with sam will probably make you healthier over time right so that's a good thing um but so you know and there's so many different bubbles there's so many different worlds so for example if you live in san francisco the thing that everyone wants is you know fundraising and valuation or who your investors are if you're in new york it might be about your wealth your art collection or your fashion in la it would be you know what awards have you won where do you get restaurant reservations uh you know athletes it's olympic medals chefs it's michelin stars comedians with netflix specials uh you know you you name it so the way to figure out who your models are as well is actually to ask kind of an odd question you say who do i not want to succeed right and maybe it's deep within you right but it might be that guy on twitter who you know you're friendly with and everything's fine but you kind of he bothers you or he's maybe a little ahead of you has maybe ten thousand more followers you just don't want him to succeed that's probably who you're in memetic rivalry with um and and so the real question is you know how do you a align with people who will lead you down a path of this mimetic copying that will actually make you happy so that's spending time with people who are actually similar to you and want things that are your thick desires right being healthy being safe gardening you know whatever that is and then the other question is how do you opt out um and and really that's pruning you know what do you read who do you listen to who do you spend time with um and you know for an example i thought about for myself you know i was spending all this time reading about warren buffett i've idolized warren buffett forever but when i think about you know what does warren buffett actually do in his day he's a guy who can sit there and read all day reading annual reports that's what his life is set up for i would kill myself like i have no interest in doing that and i think i'd be very bored so i have to be very careful not to over index on warren buffett the other thing you can do is you can opt out so you can say you know i'm going to be like dave chappelle i'm going to move to ohio where i'm just you know a redneck and you know in a small community or whatever for me i live in victoria you know i'm not as exposed to this as other people and there's this great story of this guy who's a michelin star chef so you think about chefs the ultimate is you open a restaurant and a really high-end restaurant you get a michelin star this guy sebastian brass did that all he wanted was to get a michelin star and he got it and when he got it it didn't actually make him happier he just wanted a second star then he got a second star it didn't make him happy either and he just lived in fear of losing it because they just come and inspect you you know it'll be like they'll come to your restaurant and if the tablecloth isn't perfectly clean or the food is in a certain way you know you get rejected and so you end up living your life by these arbitrary rules that don't actually make you happy and you fight for something that you know is not what you actually want so this guy is a baller he just said michelin i want you to remove my star take me out of the guide i'm out right so you can do stuff like that but that takes like brass balls that's very difficult to do why did you mention read why i mean you're talking about reading and everything and i want to ask you what you're reading why did you mention read-wise uh on your document well i think like you know i'm like you guys i just read all sorts of random stuff and i'll read all these books that'll make a huge impact on me but then i'll forget everything right and so i use this tool called read wise where my kindle highlights basically get emailed to me once a day at random and it's like uh there's like a memory uh thing called spaced repetition and so it basically sends you uh you know every week every month i'll get all these ideas back boomerang back to me and i just kind of am reminded of some of these things i've read when you're reading do you just read book after book yeah usually what i i do that as well i'm thinking that's actually really stupid if i find like a book that like has a big impact or as like has a ton of learnings i should probably reread that every handful of months or something like you know you you you should do whatever it takes to really understand and grasp and assigned reading not as much like go from thing to thing to thing you know what i mean you know do you know what the feynman method is no it's basically you you read the thing and then you teach it and you can't truly understand it until you teach it so like a way of remembering really well would be go on the podcast and in a very cogent way summarize what you've learned and then keep bringing it up for yourself right like i i mean you know just even writing out some notes for this podcast it forced me to actually go what did i learn in this book and i'm sure it'll actually hammer it into my head better that's how i used to be in college uh i didn't know that that was a technique but i had figured out pretty early on that the way i could get better grades like i wanted to have good grades but i didn't want to keep studying as my other i felt like other people studied so much they spent so many hours in the library and i just didn't find it i didn't want to do it and i was like well here's what i'll do i'll basically quickly skim the material and then i will lead a study group where i'll teach it to that group and in that process i was like a horrible teacher for the first like hour when i was doing it because i don't know the material yet i actually don't even understand it i barely remember half of it but i remember half of it and like by teaching it i remembered that half and i quickly figured out the other half i didn't know and i just remember like that's how i studied for every final when i was in college and it was um it was pretty amazing because i could study half the time as other people because what they would do is they would try to just ingest it and just keep ingesting it they just try to keep reading it and rereading it and writing notes and rereading it and they would never try to articulate it off the top of their head to anybody else or answer a question you know in public with anybody else and so they never did that and they just tried to like solidify it in their head but it never really did um you know for them or took way longer to do it it's such a hack right to be able to summarize it in one sentence or have a you know have a metaphor or you know whatever it is can you do that just by writing a blog post about it or do you actually have to speak about it oh you could do that i i used to run this thing called the anti-mba and it was a weekly book club basically we would read a book a month and each week we would divide that book into quarters so we'd talk about a book every week and i would basically be leading this and we would have 10 or 20 people show up and i would lead it and i remember i learned like crazy every book i was like mastering it but i wasn't sure if i could do that now just through blogging or if i actually had to like organize and talk to people about it because that'd be a pain in the ass one thing i've seen is my uh uh i don't know this is kind of an unpopular uh way to think or something i don't know i don't think this is the this is how much people think but listen like andrew so i think andrew i think you're super smart and amazing and great and i love when you bring these ideas because it makes me feel like it brings all these new thoughts into my head um but i think you and i think sam to an extent do something that i used to do that i'm trying to stop doing and that is like um this constant optimization and so like you know this idea that i'm going to read a book i'm going to find a great book and then sam's like i'm going to reread it because i want it to sink in i'm gonna drill it into my head and andrew's like no what i do is i highlight using this tool and i set up an auto trigger to email me back the best highlights like old me would have been like dope love that that's gonna be my solution to this like underlying ever present problem i'm going to keep seeking these solutions that are like new hacks new optimizations new like kind of techniques and solutions and methods and um and the one like realization i've had by talking to some other people outside my trainer is really the one who drilled this in me because he would be talking to me during a workout he would say something to me i would go run to my notepad i would write it down because he said this really wise thing and it was so good i wanted to like remember it as a nugget of gold and he told me he goes he goes you know you you won't have to write these down um and i go i go what do you mean also how nerdy of you to be writing this down i would literally stop a set and i would drop the weight and i would go write the thing down because i'm like you just said it so perfectly and in my head i'm like i'm gonna know this i'm gonna remember this i'm gonna tell other people i'm gonna say this on the pod it's gonna look great my head actually is silently thinking all these other things it's like trying to like achieve some stupid goal because i'm like this is the answer this is the nugget that's going to be my next hit my next tweet my next whatever that's going to be great so that's like you know a lame thing to admit but that's true that's where my brain was going um but i was like what do you mean i'll have to write these down like you know i'll just remember it and he's like you won't feel like you lack something and so you'll stop like trying to catch everything and grab everything and hold on to everything and learn the next new thing what you'll realize is like you already know the answers uh he's like you know it's like a thin book you didn't like imagine a book that ended in 20 pages and it's like you know for for a diet book right you can keep searching for the next fad diet you know the atkins diet then the slow carb diet and then the carnivore diet and you're you're just cycling through to all these different diets trying to find the next solution and read the next thing and in reality you kind of know the answer the answer is you know don't eat too much and eat like basically like eat real food mostly plants and not too much three lines you that is the answer and but instead of actually just let sitting in it you want it to be more complicated than that you would like it to be that actually there is more i need to go learn and find and try and buy this you know get this app that's going to do my intermittent fasting and then put this ketone drops in my drink and then wear a patch that measures my glucose monitor and like all these optimizations and so i've actually spent so much of my life trying these different optimizations and i've really i'm just saying this as almost like a public service announcement of like if that's you if you've done a bunch of these optimizations you're kind of on this endless path of optimizing and you do get results it's not that you don't get any results but like i've now found this like other way that's a lot more peaceful and a lot more fun and it's basically um get rid of the underlying like feeling of lack and doubt that you have that's causing you to constantly chase the next best method and solution and answer i think that really resonates and one of the things i didn't talk about was my routines and how that was making me miserable i think often routines are great and best practices are great but they end up creating conditions under which you can have a good day and if you don't follow the conditions your brain starts saying oh it's not a good day because i didn't get that workout in or i didn't get i didn't do my cold plunge and do my tim ferris tea in the morning i didn't do my evernote routine i didn't do a gratitude journal i didn't use this app right there's endless things um and i totally resonate with that like one of the practices for me was like how do i not check my aura ring how do i not check my blood glucose all these stupid things that are giving me they're tickers right yeah there you go like they're tickers for life and tickers make you miserable you know look at a stock ticker look at kpis look at revenue day to day hour to hour and you're miserable you shouldn't have those for your life yeah and i i should say it's bad for business for me to say this because this podcast and all of my content and all everything i put out is optimizations hacks shortcuts you know ways to be better ways to better yourself and this constant uh curiosity about what are some other things i could try to better myself what are some other areas i want to be better and what are some ways i could be better and so i'm like juggling these two things that are almost complete like opposition um and like you know and i and i'm not perfect on it either right like i still wake up swipe over and check the bitcoin price even though i know it's this roller coaster and like when it's red i'm starting my day off with like you know a tiny jab and when it's green i start my day off with this this this great little delight that like i don't control and so now my my first mood is up to you know the conditions of like you know [ __ ] crypto prices which is silly totally sean what do you think what do you think people are going to think of an episode like this i'll be i'll be curious i'll be because i i sometimes i get nervous about talking about this [ __ ] because i'm like i don't want to pontificate too much i don't want to like act like our way or my way or your way is necessarily better than any other way i get nervous about like having like a guru productivity vibe i get nervous i'm like and then i also get nervous i'm like these people just want like money-making schemes let's just give it to them um i'm very like think about like chamath right why is true math interesting he's interesting because he goes you know he goes on cnbc he talks about all this crazy investing stuff and then he goes with kara swisher and he like pours his heart out and he's interesting and empathic well yeah and like he doesn't give a [ __ ] yeah you do a disservice if you don't show the negative side of all this stuff at the same time because people will just blindly think you know oh yeah these guys have it all figured out and we don't so i think we're all as miserable as anyone else i think two things is what you said i think you're not giving the audience enough like the people who really listen to this podcast they they know this is not money making schemes we just like we are shooting the [ __ ] about business stuff and we're kind of business nerds and that's what they like so it's not actually that they're looking for oh god i came to this to find my next million dollar idea that's the like surface level thing and then when you get when you get through the door you realize that's that's not it the second thing is it's just like like this feeling you're having like what are people going to think of this episode i'm riding myself of that that question uh that question doesn't come into my brain anymore why because who really not at all i'm i'm not gonna be wearing red robes he's gonna have his head shaved dude he already does she shows up to the podcast half the time wearing a robe exactly uh that's i'm not saying i have rid myself of it i'm saying i am trying to rid myself of that uh of that question right and it's coming up less and less why because two things hey i don't want to be that way i don't want to sit here and be the dancing monkey performing on the stage just just for their entertainment i want to be here for my entertainment and um like who are the people who are going to love this podcast the people who love what we talk about period so if we're talking about something we are interested in that they're always going to be into it and if we just keep that as the method right who are my customers the people that love what i do that becomes the sort of like the the the most joyful way to do you know any kind of business or any kind of product because it is just you pushed out and so then you don't have to worry about what are they going to want did they like me do they not like me is this good is this bad you know i liked it but are they going to think this it's like those questions just disappear if you commit to uh who are my customers the people that love what i do so same thing for this who who are listeners the people that like what we talk about period so then i don't need to if if i liked what we talked about then i don't need to worry about it and that becomes a very simple filter that's internal and not like seeking kind of what what are other people going to think about this yeah yeah yeah and and you and i agree on a lot of stuff about how we feel about the audience i guess sometimes i think of it like i'm going to do whatever the hell i want to do and other times i do think i am here i exist to serve like others right so like you could say like well just don't give a [ __ ] don't give don't care about what other people think yeah i but what if i phrased it of like well i'm i'm here to service other people or you know what i mean it's like that and that's a fine line andrew's saying one of the things one of the top is being you you know that's the service the services being you in public public transparently you know lately i've been watching all the dave chappelle stand up comedy from netflix i just kind of like rediscovered him and watched them all and if you watch the first one it's kind of like a generic dirty stand-up or yeah his old one from like 20 early 2017 or whatever and then as you watch them they get more and more introspective and darker and longer stories and different style and it's cool to see someone evolve or see some you know deeper emotional range or whatever so i don't i don't think it really matters like at the end of the day yes you guys you know this podcast you do i i listen i have to treat it like crack right when i listen to you guys i get so fired up i'm always in the shower and i'm going [ __ ] why don't we do that business or i should start this or you know i i love it but and that's that's the that's what people love about the podcast but at the same time like yeah i think talking about this stuff is fine like i think look at a couple of the bigger podcasts that are kind of like people we like to listen to sometimes so look at rogan do you think rogan gets on the pod every day and says like do you think he's thinking all right um you know what do the people want like what does the audience want how do i make this conversation entertaining for them like i think that's so far back in his mind where it seems no like he's just having a conversation with somebody he finds interesting he talks about what's interesting to him in that thing but you know what if rogan came on and he said i had a big fight with my wife this morning and he started talking about that for 30 minutes and didn't let the guest talk yeah he's broken the format yeah but but also with rogan like you'll notice he like for example um he'll say stuff like uh he changes his words he's like well like and i agree with this he'll be like well you know i'm not informed on that topic so i don't even want to rant about it of course or he'll say like uh you know i um like i'll notice how he'll use certain words to be respectful um and he's like well you know and people have asked him i was like well i just didn't know and i know that i influence people so i just want to keep in mind that i don't want to you know say something incorrect and so that's keep so i i i don't think you have to entirely tell people to uh that you don't give a [ __ ] about that i guess what i mean is like rogan's format where he's like yeah i'm going to talk to an astrophysicist one day and then i'm going to talk to an mma meathead the next day and then i'm going to do a drinking podcast with my buddies while we watch some other [ __ ] that you don't get you're not looking at i'm just looking at i'm going to talk out loud and i'm going to do it for i'm going to do three hour long episodes yeah dude but rogan's a [ __ ] comedian his whole shtick is that he gets in front of people and like comedians are inherently like the most neediest people he gets on a stage and like it needs them to laugh and reply and if he bombs he feels bad what i'm saying is his show broke a bunch of rules that other people would have had our episode should be one hour you should have like this you know like this intro you shouldn't one day be talking about one topic and then you're the the people who want to hear neil degrasse tyson don't care about brendan shaw or whatever else sure and then you have like like lex friedman huge huge podcast his channel he's created and the guy's talking about the nerdiest of the nerdiest subjects in the most like monotone voice right so it's like he's not mr charisma he's not um talking about uh pop culture and like other topic because he's not he found the balance of doing what's interesting to him in his normal personality um and i just think that's just like a better way to go than yeah i'm just trying to say don't don't act like rogan's not human and has the same insecurities and like well i want to please people i want to look oh wow bernie did really well i should do bernie more often you know like [ __ ] like that actually yeah i don't buy i don't buy that you don't care like i think everybody cares you can say it and i i get what you mean like you know that should be the attitude going into it but it is unavoidable sure i think like well we all give a [ __ ] how we're perceived and we'd all be choked if you know i i made that tweet the other day and um i got a i got a message from a friend that said are you sure you want to tweet that right because he'd gotten some messages from people saying oh my god andrew's having a mental breakdown on twitter he said are you sure you want to tweet that yeah you said are you sure you want to tweet that and i was like oh my god have i made this terrible yeah [ __ ] that's why i tweeted it yeah i know yeah resonated with lots of people it got lots of traction and got lots of nice notes about it but um you know it's it's scary putting putting this stuff out there yeah i i i don't find that stuff to be scary but that's weird when someone says i hate i would hate that interaction are you sure you want to tweet that yeah dude i just like it took me like an hour to write that i'm [ __ ] sure it's a double down for sam it's like you know what like i'm going to double down on that now yeah i want a friend to text me that if they actually think that though like i think that's a valuable service right yeah no i don't but uh that's okay different breads i i i like also if i have a friend my friend jack sometimes i'll tweet stuff and he'll like reply like that's not true or like what are you like he'll like argue with me and i'll tweet i'll text him i go jack don't argue with me in public like don't don't you dare like like what time he like brothers do that sometimes drives me crazy oh dude i'm like we're family this stays in the family don't you don't you [ __ ] you defend me you you laid out a traffic for me as i will for you you don't talk you don't argue with me in public he always [ __ ] does that like one time i tweeted out the the numbers of the podcast and he was like um but like megaphone is wrong or he said something like uh he's like oh but you count youtube that kind of like uh that's not really a dollar he said something like that i don't even remember what it was and i'm like well what the [ __ ] jack just like shut up i'm like just text me but we're not going to argue in public you're supposed to i don't even know how we got on that but anyway my point was not bringing up that we shouldn't do this stuff i'm just curious just to hear what what the feedback is we care about feedback i care about i'll take care of myself i care about feedback tweet at us and uh you can test me and see if i respond to any of it and fail my uh i think so how how often are you keeping this how often are you holding your phone how often do you use your phone oh well i'm basically i'm down from six hours a day of screen time to two just over two hours and i'm basically just around random days i've just been taking my apple watch so if i have a zoom call or something i'll take my phone but if i don't i'll just bring my apple watch and it's been strangely freeing right because you look i can still see the text and i can get the calls what is it apple watch to airpod yeah i watched the airplane and if i'm texting i've got to do this stupid scratch or siri and so it's just not fun to text and so i just don't do it andrew one other thing you met steve jobs yeah i met steve jobs tell me what that was what happened well so a lot of people don't know this but when i was 15 my very first business was a website with an incredibly embarrassing nerdy name it was called mac teens.com and it was me and a kid from hawaii and another canadian kid and we all made this tech news website and we started writing you know reviews and news and all that kind of stuff um and we started getting a lot of traffic and like breaking apple rumors and stuff and i ended up getting invited to go to mac world as like a member of the press and you know i got invited to this tour of the apple store in new york when that was a you know it was brand new it was the first one i think and so i walk into this tour and i think like we're just going to get some pr flack touring us around and i'm standing outside waiting and a limousine rolls up and it's steve jobs and he gets out and he shakes my hand and i'm you know 15 the guy's my hero i've read every single biography of him i'm like a quivering mess and i spent the next hour me and like five other journalists getting toured around the apple store with steve jobs and i just asked a bunch of questions about you know about the products they're releasing it was like a pr thing so it's not like i got to ask him deep questions but it was pretty freaking cool on the bucket list and what was his like uh presence like or how did he treat people or what did you kind of take away from from just being around him well i mean you gotta remember he was he was in steve jobs pr you know mac world ceo mode so he was just incredibly polished i remember he was talking about uh the cd burner in the 17-inch imac and i was like enraptured it's a [ __ ] like oem cd burner right but he's making it sound like it's the greatest thing in the world i mean you know the reality distortion field is obviously real um and yeah he's just an amazing amazing guy and it was it was cool to me did you read this story that this guy tweeted out yesterday i thought you might have a story uh related to this this guy his tweet kind of went viral about he was trying to sell his company to steve jobs and he [ __ ] up did you read this no like i said it's the guy who was what happened ceo of ilike which was like a kind of like a music discovery service kind of like in the early yeah you know like startup days and um it was like a popular service and um it's like apple wanted to apple was interested in acquiring them and he's like perfect like apple would be my dream place to get acquired and they go and he gets to have a meeting with steve jobs and he sits in the meeting with steve jobs and he's like you know i started off a little rough because i was so nervous to be in front of steve jobs he's like but we kind of hit our groove in the presentation we hit our demo like you know like first he's like the demo kind of went off the rails first because the executive suite wi-fi was down and it's like oh [ __ ] how are we we're not on the internet how do we do our demo well we like recovered and steve asked a few questions while we were talking but we had great product answers and you could just tell he was digging it and um so his story is basically that at the end of the the meeting he was like look like i think you guys are great um and i think you built something something good here uh you know we'd like to buy your company i'm gonna um you know like like i'd like to buy your company we're i'll talk to eddie and we'll figure out you know eddie will take it from here he'll he'll deal with the details and uh and then he's like see the guy like kind of didn't want the meeting to end right there he's you know first he's like that's amazing but he's like you know like what uh what range you know would you be thinking about for for price for for an acquisition and then like steve kind of like the dial the dial like turns up a little bit like this conference gets a little more serious talking about the price now and he's like um he's like what's your revenue and how much did you raise what was the valuation at your last financing and the guy's like uh like you know revenue uh like we haven't we're pre-revenue we're super small right now but you know we we raised that 50 million valuation and we've added like like millions of users since then um i think he said 50 million users since then which is some absurd number and uh and steve jobs like uh we probably acquire it for 50 million and then the guys like went from this high of like steve jobs just said he wants to buy my company to like oh [ __ ] we've been working like since the last round we raised two years ago we've been working acquired all these users um i'd have to go to my team and be like hey you've created essentially no value between last valuation and and the exit here um so he's like you know doesn't want it to just leave it there and he's like um he's like uh you know i just think i don't think my team will be i don't i don't think my team or the investors would uh you know that would be acceptable to them and then he's like he's like we'll make it he's like we'll like we'll convince them like that was like steve jobs response something like that and the guy's like you know i just feel like um you know i think we're worth more than that i think we're i think we're worth 150 million and he like pause for a second he goes actually like i know we're worth i know we're worth 150 million and he's like jobs got like pissed he's like you know do you have another offer on the table have you been offered 150 million dollars but is that how you know that you're worth that and then the guy's like just pause for something he's like he's like [ __ ] he's like you're a liar and he's like he's like forget this we're not doing this deal and basically like walked out and then he's like we tried to salvage the deal like we tried to like with eddie eddie tried to like make it all good he's like steve jobs called him later it was like i don't trust you you you i don't trust you i think you're a liar you know over you overstated like you know ever you overplayed your hand basically and i was like we're not doing this oh i love that that is awesome who wrote that oh wow what company that is an awesome story this guy uh let me pull up his name so his name is ali uh partavi so his his twitter handle is a-p-a-a-a apart ovi so a-p-a-r-t ovi what what ended up happening to his company that did it so i think uh let's see what what ended up happening so it's what a baller story i think that's like soon after that apple released the itunes genius sidebar it was a rip-off of their thing facebook copied their thing and they sold the company for a loss within a year um that was the sort of like the oh my god the other good one is drew the story of drew houston going into they were talking about dropbox apple and steve jobs just starts saying feature not a product you're a feature not a product we can just rip you off and i mean in some ways steve jobs is right i think that criticism is fair over the next decade couldn't rip them off though it'd be irrelevant but at the same time drew houston went on to become a billionaire and build this great public company so dude i actually i love stories where steve jobs is wrong because the guys it was like a [ __ ] [ __ ] like you know he [ __ ] that guy was he a brilliant yeah but like i was thinking the other day um where he like had this quote where he goes to that guy who uh who was selling pepsi and he was like do you want to sell sugar or water your whole life or do you want to come and change the world and i'm like part of me is like badass that's awesome steve good job yeah soda sucks whatever you're doing is doesn't suck and then i'm like dog what you've just created is [ __ ] candy you know if we hate if i if i'm supposed to hate zuckerberg i should dislike you too like you're selling the crack pipe he's selling the crack what's the difference and so you know what i mean like it's like it's the same it's like it's the same thing like so so anyway whenever i hear these stories about him and being arrogant i'm like yeah you're badass you're awesome you're always right and then also like you're a dick shut the [ __ ] up like i was i was as a ceo i was terrible because i couldn't do that right like imagine sam you're hiring someone and you say like do you want to change the face of publishing forever right you just sound like such a douche but you talk to most silicon valley ceos and they say something like that i just could never bring myself to say that well part of me is envious i'm like oh wow you actually believe that you are doing something and then part of me is like um um you're full of it i just read this book uh called endurance have you guys heard of this book called endurance oh my god it's amazing it's i never want to feel like your life is good read that oh my god i couldn't put it down sean you know what it is i haven't read it but i've never seen the tie i've seen the cover i know the cover in my brain so basically in the early 1900s probably between 1900 and like 1925 it was called like the heroic era of arctic expeditions so they had steam engines and they had combustible engines but it was still they still had sails and they didn't have radios and so these guys would sail from england all the way down to antarctica the very southern part of the world to try and figure things out the world wasn't really well mapped out but it kind of was so basically it was kind of safe but mostly not safe and this guy named ernest shackleton basically led this expedition of 30 people and they got stuck in the ant in antarctica and it's basically the story about their two and a half year or maybe two year expedition to survive and what i learned reading that book is basically the pack the the the people you're leading they mimic the behavior of the leader and so for a while i was against this like we're gonna change the world or like you know i should be vulnerable and i should let people know like you know things aren't going that good but now after reading that book i'm like ah no [ __ ] it you gotta like convince everyone that it's gonna be okay no matter what totally it's an amazing book too i am when i get stressed out at work one of the things i love to do is to watch um uh what is it called alone have you guys seen that show they literally dump people in the middle of nowhere and it's competition to see who can survive in the wilderness all by themselves for the longest oh my god you know you're watching people eating rats and like trying to catch fish in the freezing cold how long do they last he cuts his leg open with a hatchet or whatever you know usually it's like some some people go like three months four months six months but a lot of people are out pretty quick and the the shackleton book is exactly like that i watch it and i just feel so relaxed because i'll be cozy on the couch and warm in my bed reading the book and it really makes you appreciate uh just how comfortable our lives are you should read that book sean so we could talk about it because it like i read it over uh two days i think it it it was it it's riveting i i posted really it was crazy i can't believe that that that people survived that and it made me feel thankful and it showed me that like in order to be a leader you do need to convince people and yourself that everything's going to be okay when i read that i was like i don't want to be a good leader i'm not willing to do what this guy was willing to do am i willing to go this far something funny just happened on twitter so uh speaking of distractions and and all that good stuff and speaking of the the memetic kind of like uh who are your models and then who do you want to see who do you not like to see win all right so uh so bezos jeff bezos just tweeted out this thing he goes uh he goes you know you should listen and be open but don't let anybody tell you who you are this is just one of the many that this was and he posted a photo of a baron's article of a headline of a front page of barons which says amazon.bomb and it's a picture of jeff bezos's face on a bomb and it says that the title is the idea that amazon's ceo jeff bezos has pioneered a new business is silly he's just another middleman and the stock market is starting to catch on the real winners this was in like the early 2000's yeah this is in um i don't know when sorry go ahead giannis or something like that oh yeah this is 1999. he goes uh it says the real winners on the net and it's like apostrophe net like internet uh the real winners on the net will be firms that sell their own products directly to consumers just look what happened to sony and dell that's what's gonna happen to amazon and uh and so bezos was basically saying like you know people told us there's one of many things where people told us we're gonna fail he goes today amazon is one of the most successful companies and has revolutionized two entirely different industries and then elon musk tweeted that it replied with just a silver a silver medal with the number two on it like the emoji with a place [Laughter] you gotta give them because elon's currently richer than bezos either because of that i don't know space yeah it's doing better than you know i think it's the rich thing which is douchey if it's a space thing that's not douchey if it's a rich thing that's douchey but it's so funny because you were cinematic right those guys were in a rivalry yeah you were saying like to us jeff bezos is not really the rival we don't really root for his you know whatever uh it doesn't like hurt us personally when jeff bezos wins a little bit more but but for these guys these are their memetic rivals right like these are their their peers uh that they sort of are in competition with but dude also this is i do want to see elon lose a little bit because he gets too smug with his help gradius be smart because he is in fact amazing but how baller is that tweet hilarious it has way more like you said earlier you said you know you said [ __ ] steve jobs and i think in order to be that successful you have to have some kind of personality disorder oh yeah or like yeah or something and you look at musk or bezos or if you read more about bezos i think he's a really difficult person to work for like all these guys are so complicated and a hundred years ago you just wouldn't know there wasn't twitter you just wouldn't see this this would all go on behind the scenes and it's crazy that we get to see stuff like that well i don't even think it's that complicated musk is really successful because he's incredibly smart and has a a complex because his father probably didn't love him um like like it's probably quite simple and but it's it works right i'm thankful that well that's uh great i think i don't know where you got it from but you know show me a great man and i'll show you a bad man what is that quote well i always say um i don't know if i got it from anywhere not but uh all men are also evil men all great great and like something like that right yeah great men are bad men um and in order to in order to be great you have to do bad stuff or you may not think it's bad but like let's say that like uh 60 of americans think obama is a saint well like the people who he droned they don't think he's a saint i've got afghani friends and they'll be like oh i [ __ ] hate obama you know he he droned my family and so but like so in order to like do great [ __ ] and be loved by at a large scale you're going to piss off a lot of people the way i would put it it would be better might be all but great men are sad men right so they have a sadness don't want to help me andrew don't want to be a disorder that's driving to do this because why else would anyone do it right talking about the shackleton expedition these guys are the shackleton expedition of business why would anyone choose to do that unless they have a personality disorder or like deep trauma right but memetic rivalry andrew just went up to you perfect uh yeah like actually i think your example of like obama drone striking people is a little too extreme i think it's more like uh elon musk isn't a is a great inventor and businessman uh that doesn't also mean he's got great views on the vaccine and uh on he's not a great husband maybe and like yeah you know we will praise somebody for an aspect like on this podcast i will happily pray somebody for an aspect of something they do that's interesting like this is like the jake paul tweet i did where i was like jake paul is a great marketer a great self-promoter like i don't even think that's arguable like i think he's clearly a great self-promoter that is how he is so famous as he promoted himself uh into fame and uh like people are like yeah but he you know he's accused of assault on this girl and like he's a jerk and like haven't you seen these videos where he makes these crew jokes i said oh like sorry did i say he's my like he's my hero and that like he is a great boyfriend like i don't think i said that i think he said he's a great marketer and self-promoter and you can learn from right i appreciate that and that's the way i take it which is um you know anybody that that you praise or you call out for being awesome or call out for being bad it's not you're not saying they are either all great or all bad it's like they are great in ways and bad in ways and everybody is that and it's not even that you need to get point you can like how he builds cars but not how he treats his marriage right yeah [Music] you

and some random [ __ ] okay and from that random uh stumble uh describe what you heard what what kind of podcast is this um it's a podcast for entrepreneurs uh to get inspiration and ideas uh yeah it sounds like by the way i'm not being condescending i thought it sounded sounded great but i heard it sounded great like something i would i would listen to but that's what i was going to ask you you know is this something you would have earlier in your entrepreneurial career yes because now you know you're now you're mister i've made it you're you know you don't need that inspirational juice anymore or maybe you do i don't know enough never enough inspirational juice look he doesn't listen to podcasts like ours sean he just buys them yeah most people listen i purchase uh so one thing we i don't know what you plan on talking about but one thing we could talk about that might be interesting is my snowmobile accident yeah so like we're live now so we're we're recording now so yes we let's we could do it so what we'll do i'll ask you about that i want to know about that and then also we're going to talk to you about some different business ideas and i've got a few that i want to ask your opinion on but um so let me do it let me do the super short intro this is brian halligan he's the c was that you were the ceo of hubspot now the chairman or exec chairman or something very fancy like that something fancy like that yes all right cool and you um you basically like like i think like two weeks so basically uh hubspot bought the hustle my company and like two weeks after you got into a really bad accident right yeah and you like broke like a dozen a dozen bones or i mean it was pretty serious yeah i was like i hope ryan's okay but also i was i was like if this deal if this would have happened like two weeks before the deal closed i wonder if that would have changed anything yeah cause i was a big proponent of the deal i was really happy we did it um i tell you the whole story i'm just gonna go uh i was snowmobiling up in vermont with my son luke and we were we were right yo we're we're right in the middle of nowhere right square in the middle of nowhere and we were cruising along and he was he was cruising along and i asked him to slow down he just kind of got confused between the gas and the brake and um he put his jammed his finger on the gas and he just panicked a little bit and we basically flew off a cliff and landed on a tree and wow i don't remember neither of us actually he's 17. neither of us remember the accident at all and we were both passed out before the we hit the tree and passed out after so we're both lying there in the snow passed out i wake up first i wake him up and we are banged up like it's like a cartoon or arms and legs or you know we're a mess and i thought this is it it's 4 30 in the afternoon it's freezing cold we're in the middle of nowhere no one knows where we are we're gonna die tonight um and i reached into my pocket and grabbed my phone thinking there's no way there's signal and i i had three but i had enough signal i called nine i never called 911 my whole life called 9-1-1 she picked up i roughly described where we were right square in the middle of nowhere and um then they call in the troops and the troops in vermont are volunteer firefighters um they're not you know professional emts and ambulances and stuff and it took him about an hour and one interesting thing that happened is they kind of came but one guy who found us came from below us and he marched up the hill and he's yelling kind of yelling for us and we were yelling back and he finally got to us he starts asking us questions he says wait are you brian halligan i'm like yeah he said hey i'm joey i'm the guy who plows your driveway [Laughter] like that's a volunteer firefighter and they are bad asses these volunteer firefighters so they strapped us to sleds pulled us straight up out of the you know ravine back onto the trails and then you know helicoptered us to the hospital when you're laying there are you just in an incredible amount of pain what's broken incredible amount of pain what what did what broke what was broken on your body i broke like 12 or 13 bones but but my i could show the pictures but my left knee like my left knee my tibia my my uh femur and tibia broke my right wrist broke my left elbow trash my right left shoulder trash and then my i already had a lot of loose screws up top and now the screws get even looser just like you had like a concussion or something yeah i had a concussion and um yours i broke my i hit the tree so hard broke my helmet oh my god and you're what about your son he was banged up too he broke his femur which is a terrible bone bone to break and he broke his knee and he got a concussion so he was banged up then you had to like you had to cut him out of the will i mean after that for this accident he's doing great i mean he's 17 so he bounced back fast like he was at soccer practice today and stuff so really really bounce back you're sitting in this chair it looks like you're not a wheelchair just no listen no no no no i was in a wheelchair for three and a half months though a good long chunk i can walk i can drive i can do like a light hike like my brain is 100 i'm fine i think my brain's actually better uh and and what percentage of you you know sort of attributes this to the hustle deal the timing is coincidental i mean it was the adrenaline from the hustle deal got the whole whole thing you um and like so basically you know i don't know so brian uh hubspot at this point is like a maybe i forget the market cap today maybe in the 30 billion range uh revenue north of a billion employees at like what 2500 or 3000 like so this we're talking like a really big company at this point but you had been the the ceo from the beginning and after this accident you you know removed yourself you replaced yourself and now you're the executive chairman did the accident when you're having this like near-death moment where you're like what am i doing with my life like what what did it was it like a crisis like this like when you're done uh like recovering it's a perfect question lying there in the snow thinking i was gonna die i thought to myself yourself how was your life are you proud of it are you enjoying your life as you're thinking about it a second time if you live what do you want to change about your life um it was sort of a reset button for me and i think over time as i look back at the accident it may be the best thing that ever happened to me because i've made a lot of life changes since then that um like what what what sorts of changes yeah i broke up with my girlfriend of a couple years um [Music] i you know my whole life was hubspot it wasn't i really didn't spend any time on any other causes like i read a check and so i went on a kind of a broad search for a cause that i could put my energy and some cash into and i found one that i fell in love with it's called the woods hole oceanographic institute it's like the harvard of the ocean yeah i've hung out there a bit right next to coffee obsession the coffee shop down there exactly exactly um and what got me about the institute and besides the fact that i live near it is and knew nothing about it despite living here for 10 years was a blatant optimism amongst the scientists on their ability to slow and reverse climate change leveraging the ocean in a sustainable way like it really caught me by surprise as i was walking the halls and getting to know them there's a lot of optimism and there's a lot of stuff on the lab there that they think can scale on a global level so i pick them and i'm on their board and i'm doing a lot with them these days that's been very exciting so yeah i've done a lot of different stuff like now i used to work out sort of casually every day i'm like get my heart rate up into the 160s daily like i'm not screwing around anymore i want to live a long healthy life like i'm 54 and i'd like to live a long healthy life i don't want to be an old man when i'm 70. i want to want to be a very vibrant seven-year-old what have you been reading since your accident is there like did you did it put you down this different path of learning and you're like okay i want to explore this path or this spiritual thing or this giving thing i don't know uh like a a different trajectory initially it was like lock yourself in a room and keep it dark and don't read and don't uh don't see anything when you've got a uh concussion yeah yeah i read random stuff but i you know i'll tell you one thing that surprised me is uh when you have a concussion like i had a neurosurgeon helping me i had a shrink helping me i had a shaman come and visit me i had all kinds of people consulting me on how to recover from a concussion and from the neurosurgeon to the shaman they all said to do one thing what do you think that thing is sleep meditate meditate meditate yeah they all were just like you got to meditate that's the way you're going to get through it and what what were you a meditator before i was not i never really met or i tried and i was just so bad at it that i gave up and so yeah i'm a pretty big meditator these days so like i'm just looking right here at the books i'm reading like one of the books is becoming supernatural um i'm not sure about it yet i'm only through chapter one but it's basically a meditation book i'm taking a class on vedic i'm not even sure i'm saying that right meditation next week because i want to get better at it just seems like it unlocks a lot um so this is this is kind of like a movie right so like guy builds like i have no i don't know if this is true or not but guy builds huge tech company becomes billionaire has life-changing life-changing accident changes everything gives it all up explores the world it becomes like uh it saves saves the option starts and yeah this is like this is like uh this is a movie right this is this is how it's going to be the other thing i would say is i'm still involved with hubspot so i'm still like today i've had four hubspot calls so i'm not i'm i'm very much engaged with hubspot i'm just not engaged in stuff i don't like to do like i don't like doing one-on-ones with people and doing performance reviews and talking about their salary and stuff like that i really i'm not great at it and but i'm able to work on the product stuff and the vision stuff um the stuff that really motivates me so it's it's really worked out but i'm still very busy with the hubspot stuff and i always wondered this like uh when i was at twitch emmett is the ceo he was the original founder right so he's like 10 years in and um and he basically went from like you know starting the thing with two two three you know buddies basically to okay two thousand employees and you know whatever millions of millions of users and for a long time his thing was like you know yeah i'm not the professional ceo manager type i'll get coaching there so that i'm not like awful at it yeah but uh you know i'm great with product and growth and i'm gonna like there was like this perpetual candidate search for a chief product officer that somehow was never getting filled and it's like everyone knew it's because emmett loves to do it and it's great about it i had a little of this yeah i think it's pretty common to do for this to happen or the ceo's like well that's the thing i like don't don't take away the one thing i like when there's like the rest of it is just firefighting and politics like you know i'm not not super into that bit and then you know eventually found it when i was there found somebody who was a you know really good product leader and an engineering leader and basically over you know over that year i saw that person take more of that role and then i was like oh emma what are you gonna do now and he was like i'm gonna work on like you know the vision and the long trip strategy i was like yeah but like you know when you wake up what do you what do you do you just sit there and i'm gonna think about the vision right now it's like that's such a weird what do you do day to day and i never really understood what that meant and so like would you say i think i would i work on you know the vision and strategy now you wake up what the heck do you do okay so today there was a bunch of emails back and forth between darmesh and i about what subspot looked like five years from now um so literally i woke up thinking about exactly that right it turns out so you're doing like it's like long form writing so you're just like writing out you guys it's like a basically an email brainstorming session yeah it wasn't even that long it was emails back and forth um and just different product ideas and different areas we could go into um and then i read a lot and so you guys probably saw that amazon came out with like a billion new products yesterday that looked kind of interesting actually it's just amazing how much new stuff they had and how well it tied together i think that started the thread like holy crap is there a lot of innovation coming out of that company and yeah there's a lot of r d in there but it's amazing the amount of innovation coming out of there and uh i think that sort of started it by the way did you see this infinidash thing that came from from amazon did you guys see this no what is it so so aws so amazon launches all these different products and uh somebody said somebody basically on twitter goes and they go oh my god you know aws infinidash looks like a game changer um and i think you know werner vogels who's like one of their kind of like cto scientists yeah gto types he tweets out like you know at the end at the hashtag infinidash event tonight blah blah celebrating and then um and it's a fake product there is no product called infinidash it was like just like a meme but people started kind of memeing it into existence so someone immediately responds they go i'm buying open dash dot io so i don't get locked into aws as an as an open source alternative to infinidash and then signal the big messaging app that has like 50 million users was like um you know we're hiring an engineer with an emphasis on infiniti dash lifecycle manager and um there's like youtube videos with infinite demos and like people like i'm an infinite consultant and it just like took on a life and if you knew it was fake you knew but everybody kind of played the party that's awesome the whole bunch of people thought it was real that's awesome that's awesome ryan you um i saw this like i saw this graph i think it was from darmesh at a talk at saster and the graph was pretty amazing it was like it was like maybe hubspot's first five years of revenue and i'm almost positive i was trying to like read the graph and it wasn't all marked out clearly but i'm almost positive it said something like in year three you already had like six million in arr is that accurate i doubt it it's too low or too high and too high too high i would say the thing about sas businesses that's fascinating is it takes you approximately forever to get to 5 million in ar uh but once you get to 5 50 is like bam you know it's tomorrow well that's what i thought but like it took us so long no no i think i think you're misreading that graph it took us a long time to get to 5 million an hour it took us a long time to get to a million how long did it take i forget but it's we had a lot of churn our product you know we've turned into a product-centric company a design-centric company and a customer-centric company but it took us a long time to get there and so we had lots of customers coming in but we had lots of churn in those early days eating away at our growth um so it took us a while it took us it felt like forever to get to a million i remember and then forever to get to 10 and then all of a sudden bam 100 then bam two you know it started happening fast and even now like we got to a billion and you know it's starting to happen really fast now well and like your first there was like the joke was like i actually disagree with you i think you i think darmash maybe squished that crap a little bit yeah i i i could have read it wrong but for some reason i was like wait they hit they hit something they hit like 15 like something we didn't break any records on that [ __ ] well and he made a joke he was like the first five people on the team were like brian who was like an mba sales person and then like another marketing guy another like sales person and then another operations person and then me who was a technical person and i actually had to build the thing and they're like this combination is a horrible combination for the early an early team yet somehow it kind of worked i actually i think his point on that was the early team was a bunch of people we knew from sloan that we got mbas with like people we thought were super sharp they started them as contractors then we hired them and that in a lot of ways that was good in a lot of ways that was bad um in the early days the hub spot there was a lot of pluses doing minuses to it the first person the first very few people know this but the the the first version of hubspot was built by darmesh and these two guys in egypt that he found through um found online put a test out there and pharah maui and i forgot the other guy's name and they built like the prototype of those three built the prototype outside here's how hubspot worked in the early days all day long i would be using the product demoing the products pitching the product and using it to run our marketing and then at the end of the day i'd write up you know here's the 10 most important bugs i found and then at night darmesh is a night owl and those guys are obviously working at night because they're in egypt they'd fix all 10 and create like 50 more [Laughter] so it's just a constant whack-a-mole that first year and then we hired a guy a kid from yale who was a he was a poli-sci major but he was a computer scientist on the side who's really good named patrick fitzsimmons and he joined the team and then we started getting going um and then we hired a guy from mit who ran engineering and then we ran and then we hired a guy that ran darmesh's last company he was an engineer and then we really started cooking but that first version was written in egypt of all places wow and you know when we think uh like i think back about upshot what's that what's the name of the company option upshot what is that when you can outsource your dev projects what's the other one oh desk or elance or upwork upwork it used to be called yeah i heard stories about a friend who was early at uber and they used to like this was like a secret that they didn't tell a lot of people but one of the co-founders of uber is mexican oscar he's from mexico i forget his last name oscar salazar or something like that and they used to make jokes that like some of the early code was in spanish and they couldn't fix it and i was like why i was like why what's going on he's like well apparently you know just like you don't think about it but uber was just like any other small business that didn't have any money and one of the co-founders was mexican and he lived in mexico and they had their peers or friends like it was like contractors that they could only afford and coat make the early uber code and there was this joke that like a lot of the early stuff was in spanish and they couldn't fix it and so it's kind of funny to hear that yeah that's right it's funny you say that you don't you don't ever think of uber as like a struggling little startup with no money but everyone starts that way except for today there's so much money sloshing around people don't start that way they start with like five million bucks in their bank account well the uber guys had money they just thought of it as a side project they were they didn't think about it like this is going to dominate the world they thought of it like this would be cool we'll roll around in black cars in san francisco and not have to worry about taxis i don't think they had that much money i know travis had had an exit but i don't think that they were like right through stumble upon right he had done well like he didn't i don't think they were rich enough that they could like put three or four million dollars into a business before it really was they knew it was gonna be worth it like i i don't think it may be that i mean those guys are hyper connected right like they sure they can raise a seed round if they needed to um so we were talking last episode about this company called nerd wallet and the nerd wall the story the the part that's relevant it's basically it's a big finance kind of like blog basically and um and they make a ton of money because they rank at the top of the search engine for uh best credit card best credit card for business whatever and they get a bunch of they make like 100 million dollars off that referral essentially at the end of the day but they got there by making great content and like it was like tortoise and the hair everybody else was like you know just trying to farm as much content as you could these guys are trying to do quality content and for two years they're sitting in their apartment just banging away at blog posts and like the traffic really wasn't it wasn't impressive and i was telling sam i was like if i had started this company i would have pivoted 10 times by then if i was advising them i'd be like guys look at the data this is not working but they had a lot of faith and they sort of kept going and there's these like perseverance stories and they hear these other stories that are like well we we tried this thing we saw the signals and so we made a shift in strategy and these like inflection points are the hardest thing because as an entrepreneur you never know which one is this one of those moments where i should be persevering in spite of the data or should i be taking the signals and making a dramatic shift in what i'm doing pivoting in some way and i think everybody has like i look back at any startup i started and i see multiple moments where maybe i made the wrong decision maybe i made the right decision it's very hard to say because you never know what would have come out the other side when you look back at early hubspot was there are there any moments like that where you know either it was not when it was not working and you decided either to persevere or shift in your strategy shift in your the way you guys were doing something yeah there have been two big pivots in hubspot's history that people don't talk about um the first pivot was about six months in we were building kind of a general purpose platform for for legal firms we call it legal spot this is probably something we were still in business school but we were spending time on it we had a prototype of it and we would go to law offices and we demo it and try to get people excited about it and they weren't super psyched about it but there was a little piece of it that was um around grading your website and around seo that the law firms got excited about and got excited about the lead gen piece and we stuck with this legal spot idea for a really long time and we're just getting very mediocre feedback and finally george and i were like why don't we just work on that one thing they keep asking us about and so we killed legalspot and we built website greater and we built the lead generation system and then we killed the idea of verticalizing it and went horizontal and sold it to all our friends and startups basically so that was the first huge pivot we had was giving up basically on the original idea and the reason the original idea was there was when we were in business school they put you in little pods for uh for stuff and there was a woman in our pod who was terrific who had started a company in the legal space and convinced us there was something really there um and she might have been right if we stuck with it but uh we ended up pivoting away from that and she ended up not joining hubspot the second huge pivot we had is we were a marketing app software company i mean we built we started with we started as a web 2.0 company back a hundred thousand years ago with seo and blogging and social media and we were good at helping people get in front page of digging reddit and stumble upon [ __ ] like that wait that that was the service was that you were good at getting people on top of dig and reddit we were good at helping people get turn strangers into visitors on their site with no advertising money so start your blog get good at search engine optimization start a twitter face get going on dig get going on reddit and start building credibility there and so create these channels into your business basically that's that's how hubspot effectively started but we were seo geeks at heart and then we moved into marketing automation which was an obvious move because everyone was buying hubspot but then they'd buy marketo or they'd buy pardot or they buy one of these other platforms you're like they'd spend a lot of money on it we're like you know we get into that business and so we moved into that business but the big pivot was when we said we're not a marketing apps company anymore we're a crm platform company and then we've really turned ourselves on our head and we made that decision about seven years ago and that turned out to be a very very good pivot for us and we're still in the middle of it like we have so much more work to do on our apps and so much more work to do on our platform like it really works well our customers love it you're talking about um oh i know i was gonna ask when you guys were early on when did the company launch oh five oh six oh six yeah what what why don't you know we launched it that's when we officially started it actually we never really launched the company we just kind of started it when you were doing that what i mean you know your behemoth now but what percentage of it do you attribute to you just picked the right idea in a huge market and had fantastic timing and it kind of you got pulled to success compared to you're just uh you know you're you made the right decisions and you're smart and talented and skilled i mean what percentage of that came down to it was just we got lucky that we saw this early on and it kind of worked out that we just stuck with it versus we're really healthy dose of both are are a very healthy dose of both um the thing we saw in the and the thing that anchors me is i i just watch the way people shop in the way they buy and the way they evaluate products i'm sort of look like a little bit of an anthropologist of watching people buy stuff and i noticed two things that were going on first of all all the marketing stuff that i had done my whole career whether it was emailing you know doing email marketing or was advertising or cold calling or anything didn't work because people like caller id they had spam protection that ad blockers like it's broken and at the same time people no longer were going to like idc and you know gartner and all this stuff they were reading blogs and they were reading articles on social media and uh they were going to google and so those two things just kind of clicked inside our head and like there's a transformation that needs to happen from this very old school outbound interruption-based marketing to this new school inbound marketing you have to match the way you market to the way people actually want to shop and buy and what the nice thing about it is your success in that new type of marketing was much much more about the width of your brain than the width of your wallet you didn't need a lot of money and so we initially sort of targeted small businesses we moved up to some uh to larger businesses these days but uh that's sort of how it got going and we it turns out we were right about that and we were early on that thesis and i remember there was a decision point in the early days of hubspot like we were starting to get traction it was starting to go and we were unsure you know is this going to be a big company is this going to be like the two of us are going to fund this we'll do some angel thing or is this going to be a go big or go home and i remember looking at it at some point in time it was like we're right about inbound and other people are noticing we're right we gotta like raise a lot of money and go fast because some people are gonna start copying us and people did copy us like crazy and so at some point we sort of flipped the switch from you know we got a little business that's going pretty well we may have 50 people we might end up doing a lot of services to know we're building a big software company and it was the realization that we were early and right about this idea of inbound and and one of the reasons people love the pod is because we we started off with kind of like what we're doing a little bit now which is interviews with people who are successful say hey how'd you do it what'd you do what was it like and somewhere along the way i just said hey sam let's record an extra episode on a friday what i really wanted to do is help him promote trends and i was like let's just talk about trends let's talk about what are some opportunities your your research crew has found and let's just shoot the [ __ ] about it it'll sell some trans subscriptions and it'll be i think interesting like it's like how we talk offline let's just record it and um what that started was a lot of the podcast now is basically brainstorming and just shooting the [ __ ] about well today here's what i see as some opportunities maybe i'm not going to do them because i'm already doing two businesses my hands are full but if somebody's out there looking you know i think this is really interesting this is where i would be sniffing right now and so i don't know if that's hard for you because you're so concerned by a large problem let me ask a little bit differently so earlier you you had this thing called legal spot now you guys are just your hubspot which is you know the the crm for like you know any business ever but i see a lot of companies pop up that say they are the hubspot for x so you said you started as legal spot now there probably is like are hubspot just for the legal industry we are hubspot only for dentists we are hubspot only for doctors whatever what do you think about those and if you if you're not a fan or you don't think that they like are necessarily gonna have legs which industry do you think could have legs where you could have a hubspot for x that you guys just simply can't meet because their their knees are so specific as soon as you brought this up i was like there's an infinite number of opportunities for people to build stuff on top of hubspot that's vertical specific and so someone should build a legal spot on top of hubspot someone should build a hospital spot on top of hubspot like whatever they want and it's all sort of there the apis are there like there is incredible low hanging fruit for entrepreneurs to build and then just sell it to our install base all the new customers there's lots of channels you can sell through hubspot that is it's it's it's probably the upside on it you're probably not going to build a 100 billion dollar company but you're the beta on it's low you can build a good company make good money by doing that are there any success stories of people doing this so far there's a bunch of them there's these kids in um in the uk not kids they're in their 20s but they built something called org chart hub on top of hubspot which was hey i'm working on selling to procter gamble and they pulled in procter gamble's org chart and then as a team you can go and change that org chart around as a change and it became wildly popular inside of hubspot for sales reps using the product and now they've built a series of different apps inside of hubspot that's worked out that's that was the first of them now there's a whole bunch of them popping up have you seen um have you seen the org a company called the org okay so it's i think it might be the org.com actually uh is it similar idea something like that yeah and so all they do is it's a database of org charts and they recently raised i think they've raised two rounds but a recent raise was a 20 million dollar round from founders fund or something like that like a tier one vc this org chart thing actually like it just happened to it yeah and one of the very first brainstorms when daniel gross joined we had brainstormed this because i had said it's so hard to know who the heck is who inside companies linkedin has become impossible to know exactly and we said this is a wedge to build a new style of linkedin linkedin basically took all said we'll take the resume and then we'll create you know basically like the social network on top of this database of resumes well why don't you create a database of org charts get people to crowdsource because i think people like to say here's my hierarchy here's where i am in the hierarchy so people are willing to fill it in for their company and you can crowdsource that and then use that as like the basis of a new style of linkedin i think that's what these guys are doing almost to a tee i think i think linkedin is there's certain companies that i think are ripe for disruption i think there um that work chart hub thing is is cool the company who i bet is kicking themselves is the it's the you know the information do you guys subscribe to the information yeah they have an org chart thing they haven't worked for things it's awesome by the way i bet they're kicking themselves they didn't spin that out into a company and raise a venture for it and crowdsource that because it's very good um i i refer to it often actually yeah that's the media company dna though um all right so what about non-hubspot related what if you were 21 today and you're thinking about business ideas or you just graduated business school like when you started hubspot what do you what would have your your fascination your curiosity where would you be building what opportunities have you seen that you're like okay if i had a clean slate of time here's where i would go what i would go for okay i like to think about like the big trends and then sort of zero in on okay what's an idea on the big trend so i just think just the most enormous trend that's going on and i saw in hubspot's board meeting last week so i've been out for six months i went to the first board meeting we had an hour and a half discussion about the environment and we have this whole chart on how we eventually want to get to a zero carbon footprint every board meeting in the world is having that same conversation and that's a hard thing for companies to pull off and that's just the beginning at this point you know europe sort of taxes carbon the us doesn't tax carbon eventually the u.s is going to figure that tax department i just think clean tech ocean tech there's there's gonna be trillions of dollars made in that industry explain that from a big company's perspective because i've never you know our business was much smaller than hubspot and so like when i thought about climate change i'm like yeah that's important to me as a person but like my business i'm just trying to make payroll like i can't even think about that at the moment like you know how my company fits into that you guys are much bigger what what do you um like from your perspective what does that mean you're you're willing to spend money in order to do oh we are we're spending huge money so yeah tell me like well how much are you spending and what are you spending that money on and what's the motivating factor there is like a dollar and cents thing is it to look good is it to feel good what what what where's the what's the motivating factor there from uh from a buyer's perspective i think fundamentally it's a moral issue for hubspot it's board and it's leadership team and we all are behind it um even if you didn't moralistically believe in that type of stuff your employees are going to force you to do it your investors are going to force you to do it your customers are going to eventually force you to do it so you don't have a choice if you're a company hubspot size or even a little bit bigger than where you are sam eventually your employees are going to be like you know what are we doing about this you know they were actually asking you about it in your group meetings um and so what hubspot's done is you know we've tried to lower our carbon footprint as much as possible get our energy now through wind fund uh sustainable projects like forestry projects river projects renewal projects out there to offset some of the energy we consume changing policies to consume less carbon dioxide so at this point you know we're at zero from the beginning of hubspot but we want to consume far far less we don't want to be buying offsets how are you tracking how much how do you track that is there like a dashboard i mean i i'm it's very hard to track and the companies who are trying to track it are the same are like your auditors like the price waterhouse and people like that and there's no great way to track it so it's a big business opportunity for companies that can figure out how to track that stuff well have you heard of um what was the thing we were talking about sean was so it stands for leadership and energy and environmental design have you ever have you ever seen a building um yeah like a lead scored yeah or something like that but we were looking it up on the show we were talking about that we're like it's kind of interesting and so it's a non-profit so you can actually see their sales and their revenue is like 36 or 38 million dollars and it's something i think it's highly recurring and uh is that it was kind of a shocking business and it was weird it's like what on earth made all these people believe that lead is like the thing yeah you know it's like jd power for cars it's like i don't actually or gartner it's like i don't know i think they just kind of said that they're the experts and everyone kind of bought into it and yeah and i'm like i think i got similar yes i i think even beyond that like carbon sequestration is going to have to become a thing if we're going to solve it and people are investing in ways to pull carbon out of the air that are really expensive right now i'm optimistic on our ability to pull carbon out of the air with the ocean in a more effective way but at some point you're gonna need to be able to say to hubspot to microsoft to whoever hey you purchase a certain amount of credits around carbon sequestration is it legit and have a true measurement system that's quantitative not just like a most of the stuff out there is is survey-based did you do this did you just do this and you sort of self-certify it right uh there needs to be a more more like nielsen than jd power you know right and there's there's a huge opportunity there so let's say you're right okay so that's the that's the mega trend and you say okay i could i could see the world is moving in this direction and it's it's going to need some catalyst some companies that help accelerate it in that direction pull the future forward where's your inclination when or how do you approach something like that because i think for most entrepreneurs they say okay climate change well okay that's daunting like uh i gotta save the planet all right that's a sort of a big idea here i don't really know where to start and then there's all sorts of frameworks you can use like picks and shovels businesses like how do you sell tools to the people who are going to be trying to fix this problem or investing in in a portfolio of companies that are all doing this there's deep science where like you know would you go find a partner like darmesh who's got an idea around some technical solution to pulling second carbon out of the air how would you actually go about approaching it once you decide okay this is where the puck is going uh how would you how would you actually tackle that as an entrepreneur okay so i just rolled the clock back to i'm an mba at sloane and i'm looking for a partner in a business opportunity and back then it made sense darmash and i made perfect sense um we were both super passionate about small businesses and web 2.0 and disruption and we took all the same classes and we liked each other at this point i wouldn't be looking for a darmesh i'd be looking for somebody from the other side of the university most likely that could help me figure this like how do i get more plastic out of the ocean or how do i once i get that plastic out of the ocean turn it into products in a much more efficient way how do i get really smart about carbon sequestration how do we get kelp to soak up all the carbon in the world and then drop that kelp into the bottom of the ocean and sequester it for thousands of years i'd be looking for scientists and engineers who are working on that type of stuff and i think it's it's it's endlessly fascinating i think it's it's it's and i think the answers are there i i actually am confident that the capitalist system the startup environment can solve some of these problems like you read the news and you just think oh it's now we're never never gonna fix it like it's the end of the world and when you're ever gonna get that 1.5 degrees celsius it's going to blow but actually i think startups and entrepreneurs and that same gusto that went into the biotech east ecosystem the same gusto that went into the software ecosystem i think that's going to happen in clean tech in ocean tech and i think it'll work did you see sean did you see the i think you're friends with this guy the old ceo of reddit who has a new business and it's like he's like johnny appleseed it's like only planting trees or something like that right terraform i think is the name of it what is that do you know what that is yeah so this guy ishon wong and um he was i think early kind of facebook um and then he ended up becoming this he was hired as ceo of reddit uh he was like basically kind of like a user of reddit that just ended up becoming the ceo because he had the right tech background and now what he's doing is he's got this startup i'm trying to find the name real quick um i'll find it terraform or terraformation and yeah what he's doing is basically he's uh he he he was started thinking about climate like at last i don't know or i don't know when he started thinking about it but he started really like making that his next project over the lasting of five years and i think what he decided was like oh i think one way we can attack this is to find large plots of land and we need to plant like millions of trees in this area and we need to basically re-terrify the terra formation sort of like re you know resurfacing of the way you use land and um and that's what we're gonna do and i think it's called terraformation inc is the name of his company and he found this plot of land i think near hawaii or something like that and um and he's basically published his idea of like here's a full solution to climate change that can be done in under 30 years and um and you know he's got kind of like a bold view of what that what that looks like i don't know all the details he hasn't really said all the details just yet but he's been revealing more and more over time it's it's one to watch it's one to to kind of keep an eye on it yeah the climatetech vc community is going to explode in the next couple years i think chamoth said something like like this is the number one thing that i i want to invest in but the problem is and he actually just made an investment they launched it announced it today i think it's called drone seeds and i was reading about it i was i think it's like these custom drones that basically uh is it they do it before a fire happens in a forest they go and they map out where they think fires will happen and i don't know exactly how it works but somehow they can guess where they think a fire is going to happen and they'll help fix it before it happens i believe that that's what it is it's called drone seeds just invested into it but the but he basically said he's like this is the main thing that i'm focused on for you know the next few decades and when he said that i was like okay that's that's cool uh in theory i'm totally behind this but i was thinking i'm like but i have no idea how to solve it like i it's such a grand huge thing that like so you're now investing and or working with um you know scientists at uh uh uh i forget what what was it called um who which solo should you grab against yes and i'm like well that's just like incredibly intimidating um and then i think like i think like because i mean like it's so much that's so much more challenging than just sitting in your room with darmesh and just coding something and then calling someone asking to buy it um both are hard but one seems like way more you can get to market a lot quicker building software that's for sure yeah and i was thinking of other ideas in this space because i'm like well like i'm behind this i like money like what's this huge trend like let's if i can if you can build a huge company and help the world that sounds like a win-win um but i was i was i was struggling to get my hands on something that is actually interesting uh that can actually be attainable there's a bunch of people working on um measurement systems like our measurements are horrible on global warming beyond just the aggregate temperature of the globe like measurement systems of the tides and you tell that measurement that measurement to the insurance companies so they know when the you know big storm is coming um and getting really precise about that kind of stuff systems to measure the salinity of the oceans the temperature of the ocean the temperature of the atmosphere and using all that information to input to the carbon exchanges that happen in europe and hopefully globally some day like there's going to be a whole stock mark you think with there's a there's a stock market there's a commodities market there's nasdaq there's the new york stock exchange that's going to happen for carbon and think of all the businesses that happened around that marketplace there's this company right now that i see being advertised everywhere it's called i think it's called aspiration and basically have you brian noticed that there's like all these new credit card companies coming out basically what they do i'm kind of dumbing it down but i believe this is exactly how it works they just partner with mastercard mastercard typically takes one percent of the purchase price from the merchant and makes money that way mastercard then says hey if anyone starts a new credit card system and you're able to convince these people to sign up we'll split that with you and that's kind of that's kind of dumbed down and there's this new company called aspiration i think it's called and we predicted this on trends shockingly like this is something that like we nailed way before this company came out and it's called aspiration and what they do is and i have no idea how they do this but whenever you make a purchase it tells you on your phone how uh how much carbon it used or you know what what the impact on the environment was and when i heard about this i'm like i don't buy this i can't believe someone like i care about this stuff but like that's just amazing that someone's willing to switch credit cards just for this reason because switching credit cards are pain in the ass and these guys i think they've raised over 100 million dollars and they've attracted so many new customers just on this idea and it was shockingly interesting i i i never in a million years would have thought that that would take off like it did yep i think this is a huge huge trillion dollar industry it's going to be the like software industry is a huge industry biotech's a huge industry this is going to be a giant industry and there's lots of ways to get at it um but it's it's a different it's a different model it's not just you know hacking together something on the weekend testing it and then iterating on it it's a little different so if climate is a trend a big trend a big wave that you believe in what are some things that you see other entrepreneurs doing that you are less excited about or you you're not a believer in is there some trends because there's sometimes head fakes or things that are too early uh that they're you know the time is not now um i'm curious what do you see or the time has passed you're not a believer in you're not interested in that sort of thing you know ye old enterprise software companies with ye old uh giant outside sales forces um it just feels like the time has passed to build that kind of thing and i've predicted that before and been wrong um but it feels like there's a new breed of company that sells in a new way and they start with small businesses whether it's shopify or it's stripe or it's hubspot like there's a new way to build a company and it's not targeting fortune 500 companies like when i see these companies starting like yeah we're targeting the fortune 500 like take the technology piece away just all the compliance work you have to do to be able to sell to those companies and all the boxes you need to check to get in there and then the sales model it's just like oh good luck it's a it's a that's a tough road to help and i want to read a couple of tweets that you had put out and i want to hear you kind of elaborate on a little bit so one is um you know you need to manage your if something on long lines if you need to manage your creative people with loose reigns and that's from lauren michaels the the sort of i think he's a producer or the creator of saturn out live for a long time so what was uh what struck what circuit chord with you about that okay you brought some you actually brought up something earlier that was really interesting about uh the twitch ceo uh so in the early days of hubspot i'm not a product guy by the way by training or by dna for that i i think someone described you i believe it was kip i'm a sales guy he said you're the best you're the best salesperson he's ever met yes i'm a salesperson and i grew up in sale i grew up in enterprise sales which is ironic because i just said i think that industry died um but um i tried to convince myself that i was a product guy in early days the hubspot so i read everything i could about it design books i've read everything about steve jobs and you name it and i just tried to get really smart on it and i was the truth is i just was not good at it and we hired one product manager didn't work we finally found a product manager that uh i liked and we sort of built around um and i was like oh i see i don't actually have that dna i'm not good at this and it took me a while to it took me seeing someone who's actually really good at it to understand that i'm actually shitty at it and i was like oh i get it and then then i had to figure out well how do i manage this type of person and the way i managed this person and the team was by really giving them a lot of free reign like giving them very wide boundaries and just saying hey you guys figure out and gals what's inside this box this is what the box looks like and what was that box like we need to attract this type of customer we need to grow by this we need to like we need to we can't have these people churning out i'll show you show you the box it's a box i've drawn on white boards in the product organization a million times like here's the crm platform okay mark bryan's literally drawing a box right now by the way he's got like a professor-style channel oh you guys all right so i'm right so on the board i'll describe what i'm drawing i drink this is good we have a youtube channel box on the bottom that's like the hubspot crm keep drawing by the way we have a youtube channel this is going to be on there okay it's a crm platform on the bottom and then on top are apps like we got a marketing app we have a sales app we have a service app we have a content management system we have an ops app now and basically i would draw that on every board and what's it what's interesting about the dimensions of it is the vast majority of the space in the drawing is in the big box at the bottom which is a message to the developers the product people like hey the power inside of hubspot isn't a whole bunch of applications that we're going to buy and glue together and cobble together we're gonna build a killer platform and that platform's gonna have workflows as part of it it's gonna have social media as part of it and messaging it's gonna have a set of shared services and then the apps themselves are actually quite a bit smaller but they're all just woven together pieces of the underlying platform and they got it and uh and actually they they extended it in big ways and then i said i want a marketing business it's going to be a billion dollar business growing x percent and this year i want a sales box and in that sales box i want that to be a whatever 300 million dollar business growing y percent and i just draw out the numbers and draw the boxes and they would decide what to put in there based on what they thought and what customers were saying and where they thought the world was going so i managed them very very very loosely i managed other parts of hubspot very very tightly but the product worked very very loosely but i heard i've heard that you you are like that most of the time and then when something isn't going well you get down and dirty in your heart and you're like we have to we have to nail this i do i will i'm either at a very high level or go very very deep and um one of the first things that you said to me was like um keeps you know you didn't you didn't mean it this way but you're like keep being you keep being crazy yes and if anyone says anything to you about what you can and cannot say you'd let me know yeah stay weird yeah that's what it was it was staying weird you're like awesome to stay weird down so i just naturally thought it would stay weird because what makes you you is you're you're [ __ ] dude you're weird yeah well dude so chuck bryan has a book so if you google brian halligan guitar he bought jerry garcia's guitar and you could like see the price on there um which i was like that's weird that like i know that you bought a two million dollar jerry garcia guitar that's crazy and also he has this book called like what the grateful dead can teach you about social media about marketing about marketing um so a lot a lot what can i learn from the grateful dead give me that four points we're gonna have to do a whole other podcast about it it's just too much i uh do you know so there's this company called i bet you definitely know what it is nuggs.net you know yes okay so nugs is this okay so the reason i know about it was the hustle started in this small apartment that i rented for really cheap but it was craigslist's old office so craigslist was doing like 900 million dollars a year and craig newark basically owned the whole thing and he was based out of this little shitty apartment that i ended up renting right when he moved out and we shared it with nugs.net is this company that it started out basically i think only for grateful dead but basically i remember as a kid sean i don't know you probably even have an older brother so you probably didn't do this but like you would meet people on the internet and you would get their address and you would mail them a tape and they would mail you a tape back and you would have a live recording of a particular concert and nuggs.net was the the platform or the message board kind of where you could like meet other people who went to a pearl jam or a grateful dead concert and you trade tapes i don't even know what they do now now it's cool now it's a live broadcast for concerts it's awesome so you want to see a giant you want to see a dave matthews concert tonight you know they're probably broadcasting it uh it's awesome now they've really come a long way that's an awesome app now and they like so they started as this like it was like the exchange i guess now they have like a thing and we were talking about the grateful dead and we can learn them these people have the most like it's you know there's like a few things like moms are like really culty about like products for their babies um dog lovers are kind of like this um health nuts it can be like this and like grateful dead fans yeah like the people who are into like fish grateful dead this type of stuff it's it's their engagement is off the charts so i'll give you a non-secretary giving in a weird way the grateful dead inspired hubspot and here's what here's how so sam let's say you're going to a rolling stones concert and you show up with like your big camera and your giant like recording equipment what happens when you get to the door they say bounce you know you can't and what are they what is the grateful dead say i think they have a section where you can sit special taper section for you like come on in sit right here put your microphone up like get your gear all set up come early you got like vip access and you go and tape and and then you listen to the concert and one of the things about the grateful dead that's interesting like when you see the rolling stones you see them in boston they play a certain set list and they play it very precisely and they're very good then they go to new york and what do they play it's it's totally different exactly yeah most bands do the same thing but grateful dead it changes every night every time and sometimes by the way sometimes it's terrible but usually it's quite good and so you tape in boston and then you go to new york and they do you know giant stadium for two nights then you go to philly and you follow them around and by the end of the show you've got like you know 15 shows on you know of your tapes and you pick the two or three real good ones and you make copies for your friends and you send them around to your friends and then you're at some fraternity party or whatever and somebody's playing the state and the person next to you is like hey what's this crazy gypsy music they're playing you'd be like oh this is a grateful dead why don't you come with us we're going on to on the spring on the summer tour this summer come along with us the grateful dead were the first and best inbound marketers they gave away all their content and they used the best content to spread the word around the internet they were they were very inspirational behind inbound and content marketing and all that stuff they were the first ones they were the really first ones to really embrace uh viral marketing in in a super super modern way and back then there was an email marketing and there wasn't like uh social media but they were big on message boards and the message boards were on fuego i think the the live music space is interesting to me and there's a few opportunities that i've seen so there's this company that is streams live concerts on apple tv uh i forget what it's called um but they by the way that's exactly what nuggs does yeah and this company they just built like a uh they don't stream live ones but it's like it's like a it's like netflix for concerts and they were doing like that's a cool idea it was pretty cool they were doing about 20 million dollars a year in subscription revenue and i think they bootstrapped it they're based out of england look i'll look up the name in a second and then the second thing that i always thought was interesting and it totally bombed with song kick sean did you know song kick yeah no okay so song kick what it did was they basically you would say where you're living and it would tell you all the all the concerts happening that day or for any other day email yeah so they have this huge email it's basically like an email marketing business and they raise a little bit of money and it complete i think it went i think they it failed and was sold for nothing but the thing about the live music space is like a lot of people have tried to build stuff in there because it's fun right it's like you're passionate about it but very few companies have been able to pull it off and make money um another one was uh like um something fm what was that called uh i forget what it was called it was started in san francisco fm turntable fm and it that bomb too it didn't work out nothing there's rights problems there's rights problems that's one problem for music and the other thing is the trick in business is i think to do what you're passionate about that not every other human is also passionate about right because you want to follow your passion but you don't want to follow everyone's passion because that's just competition right like brian nerds out about inbound marketing he's passionate about something that 99 of other people don't even know or care about so that's the beauty of hubspot and how you can build a giant company like website because you're going to go further than everybody else live music okay yeah great here you go you and every other really good point 20 year old wants to do it i'm not a huge beer teal fan but he said he said something interesting in his book he said in order to be successful you need to be right about something that everyone else thinks you're wrong about and they think you're wrong about it for a long period of time yeah i i think that's rightish yeah somebody says something like that they go investing is pi is being a great investor is investing things that everybody agrees with you about later yes it's called quello by the way q-e-l-l-o and they claim that they have two or three million subscribers uh very interesting business we got a wrap uh we got another pod right after this actually brian this is great thanks for coming on uh thanks for having me this is fun you're a fun hang i like this i didn't know yeah before this so this is cool i want to have you on again the things next i want to talk about is like the evolution how you go from like just being scrappy to now you're like very corporate ceo that's a that's a it sounds like an insult that's not an insult i mean like you're able to like manage thousands of people and like very few people have been able to pull that off so i wanna i wanna tell we can talk about the ceo journey and how it changes over time it's interesting but we definitely have some more grateful dead down i'm down well thank you man this is awesome this is it's kind of your podcast now so anytime you will come on let's do it okay [Music] travel never looking back

eco-friendly ones that kept track of things smart water bottles i've just never done it yeah dude i'm fine they called me hose water was my middle name in high school i'm like i [Music] [Music] all right do you want to do a recap on rob dierdick because i've been getting blown up about about that blown up yeah this is i would say definitely the mo the biggest reaction we've had to an episode in a long time maybe ever ever as i'd probably say ever the the the one thing that i got was basically people said this is not just the best podcast you guys have done but this is maybe the best episode i've ever listened to of any podcast and i don't it definitely wasn't us that made it great but he was pretty amazing right he was and i didn't know how it would turn out i remember literally being amazed in the moment like the things he was saying were very surprising to me and very interesting and i wanted to know more and he told he was very open so that was dope as well but you never know like how the episode turns out and there's all these different factors you know from audio quality to like do people care what this person has to say are they interested what we're interested in well people definitely dug it yeah you're right people were saying like my top three podcast episodes this year was naval on tim ferriss rob on your guys's pod and then whatever some reply all podcast that happened so it was like not just this is y'all's best but this is one of the best i've heard and there was people tweeting like all right this is the fourth person that mentioned this to me i gotta go listen to this today so something definitely happened i'm curious in the numbers what that's gonna show uh in a couple of years they're good i've looked at them he okay so rob dierdick on the podcast mentioned his schedule and i was curious about it and so i actually asked him to email me um what that looked like and he sent me a screenshot i sent it to you sean can you read what it what it's what it is and um basically like at first glance what does it look like when you see his schedule it's a picture of his gmail or his calendar so it looks like well there's a few there's a few views but uh the one i'm looking at it looks like i would say a combination between like a p l like uh you know a business's p l cash flow statement and or like you know just like a research doc put out by uh gartner about you know the trends of an industry this doesn't look like one person's you know weekly schedule and if you look at the view of his calendar every single minute of his day is marked off every minute yeah it's blocked off now some of it is like you know it could be like whatever free time or something like that like family and kids right so it's not saying he's working all the time but every minute is is accounted for every minute has a purpose and uh it says here i track every hour of every day throughout the day and tag each entry i have a script written that pulls and pulls the time and populates into these two spreadsheets one is daily time use and the other is monthly averages so should we do the should we look at his monthly average real quick yeah yeah all right so monthly average we'll take um we'll take september okay so september he's got sleep which was 6.9 hours uh health 1.2 hours life which is like kind of like family and things like that 7.8 hours and then work uh 8.1 hours per day and it's pretty consistent like work never in any month in the whole year the lowest month was february 5.8 hours and the highest month was october 9.3 hours right uh sleep almost always 6.8 or 6.9 hours per day so this is a pretty meticulous um meticulous thing and by the way in the work category he's got like tv shows right here's my tv shows here's how many hours i'm spending on tv shows not watching tv making tv yeah yeah making tv making his tv shows um and then there's like the dudek machine which is kind of like his business that builds businesses and then there's other which is you know random meetings and stuff like that um very cool very cool in health he's got gym meditation personal care other uh for life he's got you know him and his wife kids friends and social and then other right so this is this is sick do you think okay so let's let's let's talk about this just for two seconds do you think that this does this work for you because by the way i'm saying this out loud but i i'm gonna package this if if he's okay with it i'm gonna package this and post it somewhere it's a visual thing so we should basically like you know on twitter and newsletter i'll put on my newsletter too but like we should post this so people can see it if he's cool with it we'll ask him yeah and do you think that do you roll this way because you and i joke like the best days are when there's nothing on the calendar and when people cancel stuff and and that feels like the best day to me although sometimes i feel lazy and sometimes i feel meaningless but do you do you like to operate this way or do you like to operate with open calendar or what so i'll tell you some of my uh i'll tell you two things i'll tell you about my calendar philosophy do i want to be scheduled or unscheduled i want to be the opposite of this i want to be completely unscheduled um and you know i don't know why that is the case it used to be the opposite so my calendar used to look a lot like his i used to block out like i used to just do it at high level like work block one lunch work block two gym you know family time yeah end of night kind of like hobby you know reading random random [ __ ] or whatever i used to just kind of like schedule out my day like that and try to keep it um and then i would have like in in a week i would have one day like i still have this i have one day where i do 90 minutes of random meetings meaning people that are just find interesting i just want to meet with no agenda and just kind of like cool people meeting cool people and so i do schedule time for randomness but for the most part i've gone away from having a highly scheduled day to having an unscheduled day meaning i don't schedule it in advance on the day of i decide what i'm gonna do and i decide how i'm gonna spend today but i don't decide that like two weeks in advance and so when somebody says can we meet i have a simple rule it's like do i want to meet you if you want to do a call you want to meet me do i want to meet you right now if so i'm going to say would you like to do it right now if not i'll say i can't do right now but i'll give you a call in an hour or two hours from now and if i don't want to do it right now i say sorry i don't want to meet and i don't schedule it for like three weeks from now which is what i used to do i used to say i don't wanna do this okay yeah i'm free two weeks but then guess what two weeks shows up and then i'm like [ __ ] i gotta do this call i didn't wanna do then i definitely don't wanna do it now it's expired yeah it keeps me up the night before sometimes yeah so i'm i'm much more of an unscheduled person um but the day of i decide how i'm gonna use today's time yeah it uh his his calendar was amazing to me and i think that it's going to be quite popular when you post that maybe uh maybe um we'll have to divvy up who could post what because we could i i both didn't get the gold yeah um all right so let me ask you did you ever do this time tracking [ __ ] because i also went through like an aggressive time tracking phase and i wanted to share one learning from that um i wouldn't i was never aggressive about it no i i um i prefer open time and uh i prefer working from midnight until like 3 a.m when and that's when i do a lot of my gold and stuff so like if i have to copyright what i if i have to do any type of copywriting i will i'll hang out all day and read and have fun and sarah's like when are you gonna do work i'm like when you go to bed and so she'll go to bed and then from midnight to three sometimes midnight to four i can get i can do gold and golden work around that around that hour i have a theory about this so fur khan who was my technical co-founder of my previous company he's been on the pod he was the same way he would i would like he would roll into work at 11 11 30. he'd start his work day with lunch and like you would think this is the laziest guy ever but actually he was he's massively hard working he was just up till five in the morning on average yeah and so you know five in the morning then he sleeps you know six hours he wakes up at 11 and he comes into work and um and even when he was at work like we would take like an hour we just play video games we would just like and i was just like dude like why do you use your time this way he goes he goes i don't know i just oh i just figured this out for myself early on which is that like the time i act like during the day it's just like i'm basically just trying to exhaust myself like i want to have conversations i kind of manage other people i kind of read [ __ ] i'll talk to people i'll eat lunch i'll go work out i'll do all the stuff he's like i'm basically just trying to get myself really like like i needed my brain to slow down and i want to get in this almost like half sleepy state which is not sleepy the way most people think about it most people think sleepy means you can't function but there is a point where you're like kind of tired you know you get kind of loopy yeah yeah and it's like that's when you could do creative work for him programming is creative work so he's like dude from like midnight to 4am i write the best code and it's basically like only my hands are moving i don't want to get up nobody bothers me nobody talks to me i don't have to meet anybody i just and i just go into flow state and i just work during that time and that's kind of what you're describing is you're midnight to 3 a.m i have that same thing and i've i figured out through furcon that there's this thing that happens where if you're trying to do creative work you need to be more relaxed and less kind of like distracted and also like a little loopy is good because it adds a little bit of like serendipity into your brain your brain's willing to play with different ideas and go in different directions maybe it's over copywriting you kind of want something like that also i believe 23andme has a like a line item on one of their attributes uh and it talks about are you a night owl or an early an early person and i so i think that a lot of this stuff of when you're going to get your creative work done i actually think it's genetic and whatever it is you should just go all in on it for example i mean the world's set up for early risers you know if you if you get up at 5 a.m and get stuff done like rob did or like you win you win like it's the world's setup so you actually if you're a night person like i am or you am you kind of got to go against the grain which sucks but uh here's a good example the founder of box the ceo of box what's his name ben levy aaron sorry that's it ben leaves my guys aaron levy aaron levy uh close to a billionaire maybe hundreds of millions a millionaire uh founder of a multi-billion dollar company i was friends with his assistant and she would tell me that he has no meetings until 11 a.m and that's typically when he starts at the office because he works until 5am and by the way bezos is the opposite bezos is like i want all my meetings from 8 a.m to noon all important decisions i need to make by then because my brain is functioning the best and then after that i don't want to have any important meetings in the day i'll have other meetings but no just no key decisions no heavy topics with important like stuff to digest i want to do other work during that time and so and like you know rob dyrdek on his calendar here it's 4 30 a.m wake up wake up call pretty much every single day one one day he sleeps until 5 a.m uh you know so he's a little bit different cat i think it's you know what works for you and uh and then you want to play to that like i spent many years trying to be like uh i want to wake up at 5 a.m so i can be more productive and it's just like waking up three hours earlier was way harder for me than just staying up three hours later and so it's like why am i fighting what's easy for me what feels like play to me versus what feels like an absolute grind to me and it's sort of unsustainable it's all willpower based and so you know i made that shift but i'll give you one thing that's that is worth doing so i tried to like track every hour to see how i'm using it because i kind of want you know time is your most precious asset so i wanted to see how it gets spent that was a little bit exhausting hopefully someday there's going to be tools that just make this easy so it's like it just happens passively but one thing that is amazing is a calendar audit i don't know if you've ever done one of these it's a calendar audit or some people call it an energy audit it basically means you take for one week you sort of keep track of like roughly how you used each hour and um and then what you do is the next week you just go back you just pull up last week's calendar and you take three colored markers you take a green marker a red marker and a yellow marker and you go back through your week how you spent your time and you say what which block which thing i did gave me energy i marked those green which felt like it sucked all the energy out of me i was drained afterwards and i felt like my soul had been sucked out of me let me mark those red and then the neutral things let me mark yellow and you look at the painting you know you look at your color and you're like wow that's a lot of red or hey that's actually pretty good that's a lot of green and then you just audit and so you're all you're doing is just trimming the fat and you just say all right cool this week i'm going to do less of the red stuff i'm going to do less by just literally avoiding it by automating it or delegating it and you just make a decision you just improve it by one week and you just do that every so often and if you do that it's an amazing way to manage not your calendar as in like maximizing efficiency but maximizing your energy so that you feel good and you are um when you feel your best you're going to you know perform your best at work i think sometimes i think babe's version of you bezos said the stuff that you should eliminate is you you you can answer that by uh asking will this uh work just fine if i don't make this decision or if i don't if i don't attend this or do this will life be okay if yes then eliminate it right um do you want to talk about some ideas yeah let's do some other stuff which uh where do you want to go well i've got a lot a lot yeah we both got a lot so we haven't we have a couple episodes worth of stuff here give me one off yours that you're really into okay um have you heard of brewmate no and i'm not a coffee drinker is it a coffee drinking thing it doesn't have to be so okay so brewmate it's spelled bru m-a-t-e their first thing was like a koozie basically their first product was it was a koozie something that interested me about this and now they make tumblers so basically what's a tumbler like just a coffee drink thermos like a thermos thing they make a koozie they make a water bottle they just make cups for cold stuff and hot stuff and uh the reason why this interested me is trends my company trends trends.co we did a story on broommate and they interviewed the founder and they did a good job and i think julia wrote it and they got a picture of the revenue so check this out jacob who's the founder jacob grew broommate to 20 million in revenue without a single employee and so this company launched in 2016. their revenue was basically uh uh 2016 nothing 2017 it looks uh single digit hundreds of thousands maybe close to a million 2018 uh getting close to 20 million in revenue 2019 over 25 million in revenue 2020 100 million in revenue and he did most everything with agencies and contractors and not a single full-time employee until after 20 million in revenue and it got me thinking one that's amazing that's like the greatest thing ever if you ask me i think that's like the the ideal business and number two these water bottle and cup businesses this is something that like if you told me you're gonna start that and be like dude that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard of what are you doing i there are so many example examples of some of these things that are huge for example there's a business called swell you know swell water bottles no i by the way i'm since college i've been the type of person that just never uses water bottles me neither i'm like but i buy that child i go to water fountains and i just like put my mouth on the [ __ ] thing and i drink from a water fountain that's what i do and everybody else had these like amazing elaborate water bottles always eco-friendly ones that kept track of things smart water bottles i've just never done it yeah dude i'm fine they called me hose water was my middle name in high school i'm like i don't know i wish i had made that up as a dig on you calling your host water but that's so perfect i thought i was going low bar like my low class thing was a water fountain and you like showed me yeah like if there was like a new coke product that was hose-watered flavor like from missouri i'd be drinking that [ __ ] because that's what i grew up on so i'm not like by the way can we share this we uh so the interview we did with brian halligan the ceo of hubspot they're playing it at inbound which is the huge marketing conference i think that's the ad for the podcast or something is inbound go to inbound great so uh they're playing the the the recording there as an interview and so for weeks uh for weeks our guy has been our you know producer of the pod the old producer of the pod was badgering us like hey guys they need this intake form and like you know i'm just like allergic to words like that so you know what's that jeff bezos thing can what happens if i don't do this that was my my take and it was yours too uh it was like hey guys i need you to fill this out i need you to sign this waiver saying you're okay with the content being on there i'm like dude i'm okay with it like obviously it's a public free podcast you can just use it wherever you want um and they're like no no you gotta sign this thing i'm like oh my god i gotta download a pdf and figure out how to sign this so weeks go by me and sam both do nothing at one point he goes hey sam uh that intake form you know they're really asking me for it sam goes oh you could tell and he's just joking but we we basically we didn't do it right and so another week goes by he goes all right guys i really need this intake form so we we're like fine all right we signed the thing and he's like oh i also need a bio for you um and it's like what's your what's your job title what's your bios like i don't know dude i host a podcast and i like build random businesses that like it's not i don't have a job title and i don't have like a bio for you and so i just wrote future owner of the la lakers and then uh future owner of a lake [Laughter] it's true man it's true i think that's the difference between us i embody the difference between us so perfectly yeah it was it was amazing all right back back to the regularly you can cut you can cut that part out if you're gonna get fired for that thing no you can keep that uh keep it we don't delete it so this is stupid it's not stupid yeah and so there's this thing called swell look up swell look up swell it's a water bottle i'm not a water bottle guy either it looks like the dumbest thing ever i mean it's not dumb it just looks like the most normal thing ever then there's corksicle which is basically a cork water bottle over 80 million in revenue and then there's one called bkr i actually don't know how to say that beaker but i don't know they didn't they sell a water bottle for 185 dollars it's glass and this one's actually cool because i hate metal water bottles and i hate plastic it's glass but it has like plastic or like rubber around it so you don't shatter it anyway um who would have thought who would have thought yeah crazy uh and did he say how he scaled because this is one of the most aggressive scaling business i've ever heard of so to go from basically sub 1 million to 18 million in one year and then to go from like i don't know looks like maybe 30 million to 100 million you know these are huge jumps um facebook ads and so basically he said that so he didn't spend a dime so or sorry he didn't build anything so he created a landing page and then he drove facebook ads to it uh and he got a pre-launch email list of six thousand people and then he sent those folks an email to buy it and they bought it and he used that money to go and build the product it's classic yeah a classic way so kind of interesting um and so that's not an idea but i just wanted to bring that up no that's cool i like that one um yeah do we have anything to rip off that or just like you know props to this guy no props to that guy but uh that's it and it looks like he used a bunch of like um like working capital is always very hard for e-commerce businesses and so it looks like you know he couldn't get a line of credit early so he did pre-sales and then okay he did pre-sales then he through the pre-sales now he got an expensive line of credit so um you know he got he got an sba loan he got shopify capital paypal working capital amazon lending he would use one to pay the next and that just like let him roll over one from one line of credit to the next dude in a way after doing an audit he got a 2 million line of credit and now raised 20 million dollars in a way i think that these people are so audacious and here's why if you told me if this guy i don't know what his name is uh if you told me that you're going to launch a water bottle i'll be like jacob you're an idiot this is the stupidest thing ever and you know who else i would have said that too movement watches so this guy also named jacob jake hassan spoke at hustle khan this was like pre d to c even being a word okay so jacob cassan he launched his company called movement or cassin sorry launched this company called movement they were shitty watches from china uh they ordered a bunch and they start selling them on movement.com or whatever then they kind of make them a little bit better but they're still like not the most high quality watches and his company he sold that thing for 200 million dollars and again if you would have showed me this watch i'd be like you are crazy no one's gonna buy this this is just ridiculous and i've talked to him and he's like well why not like people buy watches why won't they buy mine i think that confidence is awesome and i love it i don't know if i have it but i love it yeah it takes it definitely takes guts and i think you know one thing i've learned is that these spaces uh so there's like there's there's the niche spaces which we love and then there's also the everybody everyday problems and that's what like keeping beverages hot and cold is and i think you want to go on one end of the spectrum or the other you need to go hyper niche where it's like yeah i'm you know for a specific type of toe fungus this is the uh this is the best cream and i'm just going to target that and on the other side you go everybody everyday problems and i'm just going to try to sell this thing because my ads will apply to everybody and so there's basically like you know like i've been looking at different water brands so what's the one in austin so there's like lacroix or whatever it's like kind of like a larger chico baby like it well chico has been around for a while what's the one that's like the startup that lance armstrong invested in that's yeah guys in austin uh let me look it up i know you're talking about water or something like water waterloo is that it yeah that's it i think it's waterloo okay so there's waterloo they got huge they're like oh yeah we're at 50 million in sales there's a brand called ugly water founder sent me a case of that thank you for that uh ugly water again cool sparkling water crushing it doing millions of millions of dollars in sales and i'm like dude how many more of these can there be liquid death we had liquid death on probably 100 million in sales yeah exactly so you know you know just bottled water again like you know canned water sparkling water uh like my trainer was talking to me yesterday and he's like bro let's start a coconut water brand i was like yeah we should because you know what like uh coconut water is a massive market and like you could just go in and do more he's from hawaii so he's like bro like i grew up on this stuff we can we can brand it right we can get it out there and i was like okay cool let me find an operator so if somebody wants to start a coconut water brand with me just email me sean shawnproof.com because i want to start one and by start what i mean i want you to do most of the work and i'll do uh virtually nothing okay um so so let's let's do that split can you can you talk about this guy uh khan the nfl owner yes oh by the way can i do two quick updates yeah one um uh there's a guy you know you talked about like just buying a giant ranch by giant farmland or whatever there's a guy who hit me up he's very credible who's like i'll do this for you guys like i will go find it i'll i'll find the right thing i'll acquire i'll get the permits i'll build it out um and like you know let's just partner on it and so uh i love this podcast because it basically matches dude you get all like why is it the ugly water guy why is an ugly water guy setting me water why is it ranch guy sitting that's what i was into yeah you're into it i think my email is easier to find i don't know and people people just guess my email easier like i often dude my email's the same as yours sam sampard.com it's literally the exact same let me tell you this let me tell you this so a youtuber reached out so shout out to rebecca who's a a youtuber who reached out she's got 10 million youtube subscribers amazing she's a big star channel's awesome and um she's a fan of the pod and she had emailed reached out and said hey i listen to the pod or her i think her husband reached out or her brother or business manager somebody reached out and said hey it's her birthday tomorrow she'd love to like meet you guys as like a birthday present no she didn't say you guys okay she said whatever she said but she put both of our emails they had both of our emails on there but for you what they have like holler at thehustle.com which i don't know if that's a real email or not i went back and looked and it's holler maybe it's even spelled wrong i don't know is holler your email address no that's not my email address maybe that's why i didn't get it [ __ ] i don't know i don't even know what that is i i can tell by the the word holler at the hustle i guarantee you made that up one day yeah years ago that was supposed to be our help email exactly i guarantee you like just holler at me like we'll fix it just holler at me exactly all right anyways uh was gonna tell you the other one the other update is um this guy sent me a screenshot he's like ten thousand dollars he goes thank you for that idea i don't remember we had done an idea either here on twitter about uh moving bins this is a very simple idea which is like when you move you need these like packing bins just like these plastic heavy duty bins so you don't have to do boxes so you pack all your stuff you move to your other place you unpack you unpack it you just return the bin so you just rent these bins for the day while you move and i had like done done the numbers i was like this thing is kind of great it's like okay maybe you can't buy a property and rent it out but you can buy 50 of these bins and rent them out and you can make good money and so he emailed he's like hey it's been a long sweat like i'm not saying it was easy but you know i bought ten thousand dollars made from these bins and uh you know thanks for the idea i just really appreciate that that's you know uh it's kind of been a great side income for me in my city and i'm like oh this is cool like that's that's the best feeling of this whole podcast is basically if we throw the ideas out there and then people actually run with them and make something happen out of it so let me tell you something about that first of all that's amazing so have you ever been to the grocery store and seen one of those carpet cleaners carpet cleaners like uh what do you mean like a vacuum or something else yeah so it looks like a vacuum but it's it's meant for um it looks like a vacuum no it's like you push it you've never seen one of these so like people oh like this is a heavy-duty carpet cleaning like like more like a deep clean yes and people rent those for like 200 a day you know what i'm talking about uh yeah i know like it's kind of like the equivalent of power washing or something like that but for your carpet yes okay so i was thinking i was like looking at this and they a lot of them have a meter on there and they and that's like the hours the hours that uh it can go for i've been logged have been logged so like they it's like a dirt bike or like a boat where it's like instead of saying how many miles does it have on it's how many hours and so a lot of these things a lot of these carpet cleaners they can last for something like um five years so let's i i i don't know if this is make up a number yeah long time yeah so i don't know if this is exactly how it would work but let's say three and sixty five or fif there's 52 weeks in a year 52 times uh 40 let's see i'm just doing it really quick 260. so you're in public math are you no i'm doing it on my computer okay so we don't do public math so a lot of these things will last like 10 to 15 000 hours and they rent out for like 200 a day which comes out to be like you know 20 an hour i think buying and renting carpet cleaners is one of the greatest like banks for your money when i went i went to the grocery store and i just looked i was like how much does this cost and i looked at how much they cost to buy they cost like 800 to buy so this thing at the grocery store that i keep seeing all i would see it all the time and then i i once i saw those i would say to the people like how often do those rent for uh do people rent them a lot and they're like yeah all the time they're always being rented out it's like one of the greatest things i've ever seen when i was like doing the math i'm like this is brilliant the carpet goes back to our teenage side hustle like if you're a teenager or you have a teenager just get one of these and then teach your teenager how to make like kind of like one page sales letters and yelp ads and basically just drop the sales letters in uh you know under everyone's door uh every month so you're gonna print out a hundred of these put them in your neighborhood and just say hey hey y'all i live over here at 37 terrace woodway and uh i bought this cleaner it's amazing here's the before and after of my carpet but you know i'm not going to use this you know i only needed to use it once and it made such a big difference but i still got the thing if you want it i'll rent it out to you for 40 bucks just text me here i'll bring it to your house if you want your carpet clean and if you want me to do it for you i'll do it for 150 and uh and you know just do that and like that's such a good teenage side hustle uh because you know you'll learn sales you'll learn marketing you'll learn a little bit of like unit economics it's just a little way to get kind of make your first dollar i think making your first dollar is massively underrated like i didn't make my first dollar my first hustle dollar where like not like a job where i was you know sitting at a cash register all day but like me creating a product and selling it to somebody i didn't do that till i was like 19. i i'm sure you did it earlier because i think you were flipping stuff on ebay or something you i think you were more of a hustler early on than me well yeah but ebay ebay doesn't feel like the first dollar though uh maybe it does it's kind of like you had the scheme it's not a job basically like you're kind of like first dollar out of business yeah and in high school but by the way 19 is very young dude uh actually maybe maybe later i thought you were going to say like 30. it was 21 or 22 right right after i graduated and um so it's probably 22 actually and so like you know i wish that that 22 was 12. i think that it's like learning languages or you know like working out like the earlier you learn these core skills the better and so uh you know if you if you're sitting there and you even if you're 29 right now 39 whatever it is and you're at a job you've just never done this i really encourage you to go make your first dollar as a side hustle as a business make a product or find a product and sell it and um you know it'll it's surprising how it'll kind of like change the way you look at things yeah i agree that's what i told sarah when she was doing her course i'm like if you just get make one dollar and it's gonna change your life um can you tell me about this con guy i love this guy okay yeah all right this is the billy of the week and by the way uh by the way we should have been pop on ben ben come on here real quick we got a new producer and one of the things i'm gonna ask him to do is for our little segments make sure we do our segments like billy of the week people love that segment we should do it and two uh we gotta have like a little sound a little jingle a little something whenever we go to this segment i think and ben ben's the host of the how to take for the world podcast if you're not subscribed to that do it he did this those edison episodes that we released about thomas edison he's almost done our show now he has almost a hundred thousand listens a month all right ben okay big dog i'm surprised you're even still here with that big number uh not not for long sean if you keep pumping me up like this then you're not gonna your head's not even gonna fit into this i agree with that zoom window um we'll we'll try out a sound we'll play something on this episode a little like billy of the week jingle and see how people feel about it all right sounds good and you got to replace abreu at the end when we used to ask about you how we did and he gave us the straight talk million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars [Music] anyways back to the billy of the week so this guy his name is shahid khan he's from pakistan and he his story is kind of insane so here's the guy who moved to america at age 16. first job is a dishwasher for i think a dollar sixty an hour and um you know so he starts making a dollar sixty an hour and today he's worth nine billion dollars personally and uh how the heck did he do that so do you know this guy's story um a little bit i know him because he's incredibly recognizable he's like he's kind of beautiful like if he he he looks he looks like a badass a little bit he looks like a badass well he looks like someone who's i built respect and fear because they seem formidable and also they look like they like to party yeah he's got a [ __ ] sick mustache basically that's his like iconic thing he's got one of the mustaches that's like almost a twirled at the end it's amazing so he looks really special is the way i would describe him in a good way um okay so what is the story so he he starts off dishwasher he's like sleeping at the ymca and like you know now that he's super rich he like donates millions of dollars to the ymca because he's like dude i used to sleep in here i used to hide in the ymca and sleep because it was so cold outside and i didn't i couldn't afford like you know where i was supposed to live and so he um so he got rich by he made his millions by or his billions really by building custom bumpers for cars so car bumpers truck bumpers car bumpers that sort of thing so here's like how it all works so he he graduates as an engineering student and he gets a job at this company that does manufacturing for uh for bumper for car bumpers and he kind of like works his way up first few years i think he's there for maybe five seven years something like that he's eventually like kind of like leading the engineering operations and he's sort of like man this is so inefficient the way we do this we get all these different parts and we try to like jam them together to make this car bumper it's really heavy it's really clunky it's kind of ugly and um and i think the company was called flexing gate or later it was called flexing gate but uh he's working at this company and he along the way he's sort of like he's trying to convince the company like hey we should change the design but they're not really listening to him so he's like all right screw it i'm gonna spin out my own company and i'm gonna design my own bumpers and so he quits he takes uh yeah i think he has 16 000 in personal savings he takes like a 50 000 sba loan and he goes and he creates his own uh bumper company right and so he he starts uh trying to go get clients trying to go get customers and he's getting you know some small customers and along the way as he's making progress he gets sued by his previous employer they're like hey you stole trade secrets and uh you're competing your competition now so like screw you we're gonna we're gonna sue you and he's like [ __ ] like um they're way bigger than me i can't afford you know i can't afford a lawyer basically so i'm like how am i gonna fight this in court and i know their strategy their strategy is gonna be like they just um they just bleed me out right like they're bigger than me this is gonna cost both of us money but they're they have deeper pockets so he comes up with a strategy where he hires the cheapest lawyer he could find just to sort of like stall the case and then like so it's costing him almost nothing to continue it's costing them a lot of money they're losing a lot of money on this lawsuit and then he starts studying every night like after the business operations are done he goes to the library and he starts studying law so that he can defend himself in court because he hires this kind of like saul goodman you know type of character and just you know wants to defend himself so he starts educating himself and um so he ends up winning the case and along the way that company flexing gate was losing like 50 000 a month and so they were their business wasn't very healthy so by the end he wins the case and he just ends up it takes the money and he has the money from his business and he buys out flexing gates so he buys out the company that was suing him it's like a kind of like a [ __ ] you plus a consolidation of like how much should he pay for it do you know i don't know the exact number that he ended up uh buying him for but you know sort of like baller move uh going back there and he had designed this bumper that was like a slick kind of like one continuous piece so it wasn't a bunch of pieces put together and it was way more lightweight and so all of a sudden the car companies were like oh this is great we want to have a lighter weight thing it's better for fuel efficiency it's easier for manufacturing it's cheaper fantastic so they start going to him and so he starts getting like these contracts and there's like all these little sub stories in here that like i don't want to dive too far into but like he wants to get the like suzuki contract and so he like hires a bunch of people who know to speak japanese he starts learning all about the culture he like goes there because he's like i have to go further than anyone else is gonna go to win this deal because i'm a no-name brand but i have a great product and if i can make these guys trust me and believe in me this will work so he lands suzuki shortly after that he gets the big toyota contract now like as of today i think he's basically making like every automaker's bumpers like i think you know there's like 20 million plus cars that are have his bumper something ridic some ridiculous number like 30 of all cars use his bumpers and so you know the company um does billions and billions of dollars his personal net worth has ballooned to where he uh he owns nine billion dollars or he's worth nine billion dollars i believe as his personal net worth and then he's done a bunch of other things so he bought the jacksonville jaguar so he wanted to own an nfl team and he tries to buy the denver broncos but at the last minute the guy who was the minority owner had to write a first refusal and like exercised it and bought the broncos out from under him stand cronky and so he's like ah [ __ ] but he became friends with the guys who are the the people who in the jaguars he buys the jaguars and he starts doing some pretty interesting things so the jaguars are kind of like one of the bottom of the barrel team yeah and they're still not great right they're not great they've never they've had like very small windows of time where the team was good but it's never like a high profile franchise really it's like one of the small markets and so he's like okay how do i play the game to like how do i use this to my advantage so he's like all right ticket sales are low and he starts to dig into why it's like oh it's just so expensive to come to a game the average fan is priced out so he does something like pretty radical like he um he uh he made it where any fan can bring their own food to the games which is like the opposite of what every other stadium tries to do where they're like uh you know low ticket but then we'll charge you like 30 for a hot dog yeah he was like bring your own food and what ends up happening is ticket sales go up and i think food revenue went up when they got to the stadium like you know some counter-intuitive result like that and um you know he started doing a bunch of other things like he uh he put a fantasy football tracker in the stadium on the scoreboard he's like oh fans you know they're not just here to watch the game they're here for entertainment and part of their entertainment is their fantasy team so he like would show your points while you're while you're there and people got a kick out of that and he like pimped out the locker room for the players he's like i want to have like the best locker room very similar things to what mark cuban did with the with the dallas mavs by the way so similar sort of playbook he now owns awe which is like a head-to-head competitor with wwe like vince mcmahon's thing so it's like a wrestling wrestling thing he's got this crazy yacht called kismet which is like a i don't know it's like a i don't know how much this yacht cost but to rent it cost 1.2 million per week and that excludes food fuel and dockage costs and so like you know beyonce and jay-z rented this thing out for their italy vacation uh i think it's like a 200 million dollar yacht that he rents out for a million dollars a week dude that's nuts what do you uh what's your biggest takeaway from him um i just love this sort of like i mean this rags to a story is kind of like amazing and i think it's uh it's inspiring and so i think there's a lot of people who who could do this you're in a company you see things done inefficiently and if you had the guts you would basically be able to spin out and like you know your own competitor inside and out because you were there as a leader and so you know where their weaknesses are you know what the customer needs are and you know if you start to chip away like you can make a lot more than you would ever make climbing the corporate ladder there and then i loved some of the like atypical bets that he was making or moves that he's making like going into wrestling i think is super interesting most people don't think about that or there's no way that will work by the way there's no way well i think it's already made made quite quite a bit because he bought he bought this i think he bought the thing for dirt cheap and there's just like there's always a perpetual number two to wwe so he doesn't need to become wwe right like yes there is a long shot bull case where you know he ends up overtaking it but there's always been a number two like wcw back in the day or like you know the local uh the local shows and whatnot and so i think that there's a lot of money in even being like a really strong credible number two and i think wwe ends up buying all their competition and so he might end up flipping it to them someday um but it takes like some deep pockets so it might fail like you know that's okay but i like these types of bits it's inspiring to me like a guy like this yeah i think it's really cool i'm reading there's an awesome article about him in the new york times it's an old one it's about from 2011 and basically it says jaguar's buyer had his eyes on had his eyes on owner ownership franchise and the dream has come true and he talks about like how it's been his dream to do that and the whole like immigrant uh you know like this was like the the to me this is an american things to own a team and i think that's really great so anyway i think it's cool he gets a lot of racism stuff too by the way i was reading about that like in jacksonville there's a bunch of ticket holders who canceled it because an american didn't own the team now and he's like dude like we are americans but uh you know so i think he's even even even still you know still fighting certain battles yeah i do of course um and i dig this this is a good one i feel like every ability of the wheat that we've ever done is like basically an immigrant there's definitely a recurring theme here we got to do an american billy born and bred american billy of the week no i like the immigrant stories i prefer those um let me tell you about a cool app that i found um well it's a web app so a website it's called [ __ ] you pay me and so the ur the url is f y p m dot vip it's kind of confusing but i just sent it to you and it's in the dock actually as well and i just sent it on riverside and so [ __ ] you pay me so basically what it is it's the it's kind of glass door slash yelp for influencers and so if you are an influencer you can log on and you can see which brands are easy to work with and how much they pay and people want to work with them again and i think this is interesting for a couple reasons the biggest one is well like this is cool but the second reason why i like this is because these types of businesses i actually think are incredibly easy to set up and if you could start getting reviews and if you could start getting people to use it very valuable so basically this website it i don't know what it's built with but i bet you that there's some just like it's probably a wordpress uh like a login or something like that like very very very simple stuff you could you could build this in like two or three days and there's another good example of this and that that's called um uh vcguide.com so we're talking about influencers and venture capitalists because that's in our world but have you ever been a vc guide dot co yeah i've been to it yeah okay so it's it's the most basic looking website you've ever seen and it's just a list of names and people vote on and or leave reviews on different venture capitalists but anyway i think that this is a really really cool business and i love this idea there's another one that i was looking at called niche niche.com which is not small but they like it's the same type of thing but just they do it for schools and so i think that there's a lot of really cool businesses that could be built with this model another one that i think could exist and similar to influencers is like basically all the publishers out there like bustle um who else i don't i mean whatever just all they pay freelancers buy the article or buy the word and i think that you could if you wanted to you could do a price per article for publishers you could do how much anyone pays for anything basically in terms of freelance work and so anyway i think this is a cool business it's called [ __ ] you pay me i think it's awesome yeah i think this is cool as like a i think it was started by a couple influencers right yeah but i don't i don't remember their name yeah so i think it's a good um like scratching their own edge right like at some point they get tired of working with clients that don't pay up on time or or try to remake on the deal and they say look if we band together we can do this and they already have a network of other friends who do this they have trust they know the problem so i think that's a great niche niche business to start and if you're in a world like in an industry the i think these are actually easier to build like for example if you are in the automotive world automotive manufacturing and you have 50 friends who work in that business you could pretty like easily kind of get this going and it becomes addicting i remember i'm not on vc guy thank god i'm not a vc but i do invest but like let's see are you on it sean like you start checking your name all the time yeah exactly you want to know what are people saying about me yeah you check it all the time and so anyway i think like they're i think these are really interesting and uh this is kind of a cool one i have a super quick idea i'll just do that's related to this i saw this company i should give them a shout out i think it's called pump um and what they're doing is actually pretty cool it's um you know like investor so you wrote great investor updates i used to be on your i wasn't an investor in the hustle but you used to send me the updates uh i don't know why just it was cool like i could see it um and you wrote really great investor updates like it was clear it was like just the right mix of like the info you need not too much and not too little and you had like a clear ask if you needed something i see a lot i see a lot of companies using that same template i don't know if i stole that if i took that from someone or like you like kevin lee from uh the ramen company his updates look exactly the same i don't know what it is but that that style i feel like is everywhere now yeah i don't know where you got it from but it's great i wish more of the founders i invested in would do it because mine don't do that that's all up there they're either like ultra detailed like we hired this engineer and this person and they used to work here it's like all right i really just okay i'm glad you did that but like what does that matter to me like it's too in the weeds for where i'm at to help your business and then they'll leave out like here's how many customers we have and here's how much money is in the bank here's what we need here's what our goals are like they'll leave that out but they'll go into like ultra detail about other stuff so um anyways i think in general investor updates take a lot of time they're really healthy practice but they're sort of like writing books right now it's like you do this thing once a month or every couple months and you write it take some time to read take some time to to write and i saw this company pumped i was basically just saying take your cap table and it lets you do like twitter sized updates about your company so you can just like post a photo of something cool that's going on or a chart what's the url uh i don't know the url i think the brand i think the app or the company's called pump i think it's pretty it might even be public i might have to bleep it out um but i was looking at it as a potential investment uh because i really like this idea i think that uh updates that are more frequent will actually be more transparent will actually be more useful it will be more easy to read but easier to write it'll get more interaction between the investors and the founder because i can just hit the like button or i can just write a quick reply like looks awesome or have you talked to this person they're doing something else check out this and um i think this is actually a way better way to do investor updates it's basically like a private twitter feed for just you and your investors and um that expectation of a bite-sized bit of content is great and it's on the uh play play store i don't even know what what the [ __ ] is the play store is that like uh that's google you know dude i don't [ __ ] use it no i don't know anything about that uh i'm looking at it now you're the craziest thing i've ever heard dude i've never been on the play store in my life i didn't even know what that was see this like blue collar everyday sam and it's like what is android [Laughter] i i i i'm sorry i don't know one person that uses android do you of course like [Music] the pixel's got an amazing camera it's amazing dude i don't know one person like closely i just thought everyone uses an iphone except if you have android and you're in my group chat you're out of my group chat bro like you're killing the group chat with your inability to like send pictures and and all that it's horrible but i'm looking at pump it's also in the app store i actually think this is cool there was this other company that people were were saying was gonna be really cool i forget the name of it you might remember it though and it was like how to collaborate with your investors better what was that called start with a c cabal i think that's the one i saw cabal it seemed okay this seems way way interesting i think this is better that cabal has a bunch of like cool people using it and invested in it so it might have like the the important people doing that but uh how did you find that i like this product better uh how did you find scout found this dude i have a lot of help zach found this one uh for uh faraz found the billy of the week and sent it to me because he'd been on the guy's yacht and sent me a picture of it and was like you got to feature this guy uh it's a lot of my ideas don't come for me wow no that's amazing um i would i would invest in that company yeah i think that's really cool um if you're the founder hit us up we want it we want to invest in that all right you want to do one more thing or you want to save it we should save it this episode is going to be a little crazy we'll see if it's interesting oh um you want to talk about my influencer update yeah you're like let's save it but i want to talk about this well because that's actually not important so we could hide it at the end this was actually what i was going to start with because i found this hilarious uh and awesome and i wanted to know what you're actually doing because like you said it as a joke so sam texts the other day he goes i think i think you were joking but you're like half serious no i was not maybe you were not serious or not joking i think i was serious yes you're more serious than joking so sam texts i'm thinking about stopping trying to be a business influencer and just go to be a fitness influencer i don't know if my face is good enough though and so then i'm like okay just some kind of random funny text didn't think much of it and then you sent me this link to this reddit post where you're like my fitness journey you're like here i'm at you know 12 body fat and here's my photos and here's what i'm doing i'm like oh [ __ ] he's actually trying to do it so what is this what are you doing so did you see my instagram thing the video yeah i saw your video yeah so here's why i think it's cool um i love exercise i love to work out and i'm a little bored of just business content and i look up so you want to know what i we're going to talk about this next episode but here's what i do late at night late at night i go to instagram and i love watching videos of ripped guys stretch do you ever watch like no no i never do that i don't i don't i've never done something like that dude there's these guys this is like getting really popular right now there's these dudes who they do calisthenics and they're like sitting on like these bars and they like move their legs above their head or they uh they like do the splits or and they're not like jacked like dudes but they're like skinnyish very flexible and i'm like this is the way to live life 100 percent to be skinny and flexible and there's just i just in my head i'm like they're just stretching all day and filming it that seems awesome i can do that and so that's kind of like how i want to live my life right now is i like watch these guys do like the you know what your thoracic thoracic spine is yes it's upper back so because like we sit hunched over like everyone's got like a hunchback kind of and so yeah the thoracic it's like i think it's really good to stretch and so i just watch videos of guys stretch her thoracic spine i love nick bear nick bear was this huge beast of a guy who came on our podcast and he has this like pretty cool business and he just like runs marathon and lifts weights all day and i see this and i'm like that sounds awesome i totally want to do that also additionally i'm a little i got a little once like we sold the company i got a little depressed because i was like i live such a soft [ __ ] life like i don't have any real threats in my life i never have to fight i never have to get like i never got to go hunt for my food i never am like afraid of getting eaten by a lion like i need some action and adventure yeah i'm too comfortable and so i was like this fitness thing seems cool like let's just learn how to box or let's just do something like interesting and just document it and i and i've loved it and so i am not joking i think i might do this but when you say might do this what does that actually mean you're going to try to literally become a fitness influencer meaning like you want to be sam uh you know sami hamstrings who's got like amazing amazing hamstring stretches or like what do you actually want what is the goal i think i could build a large following i don't i i've besides like checking like other people's pictures i don't post on instagram at all and for some reason i have like 5 000 followers so i think that's a good base i think i could build up this like reputation as this like fitness slash businessy type of guy okay fitness business but you're talking specifically about stretching or no any any fitness is fine uh i'm gonna focus on boxing and weightlifting right now because that's what i love but i think stretching is like the way to go yes like there's so many people who google uh different stretching stuff dude i'm telling you this this whole mobility movement it's huge and how committed are you to this i mean i work out constantly like so actually to the influencer part i know you're committed to doing the fitness stuff i haven't decided how uh committed i am because well what was the reaction to your reddit and instagram thing because that probably just gave you a bunch of jet fuel of motivation to keep going well the pr it was good i mean the reddit the thing that read it was interesting i just posted on a subreddit called guess my body fat and like people but then i wasn't caring about that when i told you what i was caring about is that someone said your body fat is probably this i don't know about sean perry's and i was like oh my god that's crazy someone like recognizes us and so but the instagram thing that i posted it got popular but the thing is is that i actually think that like getting famous on social media is really cool and also it will make you very unhappy and so that's my biggest thing the biggest thing i'm nervous about is like do i actually want to spend time on this and go down this like hedonistic uh like uh you know dedicating my life to something that maybe isn't actually that cool or important but it does seem kind of neat so anyway that's my rant i'm becoming a fitness influencer i think i could do it i think i'd like have girl next door like a girl next to her body you know what i mean like not likely dude that's so true it's like not intimidating you're not on a you're not unachievable but you're also impressive so it's like yeah i'm into it but i feel like with enough work i too could be there yeah i got like he's just a regular guy i got girl next door uh abs like you know like you can do it too and you have been doing it by the way you look great well i'm trying but i'm i'm far behind where you're at yeah but i had a head start it would have been fun if uh like when i saw you post that thing i was like oh damn okay so i've been doing this for one year now uh it's time to do this for a while okay let me see you know it sort of put into perspective like actually the girl the guy next door thing you said it's so true because that's actually the feeling i had which was i was like you know when i look at random people on instagram that are really ripped it doesn't do anything for me because i'm like well i'm not trying to do that i'm not trying to be a gorilla like i'm not trying to like have 19 you know 19 abs but like four four nice abs that seems like both achievable and desirable to me so i actually think you're on to something with this guy next door vibe that's what i'm saying it's like everything every our podcast people say oh you guys make everything seem so easy and achievable and i'm like and what do we say we're like it kind of is you got to put in the work but like it's not that hard in an election yeah because we're not that smart nor are we that successful nor are we that nor do we do that much research so there's there's a a relatability to us we're not smarter than you we're not that much more successful than you and we definitely don't do a ton of research on each individual topic so we're not that much more of an expert than you on anything this is my thing i might just translate that to like getting shredded and being fit and like living a long healthy life that's why it's interesting to me also the same way that whenever you post stuff uh like people send you free [ __ ] like that drink company or like you know you have you have a lot of like people who email you with amazing opportunities it would be cool to get that for workout related stuff so that's one of the reasons why i want to do it did i show you this have i shown you this it's an axe i'm holding up an axe for those who are just listening not on the youtube channel and it's called chop fit so this guy sent me this dude [ __ ] i don't get [ __ ] i don't get anything bro there's a method to the madness uh i think we asked for it or we told him like i saw this thing and we messaged him be like hey this is awesome he's like oh i'd love to send you one it's really what i do i basically just have a bunch of dms that are for products i think are cool and i just say yo shopfit looks dope congrats you know like something like that and they're like oh thank you that's amazing and i'm like yeah i'd love to try it or yeah i'm excited to try it i just let them fill it in with like yeah here you go anyway so he sent me this i'm looking at the website this is a weighted axe so it's basically peloton the reason i'm showing you this dude isn't this just a jammer it's yeah but it's like more there's two of these so you get two of these so you have two of these to work out with one in each hand and it's sort of like a peloton but like okay like i like the idea of peloton i like the idea of guided classes but i'm not into biking like i don't love biking i don't love running on a treadmill so like i have the aqua bag boxing bag in my garage because i love hitting the aqua bag it's like super fun to me i love aqua bags too so that's really cool and then this is the new toy i'm starting to play with which is like i like swinging this thing around there's something that feels fun about this it feels like i'm about to like kill somebody and uh you can get a pretty sick core workout with this thing and like kind of it also works the uh forearms really well too because you're holding an axe which is like you ever seen like a lumberjack those guys arms or their forearms are insane do me a favor tonight or tomorrow whenever you're gonna go work out again just do it shirtless do it outside in the sun and take a video of you doing this and post it on twitter and i promise you it'll get at least 25 000 views people are gonna like comment to you and it's gonna a comment about you and it's gonna feel awesome you're gonna become a fitness center too i work out with no shirt every day in the sun every day it feels amazing to do is record the whole thing i take snippets because i'm i'm you're going from fit to really fit i'm going from fat to fit and so there's a big difference you got to strategy you got to be strategic right like you don't want to just post a before it's got to be like slightly impressive yeah yeah yeah you got like a montage that goes from shitty to like oh that's really good no in your case it's like okay so i'm storing up my ammo for the epic montage you're like right now you're like there's like before and way before yeah exactly i'm i'm i'm a good before photo now but i had a way before that i've been had been working towards i'm not after yet so i'm i'm waiting for the afternoon that's a bad move maybe i should be posting everything but i think it has a bigger impact if i do the before and after because it should be impressive when you do it okay well this is the episode where we've just decided we're both going to become fitness influencers i think you should post a picture of that i think i don't want to be a fitness influencer but i do want uh to like do it myself i've never done this i've never been somebody who's like ripped um you start posting the reason why one of the reasons another reason why i'm doing it is i said out there i'm gonna so right now i weigh 203 pounds i and i'm probably i'm 12 maybe 14 body fat which is okay that's pretty good um i said i put it on there i want to weigh 185 in three months and a lot of people saw that and now if they see me out there eating like an idiot they're gonna like confront me and i think that that accountability is actually really good no like like it like my in-laws you know saw me and they're like oh we know we're not gonna eat we're not gonna we can't go to this place for dinner anymore uh right you know what i mean like that type of thing yeah that's funny all right uh ben how did we do um this one was weird was weird but i think people are really gonna like it i think people like weird uh i actually think the uh body influencer stuff was really good eight point five out of ten overall okay all right i'll take that for a while what was the what was the weakest part um the weakest part has been forgettable was um i would say probably the middle talking about like water bottles and stuff like that that was interesting but just the weakest the strongest was like the energy audit uh stuff time tracking sleep talk like when you guys work i think that was super strong started super strong ended super strong when talking about your like fitness journey all right good well let's see how the sam hose water thing was by far my favorite part of the whole episode is that a real thing people used to call you hose water or that was no but like i love hose water you don't drink out of hoses bro dude are you are you considered funny because i find you really really funny but you're funny in a surprising way and i feel like you think you're funny but almost that other people don't give you credit for being really funny i think that i'm not that funny and i think most people don't think i'm funny really oh i don't think you know you're funny i think people most people do not find my humor to be i got like a norm mcdonald humor you're either into it or you're not [Laughter] uh just so everyone has like the background that that joke that shawn told of sam saying i'm gonna own a lake someday he posted it in slack and then like badgered us like five times afterwards like did you guys see that joke was it a good job anybody read that it was pretty good and then and then we were like yeah it was good and then ben comes in he's like sean it was really funny when you said this thing and sam was like what the hell dude my leg joke was way better than that oh my god this makes our life sound cooler than it really is future owner of the lakers future owner of a lake all right [Music]

that there could be an hour that comes in your life that is worth more than the cumulative sum of everything else you've spent all the time all of the effort all of the energy that you've spent doing everything else i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back this was like a hit podcast like we're growing we're doing good and yet sean your microphone is the most like hood rat thing i've seen what is that is it like balanced in there yeah so there's like you know there's some way that this is supposed to sit and then there's the way it actually sits and uh you know don't mess with success it's our good luck charm so um jack we're recording now i think you um someone i don't know how much you looked into it but someone sent your team a little update on or a little description on what we do and it looks like you sent an agenda this looks awesome so i have a feeling you know what's up a little bit is that right yeah i listened to a few of your guys podcasts i think it's great great content shawn and i kind of go way back we used to know each other back in san francisco in the early days when tech was getting going there and winter san francisco yeah when tuck was in san francisco and excited to be on thanks for having me how did you uh how did you guys know each other i was gonna ask you this um i i didn't know how much you remembered i remember pretty vividly um i was at this time i was running monkey inferno which was an idea lab or a sort of startup studio and uh i don't know how we got connected but jack came by the office and i remember sitting in this conference room and he was thinking about launching his own you know sort of like personal incubator idea factory whatever you want to call these things what do you call it jack by the way you call it a startup studio we go with startup studio just given that the industry seems to have gone with that and i remember before the meeting i like kind of googled like okay who's this guy and then i saw oh wow this guy's like done all this stuff he had he built milo he sold it to ebay and this was like you know not his first rodeo and um and in the meeting i remember you had like really good questions you had like because a lot of people like this idea of a startup studio it sounds really fun you get to sit around all day just think of ideas and build them and like if something hits you know hooray and uh but you had actually like done a lot of thought you put a lot of thought into it and so you asked a bunch of questions and i remember thinking hey i've been doing this for a few years i could share a bunch of insights i remember everything that i had told you i was like hey here's a common trap avoid it go this way you were like yeah that's why we're doing it this way you had already you were sort of two two steps ahead i remember and i was i remember walking away being like okay i think this is one of the few struggle studios that might actually work and i think it has done so i think it's one of the few startup studios that has actually worked you guys had hymns come out of it which is like a breakout success public company and um and what what are some of the other ones that have come out of atomic that are big i know there's the there's some that have sort of spiked and i'm not sure where they're at now they didn't kind of go yeah full yeah like we did we've uh we've created a ton of different companies um bungalow has been doing incredibly well we just announced a huge raise for that company homebound which is kind of revolutionizing construction and how that's done with the marketplace dynamic replicant which is using ai to transform call centers radiant which is kind of um cloud software for screens for b2b applications so we kind of touch all sorts of industries we have now actually a few dozen companies that we've started right so we operate across everything and a lot of our companies are doing really well we're we actually try to keep a lot of our companies stealth because people have started to try to copy them and by the time we announce them they've usually raised pretty significant funding so a lot of them are are under wraps but we tend to do a lot in healthcare and telemedicine we do a lot in prop tech we do a lot in fintech education ai and then marketplaces what is the like idea process because you're right you do stay in stealth for a while i think i feel it feels like when you come out to market you've already like the company's already got a bunch of traction you announce a big raise at that point but what that means is that people are willing to copy you like if jack's doing it as an idea it's probably a good market and a good idea let's just that if we just use that and we copy that we're already skipping a bunch of potential points of failure and um you know i think everybody thinks they're a good idea person you actually seem to be a good idea person so where does that what's the process what's the process for ideas um you know how are you coming up with so like a high number of good of good quality ideas you have you have 600 you have a list of 600 in an evernote doc it's just an evernote doc right yeah 600. yeah so you have a lot a lot of ideas yeah yeah so okay multi-part question um so i think the first part of this is where do kind of good ideas come from and i have a view on this which is a little contrarian and actually i think where startup studios and incubators can fall apart which is a lot of times if you're incubating companies a temptation is to brainstorm on ideas so think about things get into a room whiteboard come up with solutions and you're kind of coming up with these contrived solutions to problems that may or may not exist and that's kind of a problem you know versus what we do at atomic is we don't have brainstorming sessions so we've been in business for over a decade we've never had a brainstorming session on ideas which is kind of crazy right so what we do is we observe problems in the world that could be problems that we have personally problems on our team problems in our portfolio that our companies have that create enterprise companies and in that case we observe the problems we see a pattern we actually build the product to solve it we deploy it across our portfolio we have built-in customers we we dog food it we make sure that it works within our portfolio and then once we know it works then we release it to the world but it's really a problem first kind of mentality and then solving the problem that i think makes us stand out and a little bit different from other people that have attempted this and i uh in terms of the 600 ideas and where they've come from it turns out our view of the world is like it's actually fundamentally very broken there's just a lot of stuff in the world that could be improved and that doesn't mean that everything's like broken broken right like it just means that there's there is an opportunity in many many facets of light and many parts of the economy to up level things and this could be in just like everyday parts of life this could be in going to the doctor's office this could be in commuting to work this could be in you know interacting with a company or running a sales team or you know something like that you just observe all these things and think wow that doesn't seem you know that seems a little bit broken there there's probably a better way and then i just got in the habit of writing those down and now that list has grown to over 600 and that's a seed that we use to start companies out of at atomic and i have um a whole bunch of questions that i like i i i was telling you i watched a lot of your interviews so i i understand a little bit about your process and i want to ask you about that but before you did this so you're 30 are you 34 now i'm 35 now you're 35. so before you were doing atomic your first big win was milo you sold that for like 75 million at 24 right yep stayed there at ebay sam do you know who his dad is i do comms core yeah so so i didn't know that until i was doing research because we had met i just thought oh he's kind of like a whiz kid and i love contour behind every whiz kid is some unique childhood i think where you get exposed to something so so jack so your dad started comscore is that right with ceo uh i don't know if you still ceo and you were working there like at age 12 or something crazy is that right thanks yeah um yeah i had a an interesting childhood where i got exposed to entrepreneurship at a young age my dad was an immigrant he came to the u.s literally without a dollar to his name from wherever he was born in lebanon and then he actually went to college in france studying science and engineering and math he came to the us phd in math at mit and he literally didn't have a dollar to his name so he slept on a concrete basement floor at mit in a sleeping bag i was born while he was there in boston and then you know he took math and he applied it to business he actually invented all these really cool new forms of marketing which at the time were revolutionary he ended up winning these international marketing awards for them ended up getting promoted in the company that he joined and eventually became president of it and then decided to become an entrepreneur can you imagine the world dream i mean he was basically born at the bottom of the third world he rose to the top of the first world started a company sold it and then when i was 12 or 13 he said jack i'm going to start a company that's going to measure everything everyone does on the internet and make sense of it do you want to join it and i joined it as the third person as a software engineer and i learned how to write code did he give you equity uh well so he was like do you want cash for equity i said equity i don't want cash give me equity so i took the equity and it ended up working out also child labor laws meant he couldn't pay me cash so i had to get the equity and at its peak it was worth it like he took it public it was worth like 6 billion or something like that like many billions yeah it ended up being worth billions at its peak um he basically yeah he grew it on his own took it public it did really well and then you know two or three years after it went public he decided i don't want to be a public company ceo and he got off of that started doing investing and being on boards but i got to see that grow just from like an idea in my parents sitting room to you know thousand plus person company to public company and i just got hooked so i started starting companies at age 15 and i've just been hooked it's just been in my dna ever since technology has been in my dna how long were you when you went when it went public hmm that's a good question i was in college so i probably was like 19 or 20 or something like that so he gave you shares when you were 13 when you were 20 what did they end up becoming worth were you like the richest 20 year old there is the podcast is called my first million you might have been the youngest the youngest person to make your first million uh if that math adds up you know my dad was a is a very fair person and that would have been nepotism to give me an unfair amount of shares he gave me what i deserved which i was a 12 or 13 year old that didn't know how to code so i got basically paid the equivalent of like close to minimum wage and shares which is kind of what i deserved right but it ended up being worth a lot of money and it was great and yeah it was a good taste of equity and you start milo it it's a quiet was it acquired for 75 billion right so you're 24. so correct just massive success milo ends up becoming a pretty big deal like a main part of ebay you work on a a bunch of big parts at ebay you become this kind of big shot like you kind of climb out about this because in the last two years but basically me so i got acquired uh we got acquired by twitch to like you know go from uh a little start up to okay it's a 2000 person company sam just got acquired his company just got acquired by hubspot i don't know how many how many places hubspot have probably three thousand i think three thousand employees and so uh and i know i would say like the default path for entrepreneurs and i know because i talked to a bunch of them during the acquisition process of like all right what's the next year of my life going to look like you know what's your advice to me and i got a whole range of idea of sort of opinions but i would say the common the default path was sort of like look somebody who's like you true entrepreneur at heart it's gonna be hard for you to be in a big company for a long time uh you could choose to either like just not play the game you kind of like coast and just do your own thing maybe do build a couple interesting products while you're there and then bounce whenever you're ready or you like try to play the game you try to climb the ladder a bit and uh and actually like figure out what what this looks like there's a different game than the startup game you're you're not zero to one you're sort of in the one one-to-n phase of things and you know it's all about sort of about management of a large organization um and i think most entrepreneurs go the first route that i just mentioned but it seems like you actually kicked ass at ebay like i remember reading some article where you were basically like a vp or something you were the the mvp really you were like the the guy who's helping turn this thing around i think it was like part of a bigger story of hey ebay is turning itself around but um you seem to have done extremely well talk about that is that something where you what was your approach when you got acquired and is that true yeah yeah how much of that story is true yeah so you know it's interesting first of all it's definitely true it wasn't told when i was at ebay partially because i don't like that much attention and i don't claim credit for a lot of things while i was there i was just catching up with like a reporter that i liked and i told him this story and he was like this is amazing why hasn't anyone written about this it ended up getting written up and eventually the story got told but um yeah i'm a pretty impact motivated person overall and i had just heard all these stories about founder friends that had sold their companies and they they sell to the acquirer and they languish and they actually kind of become depressed they're just kind of like they lose their mojo they're just like what am i doing what's my life becoming they'd almost become like robotic and i was just like you know what life's short like i'm let me figure out how to use this experience for the good of the company of me i'm proud of what i built i want to see it succeed let's figure out how to do that and i went and you know there's some funny stories about things that we did while we were at ebay to try to maintain our culture we at one point i rallied the troops we had this house they tried to put us in cubicles i had the whole company rise up and go and rip down the cubicles and throw it on the front lawn and we almost got in trouble and kicked off campus and all sorts of crazy stuff but i basically took the approach of like look what's the worst thing that can happen they can fire me if i get fired i don't really care so i might as well just go for it and try to do great things while i'm here right and what's what's a great thing that i can do well there's a bunch of products that ebay can build i like building products i'm an entrepreneur i haven't tried building multiple products at once what if i use this time at ebay to try to put together multiple teams under me and try my hand at building multiple products at once and see if i'm any good at that versus just working on one product and i convinced the ceo to let me do that and give me a shot at it and the majority of what we built was hitting and like a lot of it was driving press cycles and the stock price the biggest thing i did i convinced the ceo to do on a friday that night i convinced six people to cancel their next two weeks fly with me to sydney australia rent an airbnb turn it into a hacker house and we built the entire thing in two weeks there's actually a story written about this online and it ended up becoming the feed in the homepage of ebay and 130 million people were using it nine months later um as like the primary discovery mechanism on the site and and and after that you started a couple things before atomic i think right and those things there i feel like when i was researching your story they're kind of like footnotes like they're not like major parts and yet i researched them they were really successful uh like a couple software companies right yeah started a bunch of software companies that are still successful they're kind of part of atomic is kind of how we consider them everything's kind of been folded into one umbrella at at uh one point or another the the other thing that i would say that is a lesson that we learned and sean i don't know if you remember when we talked about startup studios about this but one trap you can have with startup studios is when you have hundreds of ideas and when i left ebay i had 250 potential ideas for my next company is the temptation is to try them all and the thing that we did at atomic is we only did one the first year to the second three the third for the fourth we really paced ourselves and i think you know now we're at the point where we can do 10 or 12 a year um but that was kind of part of that pacing process i remember three of those traps i want to say them because i'm sure there's somebody out here listening who who would be curious um i remember one was exactly what you said which was focus so uh the theme is basically startup studios are great they have a bunch of advantages but you don't want to lose the natural advantages that startups have and so startups have desperation and focus those are two of the core ingredients of a startup and i said you know shiny object syndrome is a trap when you have an idea lab you could do exactly what you said you could just go in a whiteboard brainstorm it that's kind of your job and then you take one of those ideas it sounds semi-plausible and paul graham i think calls these sitcoms startup ideas it's like you come up with a a a kind of a manufactured story for a sitcom like oh a guy and a girl fall in love in college and then you know their jobs take them across the country and they break up right like you come up with these manufactured ideas and then the second thing is because you have multiple ideas going at once when you're doing at the beginning when you're doing one it starts to hit some rough patches or plateaus or just things get challenging like every idea does um well that shiny object over there is unproven that one might be easier let's just go and you either intentionally or unintentionally start to shift your focus away from the hard thing that you should really be pushing through and start just focusing on other shiny objects the second one was desperation you you had said something smart you you go we're gonna fund the team i think we've said for nine months you go then their job is to raise the series a in nine months um and i was like that's great because if otherwise in an ideal lab these things can just languish forever you could just keep them it's sort of this feeling that you know if not this month and next month no problem and you're like the people working on this are only going to work on this one project their project needs to raise money or sorry guys it's a bust and like of course you would probably recycle the best talent into the next idea but i liked that having a uh sort of a deadline and a do or die moment of like you either proved your [ __ ] or you didn't that was the second uh second one i remember and the third was you're like we're gonna focus on b2b initially and not consumer stuff because we know a bunch of pain points that we've had as entrepreneurs or our companies have and so we can kind of scratch our own niche and not try to make the next hit social network and frankly it's probably so much easier although himself was a consumer company so you know you know but maybe who knows i don't want to pry but maybe you're scratching your own it's there too well you know it no that was a bunch of that was a hair loss company i still have my hair as i said it was a hair loss he was about to jack was about to skip that one over and then he was like i gotta try to let it go um you know that a vc told me who i really respect that the way you make your money in the venture business is b2b those are your singles and doubles typically and consumer can be your home runs that can be your lightning in the bottle and you should plan your portfolio accordingly who said that um that's a good question i think it was one of the managing partners from general catalyst if i remember correctly um and they're great we do some work with them they're pretty fantastic and you know since then b2b has actually been able to become home runs right additionally right like the valuations on some of these b2b companies is absolutely astronomical but the great thing about doing b2b is you can talk to the customer and you can trust what they say and that is not necessarily true for consumer consumers you can talk to them and you almost have to read between the lines with what they say you can't trust what they say you can trust what they do you have to kind of run them through the product you have to look at the data and see what they do but what they do is actually usually different than what they say and what works is not always what they say is going to work part of that is consumers don't know in their mind what they need they don't know it's hard they can't dream it up so it's a very different practice creating consumer companies from b2b companies but to address your other point sean of the nine months and you know having companies raise on their own that is like a purposeful element that we designed atomic in which is we tried to design atomic to be uncomfortable at the atomic level so companies are pushed out and people are pushed out of atomic and there's not this effect where people just stay in the incubator forever because it's dangerous to do that and that is is it nine months and 300 000 is that right or 250 000 or something um so we have multiple stages of investment the first check that we'll write to kind of get something going and do some initial research and homework is around a quarter million dollars but it could range from a hundred thousand to four hundred thousand and then if that goes well we can write a check that's usually two million dollars but again it could be one to four million dollars and then from there we can actually write a check that could be three to eight million dollars um that sometimes we do with other vcs sometimes we do on our own kind of depends on the circumstances depends on the needs of the company and what we need to get to the next set of milestones um but that's kind of how it works now that's been evolving over our funds and our first fund it was smaller so we obviously only did like the early rounds which is what sean is describing and then as it's gotten bigger we're able to get the companies further which is why we can keep them stealth longer and now when they come out they usually have raised these really big rounds did you when you when you were starting this how much of your own money did you put up to do this and were you like all right uh you know i made this much money i'm willing to lose a million dollars over the next two years to see if i can make this work yeah it's a good question so my general philosophy with things is you shouldn't sell what you wouldn't also buy so i wanted to prove to myself that this would work before raising outside capital so the first year or so of atomic i did it with my own capital which was roughly on the order of what you described and then once i was convinced okay i think this is working i think we can pull this off i think this model is going to work and then we raised our first fund and our first fund was you know roughly the first first part of the first fund was roughly a 10 million dollar vehicle that was primarily individuals and we had some great founders of venture capital firms involved like mark andreessen and um idan senkid and peter thiel and people like that that helped us a lot in the early days and that helped us prove out the model from there and since then we've raised much much larger funds you have a couple of things on the agenda that i i want to know the answer to and one is what you just said you've uh andreason backed your your fund chris dixon david sacks peter thiel and you said on here he says some of some of the learnings from some of these kind of like pretty amazing people these are some of the like architects of like you know the modern silicon valley um i guess do you have any like fun stories anecdotes or lessons learned that are you know not what's you know i guess like just absolute common sense where you just say we all already know that but what have you learned from some of these guys that's that's been that stood out to you or stuck with you and add in josh kushner on there too because he interests me as well he which he almost has a model like yours yeah he also starts companies i love josh josh is fantastic um wow well those are great people the first thing i'd say and you know this is just a general thing is like there are some amazing people out in the world i'm surprised how many people don't approach them and just ask them for advice and mentorship and that's something that was a major way that i learned throughout my career and i'm so thankful to have had those people in my life and grateful for everything that i learned from them you know i'd say maybe going going through some of them one of the things that i learned from mark andreessen was actually a really interesting story about peter thiel um that led to a really really big insight that i had that has kind of driven a lot of my decision making since then um which is this concept that time exists on this massive power law basis and um you know they were having this conversation apparently mark was telling me where peter was talking to mark and he was talking about you know this big moment where he made this investment in mark zuckerberg and he made this investment in in facebook and you know he said you know listen mark i worked so hard my whole life to be able to get into stanford i really worked hard in in high school and i did this and i did that and all these extracurriculars i finally got into stanford i got into stanford i crushed it at stanford i tried to get you know the best grades while i was there i did really well to get into stanford law school i got into stanford law school i did really well while i was there i you know was really crushing it while i was there because i wanted to get into the best law firm i got into the best law firm while i was there you know i realized it wasn't for me but that enabled me to start a hedge fund from there i met max levchin i got the opportunity to go run paypal i ran that it went public you know ended up being merging with ebay it led me to start clearing capital this hedge fund which was kind of a dream that i wanted to do for a long time all of this effort all of this time all of this energy everything that i had done up until this point in my life got me one hour with mark zuckerberg and that hour was worth more than the cumulative sum of all those other hours that i'd spent in my life and that is a crazy mind-blowing fact if you think about that that there could be an hour that comes in your life that is worth more than the cumulative sum of everything else you've spent all the time all of the effort all of the energy that you've spent doing everything else and i think that can be true for everyone so looking out for those kind of like power law time moments or those power hours can be so important and i believe that they exist and sometimes they're in plain sight so thinking about those critically how do you put yourself in those positions where you can discover those kinds of opportunities and how do you almost engineer your calendar so that you can create those opportunities for yourself i think it's an interesting question what's an example of that for you do you have an hour is there something that stands out to you that's like your version of that hour with zuck or how do you engineer it yeah it's a really interesting question so this is something i've never met jeff bezos i'm a huge fan of his but one of the things that he does that i think that i adopted that i think is a really really cool practice is you take a look at your prior week and how all of your time is spent and you you look at your calendar you look at each block each half an hour each hour and you you basically i basically modified a little bit what he does but you ask the question for all of these things that i did last week what are the things where if i hadn't done this thing nothing would have changed and you cross it off the list and if things keep getting crossed off that list you probably shouldn't be doing them you should probably find a way to get out of those kinds of meetings or replace yourself in those kinds of meetings or hire someone perhaps to you know take those kinds of meetings for you because they're not as productive and then really circle the things that really really mattered you know there could be within a week if if it in a lifetime you can have an hour that's worth the cumulative some of the hours you can certainly have that in a week right you can have that in a month you can have that in a year so really training your mind toward you know what those things are um and circling them and having that pattern recognition can make a lot of sense um i like that so that's kind of i used to have a job that was kind of like a shitty job it paid really well but i just didn't like it and i remember talking to my friend there and i go he's like why don't you like it like it's all good like it's an easy job we're making great money we're you know they really respect us they like us what's the problem and i was like the problem is i feel like if i didn't come here today nothing would change and if i you know and then you boil that down it's like if i don't do anything this hour definitely nothing's gonna change and we called it uh it's kind of like you said you look at all those blocks and you sort of figure out which blocks matter and we literally said the same thing and we called it the jenga law which was you know in a tower of jenga blocks if you remove some blocks the tower's totally fine and then other blocks are like the key linchpins and there's some some point where you remove too many and the whole tower tips over and it falls and so you you don't want to remove those anchors but there are plenty of sort of useless blocks that are in there and if you take them out you make space then something interesting can happen and so we started doing that i started i first started with an hour i said okay every day from 1 pm to 2 p.m i'd do nothing it wasn't to be lazy it was to test what happens and then of course nothing happened nobody noticed your office space moment yeah exactly and i took half a day off i'm just going to do nothing for the second half to stay see what happens nothing happened then i just stopped coming to work for like two weeks right and finally by like the fourth week it was like they you know they were like hey what the heck where are you uh we noticed that these things were behind and what job was this it was a job i had in australia my after my first company kind of got like aqua hired i was working for this thing and yeah it was it was a fun it was again a nice place but it really taught me that like one thing that matters to me is that my hours matter like i want my hours to matter that doesn't mean i want to work super hard but when i do do something i want it to matter and i started doing what you're doing which is like recognizing that it's not linear every hour is not equal um we kind of get trained this way right you're going to work monday through friday nine to five if there's this assumption that monday equals thursday that you know the first hour of the eight hour day is the same as the fourth hour but they're definitely not in productivity or importance yeah yeah absolutely i think that that's absolutely right i want to ask you about very specific ideas so in the pomp podcast basically you said something i entirely agree with which is distribute or i don't know if you said it or if it was discussed distribution over ideas so you look at um you want to know um how do i get early customers and can this actually scale some of the ways that you do that is you look at the payback period so you try to see you try to get that as low as possible so if i acquire a customer how much how long does it take to get my money back you said the best in class is three months you also said that the ltv to cac best in class is five uh meaning uh you acquire a customer for a dollar they're worth five dollars to you um and you also said that you have a very at this point very strict standards for launching companies so you said you have 600 ideas you can launch up to 10 now and that's many years into this so what i want to talk about is what ideas didn't cross this threshold but in your head you think it could have or if the right person does this it definitely maybe could work or maybe it couldn't meet some of those benchmarks but it's still pretty cool and pretty good what uh can you tell me some ideas that keep you up at night honorable mentions honorable mention good question um that was a good question by the way let me let me think through that i mean there there have been plenty plenty plenty over the years to think through i'm just trying to think through some worth calling take out your evernote and just scroll i know i know click share and then add say i'm at sampar.com yeah totally okay well i'll give you some examples so one example is um all right so talk about problem solution so we got this we got this new office in in letterman and the presidio for those of you who don't know in san francisco it's kind of like a national park there's like a lot of trees around and we got this new office and i was just a mess in this office i was sneezing i was feeling awful like every day and i just had these horrible allergies and i couldn't get rid of these allergies and i like it took me three or four months to get an appointment at an allergist was it like mold or something well i had no idea i was like what could this be like obviously there's something new about this environment so i went to this allergist i got tested and of all the possible things i could be allergic to it was the one tree that was growing outside the window of my new office that i could not move that was like protected by the city anyway so i i had to deal with it in the process you know what are your options in terms of getting treated for allergies well you can get allergy shots which are painful you have to go every week they have to be scheduled they're expensive like they take a lot of we're talking about time power law i don't want to be driving around the city getting these allergy shots every week or you can do something called sublingual immunotherapy so basically like there's two ways to get these allergens and increasing quantities into your immune system so that you you get used to them one is through an injection another is by putting them under your tongue both ways they get into your bloodstream i i said well i want to do the thing under your tongue you can do it at home it's a drop a day in the morning that seems a lot easier so i did that and i got it and it completely cured me of my allergies and i was like this is amazing why doesn't everybody have this look at all these kids they're going they're getting these allergy shots you go and you look and structurally it's really messed up because the allergists get paid for giving these allergy shots that's why there's so many allergy shots you go to the allergist they bill your insurance so every visit you do they get paid versus every sublingual drop you do at home they're not getting paid so that's actually you know normally the perfect setup right for like creating a company it's like okay let's disrupt there's this misaligned incentive let's go go ahead and disrupt this a lot of people suffering huge pain point people really really hate their allergies so we went you know we found a compounded pharmacy we found like supply chain this is actually pretty difficult to like source and get right and treat all these allergies and figure out how to do vita telemedicine and we went and we we tested it and just the economics just don't work and it's just i think they should work i think it's dramatically better than getting shots at the allergist i feel like i don't understand why this isn't the way everyone gets cured of their allergies we attempted to make the world better by giving everyone this way of getting cured of their allergies but we just weren't able to figure it out and then we tried selling it through doctors and you know the allergists of course don't want their revenue stream to be disrupted of getting the allergy shots so that's not going to work so eventually we said you know what we got a lot of other problems to solve and opportunity cost is really high what what about it didn't it work the the methods were too expensive just the unit economics yeah we couldn't we couldn't get the unit economics to work do you remember how much like what some of the numbers were well let's see we were trying really we tried a bunch of different price points in terms of like the monthly price for these sublingual drops ranging from like 79 a month all the way up to like 250 a month because these are our tests you know we're testing the pricing that obviously gets you a gross margin depending on that price and then you know there's a cac to acquire the customer and the problem in this case was just the cac was really really high i don't know if it's you know a new thing customers don't know about it they need to be educated maybe they're skeptical hard to sell over the internet i'm not sure but you know we're really good at producing locax we're really good at scaling things we just couldn't figure out how to get the caclo on this we did a lot of different iterations and you know the other way that can work is if the churn is really low and you just get payments for a long time this should be it takes about a year to three years to fully cure um but it just didn't work out the math didn't work out and you know that's the kind of thing the world should be that way it should be that way and like you can be an entrepreneur and believe that and i still believe that but you'll be knocking your head against a brick wall forever and get nowhere and there are other problems like that that you can solve that can become huge and it's just better in our view to work on this so that's why i've adopted this philosophy which is exactly what you said which is distribution's more important than ideas and we only want to work on ideas that can achieve mass distribution because our view is life is short and you know but for us and our co-founders we want to you know prize our time and we only want to work on things that can reach a lot of customers whether they're consumers or businesses we want it to matter so we we try to validate that as much as possible up front what are some other ones that you've done that maybe could have worked but just missed the mark you have a different like different bullet here that you can do if it's hard to think of that which is patterns for great company ideas and it says three ideas to talk about so i'm curious about those yeah i'll i'm gonna throw out another one that was like a crazier idea that we we looked into that i'm just gonna put out there as a crazy idea maybe someone on this podcast will do it i still think it's a good idea um but there are some problems with it so i'll disclose it so you know there's all this technology computer vision etc that's been developed for autonomous vehicles so cars self-driving cars so cars they drive around there's a lot of issues right like you've got stop signs you've got stop lights you've got got to be able to identify colors there's people coming there's bikes there's all this stuff in the environment that you you know there's it's 2d but it's also 3d you go up you go down there's weather there's all of this stuff so we were trying to think what are some interesting you know ways that this technology could potentially be applied and you know a crazy idea that i had that i had us look into was what if you created autonomous fishing vessels that went out into the ocean and just fished 24 7. even through inclement weather and they had like crazy sonar and like computer vision underwater and they could find the fish and they just you know automatically did all of that and you know we looked into it and you know it's it's still such interesting technology i hope someone does build it but that there's some structural issues with it around fishing quotas and the industry industry capture of that industry that we could get into at another time um that kind of make it a little bit difficult but that's another idea um but anyway yeah i'm happy to we can discuss that more i'm happy to progress into the patterns behind yeah go to the patterns i'd be curious to what those are okay cool sounds good um yeah so some patterns that i think are kind of tried and true that are really interesting to to think about one pattern is if you take things that rich people have access to or rich companies have access to and you figure out how to democratize them so you make them more accessible distributable cheaper and accessible to everyone that is a winning formula for creating a really good company and part of the reason for that from a philosophical perspective this is actually something i learned from mark andreessen he has this belief that human desire is infinite which is an interesting concept and if you believe that then people with a lot of resources and companies with a lot of resources are willing to spend on the outer limit of human desire so they're poking around they're figuring out all of these things of what's the next thing on the human desire bubble that could be discovered and they might discover something and if something there really takes hold that you can then take and give to everyone everyone might want that and it might be ready for everyone like one like uber uber was a classic example of this right people had private drivers now everybody can push a button have a private driver driver pick him up yeah private driver um with uber private chef with doordash private shopper with instacart those are all you know really good examples you could even argue you know second home airbnb it's kind of like having access to a second home much in a much cheaper way and so what's uh what's an idea in that space so what are some other things that you've seen that either very wealthy people or very wealthy companies have that the rest of us don't what are some other what are some other examples in there that you know haven't looked into it but might be might be interesting well i think that there seems to be some kind of a renaissance happening in fintech partially because the wealthy seem to have access to financial planning financial resources around planning access to the markets you know there's this whole 99 percent versus the one percent and people have kind of figured that out and i think that's why you're seeing this boom of new companies if you can give the 99 what the one percent has access to and the ability to generate wealth i think that that's actually really interesting i think there are a lot of interesting startup ideas that are being formed there we're starting one or two um that we think can help empower people in that area for example um so that would be you know one example of of an area that are you gonna do anything in the wealth advisor space um we are kind of tangentially doing things there i think that there's probably a lot more to do there um you know wealth advisory is a compounded issue where even the wealthy when they have access to wealth advisory it's not great it's not great have you heard of have you heard of adpar sean no so i i bet you have jack right out of par yeah at a par sorry and so at a par was started by joe lonsdale i think right um i only know like you know the wikipedia version but basically it's a it's kind of like mint.com but for really wealthy people i actually but like billionaire wealthy people i actually don't know what features necessarily it has that uh something a little bit what jack what's it have that's more robust you know it basically has tracking of like everything every fund everywhere in the world every wealth manager all of your assets but they tend to work more with wealth managers instead of individuals but joe in that company has an in like a big vision for where that can go um and you might be able to work with it as an individual now but that's kind of along the lines so i could disrupt that so i work with some of these folks and they send me like the jankiest stuff ever and their login so like morgan stanley the login to like look at your investments it's horrible and i was like you guys this is just absolutely awful like i'm just using spreadsheets on my own this is really bad you know i've heard of this adapar thing and they're like well you know you can't use that unless you're worth 500 million dollars or like a billion dollars it's really really expensive like it's crazy high and i'm like are you kidding me just like give me a min dot com login or something and you guys like become the admin and just like let's share this you can just tell me because this is dog [ __ ] and so i think that um i think there's a lot of interesting stuff in that space but to go back to your point about distribution i think selling to those people are can be quite challenging because they're very old school and they're very conservative but uh that i was bringing this up to ask you if that's a space that has been interesting to you lately because you i know you're being a little cryptic because you like to be stealth until you you go live but so i was trying to i'm trying to get something out of you yeah i think it's a really interesting space i would encourage people to look into it i think that there is a lot that can be done there i think there's dissatisfaction amongst everyone basically in that space it's pretty universal a lot of room for improvement cool so that's that's one uh pattern for great ideas so what are the what are the wealthy companies that people have that can be democratized and uh and other if a few people have that desire and they've pushed out to that limit other people would want it if you can make it accessible cheaper and more available to them that's that's an amazing one i think there's tons of great ideas there uh what's another what's other framework or or sort of pattern you've seen for great ideas yeah so one that i think is is pretty interesting that's also i would put in like the tried and true bucket is if you take something that people consistently do and they have to do and they feel like they have to do it but it takes a lot of steps and or time and you dramatically simplify it and you make it a lot faster to accomplish the same thing that they feel like they have to do so some good examples of this would be for example booking online travel you know it used to be so hard to do you'd have to go to so many different sites the kayak founders had the vision of let's just pull it all into kayak.com you go to one site you see it all in one place they made it really easy and the case we've said this once which was anytime there's somebody has 14 tabs open to do this to do one task that's a business opportunity is that right that's a business opportunity yeah i mean you just watch for that if you ever see that people are doing a lot of research there yeah tons of tabs open it's really arduous that that's an opportunity another example of that that we we kind of found with hims and hers and other telemedicine companies that we we've started is going to the doctor's office you know people need to go to the doctor's office think of that process you're calling the doctor's office you're scheduling an appointment you're whipping out your calendar you're putting it on your calendar you're going to the waiting room you're sitting there you're getting prescribed something you're going to walgreens you're waiting in line for half an hour going around the store going home you know this is a big process and as a result the next generation kind of doesn't even really engage with the health care system you know close to nine out of 10 of them don't even know who their doctor is and or they haven't even gone so you know telemedicine takes that process and makes it a five-minute process where you can do it on your phone and go through and get treated for whatever condition that you have um i think another interesting example of that is selling your house people need to sell their house right and it's a really hard long arduous process fraught with a lot of anxiety and things like that open door came along and said hey come to this website tell us what your house is and we'll make you an offer to buy it and you can sell it right now and you know not everyone has to do that and not everyone does do that but enough people do it that it created a really really big company that's doing really well so those are some some interesting and you guys are doing that now with open store right uh which i gotta say is it is a truly great idea i remember when i first started it i texted my friend and i said uh i i didn't even say how great this idea is i just only said why are we not doing this uh because i was like this is that good of an idea selling your company selling your e-commerce store in this case um takes so much effort so much work and the data is all there right like i'm assuming i don't actually know how it works i'm assuming it's sort of like clear bank or whatever where you can plug into their shopify you can plug into their facebook ad account you can plug into their bank or whatever and and with those you know three sources of data you can get a basically like a health score and a value of this of this of this shop and make them an offer and they don't have to go most of them don't even know like at least with a house it's painful but you kind of know what you're supposed to do to do it yeah at nine out of ten friends i talked to who have an e-commerce store don't even know what you would do if you wanted to sell i don't even know what whose door do i knock on what do i need to have ready and so therefore i just i'm just not gonna do it and um and it's like the open door thing where not everybody's gonna do this but sure if open door captures i don't know what they modeled out but you know one percent three percent five percent of all house sales like multi-billion dollar company same thing for for open source so i'm super super bullish to the point where i was like what am i doing with my life that i'm not doing this idea this makes total sense oh man well thanks for saying that don't worry i'm not going to copy you but keith and i are having a ton of fun ton of fun building out that company um here in miami that's been a blast building a a great team a huge team and yeah it solves this pain point in a market where it's really hard to sell your company and all you need to do is come to a website we give you a price and you can sell your company and it's it's really interesting we have an amazing data science team we're hiring really aggressively if anyone wants to join it's you know anyone who joins that team it's such an unbelievable team i think it's going to create this almost miami mafia so to speak around here of amazing people i think it's an exceptional opportunity and scaling really quickly so that's been a lot of fun thanks for saying that in another pod you said something like you have this list of ideas but every once in a while you'll meet someone who's so amazing that you say to them well what's your idea and how can we just tell me what your idea is and we'll partner with you or you know you said something like that i don't know if it was exactly that what attributes would a person have to have in order for you to say that to them yeah so we're we're open you know the ideas don't necessarily have to come from us we're totally open if people want to bring their ideas and co-found companies with us um we just kind of ask that they be baked off in a process and that the data wins we're just such big believers in this distribution over ideas thing that as long as we if we test our idea and the distribution's great fantastic let's go let's do it together that sounds great but otherwise you know we just ask that we do that kind of testing process that we like to do but some of the attributes that we look for you know we really like people that are just tenacious they just wake up in the morning they want to play offense they have three things they want to get done by the end of the day and they get them done and they knock down walls and they're creative they have a lot of raw intelligence they inspire other people they can hire they're charismatic um you know it depends on the idea right like some ideas that are more technically oriented obviously you're looking for a slightly different profile versus ideas that are maybe more you know sales or product oriented so we are a little bit founder idea or product fit as well we do consider that but um yeah those are some of the attributes that we look for in people but sometimes you meet someone and there's just a really strong connection you know you have these high bandwidth conversations you're feeling great about everything and we'll just say you know we just want to work with you um we're totally agnostic to the idea and come in and join us let's look at 10 12 15 ideas over the next three to nine months if we find something we love great let's start a company if we don't find anything no harm no foul hopefully you know you've met some cool people and we've had fun along the way and you know you're on to your next thing and we'd love to be as supportive as we can one of the biggest differences between sean and i although we're very similar in a lot of ways he tends to do many different things and he he likes doing many things at one time i am always teasing him and and jokingly criticizing him i'm like only do one thing if you only do one thing you're gonna be you're gonna succeed more and he's like well no but i i like this and it's working and he's right it is working for him you have both started one company or you know milo was like your baby or i imagine when you're running that that was like your only focus now your focus is on launching 10 companies a year although you know you hire people to help you make it happen so i guess your baby's kind of atomic but do you think that starting multiple companies is going to be a bigger wealth creator for you than if had you just done kind of one major thing and you only focus on one let's say a software company or something like that um it's an interesting question so before i answer that just one comment on that i have noticed a pattern which is that the smartest people i've met in the world fall into one of those two camps they either want to be like singularly focused on one thing almost to a fault where they are so focused on it and they just absolutely have to crush it and that's one archetype of success and it works really well and some people are super successful that are that way there are other people and i put myself more in the camp of like i just get energy from working on a lot of things with a lot of different people it's how my brain works i have to work across a lot of different things and that's also you know part of it is what you enjoy and what makes you happy and that's kind of what i enjoy and what makes me happy it's inventing it's the early stages it's what could come next so when i thought about doing atomic it actually wasn't believe it or not a wealth building exercise it was really you know one is it possible to build a company that builds companies nobody's really figured out how to do that at scale before two how could you do that three is that the most interesting and impactful problem in the world to work on i believe that it was um at that time and you know would it be fun and would i get to work with really great people on really great problems and i thought the answer to those questions was yes so i decided to do it um it can be very lucrative i do think probably you can do better by just focusing on one like if you had one thing that was gonna go to the moon that you can probably do financially better just going all in on that thing at least in the short term um i don't know in the long term because in the long term if you build a company that builds companies what's the value of that i don't know it's like it's like asking a genie for unlimited wishes right so but that's not really you know what drove the decision making or kind of how i think about it well you said it's not been done before i mean um maybe i don't know where they were at the time you know rocket internet for those listeners there's a company called rocket internet based in germany started by these three crazy crazy brothers and their whole stick was basically copy silicon valley companies but do it in africa asia and other places where that thing didn't so airbnb in europe or amazon and thailand or whatever to zappos and uh nigeria um and they created a few companies that were [ __ ] huge and they did it so but they the whole thing was copying to the point of they would have this chief scientist who would basically study let's say they're copying pinterest he would send out an email to the pinterest of africa and the pinterest of germany and be like pinterest changed their button size on the top right from this to this do it have you ever thought what do you think about those guys and have you ever thought of doing that strategy where instead of invention let's copy yeah so it's just not our style it's a very different style first of all i think the kind of talent you can work with that you can motivate to just copy other people's ideas i think is very different than the kinds of people we're able to attract at atomic and work on our companies you know it's more of a mercenary probably than a mission-driven approach we pride ourselves in everything that we've done has been innovative it's been original we haven't been copying other people's ideas it's not in our ethos to do that so and the processes and how it operates is very different and the culture is very different fundamentally as a result so i do think you need to pick one of those two things would it be easier to build something that just copies other people's ideas yeah it would be easier but it probably wouldn't work as well because i don't think just copying other people's ideas is as valuable and i don't think that it would work as well anyway but it's also just far less interesting to me it seems like the ideas that worked well for them were the ones where there was like a local network effect in the us that hadn't gone to europe yet and they did it in europe before the u.s company could go to europe um but there were a lot of companies that they copied that they had a hard time because they kind of installed someone who yeah there's higher guns they would just hire bankers and say just spend more money than this other company exactly and uh you know missionaries often outlast mercenaries and you have to longevity is one of the key factors you need to to to win let's talk about worked to some extent but it's just different let's do a couple minutes real quick on crypto so great on a scale of one to chugging the kool-aid where are you at with crypto just kind of personally investing in it and then what do you think is exciting or or completely overrated i don't know what your take is sort of it's pretty polarizing so people are usually very into it or you know think it's toxic and and ponzi scheme so like where where do you stand yeah good question i mean i think crypto is real and it's here to stay um i think the question is what are the fundamental like real innovations in crypto the things that are going to be around and what are the things that are there's a lot of manipulation there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes people don't know about on these chat groups and apps and like forums of like pump and dump things yeah really bad you know this is stuff that people like in a normal market would probably go to jail for like seriously this is happening somewhat regularly in this market so it's a little concerning to like the average person to know what is and what isn't real and that's my big concern with it is you know there's a lot of people rushing into it there's a lot of enthusiasm it is real but knowing what is real and what isn't real i think is is really difficult um so what's real to you what do you think is real so to me you know i think one indicator to look for is where are developers signing up this is also true with companies by the way whenever there's platforms that are built and this is true for like enterprise companies or like app stores where do the developers go where the developers go usually works and is a good place to invest and i think that's true of crypto as well so on that thesis i think ethereum is a great place to go solana seems to have a lot of developer interest i think there's a lot of other places um you know one that i was kind of early involved in and helped get off the ground was one called tara and luna that just launched a new main net that had like 50 to 100 apps just launched that are super interesting they're very interesting to me because they're solving a different problem than a lot of other people in crypto are solving fundamentally what does that mean sorry go ahead go ahead um so a lot of you know if you were to kind of knock crypto if you were like a macro economist and you were like wow what does the world look like 10 or 20 years from now if this really catches on the big critique would be well if this is digital gold imagine what would have happened to the world if everyone just held gold and nobody put money into a bank there'd be no jobs there'd be no economy because people put money into the bank the bank lends out money to companies into people that money gets spent it creates jobs those people spend the money and it goes through the economy and it just has this domino effect that's really important for the whole like system to work in crypto someone puts it in crypto and it stops and it doesn't keep traveling through the economy it's not a productive asset so you basically take a productive asset and you make it unproductive and i feel like for like decentralized crypto to work and scale in the world that's got to be fixed somehow and the tara and luna people are very very attuned to this problem so instead of just focusing on purely technical things like you know nfts or you know new apps they can build or apis or smart contracts or things like that they're actually thinking about you know how can you lend crypto how can you borrow against crypto how can you invest in stocks you can invest in stocks directly with their stable coins you can earn 20 interest with anchor you can borrow against that and then there's a way to earn 30 interest and there's this whole ecosystem of basically ways to make crypto productive in a decentralized way within the crypto ecosystem that i think is really interesting and i don't know they're really really good really smart team i don't know of too many other people that are working on that and then the other one that i would call out that i was an early investor in is a project that hasn't launched yet but if there's anyone out there who knows how to mine i would say mine this cryptocurrency it's called iron fish and it's basically this genius i can vouch for her she's a genius and she basically created what i what i think is the first true cash on the internet so the whole idea of crypto was it's going to be cash on the internet it's untraceable i give this to you nobody knows just like with cash in reality what happens with bitcoin we make a transaction and it's public forever literally this this record is going to be public and replicated across the internet forever and everybody's going to know about it now people realize that um and it's an issue so you had you know coins like zcash and monero that were created but it turns out those actually can be decrypted and you can figure out where all of that went so she's the first person that really figured out how to make truly anonymized crypto and it's called iron fish i think it's a really exciting project i don't think it's tradable on exchanges but i think it's mineable and it'll probably be tradable at some point those are some early ones that i think are exciting worth um worth kind of looking into love it and uh and do you use like defy are you like an actual participant or user of defy um i don't use d5 too much per se i'm more i do actually a little bit but i'm more of kind of like a set and forget it buy and hold long term and patient type of a person um so i'm not actively doing i you know i know there's a lot of stuff out there going on like yield farming and things like that that i'm not as attuned to um but if i had more time i'd be interested in learning more about it yeah that's what i wanted to leave it with which was if you weren't doing all the [ __ ] you're doing now and i took away kind of the reputation of the network so like you know you're you're still you you're still you know sharp but you're 21 22 23 years old where do you think you would go work what would you work on hmm that's an interesting question i might consider working on you know web 3 and crypto specifically figuring out how to use crypto to build new networks that can be built that are totally decentralized um like social networks or other types of networks uh they could be marketplaces they could be social networks but i think what the internet taught us is networks are what's valuable at the core and i don't think web 3 is i think it's still early there's like 10 million sort of users out there of this stuff there's you know four and a half billion people on the internet so it still has a long ways to grow if you can build some of these early networks with network effects you can probably build things that are really valuable and i know there are some people that are working on it but there are probably still some really interesting opportunities out there well this is this is this is awesome man i i mean i could talk to you for another few hours i've got so many more questions hopefully you can come back and do this again um of course we'd love to thanks for having me this this is badass um i'm i pay attention to everything you guys do on an atomic i'm always looking at your job page to see like what are they who are they hiring for now what are they going to launch now and i'm trying to figure out if i could kind of like reverse engineer and see everything and so you have a good taste dude you uh you you invested in or co-incubated a company with my cousin i don't know if you know that uh rohan which one rohan puri he uh yeah he's super smart yeah he's great well thank you for doing this this is badass um of course thanks for having me we're excited to publish this we're excited to make this happen it was awesome talking to you if people want to get more where do they follow you find you you know subscribe to your newsletter uh buy your only fans what do you want them to do not on only fans uh yeah you can follow yet uh you can follow me on twitter i'm just jack jack abraham or you know you can find me on linkedin and or you know we're just at atomic.vc is our website you can actually apply on our website for a program we have called the future founders program where we'd love to co-found companies with people we love co-founding companies with diverse people of all sorts of backgrounds we're agnostic to location can be from anywhere and we want to start a lot of great companies and it'd be an honor to start you know maybe we can start a company with someone listening to this that would be great well this is awesome thank you very much um we'll uh we'll be sharing a bunch of links i'm so excited you came on here [Music] you

i'm i am human optimization and optimized to to be what though to just be happy i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to sorry we're late we uh we're we were recording another episode and yeah look i got the context i thought it was fascinating i love the idea of like your digital media company being acquired and then you have to do a a podcast with the guy who acquired it who no longer works there or no longer ceo it's fascinating well he told a story that was i think good because i think most people don't want to hear necessarily from oh you're the ceo of some marketing companies a public company it's not the sexiest story but he he just got in a crazy snowmobile accident and broke like every bone in his body and was sort of like lying there on a mountain for an hour thinking i might die or you know maybe hopefully his cell phone had like one bar and he was able to call the police and get get a firefighter to come save him um so he told that story and i was like okay this is good this is good content then everything i'm happy with how this turned out wow that's that is fascinating yeah it was good he was like it was like a movie we were like you know brian this is like a movie you know like billionaire tech guy almost dies quits and starts meditating and yeah he became like a philanthropist afterwards he reevaluated his life while he was lying there that sort of thing um all right sam you want to do a quick intro no you do it you do it i like i've enjoyed you uh doing it lately okay i'll give the um i'll give the like the brief context of this okay so rob um i don't know if you know this but your your show on mtv there's a there's a kind of a meme about it on reddit do you ever go to reddit i do not okay so do you know of reddit it's like a popular kind of website or whatever of course so me and sam both watch the the show the challenge on mtv and um and the challenge has been around for like 15 years it's kind of like our you know i'm not even a guilty pleasure frankly i'm not guilty about it i i feel great about it it's a great choice this is great this is great and so museum both watched the challenge and we're probably the only kind of like tech investor dude bro it's my wife my wife watches it yeah sam hides behind his wife i love it i i'm i'm i'm not afraid to say it i came out the clouds i said i love the challenge so on on reddit there's this big separator about the challenge and the running joke is that mtv plays 23 hours of uh of ridiculous uh ridiculousness and then one hour of the challenge on wednesdays and so because your show is your show is always on tv i don't know if you know this but it's kind of like constantly on mtv and so there's a running joke that that's that's all the channel is basically is ridiculousness um i don't know if you know about that or if you have any thoughts but i wanted to start there well i mean yeah i mean it's 60 of the total programming yeah is it really yeah and it's it's fascinating because it's like you know as i have evolved the program and my relationship with the network and ultimately sort of the business that i have with the network it evolved into creating more content and airing more shows and so they began to air more shows and the ratings went up higher and higher so then now people are watching it in blocks of you know two and three hours at a time so it you know in linear cable as a whole kind of faded to appointment television and you had hero content that pushed up to the forward on almost all the networks and i just happened to be lucky you know what i mean of like finding that sort of resurgence but i was also because i control and own the the the production i have negotiated on the unit economics of the show and what the network needed as the uh cable advertising world was evolving so i i was able to control it at a higher level than traditional talent which took me from getting 30 episode orders to 168 episode orders which then eventually became 500 episode orders right it's a hey for example athletes like floyd mayweather right starts off as a boxer but then the promotion the production company basically takes all the economics and he's out here the talent the one that's drawn in all the viewers but didn't own that piece and then over time now he owns it all because he he kind of like got screwed for a few years or you know sort of wisened up and said oh i need to own more of this stack in order for me to like benefit in the way that for the value i'm bringing were you did you get it from day one or did it take some time for you to figure that part out look i think you guys know the complexity of making a successful business right so at the at the end of the day there's arbitrage for talent and different aspects of business and it relates to entertainment but the ability to actually monetize it create value and then in my case sell it for a significant amount of money is extraordinarily difficult unless you really understand business at a really high level so it's it's way beyond i've you know i started my first company at 18 years old i went through basically years and years of of making millions and losing millions through ventures where i ultimately created a system uh to to grow into being a great entrepreneur and then i capitalized on uh this unfair advantage that i had in the entertainment space to be able to look at the opportunity and maximize it both from a talent perspective and create a business that i was able to have acquired um through that platform you know what i mean it's i think it's more rare than it is common for an athlete to have that mindset yeah and let me give a background here and this is what i'm about to say is with no research it's just as a fan so i don't you don't know this but i i still skate so i've been a fan of yours forever and so here we i i have here look here here it is can you see that there's my tray flip talking about a full tray flip right here fully caught yeah yeah totally crazy look at that i can still i still have it in me a little bit oh my camera will come back in a second but so you um you you started skating very young and i think you were sponsored by alien workshop when you were like 13 14 15 something like that right well to give you more context like i got sponsored it at 11 years old but i i connected with the group and and when they founded the alien workshop and i turned pro for it when i was 16. and you uh but now i think you you own alien workshop right or your part owner no i acquired it for four million dollars and then i gave it back to the original foundation that was free and clear on top of buying a bunker in ohio so they could run the company out of it and gave that to them free and clear that was the worst mistake i've ever done in my life was um look i you know i i did it more they were acquired by burton and i i every advisor around me was like this company does not make money it has terrible margins like it burns cash like this is a terrible investment i didn't care i didn't understand business well enough i just wanted it for the story the hometown kid buys back you know the alien workshop that he sat in the room and helped choose the name and create the brand when he was 16 years old and finds great success and comes back and acquires the business and when i i acquired it i felt like i acquired a hornet's nest and i i learned so much about the operational side of business and culture and and the dynamics of um what i'd consider a a a toxic culture and i just realized that that my passion was to create build and and create an roi and irr for the stuff that i created and that's that doesn't align with skateboarding very much right like they're really like misery loves company let's all be broke let's all barely survive let's all like keep your artists everything starving artist syndrome and i i literally like was on another call and was like man i don't even want to be on it i don't want to put another bit of my energy in here and i'm like you want to know what the real hero story will be i'm going to give back the original founders who built the company and sold it i'm going to just give the entire thing back to them and that's what i did so we have to talk about that in a second that's crazy to me uh not a bad way but it's crazy and so you're you're a skater you know i used to watch you in a lot of trans world videos as a kid and a bunch of other stuff and then you were early-ish at i think very early at dc shoes before dc shoes was even named dc right um that ended up becoming a pretty monster success um and so you've seen a bunch of stuff then you started some of the early shows which crushed it and then now you're telling you're sitting here talking about ridiculousness and the way that you're describing things i'm like it's just the evolution is crazy right from skateboarder to like talking about how you own 60 of the programming on mtv and so i wanted to give like context there because it's it's amazing and it's inspirational but at this point you've got your hands and everything it seems like you've got you do you dabble you do a bunch of stuff if i remember correctly years ago you had like a food truck is that right um i might have wrote an episode around a food truck but it was probably fake a fantasy factory you had like a bunch of different you know you had a bunch of different stuff you got your hands on everything i think you even did i read that you were you do uh horse racing you own racehorses i did i did when i got into horse racing i jockeyed a horse for a race at hollywood park and won the race um went on to own 12 or 13 racehorses including a horse that i uh that got third place in the breeders cup that i sold for two million dollars that i paid 200 grand for that's crazy to me so is owning a horse a good good investment in general like that's a great obviously that's a great flip but it's it's not but i for me i got out unscathed you know what i mean like for a lot of people i know that are in it it's just really for the enjoyment of it it's a lot of fun to go watch your horse race um you know i had a lot of respect in the racing community because they know i jockey the horse they know how insane that is right did you do that as a skit or did you take it seriously i know i mean i did it as a skit i mean it's like the don't it's the scariest thing i've ever done you're talking to a guy who's broke the world record for jumping a car backwards i've barrel rolled a car i've been attacked by a shark a tiger it's like i've done you know broken 25 world records on a skateboard but the scariest thing i'd ever done in my life is jockey a horse at hollywood park because it's just you on the back of this horse you got a hold of its mane you break the gate you're going 50 miles an hour on the back of this giant beast how do you how is your current your your entities set up right now as well as your focus because if you have well i was gonna the reason i'm listing all these crazy stuff the crazy things that you do and all these projects that you've got going on which are very substantial how are you balancing all of this and what's your current business structure i mean do you have like a rob deirdick media which only does the mtv stuff and you get uh some type of fee from them and then you have you know i've been i i would've let me hey if you want to talk structure let's talk some structure yeah basically operate as a very pro like a hybrid entertainment family office right slash venture creation studio right so i have a single entity the direct machine llc that owns everything including rob dyrdek inc which is the the entertainment side of rob deardex business so all of that capital flows into this single llc and then i distribute that capital into uh real estate holdings right the cash flowing real estate holdings or i distribute it into ventures that i co-find and create right so i co-find and create almost every single company that i build and i i do i co-find it with common shares and then i do the initial funding uh usually in the 800 to a million and a half a million dollar uh sort of pre-money and then i put 250 to 500 into every venture i try to own between 25 and 70 of every single venture that i have at maturity um i have built 17 companies sold six for and netted 450 million since i launched the company in 2016. one of those is the production company but all of these entities sit under the umbrella of the venture side of the direct machine business including rob dyrdek the television business so my production company that was acquired my earn out goes into the llc um that i own 100 of right and then uh my talent money lives in that same same thing then i pay myself a salary that goes through that and then i invest all of that in in basically non-correlated cash flowing uh real estate investments whether that's manufactured housing multi-family units storage units like i've been investing a lot of rv parks lately dude this is music to my ears yeah it's just very sophisticated it's a very sophisticated you know hybrid family office that i built for myself right now and keep in mind every venture that i create has a has a time structure we call it the unified theory we at the very beginning we lay out the entire capital path and growth path and and when we want to sell it how much we want to sell it for and that's our target everything is built to sell from the very beginning whether that's pig out chips and outstanding foods or mind right bars or lusso comfort wear or any of the build builds that i've done over the last five years but all of it is connected to this idea of uh the capital that you've earned the tax efficiencies on how you earn it and then ultimately the irr on every dollar wherever it goes inside the system and what do you do then you keep your expenses within the range of your dividends that come from your real estate so you basically play the entire game for free and then as you scale and have big exits and big big uh liquidity events you just pump more money into the overall system and you basically live this extraordinary free life now to that point i do all of this with 30 of my time right because i i manage i've mastered time energy and capacity right so i live this extraordinarily balanced life by design where i only dedicate 30 percent of my time to podcasts in my shooting television and uh building my businesses i spend 30 percent sleeping 10 percent on my health never compromised it than 30 with my family you know how much is 30 for you like how many hours are you looking at 30 of a 40 hour work week or thirty percent of your weight he's saying my entire life all hours eight hours right no all life of the 24 hours in a day i sleep 30 so seven hours right like i work seven hours i'm with my family seven hours and uh i spend uh three hours on my health on average right when you look at the the overall balance and then i could show you this because i track it every day and it pumps all of it into this beautiful dashboard because what i've done over time because to give you an idea i shot 250 episodes of television this year it's exactly four percent of my total time that's how highly optimized it's become right because you basically have a certain level of human capacity and in order to scale it you either hire or automate it so i live this deeply automated life uh that that hires people in to add capacity and at the end of the day i just live super balanced and happy that's it so give us one example wait what software are you using to track all that time yeah that dashboard i created i i had a i had a programmer write me a script that goes inside google the google calendar it's an app on your phone or it's just on like a spreadsheet basically it's inside google calendar and then it pops it populates a google spreadsheet right and then the beauty of it is is i qualitative data and quantitative data is what i live my life off of right so every day for the last five years i asked i wrote down how i feel about my life work and health 0-10 and so i could show you by the qualitative numbers how i'm living a higher quality and happier life and and the result of that is based off the optimization that i've done on my quantitative stuff my quantitative stuff is did i get up before five did i brain train did i get in the gym did i meditate did i have a clean diet did i not drink i could show you by my quantitative numbers that i have done all of those almost every single day of this entire year about 87 of those quantitative things that have just driven those qualitative numbers how i feel about my life my work and my health higher and higher so by the numbers i could tell you what a high quality life that i'm living compared to just five years ago you're saying somebody amazing things i gotta yeah i've been to each one all right so you just said something did i brain train what's that mean i use a luminosity app right like where it's just adding flexibility and just letting your mind do all of these things that are different than just getting in and reading your emails and you know just going through your rhythm is really what i i do that for and when you wake up at five what's the morning routine like sounds like you're pretty yeah look i i'll get up i i i get i have to get up before five but depending on what time i go to bed i'll get up um at four or four thirty two right and then to me uh you know always have that that coffee pre-made so i can get up and get cooking um and then i track all my numbers from the previous day fill in all my time if i missed any time to make sure that that all my data is there on your phone or on your computer on the computer right and then and then i try to just like organize and knock out sort of my more executional work before the kids get up and all that um then at six o'clock i brain train 6 30 i meditate uh when i jump out of meditation i sent we're actually at 5 15 i bring my wife a coffee and i send her an email of every single thing that i'm doing that day what it means to me with a love quote on top right um again this is what it means to me like each thing you're doing just like you know just like what you're doing you know yeah in my in my one of the one of the pulls of our relationship was like i do so much stuff that she would be it'd be i'd just be talking to someone to be the first time she ever heard of it and so she would just like i would do so much stuff in a day she just would would feel disconnected so i just started giving her an email every day of like what i'm doing what it means with a nice love quote right and and that then settled down the energy of feeling disconnected from everything that i'm doing um bring her a coffee at 5 15. god bless her she started doing 5 30 calls for her business um which means she's going to be tired earlier that means we can go to bed by 9 30 right which is another sort of blessing and this is happening in l.a right you're this is yours yeah yeah and then but you know i pop out of meditation at seven wake the kids up uh get them both down to breakfast at 7 30 my trainer doctor comes to the house uh 7 30 to 8 30 um training and then take the kids to school at 8 30 right and then the day depending on what the week is you know sometimes i go to breakfast dates with my wife sometimes it's you know on mondays you know i basically run a flat organization right so i have you know 10 core divisions that are ran by an executive and i just spend monday fully organizing from when i get up four o'clock into my chief of staff for an hour into my president ceo for an hour and then half hours for every single person that runs that uh division so that we can just be highly organized and then plan the rest of the week which of course is inside thursday night date nights and friday night sushi night with my wife and picking my kids up and all of you know i design balance and then i only work within the structure of balance and then depending on how i feel depending on how my wife feels then i'll even adjust that to lean into making sure that my family is feeling priority above business always you you you are like yeah you're you're like you know like people make fun of silicon valley people because they're like like here's my calendar i've got it adjusted like this this and this but uh i'm sitting here looking at you i think it looks like you're wearing a black blazer with a black sweater and you got these slick air pods in you are more silicon valley techie in tune with this than like the stereotypes of it and i i love it i think this is yeah i mean look i'm i am human optimization and optimized to to be what though to just be happy you know what i mean like at the end of the day that's why you're playing the game and you got to figure out yourself to understand what truly makes you happy because your goal is to not be happy in pockets your goal is to be happy every single hour of every single day of your life right and that's really what i've accomplished and i'll tell you something if you think about how you live right you you can live in two places that'll get you nowhere it's dwelling and being negative right or it's being hopeful and like wishing right either of get you nowhere but real where life is lived is you're either problem solving you're either creating the future or you're experiencing the present right and the truth is whatever you're experiencing the present is based off of the decisions you've made in the past and it's your choice to create whatever you your reality is that you're going to eventually experience or god forbid something hits you rather than dwelling on it or hoping it didn't happen if you problem solve and handle it you're not going to you can basically live a life with no negative thoughts if you learn to live in a state of either experiencing creating or problem solving in your entire life right but it's on you to understand what that is to be able to live in that state i'm flabbergasted sean rob is is just here's what i'm shocked me here's what i'm wondering we share a lot of philosophies by the way the things you're saying there's a lot of philosophies i i live by sam lives by as well but i'm wondering this in my life because i live by a similar philosophy i've encountered a bunch of people and what i've found maybe i'm wrong here with you but what i found is kind of two two groups there's a group of people who kind of were this way from day one they were sort of like optimizers from day one they really cared about they sort of recognized the importance of time early on they recognized the importance of their mood and how they're feeling early on and they say cool i'm going to design systems to make this work for me by default so i'm not swinging from highs to lows i'm not pissing away time i'm actually making imaging so some people get it early i don't know if that's nature or nurture but they they were this way from day one and then there's other people who sort of live life in the exact opposite way for a while and then it comes sort of screeching to a halt and they say i gotta make a change i gotta get some order and some organization i gotta like i gotta actually take control of this and not just have it be so loosey-goosey and i'm looking at you and i'm thinking is he skater early how does the skater guy become human optimization embodied the way you are were you always this way or was this i lived a certain way and then i had a realization in a moment where i decided to kind of shift my path so that i could design my life a little bit differently yeah i was not this way you're talking to a guy getting attacked by sharks who's starting company after company breaking world records jumping cars doing cartoons television shows doing doing all these things as you related to in the beginning like you you were pulling into i would say you were pulling energy from like who i used to be and what you know me as right so just as i said like yeah right so so the way that you were viewing was in fact really how i was kind of living where i was being i always refer to myself as going in so many directions that at once i was i was like pulled tight and so what happened you swing from side to side in order for there to be some sort of give and whatever you were ultimately doing and for me i was i had had built my league my professional skateboarding league and took it to market to raise capital and and these groups were like oh we want to we want a piece of everything that you do look at all that you do they offered me a 360 deal i thought this is it you know i've just you know done this whole thing by the seat of my pants and like finally like these people are gonna recognize me and turn me into the billionaire i'm meant to be and when they did the diligence on how i ran my finances how i ran my life all aspects of it they were like you're not even investible you're just like you spend all the money that you have like you're not creating any value like all this stuff and it was this this deep awakening of like you're not who you think you are like you you've attached yourself this this identity that you've created for yourself is actually false and the success that you've had by being so driven and so ambitious like as you know despite all these other things you're doing that are failing you're making up for it by other things working like it you aren't actually what you think you are and i went on this journey to begin the discovery of like how can i begin to put a system around myself to become first it was like how do i learn business i don't know business and i hired a consultant to teach me how to build a company beginning to end and and in that process i found this book called start at the end that was a business book about decide what you want out of a business before you ever started and then it was like this sort of like like you know insane sort of moment that where i was like man like i need to start treating my life like that what life do i want and hold on that would have been in 2013. you know what i mean so it wasn't you got to understand i this the evolution and the growth that i have gone through over the last six years is is four or five lifetimes of growth you know you're talking about from from saying you're uninvestible to creating generational wealth in a five-year period okay more and and now transitioning beyond you know self-preservation to generational preservation what is my 500-year plan how am i gonna affect your dex for the next 500 years and i couldn't even in 2013 you know i was single partying and like part of like when i looked at like what's my ideal life i want to have balance and love in marriage and kids and these things so i had to begin to change the way that i was living to ultimately create the energy to attract um the person the people the knowledge everything that i would need to grow into the person that i that i had designed for myself in 2014 and 15. and was the you said your production company was acquired um was that the biggest win for you financially well you know i mean there's no doubt you know what i mean but you got to understand like even you know it's it's such a significant amount of capital um and i own 70 of it right so it's just a it's a much it's a it's a big acquisition um you know you know the final numbers aren't we're still in the middle of the earn out but it's it's oh it'll it could be close to you know you know 125 130 million for just me now right and so that that unto itself is a really significant single transaction um that is that very few people ever experience you know what i mean so again it's a in it to me it's the first company that i built that was in the built to sell structure right of when i just taught myself business completely built a system for how i would create businesses it was the very first one that i built to sell and built it and sold it in three years right and went first to the investment bankers said i'm going to build a production and sell it the people that only sell uh production companies they're like okay here's how you got to do it if you want to build it and sell it then i went and hired a person who just went through a build and acquisition who was the number two at the company to help me build it then i went out and began to build it now what happened a whole lot of magical [ __ ] happened you know what i mean like because like like all of these different things like occurred that allowed me to go from zero revenue to 50 million in the first year that allowed like the trajectory of the growth and the the ebitda and the company to scale based off of ridiculousness having a second resurgence and me being able to negotiate the value of the company based off of now understanding the production the unit economics of what the network would need these unpredictable things that that in the beginning but i said it where i would build it and sell it in three years and then took it to market went back to those bankers three years later here's the numbers let's take it out and see if uh see who would be interested now as fate would have it the group that acquired it was the same group that offered me the 360 deal that said i had no value um in 2013. and when they acquired it part of the acquisition i made them also acquire my professional skateboarding league as part of the roll-up that they created right so it was a very poetic justice and beautiful sort of 360 moment as it relates to they as the single sort of private equity group that drove me to like re-evaluate and really push myself to like design my life and then they come around and also provide the opportunity that sets me up for the future instead of owning half of me for the rest of my life they acquired the only two assets i kept from that era and you don't know this rob but sam is kind of a nut like you uh he i think at the age of he showed me the spreadsheet and he's like i made this i think he's 23 24 maybe and basically what he did was he said okay i want to have i forgot what it was i want to be a millionaire self-made i said i wanted to make i wanted to make 20 million dollars by the age of 30. by the age of 30. i want to have 20 million by the age of 30. liquid cash that i actually uh you know i own liquid liquid net worth and so he then created a list of all the rich people he could find in tech because we're in the tech world right and he's like okay from jack dorsey who created twitter and square to like whoever and he mapped out how many years did it take them to make their first like their first nut of like a million bucks and then like how long how long before they got their big win he's like he's like okay the median time of seven years um the average person is getting this uh i need to be on this trajectory at this and so he's like mapping it all out so i was like i need my business to be at this revenue with this ebitda inside four years because that means the growth rate is this and then if i own this percentage that means i'm going to make this after tax so long as i'm in this state yeah everything and then it you know when did you do it yeah he did it he pulled it off he just sold 31. i sold the car who was 31. you're late yeah good for you man and you want to know why you did it because you started at the end and then you know you know hey hey and you know hey like it wasn't about how the path actually went you could have never predicted you're like whoa i would have never expected it to be in this one whatever it may be but your mentality was there on what it is and you're very young because you got to think the way i'm talking i didn't do this till i was 40. 10 years from now for you guys you know what i'm saying but go ahead so i didn't mean to cut you off i just wanted to know the payout no you had it you know you had a point for me on that or no i just i just jammed you yeah no no you're good uh the other things i was gonna say is that we uh you know one of the first messages sam ever sent me i met the guy you know kind of in passing and then you know two days later on facebook he's like so how much do you pay yourself out of your company and he started talking money in a way that most people don't most people are very afraid to talk money and i thought at first i was taking it back i was like who the hell is this guy and then i was like actually it's pretty powerful if i could have some friends like this where we could openly share what are we making how you know what what did we sell for what are we investing it in sharing how what are we spending and it is spending that much money each month actually making you happy yeah that sort of thing and so wow this is amazing here go ahead and so we got to know each other that way created a friend group that way do you have like a set of peers like that in your world where you kind of learned the game together you came up together no and but let me tell you what uh who i do have as a peer group that i think you'll find fascinating have you ever heard of tiger21 yes we've we've broke down that business a ton i actually think that you can build a new tiger 21 because it's pretty old school it's like all old rich guys right so like it's how you look yo so i'll tell you what my tiger 21 experience is right so um to me it's not about the business model of tiger 21 it was about the peer group and so this is what you do in tiger tiger21 so in my group you know they've really expanded it since they took on private equity and they're really trying to grow it so it's probably a little bit different whenever whenever you had looked at it in my group there's 15 people of varying ages right really young guys that have made hundreds of millions really young guys that have a billion couple billion dollars in net worth right really interesting group of of guys now this is what you do in tiger 21 you each month one person has to show all of their assets and it's called portfolio defense right so each person has to like lay out this is every single thing that i'm doing so what are we doing as a group not only do we understand each other's philosophies what they're spending their life philosophies all these things but understanding seeing how they manage their wealth their wealth not not not making money but managing wealth right all all of the latest things through their own advisors that we share and all this stuff but at the core of it it's the realest of the real because you have to be very real in order to open up and show everybody what you actually have and to me when i first heard about i'm like oh my god this is the group for me like this is what i need like i know that only like the realest people would be willing to share all of their their their investment strategies and all of their assets and so for me i actually have been in it now for two years and it was life-changing for me right because part of that very first portfolio defense it was like what was your hundred year plan and it was like in an instant i've i shifted from present self-preservation to generational preservation right but of course i had created enough wealth to be in that mindset to that point right and now over these last couple years it is just it is a a depth of knowledge of wealth building that i've like that's so personal that that i've just never experienced on that i could never experience through just people that were my friends that weren't like open to this being part of the structure of a club if you will so you know look i would even say for it for for you know you guys to even consider it you know what i mean just because it is a an extraordinarily eye-opening and you just learn and learn and learn because at the end of the day you're you're you grow like this right you your your entire life as you grow and evolve you you you expand and what you want to do is be expanding in one direction because that's where exponential growth and greatness and mastery and all these things lie when you grow into a single direction so you know i i think that that it's something like that as a peer group has been massive for me that i didn't have before that because i just don't i don't have anybody that that because i come from a sort of a different world i just didn't have any relationships with people that that were thinking like that were you doing i know that you i mean you've been famous for forever it seems and you've always been doing cool [ __ ] but you mentioned earlier that when you're going through due diligence that the the the buyers were like dude you're running you're like you're spending too much money or you're maybe you're you're buying things incorrectly and you're not you know you're mixing personal and work maybe i don't know but were you were you making a significant income leading up to your big exit and also i mean judging just off purely off tv so who knows if it's real where you it seems like you spend a lot and you like to and you and you like to ball out and you like to do fun stuff were you spending a significant amount and so like were you actually financially successful prior to the the the deal and you're saying when they offered me the 360 deal uh when they win like like you you sold your production company recently although that's still kind of mid mid it's not entirely done right but prior to like your well you said you read the book in 2013 or or whenever it was were you actually doing well or was it like you're still getting by but you're you're you're you're making doubt i was not crushing it i was making a significant amount of income right the the problem was i was spending so much and not managing it properly not not looking at what i was doing it i would like you know i put two million dollars four million cash to buy the distribution company i put 2 million into building the first ever street dream skateboard movie i put 2 million into building my league i was just making millions and investing and building any any which way but loose on top of having you know a five million dollar a year overhead and bodies in my and running the fantasy factory and then all the people that that were underneath me as as part of the management team so fantasy factory cost 5 million a year to maintain and run like like having the building itself was like you know 750 right and now you you put all the bodies in there you know what i'm saying i had you know president ceo of like like full-time like general counsel like ceos like i had like you know a 30-person team i was like running like an agency almost the way that it was built in that era you know what i mean but also let me give you are you making on any profit at all or or was it breaking even and you're just spending it i was like i was i was breaking even because yeah i was i was making profit and paying taxes but after taxes i wasn't saving any money i kept reading and reinvesting in new projects and bigger ideas because i thought that's how you do it you know what i mean you just keep taking shots and my back then i used to say uh like our money's fearless scared money doesn't make money and it's like you want to know uh dumb money doesn't make money you know what i mean like that's like the reality of how i was running and again it was because i was still i revolutionized skateboarding and built street league skateboarding i launched and built a cartoon on nickelodeon i had multiple shows on mtv i i owned my integration right so i was doing chevy deals and microsoft deals and making millions of dollars so i was having extraordinary success only like i wasn't the way i was reinvesting in it i was still um essentially making rather than creating value i was i was really almost like a creative services agent just kind of sloppy just you weren't tight was not not only not tight but didn't wasn't wasn't creating value with intention wasn't looking at markets and market sizes and and trends and how could i create a business that could be acquired one day i'd never even heard of a venture i didn't know what an investment banker was in 2013 i thought it was someone that dealt with high net worth individuals when i when they told me my league was worth 30 million dollars and we did 7 million in revenue i said how they're like oh it trades at like you know four to five times revenue and i'm like how the how does business even how does that work i that's how little i knew about business in 2013 when when the 360 deal was offered to me i had i knew nothing of the capital markets capital staging private equity venture didn't know anything of the first time i'd ever even heard about it and and compared to who i am today and how i look at creating value and managing capital staging and treating myself like a family office not that many years later it's an exponential amount of like unprecedented growth you know that almost doesn't even seem real you're like transferring through universes you know what i mean you uh you've been you know pretty phenomenally successful i'm very impressed by the way but i almost feel like you were too early i feel like if you were 12 years old now because you didn't have you know tick tock and youtube where you you would have been the you know the the elk boys you would have been bigger than the paul brothers right like because you didn't have social media when you were doing all these stunts you you did it in tv you you know you did it before tv and then on tv but it kind of helped them in a way right like yeah i bet i think you would have gone viral like nobody's business i think you know for the amount of views that they get i bet mtv pays more than you of course of course of course it's he monetized as well but i think fame wise if you were a teen today with the tools they have and you had this same kind of gunslinger mentality of like doing stunts to attract attention attract viewers and challenge yourself and have fun have a blast in public that model works today with people who i feel like have done like a fraction of the level of stunts that you've done uh do you think you're you're early i don't know no look i'll tell you what it makes me tired just even having you say that it's just like god think about being on youtube you know what i'm saying and like look if i even when i look at the world right forget about sort of being early or whatever it is like an extraordinary exist i've lived an extraordinary life a handful of lifetimes but i've never been happier than i am today talking to you because at the end of the day there was so much like like angst and ambition and like i want to do something so big and i just kept trying and trying and my will to execute and my ambition and drive kept just breaking me down highs and lows highs and lows highs and lows where now i am just in this like perpetual str state of like high growth in a clear direction right and and inside that is complete happiness right and not saying that i didn't enjoy what i i went through but it was too much highs and lows and chaos and for for for what it's worth right like it's and it's all experience and i really love my life way more at 47 than i did at 27 or 37 right i and that's really what your human mission is right at the end of the day you want to live this peaceful happy effortless like fulfilling life that's really what you're chasing right you want a a a life of infinite abundance and love right and and the only way you can actually get to that is through learning mastery of self and that is mastery of your energy and all the things that give and take from it your time and ultimately your capacity right and and the only way you can master all those is to really learn yourself at a high level what you really love to do and the difference is back then i was i had to do so many things that i didn't enjoy to feed that beast right and and continue to find the next thing and constantly struggling with like i gotta do another show and it's gotta be bigger you know it's like it's like that sort of thing where now everything so much more controlled and done with purpose inside balance that you just enjoy every moment of the process right um but yeah could could i have done that on youtube no because i also had you know an 800 000 budget that allowed me to like you know go and do a deal that could you know rent out uh you know six flags so that i could flip a car ramp to ramp over the world's biggest skateboard that i designed for a while that's how much that stunt cost it was 800 oh no i'll shoot i don't that stunt probably cost like altogether all of those or a few million dollars you know that's crazy that's like stunt teams and groups and like test cars and like i mean i was like you know then then the day comes and what do you got to do you got to flip a car and you want to know what you want to know what happens on the day that you got to flip a car you're like this is the dumbest idea ever why am i even here i have so much going on in my life like why would i even put myself in this position to like flip this car and then you flip the car and it actually works and now it's a super bowl commercial and it's part of the the season premiere of season five is a fantasy factory and this giant chevy partnership and you made millions of dollars and now you're a legend and and you're gonna all this stuff it was genius and the best idea but the day of when you gotta do it it's like cool this is so dumb you know what i mean that's basically all of those uh all the stunts that i did in that era it would always be like this is the worst idea it's not even funny and then when it was over i'd be like i'm earlier you said that you track trends now and you and you start at the end and you work backwards what trends interest you at the moment what uh what business opportunities are intriguing to you if you had a little bit more like even if you aren't going to do it but you wish you had more time and it's just kind of on the side and you're like this is this this interests me i think someone should pounce on this opportunity maybe i will maybe i won't but i'm interested um for clarity purposes here now now i have a business that builds businesses right so i i build uh you know five to six businesses a year right and although i've i've you know i've kind of like really pushed into all the builds i'm doing at the end of the year here are all in the beauty beauty industry uh adaptogenic um topicals uh water filter system saw real opportunity and and sort of um in the beauty space of like how important like water is and how how many chemicals there are and when you shower but then you go and spend all this money on your hair and makeup and skin care but you wash yourself and chlorine so found a real opportunity to develop a a real innovative sort of shower purification system and and water filter system for beauty um and you know really looking at superfoods and plant-based um sustainable beauty products there's a big opportunity in in in that sort of space you know we launched a nootropic footwear or nootropic um an adaptogen uh plant-based bar and drink mix and coffee mix line this year that's been really successful we looked at you know the the three billion dollars in market share between uggs uh crocs and birkenstocks and created what we consider the more the the sleeker ugly ugly shoe the pretty ugly shoe uh and luso cloud that we launched this year that's their last year that that really has ridden this wave of sort of uh comfort this comfort wave and casual wave in the comfort footwear world that we think is going to be uh on track to do really be really big too for because to me at the end of the day like what's happening in a market is important um and it's it's going to be where you live and die right you're too early or you know in the case of ultra cast you know i launched this company that was a a a live 360 um live 360 and vr video platform uh that put 360 videos all over the world and where you could jump on your phone and travel all over the world and be in different bars and clubs and all these different things like right on the conversions of live instagram and and live content and live streaming and sort of vr coming in together and then what happened to vr like just died nothing right and it's like i was like and what did it end up being like the new 3d tv right and so 360 video became like the new like the 3d tv right and so even though i built i got it right on the wave and like it was super innovative with an amazing ceo who once the company went out of business built and took a company public in like nine months but i'm um that that fails right so you're trying to time markets and look at trends and all of that but at the end of the day like you got to get a little bit lucky so you want to be in the right place white space and an opportunity that's an investable um there's so many nuance to a white space and where opportunity is i can tell you uh from someone that's built 17 companies in the last five years that the the greatest lesson i had in years two and three uh was founder market fit you know what i mean like where it's like when the the the the biggest red flag you will ever hear is when somebody comes from uh you know one industry and wants to be in another because this one's so much easier right this one's it's the margins over here it's the shelf stability over here it's though there's not sizes like they all have a position based off of how hard their particular industry's sort of structure is and they're all hard they're all hard and you don't want to invest build companies with people that have to learn the industry as they go right and i think that's that's i would get caught seeing great opportunities and ideas and build with really relentless well uh experienced founders uh who get crushed in the learning curve of trying to learn and understand a new industry it's something that i've really it's very hard for me to build a company with somebody um that's getting into a an industry for the very first time rob we've we've had like billionaires on we typically don't do do guests we typically just sean and i but we've had billionaires we've had you know gary vaynerchuk was on recently he was he was really fascinating we've had some famous people we've had all types of people on here you might be the most interesting that we've ever had um you're definitely the most surprising you know and i hopefully this isn't you don't take this the wrong way but i i judged you based off of just as a skateboarding fan and what i knew about you on tv obviously i knew you were the slick ass businessman and you always had some cool [ __ ] going on but you are way more dialed in than i ever would have imagined and you might be one of the most interesting people i've ever spoken to and uh yeah i i i think you're my new hero yeah i i this this has been amazing look i i i could tell by the questions you asked me um that that it was coming from that sort of lens and i thought to myself man let me let me feed this guy kind of the uh the angle and the evolution of where i'm operating at right you've evolved a [ __ ] and think about it too it's extraordinarily concise and clear right because it's like i constantly am seeking clarity so i'm always operating from a place of intention and then i'm i'm considering myself to have an evolutionary mindset where it's like how how can i purposely keep evolving and evolving and evolving with purpose in a singular direction and one of those is like literally human optimization and being happy as could be you know what i mean at the end of the day but no i thank you and i appreciate it because you guys also had me do work right you guys said hey can you write an agenda of what you want to talk about on today's show i'm like these guys are like having me write an agenda to be a guest on their show and i wrote out an agenda and we never even covered any of the subjects can you come back we didn't cover it because you blew our mind early on i could have took the first three things you said and said okay i have two hours here where all i need to do is just let you expand on that because if i'm listening to this and somebody says something interesting there's nothing more annoying in the world than the guests going back to their pre pre-set agenda and not asking about the really interesting thing the guy just said and so we had to do it uh you know look it goes back to what you said about building towards the end yes we had you plan just like i planned my exit but like what you said was you don't really know what's gonna happen in between yeah yeah and look even with all this this this planning and structure i'm i don't let it i'm not controlled by that calendar you know what i'm saying like i still allow myself to like but the beauty of the system is i could just shut down three days and everything continues to move and it picks back right up when i get there you know even as i operate my life i with the same group that helped me develop my system for the deardeck machine in my my business creation system like i had them develop my life system right and i have this this 50 page document called the rhythm of existence that's managed by my two assistants and my chief of staff and it's basically the operating system for my entire life right and so that that allows all aspects whether it's from my food to my haircuts to to like how i deal with birthdays and how i deal with all these different things is put into this system that's managed that does what it's automated and gives me back more capacity to be able to do more be more present with my wife and kids be more present when i'm working be more focused be able to get more done because i keep adding more and more automation and optimization to my life that allows me to just live and do the things i love to do which then gives me more energy to be more successful more clear have more intention and push things further and further along would you be willing to come on again and and talk more about like pretty much everything you've discussed and also the things that we've planned because this is this is gonna be a home run yeah look you know what i'd like to do i'd probably like to like send you all of my i'll send you all the stuff that i do so you could read it and see it and have that okay here's a live conversation of how rob lives and runs his life optimization then sends you all of my business stuff including my machine method and how i i run my businesses through a discovery diligence build um uh scale launch and scale phase and my seven core capabilities of business and brand product uh media marketing sounds like you have a new product coming out this is the the deer deck ada program no it's not it's just so i can build businesses efficiently and consistently you know this morning i told my uh you know my head of media i said look i think i'm going to come up with a drake equation for business and are you guys familiar with the drake equation you know the drake equation is essentially the probability of intelligent life inside the universe right and to me i do believe that there's an equation that i'm i can put through market through founder experience founder age like all these different things that add up to a probability number on this company that i'm about to create with this person's potential successes and it's because i've pointed my mastery towards i want to master curating individuals and ideas and building them into sustainable profitable acquirable businesses and i just get better and better at every single one that i build because that mastery is going in a single direction so my depth of knowledge in building companies is getting so wide which in turn is doing what it's making me more intuitive i can have a five-minute conversation with a potential founder and fill all their holes know that they're a a more operated minded like product person like not a brand person doesn't understand marketing doesn't understand media oh it's a financial mind uh that understands product oh it's a brand mind and product person that doesn't understand operations or marketing or finances for sure like you become you're driving yourself if you want to save energy you become extraordinarily intuitive right like that's where your mastery shows itself so i digress where i would we we could we could do a live show and a business show you know i'm into it they're very similar dude this is so good i'm so thankful that you came on thank you so much um we're going to do this again i hope hopefully you'll do it but we're into it yeah yeah it's been our pleasure thank you so much for coming on okay all the best now cool [Music] i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i travel never looking back

you 500 i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back should we be doing a like we right now we just roll into the conversation should we be doing a thing where it's like this is the my family podcast where we do xyz because like if you're a new person coming on the podcast starts with you being like we good okay so i want to tell you a story i bought a car and the car has a transmission you know what a transmission is so check this out and then you're like you go into the thing so should we be uh educating people on what this is or you think that's true try hard and just [ __ ] no i think we should we we did the intros at the end for a while where we recorded them and put them in front but how do you i don't even know how to describe this podcast when i meet someone and they ask me what i do for a living i say oh i do this thing i also host this podcast called my first million and i'm always embarrassed to say the name but then what do you explain the podcast is yeah i would say like you know for people who are uh they're kind of like business nerds or they're they're idea junkies so they're always you know scheming or wondering you know what's the business behind this how much money does this make how much money does this person have those types of questions that you're not allowed to say out loud this is the place where we talk about those things out loud that's kind of my my off top my head description and so we brainstorm if you wanna you know if you wanna sit here while we brainstorm business ideas and break down the economics behind businesses that you've heard over never heard of um this is the podcast for you great well there's our intro another way another way i'd put it is every other podcast you can listen to if you go into itunes is gonna be about the past or about the future and we tell you something about the present right now so past is all interviews about [ __ ] you've done the future is you know guessing about you know what the world's gonna look like in 20 years and what we do is we talk about business opportunities that exist today that uh that you should be looking either building investing in or just knowing about but it's not just business for example i got messages sometimes we talk about health related stuff or we just talk about like things we're doing with our life and i got messages saying people love it for example right now i'm staying at my friend's house in hawaii and i posted a video on my twitter did you see that video looks sick okay it looks sick but there's something interesting about this house and what my friend does that i think is amazing so he only has one it's a really big living room he's got a huge living room he's got a very small couch the rest he's got pads like pillows on the floor and it's people it's floor sitting like it's like a floor sitting scheme or like a layout and i love it have you ever sat like they do a house where people like to sit on the floor so my sister did this unintentionally so my sister i think i think i've mentioned i should probably talk about her businesses because they're pretty cool yeah but she basically does uh something called in home like in-home uh daycare or preschool so she does both and so like she took she took over my apartment so my parents were like hey my parents had a house and attached to the house was a two-bedroom condo and i was living in that right when i moved to san francisco i lived in that that place uh like for like a year and then i got noticed i was getting evicted by my parents i was like what's going on it's like oh yeah your sister needs the space she's starting a business in here so like you know you got to get the [ __ ] out and like she's going to take over this space so where we had the living room she basically ran a preschool out of that space and uh you told me the numbers it was a really good business oh it's still a great business so she has three of these now uh they're they're all different so she's got an outdoor so it's even better right so first so the first genius move was instead of going in renting a commercial space she's like oh i'll just use like an in i'll do in home and okay why is that good well you're already paying the mortgage and what happens is from you know 8 a.m to 4 p.m during the day a part of your home will be used for your preschool your daycare and now if you're a student so you would think okay yeah that seems pretty small like you got what 10 kids in there no no big deal well every kid pays three thousand dollars so that's 30 grand a month of income coming in now uh you have teachers so you got maybe three teachers uh there it ends up being about 40 40 i want to say profit i i might be wrong ahead but it's about 40 profit there's another hidden benefit which is you can write off pretty much everything about your house and your in-home life because your business runs out of your home so you basically pay no taxes uh sorry your all your life expenses are also business expenses in a way uh because that couch that you got or that mat that play mat you bought that's all for the school right all the toys you bought that your kids also get to play with they're for the school you're and she also sent her kids to the school so her own what she would normally be paying for daycare now she was getting you know for free because she had her own school and so and then she started she created an even better one which was an outdoor only program so what's better than using your in-home for for for your space no space at all use the public parks and this was great because a whole bunch of parents didn't want their kids indoors all day and like sitting you know kind of like sitting inside well you're going to do that at home anyways why don't you get out there like a good kid and go play go go play with nature and so she created nature kids which is this program in san francisco and it's actually awesome has like the highest reviews and there's i went to the class and basically all the other parents were there and i was just kind of talking to the parents it's like oh yeah this guy he started uh kiva this guy's ex paypal this guy is it's like all these like billionaires of san francisco basically sending their kids to this outdoor program wait she has three of them now so she has yeah she has three total uh programs so this could be like a like a seven figure a year business yeah it is yeah so it is it is that and and so and so she has like teachers who who you know run the day-to-day she's on walkie-talkie with them like doing like throughout the day and she has like nest cameras in the place so she can be like uh like hey you know like you know where she can keep an eye on it but she's not day-to-day involved anymore which is great at the beginning it was her and my mom was like making the food for the kids like making tacos and [ __ ] and like now it's all like you know all done done and and they're home they're they're floor sitters so okay yeah so back to the floor setting thing sorry so because of that whenever i go to my sister's place um her living room there was no furniture there was no tv there was no nothing like a normal living room would have she had done like what you did with your home gym she had just turned the whole floor into play mats and even better than just the floor sitting because it's just play mats and then like all the walls had like kind of like kids games and decals and stuff like that but then she had these like little swings for kids like you know you know like a rope swing like tarzan just like hanging from the middle of the room so like things that would occupy the kids but then when i would go hang out there i'm floor sitting i'm just like stretching while we're hanging out with you that's exactly what i'm doing so so i was getting so [ __ ] limber just like hanging out with my sister because why wouldn't i just be stretching and rolling and just getting to know my body a little bit and then there's a swing there so now i'm kind of like practicing rope climbs like a fireman and [ __ ] and i was like dude this is like i don't know what like it's like an ergonomic lifestyle it's like you know there's this whole my lifestyle just changed into this like mobile tarzan you know one with nature and one with my body that's exactly what i got every time i'm here so he's got this like hammock swing coming down from the ceiling and so you have to like sit in a particular way where you're stretching and then he's got like these cushions that are only like eight inches above the ground yeah and you just sit there and it takes a minute to get used to it it is so much better than sitting on a couch it's so much better it's the best i watched this youtube video recently and this guy had this whole like theory it was like it's kind of like a ted talk this guy's got this video and it's all about how like sitting is like crushing us and basically his whole thing is basically that you should stand most of the time and you should stand in a very particular way where you like squeeze your butt and so it's like your hips are directly underneath you and he's got this whole talk and he like looks at these people who don't sit in normal 90 degree chairs and he shows like what their butt looks like and it's like the whatever it's like the whole point is he like has all these visuals anyway i've been floor sitting and it is awesome i'm 100 gonna stick with this or at least i'm going to try to yeah it's a total hack i should do that uh like i do love me some couch time but i definitely want to have a room that's just pure maths and then when i hang out there work there just roll around there it's just like a different vibe and with kids it's perfect because that's what they naturally want anyways and so i'm just going to do that with my giant like playroom do you want to talk about um ozzy this is amazing i got a bunch of topics i'm going to save half of them for next time but we'll do half today um this is an amazing amazing story the story came out about aussie media and if you missed it i'm going to give you the rundown and then i want sam i want you to react yeah i know all about it okay so here's what i know and you fill in the gaps okay so i heard about this because uh the story breaks in the new york times and they basically say and they talk about aussie media a company that i never really heard of most people have no idea what it is red flag number one so they go they were it's a company that's raised 150 million dollars and they were on this call with goldman sachs and goldman sachs is ready to invest 40 million dollars in the company and they're just sort of doing their final kind of like diligent slash get to know you calls and they're one of the selling points that ozzy was telling goldman sachs about like how it's defensible and how we're like this next gen media company was they were like our youtube videos which you see you know some of our youtube videos get millions of views which is good for news and media company um it's you know youtube loves us the data shows that you know youtube sees that you know gen z or millennials like love our content so they're big fans of our of our content we're going to be doing much more with youtube so you know your investment now you're investing in this like next-gen video company as well and so they they get on a call they're like why don't we do a call with us the founders of ozzie goldman and uh the executive over at youtube who runs youtube originals and so they get on the call and they're on a conference call and they're waiting for the the youtube guy emails and says hey i'm running a few minutes late sorry and so they're on this video call and then the youtube guy says hey guys i'm you know i'm sorry i'm still stuck in traffic can't do video can we just switch to a uh a phone call conference call sorry for the inconvenience and everyone's like no problem we switch over to the phone call and he calls in and he says hey i'm so inside let's call him jeff i don't know what his name is i'm jeff from youtube yeah ozzy is amazing our data shows that it just crushes other media companies uh they're really innovative we plan to feature them and do a whole lot more it's so great and the goldman guys they're like wow that sounds good but you know they sort of noticed like his voice sounded a little funny almost like it was like a like a voice changer and they're like ah that's probably nothing but you know like just in case let's go ahead and just like double check in our diligence here let's just let's just email the guy from youtube and just just make sure you know it's all all good and they were like oh you know he had emailed us from a gmail which is kind of weird you know like the official jeff at gmail.com like let's just email let's just go to youtube themselves and just email him directly and so they email and that guy of course is like what the hell i've never heard of aussie media no i was not on a phone call what are you talking about and so goldman's like what the [ __ ] is going on and so this basically was and then they they they go back to the company and the company's like oh my god yes we're so sorry i'm a lapse in judgment we had that was my co-founder on the call you know like we're embarrassed sorry that was just a bad bad decision i don't know i don't even know how they could with a straight face back out of that but they you know they back out of it and goldman says okay look we're not gonna invest because obviously shady as [ __ ] but uh you know we're not gonna make a big deal out of it so you know whatever so they back out and this this company if you look into aussie they had made some pretty big claims so those are some other big claims so 50 million monthly uniques they said their email newsletter had 20 million monthly subscribers which is like you know as somebody who has like the biggest thing ever yeah yeah so it would be unheard of i think the public numbers morning brewers said they had three million i think you guys are right around that same number so to to do you know 10 times more than that would be like wow that's pretty substantial like that's interesting and uh oh you have 50 million uniques like on your website when i go there it looks like you have less than a million according to this 50 million monthly uniques is also like a top 100 or top 200 website i mean it's it's huge so people start looking into it and they start looking into all their claims so they claim they're like we are amazon prime's first talk show and then you go look into it it's like they used it wasn't like amazon prime commissioned and paid them for a talk show they used something called like direct upload which just lets anybody upload their thing into the library and uh and then they claimed that they were the first and then they were using amazon's name and all their like kind of like billboards and ads saying it was amazon's first and amazon sent them a cease and desist and was like take our name off your [ __ ] and uh and he's like i stand by our claims but you know of course we'll take your name off this and um and then they claim that they are the fastest growing talk show on youtube and the journalist was like so how do you know that because you know we talked to social blade they measured this kind of thing they said you're pretty like average he's like well you know we're the fastest growing premium talk show that's youtube centric like their own category they made up and we looked and we couldn't find a faster growing one and it's like oh so you looked and you couldn't find one and so you said you are the best one and then they look if you look at their youtube videos they'll have like a million views but like less than 100 comments so you know a little fishy a little fishy you know what's going on here and so um and by the way they had like pretty legit investors so axel springer uh mark lazary who owns the milwaukee bucks like steve jobs wife david drummond who's just like you know long time google exec uh they had some pretty like legit investors still have pretty legit investors and the funny thing is after goldman sachs walked away and all this happened they still raised money always still raised another round and so what's your what what did i miss and what's your reaction yeah so the takeaway here is twofold the first is we actually talked about this a few weeks a week or two ago we said that you can raise a fair amount of money and pretty much lie and most people will not check in on you right yeah we said we said the following i'm surprised more people ain't lying because it would be so easy and quite lucrative to do so yeah when it comes to the thing and we said most people us included don't do a ton of diligence and even if you do it's very easy to get away with the basic diligence and we're nobodies right we're we're doing this and then you take these larger funds larger names and uh they still don't do it they all got duped too you know what i mean so it's like uh so there is a systemic problem in a way it's a feature and a problem the feature is this industry runs on trust and the reason you you and i can do deals on a handshake is because we trust each other and we and there's a lot of founders out there who are but the majority of people are not trying are not duplicitous or lying or committing fraud and so that's why silicon valley can move at a fast pace because we don't have to take three to six months to diligence every single deal we do that's why we can move at a fast pace but the flip side of that is it does create an opportunity for fraudsters to to lie which doesn't happen often but so basically i believe the founder's name is carlos watson and carlos watson is a very charismatic guy i think he was a host or had a tv show or something like that on both pbs and cnn if i remember correctly they started about a year or two before us and i remember i recruited people from there or and i had one woman who worked there who have worked for us and and i would ask them about it uh ask her about them and basically they caught my eye because i would use similar web and i would notice that they had very little traffic and if you go to on their website now the hustle probably actually gets more traffic than they do and we don't even i compared you guys have about 10 more traffic according to that than them yeah we don't even try to get traffic like we don't like that's not our business is not web traffic but their business is web traffic aussie additionally their website is horrible like it's one of these sites that looks pretty but you go to it and you're like how the hell do you work this thing and like it's like impossible to figure out what they're like as a marketer and an entrepreneur i can go to a website and i can look at i'm like oh the goal is to drive me to this thing when i see their thing i'm like what are they trying to get me to do and so i've always had a red flag about this company because they claimed these huge valuations they claimed these this huge reach and i don't know anyone who consumed it i when i was in new york i used to see um buses with their logos on it and they're buying all these ads and media companies don't buy ads media companies sell ads and you're not buying a bus ad of all ads and so i used to see this and i knew that something weird was happening because it didn't make sense how they made money and they constantly had to raise money and so this was always full of [ __ ] to me um i'm a little surprised axel springer invested in it because they're pretty legit but i'm not surprised that steve jobs wife invested into it because she invests in a lot of non-profit making stuff so i'm like well she just gives money to anyone um but yeah this company i think is nonsense they also claim that they have these huge festivals and i've never heard of anyone that went to one of their festivals so i've always thought that this company was full of it and now there's some proof yeah yeah funny i mean it's crazy how this stuff goes down and then you see people who are so there's one i think mark lazary's on the board and i think he was i think they released a statement like oh you know we you know a lapse in judgment we we we stand by this kind of temporary momentary kind of like lapse in judgment uh you know they're making the right steps to correct this um i don't even think the co-founders like got fired i think i think he's still there i'm correct dude it's a weirdos company and they also claim that they're you know where they they say they're based out of is palo alto and like you and i have lived here for for 10 15. never heard of them never met a single employee yeah never met anybody who reads them or shared an article from them uh also not where you would start a media company is palo alto so you know just strange all around yeah so that's weird um do you want can i tell you about a uh can i can i do one real quick okay so have i ever told you about um uh newspapers.com you told me about this and i remember going to it be like oh i've never been to like that sounds like a very common word and i remember going to it you said it was something cool but but say it again okay for me because i don't remember in another so i believe it was owned by ancestry.com and so ancestry.com it's a website where you can do two things you can enter in your dna or you can enter in your last name like you give them your dna and they you know do 23 me [ __ ] and they tell you who you're related to or you just do um you enter in your name and you could track like you know if you came into ellis island and like who your great-grandparents were based off of civil war records and all this weird stuff and they owned they bought this archive called newspapers.com and it scans every newspaper they could possibly get a hold of and you could search it and i use it for research all the time and if you scroll down on our doc sean i actually gave you an example so dan gilbert started this company called quicken loans he owns the cleveland cavaliers is that what he owns yeah and he's like a big shot detroit whatever and he seems like a nice guy and i was curious about his background and so i used newspapers.com to learn about his company so quicken loans originally was called rock financial and i sent you three examples of why newspapers.com is incredibly fascinating the first you can read profiles about people so quicken loans went public i think in 1997 i found an article from 1996 i think and you could read that article and it's a profile on dan and he'll explain they'll say dan gilbert's off office is really funny he's got toys everywhere and he'll say well my you know what i'm trying to do is build this fun work plate you know whatever and so you see like first-hand knowledge as they are building about how their philosophy on business and that's incredibly fascinating and he'll also say like yeah you know we started the business with five thousand dollars of savings and then we scaled to this much revenue and so you could actually see in real time how they're describing the business and where they came from the second thing that you can do and i do this all the time is i find their ads in classified newspapers where they list jobs so i actually listed one of their their job ads so how would you do this so let's say you're wanting to find this can you search like everywhere rock financials mentioned or you had to literally go just let me check this sunday and check the job section and see if there's no so what i did was i typed in rock financial i typed in show me all the newspapers within a radius of detroit because i knew that's where they're based out of and then i said uh make it between 1995 and 1996. and then pay for newspapers.com this is a paid service 10 a month um and when i and then i i could see it says when you're searching it says which newspaper it's from and which section of the newspaper and who the author is so i can very quickly see if this is a profile if this is like just dan gilbert giving a quote on the economy or if this is a job ad and i read the job ads job ads are actually amazing so if you ever want to see what a company's launching even today you go to their website and you click jobs and if you see like oh wow youtube is hiring or i don't know i'm making this up apple is hiring people who have experience in cars amazing they're clearly like going into like so that's like a no-brainer but it's cool to see uh and also on a lot of job uh boards or websites they'll say you know we're aussie media we reach 20 million people a month we we cover this stuff and so you see like it'll actually tell you a lot of uh stats about the company they have to they have to um they have to sell themselves right if you're recruiting people and by the way super super sneaky move go interview at a competitor's company to find out their their data because during the interview process you'll find out a lot about the company's strategy about their numbers things like that and that's one way to get competitive intel that i've i've heard some people do or you can recruit the people who work there knowing that you're not going to hire them that's another one well that one is a little bit harder because you recruit somebody and you put them in a position and some people get really some people are like oh yeah like happy to share nothing nothing that was confidential but just you know here's my point of view on what i think they care about and what they're roughly the size of the of this of this part of their business but then some people are like i can't believe you're asking me to divulge information about my previous sure yeah you have to be respectful you got to go about it in a certain way so anyway newspapers.com i use it to look at job ads and i can see like how they describe their company back then and like what they were recruiting for sometimes you could see salary and so it actually adds a lot of context around it and then finally i look at ads that they use to get customers and so you can see like how they describe themselves how they got customers uh things like that you can see if you look at job ads you can see how they're structuring their business it's actually an amazing tool and so the difference is is that when you read biographies they'll tell you like a third person point of view on like analyzing it when i do this when i do it this way i'm like well here's exactly how they describe themselves and um like yeah it's different because it's moment in time versus hindsight right biography is always hindsight now that we've seen it all play out we can connect the dots in this way but when you just go back to the source material at that time when it went to print this is how it was seen in the moment which is which is really useful because like i've done this with tech companies you can go read when twitter launched on techcrunch and it's a small blurb yeah it's like oh this goofy thing called twitter launch it's kind of buzzy at this party but it kind of has no point i'm keeping an eye on it blah blah it's like oh pretty inconspicuous launch for something i guess that became as influential as twitter you could go see this for you can go see their original landing pages and their original launch press and how they position themselves you can go read original like launch announcements on hacker news for dropbox and other things you can go see the the five minute video that drew houston put up demoing dropbox and the comments of people being like dude no one needs this and um you know here we are you know 20 billion dollars and for the modern stuff like a dropbox and twitter there's two ways you do that the first is when you search on google you there's right underneath this uh the text bar you go all the way to the right and you click search tools and you could change the date so you change the date and so you make it so if let's say twitter launched in 2009 you type in twitter and you take out the e because that's how you remember they spelled it and you do like year 2005 to 2010 i forget when they first launched and you actually see it or you go to webarchive.com and or waybackmachine.com i forget just google one of those and then you can actually see the early landing pages so anyway that's a cool hack that i wanted to show you about um it's pretty amazing by the way this print ad i just want to re i just put it in my swipe file but like this ad for them they go it says everybody's talking mortgage first and then there's a quote from a customer we found out that the bank's pre-approval is just a piece of paper with mortgage first we got a firm commitment and locked in a low rate there's no easier way to shop for home right that's like the print ad headline and it's just cool to see the copywriting of these like these types of products you know it's not it's not the sexiest type of product to send to sell as you know a mortgage and that's exactly my point so here's the point when you're starting something you say to yourself i want to be like quicken loans or i want to be like let's say you have a clothing company i want to be like louis vuitton i want to be like gucci and you have to i want to be like steve jobs and apple and you have to remember that it's always on nine out of 10 times it's not glamorous early on and so you can go and look at early apple products and you're like oh wow they're they were [ __ ] just like i am like they were still trying to figure out they weren't that great and what they said then like i can't connect like it's hard to imagine that this thing became this end thing right that this early ad or this early profile like i never would have guessed that therefore if you go to rocketmortgage.com now and it's like you know this diverse crew of like white black asian people sitting on beautiful couches and it says rocket mortgage is the home loan experience designed for you you're one of a kind your mortgage should be too start an application to see what's possible right like a very different type of ad and so if you wanted to be the next them don't copy what they say now now that they have kind of branded and they have a sales force all these other things go copy what they did at the beginning when they had zero brand awareness and they had to like explain what they do quickly to people in a more literal sense rather than these like kind of like fancy marketing brochures exactly that's exactly my point and so i think this is incredibly helpful tool both intellectually because you can get ideas but also emotionally and you can see that like oh wow they weren't always like kick ass they sucked like me or you know they were only okay or i never would have predicted that they ended where they start based off where they started right okay i got i got one for you can we switch yeah which one you're going to do you got a lot of really good ones i'm going to give you my blue collar side hustle okay so uh so this is this is the blue collar side hustle segment for for this week which is basically a way you can make money not a ton but like thousands or tens of thousands of dollars maybe a hundred thousand dollars um with just a little bit of sweat and creativity that's the blue collar side also okay so what is it so it's we're we're about to start october and this last quarter of the year is holiday season it's the biggest shopping season of the year people are ready to spend and coming into the holidays there's one little side hustle that i always thought was interesting and i started looking into it and it's this business of mall santas so have you ever like have you ever done this you don't have like a little kid so you may not have ever done this but like last two years since my daughter was born you know come christmas season uh sonya always wants to like go to the go to see the santa and have us take a family photo with the santa for like the memories with our like baby sits in santa's lap take a photo dude which is when you think about it [ __ ] weird that is it's so weird like why does like this young couple who like if you're an immigrant or you're like in your case you're idiot like just believe that you gotta get this picture with this fat old white dude oh by the way barely looks like santa right so the one i'm going to and also kid cries 100 of the time right because you put them in a stranger's a stranger who looks like a monster's lap surrounding you like dwarves they're surrounded by dwarves and other strangers looking at you yeah you're like give me a smile and they're like nah i'm crying here so um okay so this little business so what is this so let me just tell you how the current system works and then what you can do so a mall santa will make between 10 and 25 000. in about a five-week sprint here and all they do is they go they they buy the outfit for about 300 and then they get hired by these like photo companies like there's one company called iconic that does this iconic what they do is they pay they hire all these mall santas and they have 300 malls in america that they're partnered with and then like a hundred like babies r us no and they'll be like hey i need them i need a santa and charleston you're gonna make you know you're gonna make twenty thousand dollars over the next five seconds like a model agency for fat white guys exactly so then they send you they dispatch you you just go sit there on a chair for like six hours straight and uh kid gets in your lap you say oh ho ho what do you want for christmas take a picture see you later and you just do that it takes zero what do they use them for the rest of the years like a diabetes commercial like what are you going to do with these guys so let me tell you so okay so so that's the first part so then uh so they have about 6 000 santas that they hire just themselves they showed that they get into the malls and get prime real estate because they showed the malls that having a santa there will drive about a million in incremental revenue because you get increased foot traffic into the mall because families like us come to the mall to get the photo done with the santa and you're paying like 50 bucks per photo and you're doing a photo you know every i don't know minute and so like you can just add up the cost per hour that other sort of revenue per hour that iconic or the person hosting this is doing so i thought this was kind of cool then i was like where do these people come from and basically there's been a spin-off cottage industry of santa training and santa out costume like businesses so there's like santa costume business little e-commerce pop-ups like you know halloween pop-ups so it's just selling certain part of the year and it's the boots and the glasses and the beards and the hats and the robes and all that good stuff so you'll end up spending hundreds of dollars just to have one of these outfits um i i own one of these outfits because we wanted our at-home photos to also have me in the santa outfit so you know brown santa sitting next to the tree i have a bunch of photos like that from last year dude your wife is is amazing this is all her instagram she's like an instagram mom basically without the followers so we all of the work of being at instagram without any of the uh influencer money that we get we should be getting out of it so um so so she does she really cares about photos and so like she wants her memories and she wants cute photos so i have to do all this [ __ ] so okay so then what happens so there's these schools that will charge you up to a thousand dollars for santa training and what does that mean it's like tells you what to say it tells you how to groom your beard and your hair to look like nick and then helps you get a job as a as a santa somewhere so that's like a whole little cottage interesting now what do i think you could do with this so i think this can be done in a whole bunch of different ways so i think you could kind of independently do this in your neighborhood so we've talked about like how do you do um door-to-door in neighborhoods so i think you could go door-to-door in any neighborhood and say hey tomorrow santa's gonna be here if you want a christmas photo just come to the front of the neighborhood buy that tree and you're like mixing up a throne this is like a pedophile's dream like santa meets ice cream man this is weird it's not just the kid that does the parents go with you to the thing it's incredibly safe safer than a lemonade stand my friend so this is the lemonade stand we do in the winter which is you do a pop-up santa photo photo thing and if you were going door-to-door you could go door-to-door dressed as the elves saying that santa's coming all right so that's that's one way of doing this the other is you can partner with really any place that has foot traffic so whether it's a mall or it's kind of like an outdoor eating area it's a farmer's market it's um you know like you just need to find foot traffic and if you pop yourself down my estimate is that you're going to be able to make 50 per minute doing this thing uh that might be a little high let's just say 30 per minute because people don't always opt for the big photo pack so thirty dollars a minute add an hourly rate bro okay so hourly that's 1800 an hour and you're going to be there for let's say six hours that's 10 grand a day you can print doing this thing and all your costs are you know fat santa for uh you know hopefully that's somebody that's you or somebody you know that you can get to do it you buy me out for 400 another thousand dollars of props and decorations and the chair and all that stuff the photographer might cost you let's call it a thousand dollars for the day and um and so that's your that's sort of your cost structure going into this i think the rest of it is pretty much free because who's going to really kick out santa who uh who's iconic iconic is the company that does like like photo experiences and stuff like that are they big i think they're big because this isn't their main business um so i think this is like you know part of their business if someone okay so i agree with you that someone could pull this off i would be i'm just saying you want to make 20 grand for the holiday season that's nice a lot of people want 20 grand i would be amazed if someone is well you got to have so much courage in order to pull something like that off that scares me this scares me but why what scares you about this so it's kind of like whenever i think of business ideas i'm like anything that involves eating something i'm like ugh that's so that's all you got like it's like a big burden right it's like a big burden uh if you like if your product is going to be eaten oh you mean selling something other people are going to eat yeah i'm like well you can't [ __ ] that right you got to like you got to nail that right away and then like a tear down i'm like well anything involving children i'm like oh my god like you got to nail that too you can't have anything weird going on there's no risk here it's literally a santa with the parents standing right there next to you and you sit on their knee for one second to take a photo it's so real low risk it's not like a daycare or something like that daycare is up there too i mean this is i would be i would be very curious if anyone's going to pull this off this isn't like you're just going to the street and like break dancing like you're going in the street and like having a kid sit on your knee i just think that uh dude i'm gonna i'm gonna do this for the uh for my for you know we were talking about our youtube channel doing some uh some little business stunts i'm gonna do this as one of them this holiday season i'm gonna do this i'm gonna hire a santa i'm gonna find a foot traffic area and i'm gonna make like 10 grand in a day no way there's no way you're gonna be able to pull this off i bet you five hundred dollars there five hundred dollars okay what part are you doubting okay maybe the 10 grand a day is the ambitious part no maybe it's five okay i'll be very curious to see if you can pull this off this would be amazing what do you think is going to happen what do you think all the risk is there's no risk i don't think there's that much risk i just think there's a huge amount of fear that i have about doing this about anything involving the risk is sean gets lazy and doesn't decides not to do it that's the only risk that's the only thing preventing me from successfully doing this well let's see if i was you if i was white i wouldn't even i would be saving myself the the thousand dollars i'm gonna have to pay some santa here to do this because nobody i i nobody wants me to be the santa so you know i'm already working from a district are there ever black santas that is kind of interesting we gotta we gotta like what are there ever i've never seen a non-white santa at a mall i'm sure i'm sure there is but uh yeah maybe that's the underserved market that i need to go for i think people want the classics i think with holidays people throw all the equality out the window and they want the classes wait do you do celebrate what religion are you are you anything i'm not religious but i do celebrate fun days like christmas yeah i didn't but you know i know you're not religious like in terms of like a god but like a culture like you know i'm catholic i was raised catholic but do you do you do anything oh no i celebrate all the fun holidays if any yeah oh dia de los muertos sounds great i'm i'm you know i i'm hispanic for the day well let's do that like any any any culture has a fun holiday i'll play why not i'm looking for more days to celebrate yeah we gotta uh yeah once i started like meeting my jewish friends i started celebrating shabbat so uh we could pick some holidays i love shabbat give me some worship yeah it's really good what do you want to do this royalty-free music one i think this is amazing yeah okay so here's the idea so i saw this on product hunt i kind of forgot the name but there was basically a product that launched yesterday or today and it's a ai generated royalty-free music okay so for anybody who's ever had to make a commercial or like create a video or you're an agency or a freelancer music makes your video like 10 times better but it sucks to have all the music you know is copyright protected so you'll put it up on youtube it'll get muted or taken down or dmca noticed and if you want to use it to sell products or promote your company you really can't do it it's illegal if you use copyright music because you don't have the permissions and so there's this whole like genre of royalty-free music out there and there's all these big um websites like pond5 that exist that will give you royalty-free you know either stock footage stock photos or stock music and this whole like stock industry is pretty big and so what i thought was cool here is take a business like pond5 so i don't know if you've ever used pond5 do you know pawn five no no no no no no no no no no no so many times in my life it's great it's like the best place to go if you want like uh stock music for a thing is it free and so how does it work no you pay you end up buying the the the music you like like while you're listening to the sample it'll be like the really good music and it'll be like pond5 in the background like just like as a watermark like every two seconds so that you can't steal the thing you have to buy it so here's how i know this company crushes they raised one round of funding in 2014 it was a 60 million dollar round which means they already had a bunch of traction before then since 2014 they haven't reported any other raising of money and i know they're still going super strong so that's like you can sniff that and be like what's the opposite of aussie media it's this it's a company that raises one mega round doesn't raise again for the next seven years probably means it's super profitable just spitting off cash and they probably sold who they raised 61 million dollars from they probably like it was probably they just sold a bunch of their shares yeah it's probably to get some liquidity because i think they started in 2005 or 2008 or something like that so it was like many years into the business that they did around nerd wallet same thing right they started they ended up raising a hundred million dollars never touched the hundred million dollars like their bank account's never been less than a hundred million dollars since then it's like these are companies that are lean mean and just super profitable we should talk about nerd wallet do you have intel and nerd wallet uh you probably have more you're buddies with the guy so i don't have much but we should have him on i i was talking to uh his his partner and he was saying that he was saying oh yeah you should have one and i thought that's a good idea well he uh i heard they were considering going public or something like that and so he couldn't talk too much but if i don't know if that's the case anymore or not but we uh you know when you're about to go public you can't say too much and so it's hard to get they're not good interviews well i can tell one uh anecdote i heard which is just on how they kind of got chartered how they made it work so early on with nerdwallet what nerdwell it does is it's a blog for like kind of like personal finance so it just kind of gives you information you need to know about about managing your own finances and their money maker is that they rank really high for credit card suggestions so if you say what credit card should i get nerd wallet's like at the top of the list and then they'll break down in a pretty objective way here's you know the best credit cards depending on your goals depending on who you are pick this one it's basically nerdwallet.com best dash credit dash card that page i think that page likely makes like 80 of the revenue and the entire company exists to make sure that page shows up number one on google when you search best credit card right exactly and i think when we say 80 of the revenue i don't know the revenue if i was guessing i would guess that the revenue is 100 million dollars or more plus or minus 50 yeah um definitely not minus 50 okay so maybe plus 50 so so that's pretty impressive right because when when somebody clicks that link to go buy it they they get an affiliate uh kickback and so they'll get i don't know what it is like two thousand dollars it's like very lucrative to refer a credit card 2500 or something like that for a credit card referral so they make a lot per customer that hits that page so early on all the sides so because that incentive is so big every website in the early web web days was just like who's going to give me the highest kickback fantastic you are my my recommended my recommended card and so it was kind of like it wasn't objective right they were just there they were in the pocket of the credit card companies and they were just printing you know shitty content to try to get you to click that link um to go through this which is which is how red ventures started red ventures is a company that makes north of a billion dollars a year they basically started doing that with both credit cards and dish tv right right yeah satellite tv and so so with these like high high margin high subscription products you know they'll pay a lot for affiliates so what nerdwallet was doing was they were just two dudes sitting in their room and they would just write blogs like high quality blogs they're like we're gonna write higher quality stuff because these other ones are just kind of content forms trying to generate clicks and year after year they were just like writing these things and it really wasn't going very far it was like not that impressive now you tell me if i'm wrong on any of this uh it wasn't really it wasn't taking off it took just two basically in the first two years there was i don't think there was a month where they got more than a thousand people visiting their website and if you google nerdwall hustlecon you'll see a talk where he shows their traffic like it was like you know it was a shitty it was horrible multiple years of staying the course even when the evidence all said this doesn't work because they trusted their gut and their belief system that if we put the highest content out highest quality content out there eventually we will get the traffic and if we build it they will come and it actually worked right so like you know there is a counterpoint to every uh every piece of advice i would if there was if they were a startup doing this right now i'd be like guys two years no traffic less than 10 grand a month you're making you how long have you been in this apartment when's the last time you left this building uh guys like look at this company they're just shilling out shitty content and getting way more traffic and paying for it and just trying to arbitrage like do that that's gonna work that's working so like do that so my advice would have been horrible here because this was a tortoise-in-the-hair startup story that actually worked and so finally there's a google update uh google updates a search engine and it punishes the low quality blogs that were out there and nerd wallet jumps in the rankings and so all of a sudden they they go from making you know zero dollars a day to like seven grand a day of revenue and that's from the the traffic that's coming here and then a few months later there's another update and it goes to like 70 grand a day and uh and they sort of never look back they've always been kind of like near the top or at the top for this kind of thing uh since then so that that i thought was pretty remarkable and you know i could have had that same idea i would have never stuck to it uh the way that those guys did and they deserve every dollar they make off this yeah it's a it's a pretty monster company um what but what about pond5 okay so back to pond5 so pond5 my research tells you this is quite a big company they at one point they reported 60 million a year in revenue that was like 10 years ago so wait a minute i'm pretty sure that yeah so i'm pretty sure that they're doing 100 million dollars or north of 100 million dollars off this most stock websites will do you know 100 million dollar plus but they get consolidated so like you know i stock photo and all those things they all get owned by the same company so anyways what's the idea here well pond5 they have their value because they have a big library so that when you're searching for upbeat energetic music for my commercial that's 60 seconds long that doesn't sound cheesy i gotta find that that that thing on your website and so how do they get this library where they don't make it themselves they let any creator just like a stock photo site you upload your content and then if someone buys your thing you get a rev share you get 50 rev share well here's the cool thing about what's happened like there's been a change where ai has gotten a lot better and you can auto auto-generate music now and so what this product was doing was you put your video in and it knows okay your video is one minute and 23 seconds long so that's how much music you need and it can even look at in you know in the future it can even look at you can mark maybe key markers on your video you say this is where the the climax happens or where my product reveal happens like i need a beat to like i need to i need an uptick here right and then it will auto generate an infinite number of music amount of music for that that's custom fitted to your video track and you can just say i want it to be playful i want it to be energetic i want it to be serious i wanted to be foreboding i wanted to be mysterious and um and then you just hit generate it'll give you one you say next next next just like tinder you can swipe through and they're going to keep 100 of the revenue so whatever whoever does this i think they're going to have the biggest library pretty much from day 10 because their neural net will have generated such a vast amount of stock footage or stock stock music or stock photos so i think they're going to crush the existing stock stock sites because they're going to have 100 times more content and then they're going to crush it in terms of economics because they're not going to have to share any of it with any content creator and they're going to keep 100 of it so i would love to invest in one of these companies that's doing this that's got the right marketing mojo to get this out there because the fundamentals tell me that however big istock photo and those guys are the ai version of it is going to be you know maybe four or five times bigger and those today are like multi-billion dollar companies i'd imagine though the key to this business is not the ai generated music part i would imagine the difficult part here is getting customers because the um stock photos and stock video and stock music in terms of search traffic it's impossibly challenging like it's it's like oh i bet you it's almost as hard as uh credit cards like best credit card right so that would be the hard part is how to get customers you know a business is basically like three things it's like convincing people to work i guess there's four things convincing people to work there convincing someone to give you money or figuring out how to get capital to do it making the product and then getting the sale this one falls into that fourth bucket where that's the hard part i would imagine is getting people to go to your website consistently for at least cheap enough i would simplify it i think i think businesses get customers uh charge them enough where you get to keep some pr some profit and keep customers right you got to do those three things and get customers is usually the hardest one um and it's the hardest one in this case so so that's why i said the founders that have the right marketing mojo that was the key part of what i said because you have to have a tr a way that you're gonna like get traffic for this and over time i think they will out-compete their old-school alternatives because they're outdated now so here's my other that 50 that goes to creators you could maybe spend on acquiring customers exactly and um and you can give away a lot of the content for free initially right because of that so here's my hack for for this this is also a hustle this is maybe my big co side hustle this is you're a pm at google or you're a product manager at duckduckgo and you're a search engine well the search engines have one way that they cheat which is when you search for something they can just give you their result as the top result always right that's like google with their one box thing if you just say hey what's the best holiday they surface the best results in a box so you don't even need to click and go to a website or if you go to google images and you search for icon of this or stock photo or royalty free whatever they could just serve you the google results for this and they have all the ai talent in the world to do this and this could become a product line that generates you know nine figures a year for these companies so if you want to you know if you're inside one of these big companies that's another pitch you can make to your boss that says hey boss how does this sound we use our ai talent on something that we're already getting millions of searches for a year and it will generate you know 100 million dollars plus in revenue within three years can i work on that project and then the answer will be uh yes and why haven't i promoted you already dude i went so i've got two stories i went to a conference and i met this woman who was she was part of the crew that managed this so basically google makes 95 of their revenue from one thing but they're constantly trying to launch all this other stuff so they've probably done stuff that you don't even know exists um but and they'll like buy stuff and try to run it and make it bigger like in it one example is zagat you remember zagat yeah the restaurant reviews is that right yeah google owned it a lot of people didn't don't even know that but google owned it and i talked to this woman whose job it was to help manage the ceos of the projects and decide what's interesting and what's not and she told me that they have some products that would scale to a hundred million in revenue in only a couple years and they would kill it and i was like why'd you kill it and they go well two reasons one the people who we get to run them they're oftentimes paid so much money that they don't give a [ __ ] like if you're just like running your own startup you're like this has to work because this is where 95 of my net worth is like i would be screwed whereas the people who work at google they're like dude i make so much money each year i don't really want this to succeed that much i have to work more and still get paid some and so she told me that and second they're like google is so big that even though a product makes a hundred million plus in revenue over the course of a few years which could be worth a couple billion dollars it's just not worth it to us we just have so much better ways to spend our time and i was flabbergasted and i knew this other woman who ran this one thing that was doing over 100 million in revenue and they killed it because they're like this just isn't big or interesting enough and it's just it's pretty wild to think about that yeah it's insane actually i did this when we got acquired by twitch i had in one of the meetings i had with emmett i was who's the ceo i was talking about like oh yeah if we try like this could actually make this much and i noticed he didn't like react in any way like when i say something that i think you're gonna get excited about you don't get excited i'm like hey i thought you would i thought that would like register for you it looks like it didn't tell me why that didn't um and he was just like he's basically like look uh we make this much revenue over here so to move the needle on revenue you have to be like the size of the price has to be x and like trying to make revenue brings in all this like legal complexity business ops complexity and like potentially stands in the way of user growth and so like we either want something that hits this threshold on revenue or make it free and just optimize for user growth i was like oh okay so like not interested in like you know this kind of like eight figures plus you know uh of of revenue a year it's like no um and i was like and i i didn't take it i was like thank you for teaching me that because yeah that makes sense my startup brand was wired where that's a big number but now that i'm at a big company i need to like rewire it as a small number dude when we sold to hubspot we went we sold in uh i forget like mid to late january and so we went into the year 2021 with many many millions of dollars of advertising revenue booked and contracts signed and everything and this year we you know we would have made many eight figures in revenue and when they sold when we sold they go um look we make this much money i think what's hubspot make a year like 1.2 billion a year in revenue and it's growing quick they're like your little 20 million dollars it doesn't really matter to us we rather you not focus on that so we gave all the money back like we yeah we had to call them and we had to be like hey this company i know that you booked like five hundred thousand dollars in advertising sorry we can't do it anymore and we gave it back and it i was heartbroken i was like oh you're killing me and they just didn't and they're right i mean it's smart but it was crazy to think about that dude uh okay i want you to just don't type hands up hands in the air guess google's revenue last quarter i would imagine that they do uh i don't know 30 40 billion dollars a year okay 34 billion a year so let's divide by four and let's just say round number 10 10 billion a quarter good guess that's actually what i would have guessed they did 61 billion dollars last quarter so four times that is what 24 240 we don't do public math yes dude what unless i'm looking at something that's wrong but uh i'm looking on statistics right now it's it came up in my in the first google search and i was like no right that's annual not quarterly and then i looked at another place and says it's second quarter revenue of 2021 was 61 billion dollars okay now how long have you felt like google's a juggernaut like an absolute juggernaut that's already like pete it's already like at the peak of its powers since the beginning of years ago yeah how many years ago did you feel that way like let's just say like at what point in time if i was like hey google's revenue is already like you know just absolutely monstrous not too much upside left like five years ago would you have said that uh yeah so like in 2015 which was six years ago now if you told me just to like invest all my money into google i'd be like why would you why would you what why would you ever want something that's already so big it's not going to grow that much yeah so since that date that same quarter in 20 2015 uh this quarter was three and a half times revenue times more revenue so it went from 17 billion to 61 billion in that five-year span when i think of that so there's like i used to be all about facebook i actually think that if you told me this could be like crazy wrong in 10 years if facebook and google are not like i think they'll exist but if they're not like the big shots i actually i'll be surprised if they're still the big shots would you agree so that could mean many things is it like there's the big shot like microsoft is still a big shot but and it was always a big shot but like facebook and google kind of like took all their shine for like a decade plus um you know as microsoft was either flat or kind of declining but it was still big but it didn't have the talent it wasn't growing as fast stocks not appreciating as fast so is it that where it kind of stagnates or you're like it's actually going to go down i think it's going to go down and here's why have you ever met anyone that worked at google or facebook yes um like they currently work there yes i think that google so google is interesting point one is that it kind of succeeds in spite of itself they basically invented this one thing that hasn't changed that significantly and it's always been amazing okay so they kind of have that going which is good but the second thing that they have is that people i don't think particularly like working there like it's not cool i think to say you work at google is like five years ago saying you worked at goldman it's not really that particularly interesting and i also think that the people who work there unlike goldman whereas goldman will explicitly say we're going to work your [ __ ] we're going to work you down to the bone you're going to grind and most of you aren't going to work here in five years google's the opposite they say we care about you we do this we do that right and can i fold your laundry can i do would you like a foot massage while you are you program you know this code right now and because they do that they create entitled babies who protest and get angry uh when anything bad happens for example i think last year there was this big event and i don't actually know what happened i don't know the reason it could have been justified who knows but they had a walkout so a lot of the employees just like walked out for the day and uh when i saw that i was like oh this is like the beginning of the end because if you think about google do they do things that maybe you could describe as evil or you don't agree with definitely yes but as an employee are they overwhelmingly like a soft place to work that you get paid significant amounts of money barely have to show up and they pretty much are like oh yes honey like you need anything of course they are and if people are willing to protest that and walk out then they're soft and they're going they're going to die soon that's why i think that they're going to die soon rant's gone wrong there's like a there's like a phrase what's it it's uh uh hard time uh hard times no difficult times make strong men strong men make easy times easy times make soft men that and that's like what's going on right now at google so that's why i wouldn't be surprised if they don't exist i i had a friend who worked at facebook and they would send me there's an internal uh facebook group for employees and it's basically just a [ __ ] session where they just vent and [ __ ] about everything that's happening inside the company and he would send me screenshots of what the topic would be and it'd be like the most petty trivial like hey i noticed that the orange juice has moved in the cafeteria like you know i like to eat salads and when it was by the salad bar it just really complemented my healthy lifestyle and now that it's over by the meat i feel like i've been vegan for two years and now that it's by the meat it's like a micro aggression against my vegan it's like dude these people were complaining about the dumbest stuff and they would have hundreds and hundreds of comments which means just hours wasted fighting in the facebook comments amongst facebook employees and it was everything from the parking garage layout to the milk choices to the the wording and the email that was sent out to listen to the softness of the song so for the longest time and i think he still does it but when my wife worked there he was definitely doing it zuck and cheryl sandberg but i think for sure zuck or definitely for sure suck it was either every friday or one friday a month i forget zuck would do in all hands and you could show up in person and you could ask him a question and it was mostly empty like you know facebook at the time had 15 000 employees and like 100 people would be there and to me that's crazy right that's like imagine like going back uh years and years and like you get to ask andrew carnegie or john rockefeller like any question or henry ford like any question like that's it's like pretty amazing i'd be there every friday and i used to tell my wife i'm like man if you keep asking interesting questions he's gonna get to know you but he'll be like you know sarah that's a great idea come and talk to me i was like you gotta just be there every time and one time i heard the story about this person he raised his hand and uh they're like uh yeah what's your question he goes look we have a huge problem at facebook um we don't have tampons in the men's restroom and it's like discriminatory and zuck was like he said like is this really what you want to spend your time discussing or can we discuss this out there and they're like like we have to talk about he's like all right head of hr or how to please come up here and like address this and uh i swear i heard the story of that someone asked that during the their time would suck is that crazy i feel like we should end on this just like a man it's like just is that really what five minutes is a better look than current google employee totally isn't that amazing it's a such a stronger signal that your ex google than current google i completely agree do you agree with me do you think that they're gonna go down no i think they're kind of juggernauts but i do think like every they become less and less relevant over time i think they've i think facebook particularly has done an amazing job fighting off irrelevancy um like tooth and nail i think zuck knows and therefore like is he goes to war for it but they just have all the there's the natural like father time is undefeated or whatever like basically over time there's a natural decline and then there's a talent drop off as for people that are going to go work there versus go work at new exciting high upside things and then there's the like um you know like anti big tech company backlash where now if there's a if there's a new social network that takes off like instagram did or like um whatsapp was doing facebook can't buy it anymore so the next one that takes off facebook can't buy and uh that will because of antitrust and so they're just gonna lose their stranglehold because that was their previous way of like extending their lifespan was to acquire the next best social thing and bring it in to bring it in house so that's gone for all the tech companies they can't do that anymore i typically hate discussing big company [ __ ] like google and facebook i find to be incredibly boring and i'm like who the [ __ ] cares like this doesn't actually impact me at all and i think that takes place or that exists for a lot of our listeners so i'll be very curious to hear if they even remotely cared about this discussion uh so let's see let's see what they have to say yeah tweet at us all right i'm out of here we're done [Music] never looking back

there's a whole bunch of big money industry financial players that will happily pay 25 000 50 000 100 000 a year just to be like uh explain this [ __ ] to me i feel like i can rule the world i know i could [Music] sean what um what are you wearing you get so offended when i don't have sleeves i forgot i'm not offended like shook you're completely flabbergasted i think that a sleeveless hoodie is an interesting choice i think it look you look nice and then you look jacked thank you i'm trying to be jacked are you um i'm like thick jacked uh like i have a lot of muscle but they're still fat on the muscle so it doesn't look very good i um i took this so i got you know you know those cars that kids get where it's like it's like a mini version of a car so they can drive it around like whatever yeah so we got one for my daughter's birthday it's like a little mini range rover thing and so i posted on instagram i never post on instagram so i posted instagram like a close-up of like the range rover logo the wheel where you it couldn't you couldn't tell it's like a kid's car i was like yeah a new ride you know work hard it always pays off and then i posted like a zoomed out version of it in my driveway and it's like two feet long and then i took a picture posing with it and then uh and then yeah i didn't realize that i forgot that most of the world hasn't seen me in like two years um and so you know i have long hair now i never had long hair so everybody in my instagram's like what the what's going on is this you what is this and then uh also i've gotten like considerably like bigger and more muscular i guess yeah you're you're you've you've over the last i would say four years four years it's been like a three year journey maybe you've changed significantly yeah yeah so i i got a bunch of dms of people just being like well like like how that's funny what you were doing like because i was like you know like you know proving the haters wrong like you know hard work pays off you know like the cringy instagram stuff that people do when they like get a new car i was doing that i just doing it for a joke and then also jokes on me because people are like you look weird that's all right they're actually complimenting you so do you know that um i was reading stuff on we talked about examine.com i was reading about examine.com so i i enjoy reading about things that have core or that are correlated to longevity um and so like different studies on that and so there's two findings that i've discovered the first is grip strength so grip strength is highly correlated with longevity the second thing is yeah i'll explain why and the second reason or the second thing is quad strength so your thighs how strong your thighs are now so you're living until 300 300. yeah i think i'm gonna be i'm gonna be old however there's not a correlation between muscle size and longevity so just because you have big muscles doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna live a long time but what it means is grip strength and quad shrinks are both really um the most uh perfect of an imperfect test to test your upper body and lower body strength and so if you're strong you're going to live to be longer or it's it's more it's correlated with longevity so strength is so i think it's good you're lifting weights uh yeah but i feel like my grip strength and quality is not great and i also feel like that's not what the show is and nobody cares about my griffin quad strength but i do think it's cool the longevity thing is cool i've been i've been like you know you have these things where you're like okay i'm not doing a project in this area it's not my work it's not my job i also don't even really know what i'm looking for but i just keep going down this rabbit hole just i just keep watching videos or reading stuff or kind of like talking to people about this thing i kind of i don't have like a destination i'm trying to get to and um that's what it's been with this uh longevity anti-aging stuff i've just been watching a ton of interviews and reading about a bunch of the science about what's what is the latest in this space i think i talked about it on the podcast that guy i regret degrade yeah and uh and then there's like laura deming do you know who she is no so she's um she's a i don't know she's an entrepreneur i think she's kind of like she she started doing this when she was like 16. i think she was a teal fellow so she dropped out of college uh to take the teal fellowship which was basically peter thiel made this thing where's like i'll give you a hundred grand if you just drop out of college and um work on whatever project you want to work on so he's paying people to drop out and so she took that and she was like okay do i start a company do i do this do this and i think she ended up creating something called i think it's called the longevity fund and it's basically it was the first major i don't want to say first it was one of the first at least major vc funds that was like um only investing in anti-aging and longevity companies and so she raises money she's still probably i don't know under 25 and um but she's like you know a veteran in this space now so i think she worked under armor de gray and then i think she uh or knows him at least and then she's got this longevity fund and she was talking about like you know what's what's been what gives her hope like what what breakthroughs or advancements make her think oh shoot like the products are really being made and like what are some things where 10 years ago you thought this would be here by now and we're still 10 years away or more and uh and i feel like there's a bunch of space like self-driving cars is like that people have been thinking about this for a long time or vr people have been thinking about it for a long time it always feels like it's five years away but it never hasn't clicked yet but you do feel like it's inevitable and that's kind of like what anti-aging is yeah i've been reading it a bunch one of my favorite books is it's like the the pop culture version of all those blue zones have you read blue zones no what is that you don't know you don't know what the blue zones is no blue ocean i know but not uh all right so the blue zones is fantastic so it's a book that studies five different cultures that have an incredibly high number of centarians so a large population of people who are above 100 years old i believe the five locations are the seventh uh the seven day adventist which is a religious crew in mid california then there's a group in japan there's a an area in greece an area of korea and i maybe costa rica i forget i forget the other ones and he tries to narrow down to the handful of things that they all do and those things include eating meat and vegetables particularly large amounts of vegetables drinking moderately not exercising vigorously but exercising like walking to work or walking around all day so the seven-day adventists they um they they believe their body's a temple and so they walk throughout the day and they work jobs where they got to lift stuff above their head but they don't exercise in the traditional sense they don't damage their body to try to get super sore and grow the muscles yeah and they and they under eat you know they don't overeat because they believe that their body is like sacred um and then a few others are the old folks don't go to living nursing homes they stay at home so they have a stronger sense of community typically they drink moderately i also believe a lot of them have some type of religion or spiritual thing that they're like looking towards um and uh that's mostly it but there's a maybe a few more characteristics that they all share and do you um there's a whole bunch of like drugs that are like you know possibly possibly linked to longevity like whatever metformin and stuff like that have you dabbled in any of those no but i'm as of today for the past handful of months i've been taking a variety of magnesium um what ashwagandha the thing that you mentioned right um what's it called althea it's one of those it's one of those words that like i write all the time but i never pronounced theanine yeah cava uh and i believe that's it but i've i i've i have been interested in some of that stuff i just haven't what's it called again it's called um i forget the stuff that that's proven in my mice for longevity uh i don't know rap some myosin or something like that rapamycin yeah um anyway uh so uh yeah i'm interested in longevity stuff we'll have to talk about it i i don't have slack open by the way if you're gonna message me i don't have slack open i've got zen caster no i was just kidding like some of the things we were talking about yeah they're all it's all meant for like lower mood also the blue oceans a lot of it a lot of it um they have low stress right yeah i think this stresses that stress is the killer that's that's what some people talk about with warren buffett because buffett's diet is like famously garbage like soda mcdonald's yeah he like i think he eats uh you know mcdonald's for breakfast every day on his way to work or something like that like a sausage mcmuffin every day i remember watching some video following a day in the life this was like 10 15 years ago so maybe he's uh maybe he's he's sharpened up but at the time he was saying this is what he does every single day and then he drinks diet cokes and he eats eminem's it's like all his portfolio companies you know that he like lives by basically [ __ ] and um and so you know it's like shocking but because he's you know he's in pretty good health and he's got like he's got his wits about him even though he's almost 90 years old or whatever he's like very sharp mentally has high energy that sort of thing and obviously he's still performing like extremely well at his job even at that age and so um so a lot of people are like well that defies the odds and then some people say well one thing that buffett does right he may do a lot of dietary things wrong but one thing he does right is he is extremely low stress and um and it's uh if i was betting i would bet that stress ages and hurts you more than any other um like dietary input now i'm not a scientist it's just like my observation of people i could see people who are glowing who have high energy people who stay healthy and who don't and it's like if i looked at what in my life the people around me what would be the common denominator um it's actually not their diets it's more of their their stress and their mindset yeah i uh it's it's it's hurt me in the past so we're on the same page do you um do you want to talk about the results of the nft thing yeah dude i mean it's kind of insane we uh so we did this nft auction which was uh uh here's like the the quick summary if you if you didn't follow so basically i was i'm really into crypto i did this thing called crypto week where i was just deep diving and my goal was to actually use all the different parts of crypto not just like be an investor but like be a be a user of what they call web3 which is all these different technologies different things you can do one of which is nft so i bought some nfts i i played with the tools to help you value them or scope them out and all that stuff and the last thing i did was i wanted to mint an nft and i thought all right what would be an nft i would do well we're not great artists so i'm not gonna you know i'm unlikely to have this visual art that just speaks to you um but i was like what did we do well and i thought well one thing we've done is we've we've created this audience through my first million and what if we created an nft called five minutes of fame and five minutes of fame is real simple it basically just says hey the owner of this nft owner of this token it's like the willy wonka golden ticket if you have this golden ticket you get access to the chocolate factory so for us it was if you own this token you get access to the pod you get five minutes of air time on the pod where you could talk about whatever you want if you wanna talk to us and just shoot the [ __ ] bring your ideas to the table fantastic if you wanna ask questions or promote your company or whatever you wanted to do that five minutes it's yours and so kind of on a whim i just texted you being like hey idea what do you think you're like cool go for it and uh i minted it on open c so i paid a little bit of uh ethereum to create it i set up an auction for seven days and i started the auction at .25 ethereum or ether uh and so that was the equivalent of at the time about like 700 800 and it just closed last night at midnight the auction closed and i think it made 33 000 so i think it closed at 11.55 which is about about 30 32 33 000 i think it was a little more let's see 11.5 times 11.5 five three thousand five 35 grand yeah so that was uh that's what it closed at last night and uh so we should shout out the winner i thought it was gonna go at about 25 30k that's right that's what i would have predicted ads on how much would an ad cost on this podcast maybe 10 000 and we would do a couple of them yeah i think you know 10 000 bucks would would be you know maybe i don't know we don't sell ads anymore so i don't know what five or 10 grand maybe going ad rate would be for it but you can't we don't sell them so you can't even get it but yeah who's the winner um the winner is his username just like d2d something so i don't actually know the person um you know it's sold to uh kind of an unnamed unnamed artist they can they can hold it so they can basically say all right cool y'all are growing 20 month over month i'm in no rush let me um let me just hold this for you know the foreseeable future and um and let's let this thing grow and then you know they could cash it in later or um so the username the one person you want is d2d d2d628 and then you can go look at their profile about some other stuff that they own they own some other nfts that are you know five e three eth they own one that's valued at 335 each so they definitely have like a portfolio that they collect 335 i mean that's like is that 900 000 yeah it's like a million dollars that's the set price for it i don't know if that's what it'll go for but that's the um wow that's the the list price that that's asked um so anyways this person won and they can sell it so they can just say cool i'm gonna flip it they can use it the way they use it is they send it to our wallet so they'll have to burn it by sending it to our wallet which takes it out of circulation and um and that's how we know you were the owner of it and you cashed it in all right let's um you want to talk about some you want to talk about harvard yeah we talked about this we hinted at it last time so let's do it i think you did a bunch of research yeah but i want you to you i want you to kick it off and explain to me why you uh got interested in this basically i i've known about this for a while so i launched trends because i read all about this and so i want to know what caught you i i think i brought this up on the podcast a little bit but what caught your eye you initially told me about uh the harvard business review in passing you just said something very very you're like i think they do like 100 million dollars you said something like that and um so that caught my eye this was maybe five years ago and at that time i like kind of stashed that away and then when we sold bebo one other thing i did a brainstorm of like when i started another thing and one of the things that always interested me was education education education education i was like okay well i like business i mean this is before the podcast even i was like i really like business and kind of digging into nerdy business stuff could i package that into a product it became this podcast but one of the ideas i had was could i compete with harvard business schools hbr kind of their media arm because what they do at the time i was looking into their case studies so what they do is if you ever go to business school and there's many business schools that do this they have kind of like case-based learning project-based learning basically and so you you go into class and you get this printed out piece of paper that says here's the scenario you're the ceo of sony and you're coming up at the new playstation and you're competing with xbox and right now sony's market share is going down and you need to figure out a way to get it to go up here's some of the background and it basically gives you a case to walk through and basically give your kind of like your two cents on what you think the strategy should be and all that good stuff and then the teacher has kind of like an answer key essentially it has the results of how things played out and what worked what didn't and kind of a guided discussion and so it's basically like the curriculum for a business school so i the reason i got interested in this because i was actually going to go start a company making these case studies focused on technology focused on on kind of like cutting-edge tech and either sell it to schools or sell it to companies who wanted to train their managers so that was my like idea i still kind of want to do that someday but i did back away from it when i realized that harvard really had a monopoly i think the stats at the time were that 80 of all the case studies all the business school case studies were harvard business school case studies and then the second thing was if you go talk to a professor i think i talked to two and i was like hey i'm gonna do all these great case studies it's gonna be so much better and they're like yeah but like uh what's that phrase like no nobody gets fired for buying ibm it's like nobody gets fired for buying the harvard harvard case study if i go by the sean case study um and if if anything is off about it um or even if it's good like it's just gonna have lower perceived value than the harvard one so actually i need to stick on the harvard sauce and i was like oh that's a problem it's the credential it's the brand of harvard not the content of the case study that really makes a difference so let me set the stage here and give some numbers to explain what we're talking about okay so every number i'm going to tell you is from 2019. all of these numbers are public so this isn't this isn't ideas or theories or rumors this is fact in 2019 harvard business school made 925 million dollars i'm going to rank in order where that revenue came from so 25 or uh yeah 25 percent right which around it jump billion basically just to make the math easy yeah well i absolutely we don't do public math 25 or around 250 million dollars came from endowment in gifts okay that's the second largest thing i'm gonna save the first largest for last the third largest thing 24 or around 240 million dollars executive education tuition we made from tyra banks for saying she went to harvard because she went to an executive education that's what she's talking about the fourth largest thing get this only 15 percent of revenue mba tuition right tuition is the fourth largest one the final two are harvard business school online so basically online courses which is five percent of revenue and then finally housing rents and other three percent so the biggest one their biggest revenue stream is 28 roughly 280 million dollars that makes almost two times what tuition makes what is that they're publishing arm right so they make money in publishing through a couple different ways basically a uh uh two or three they make a little bit of money through advertising but it's pretty it's nominal but they have 400 000 subscribers and subscribers pay anywhere from 10 to 50 a month depending on which package you get but the bulk of their revenue comes from the 15 million case studies they sell to around 4 000 universities now that number of around um let's say i think i believe the exact number is 262 million dollars in revenue how does that rank so let's put this in in in um perspective here the new york times i think probably the largest print publication or text-based publication in america revenue of 1.8 billion the economist another 100 plus year old brand 429 million harvard business review 262 forbes which has you know all they do is publishing 180 million fortune 100 and axios 58 million however amongst all of those harvard business review has the highest revenue per employee so they're the most efficient so 582 000 per employee so that that's some of the numbers shockingly big shockingly big it's shockingly big and uh so just to break that down into kind of the different categories so let's focus on hbr so what are their products they have the they have the the review they publish which is kind of like a magazine right essentially it's like a sort of like a smart kind of smart person magazine then they have the case studies what's the split between those uh case studies and subscriptions yeah uh well they sell uh about 15 million to 20 they they sell like 18 million case studies a year and they cost like uh 10 to 20 dollars a piece so if we round uh here i actually have the exact numbers they have um 400 000 subs and they sell 18 million case studies uh so i would imagine that of the 262 million dollars uh 200 million is from case studies wow um yeah so that's kind of unbelievable and that's basically recurring revenue because they're they have to pay for it each year yeah the way it works is your professor who's teaching so professors who are teaching at any mba they basically the the one of the four thousand universities in america they've given harvard their credit card and the professors just scroll through and they go click i want that oh i have 120 students therefore 120 times 20 that's how much i'm going to pay just click and bill it to the university and that's how it works right yeah i still want to compete with this actually now that you've brought this up again it just makes me want to go do this um so i i tweeted this out um i put this in my newsletter actually uh yesterday i go top universities are an amazing business imagine having hundreds of millions in recurring revenue through tuition or publishing a huge a huge like venture capital fund basically a huge fund not venture capital a huge fund which is their endowment you own your real estate and you pay virtually no taxes because you're a non-profit and so like i think harvard paid i remember reading this one year they paid um 12 million dollars in federal taxes on all that revenue that you said um because uh because they're you know a 501 with a 3c or whatever it is they're basically like you know they're a non-for-profit university and i think they just there was just some new bill that like now they have to pay some tax on their endowment so their bill went up to like 50 million which is still you know not very much for you know a billion dollar bill billion dollar a year um enterprise and well so check this out dude harvard's endowment is 40 billion dollars so let's just say that they get a seven percent return so that's a little bit less than four billion dollars right that they get an annual profit i would have to run the numbers but i believe i did this one time if they gave free tuition to all of their students and they only paid their bills with their endowment profits they would still net make a profit of a few hundred million dollars a year so like you have to keep in mind that harvard like you say you want to compete with harvard okay cool i hear you they have not infinite but close to as many res as much resources as you could ever possibly need to to build yeah so so what is harvard worth right like if you were going to value harvard how would you value harvard the same as nike or something like that i mean you have to look at what the multiples are for nike and interestingly if we did do if we just looked at the harvard business review revenue harvard business review had 262 million dollars in 2020 revenue if we added the same multiple that the new york times currently has it would be worth just the business school portion would be worth 1.2 billion dollars yeah oh sorry just the publishing arm of the business school right so just the publishing arm the media company would be 1.2 billion um would be valued valued at that right is that what you said yes and so uh the whole thing is probably 50 billion or more yeah yeah yeah i mean it's a lot and you one would argue that they're not exactly optimizing to make revenue and profit i mean i i don't i don't know too much about it but i would have to imagine that they're not like you know smacking the whip and telling everyone like you know we gotta improve margins right [Laughter] uh yeah it's kind of crazy so um and let me give you some more stats you know mit tech revie you'll see them floating around i recruited a person from mit tech review to work at the hustle and that person told me all about it and they were doing north of 20 million in revenue and it's archaic it's a very very old enterprise um colombia has a a popular one university of virginia is the second highest sale of case studies and get this here's another big one you know oxford press have you heard of the oxford university press they own the oxford review and they make books so they do close to a billion a year in sales wow from their book publishing from their book publishing yeah and case studies but lots of books all right so how would i do this sorry let's let's brainstorm with me so i think people get the idea that hey these are much bigger businesses than you would you would have thought what would you do if you wanted to go get some of this action if you said wow that's a lot of money being spent on let's just start with let's just take case studies well look you're stressed you're advising your buddy sean sean says you know what i think i want to do this but i don't have the angle what would you what would you say so i did this dude so my company trends the ones that i just sold we did this at the end of this year trends will potentially be a 10 million plus a year recurring revenue business so we did do this we built this exact thing and if i owned it and was trying to make as much revenue as possible i would start in knowing what i know now i would charge probably 10 times the price so i probably charge 20 or 30 000 a year well 10 to 30 000 a year and i would start in different niches and i would slowly start checking off the box and i would build this elite kind of scary brand you know something like a viacom or a blackstone something that has this like or like uh uh what's the university that starts the d darth dartmouth like something like kind of like cool sounding um i think um what's the what's the um research report okay here we go yeah our you know gartner we'll just call it like uh uh uh like uh i don't know i would have to look around and just like you know it's like your porn star nickname i'd be like your favorite piece of furniture right and you're like the hardest the hardest metal or rock surface near you okay granite and then like uh you know you know a word that means research yeah we're gonna call it like macklin inc like the street that i grew up on macklin inc and you start doing these like and you start do you hire sales people you know you do build like a gardener and then i would branch down and start hiring a few more pop culture centric writers and uh then i would and i would do a little bit more broad a little bit more broad one but you know this is what gartner did and gardner's has a significantly large business um and so that's what chrysonomics do this too you know about them they tried to but they didn't execute that well that doesn't mean the business sucks but they failed at executing it i think they ran out of steam or lost interest i see okay and what um you you sold to basically small business freelancers entrepreneurs agency owner types yeah dude and we have like you know over 20 or i don't you know tens of thousands of subscribers okay and we did that well but i'm an idiot because the reality is those same people would have spent a thousand dollars right now they spent three hundred dollars and so i [ __ ] up the pricing i should have charged either way more or way less so another way is i should have charged a hundred dollars or 99 and made that an impulse buy 300 which is what we charge that's not an impulse buy 99 is so you charge 99 for a couple small things then you have an upsell of two three four five thousand dollars and very few people buy that but you use the 99 dollar one as a get in the funnel that's what you should have done i did 2.99 that's that was a dumb so you you you have two two things you would have done differently one is the price point and then the other you're saying is you would have niched into certain categories and like really built those categories out what would what would be the first two or three categories oh i would probably uh let's see i mean it would have to be like what i know so i bet i could have done media pretty well i also think i could have done d to c and what i could have done is i could have gotten like the nikes of the world to give me twenty thousand dollars a year and they would have gotten two things one i would have published one or two case studies a month maybe four or five case studies a month on the latest and greatest ecom um like the d2c folks like who's who and who in the category is is crushing it why are they crushing it and then every single month i would host a digital or sometimes in person panel where i would go out and find uh you know the sean the sully and the ramone or the is like you know three or four young young companies that are crushing it and then all these gray-haired nike executives would want to come in and be like oh that's how you guys are doing it that's how you're thinking about x y and z and i would do that panel once a month and uh you guys would get free access the young guys but then the companies would have to pay 20 to 50 000 a year and then here's the third thing that i would do i would come up with a very cute graph or some type of signature thing where i rank and i have a ranking so i have a power ranking here's all the power rankings of the latest and greatest d2c brands that are under eight years old here's the best up and coming ones here are the incumbents the older guys here's the their power rankings and i would create some it wouldn't be [ __ ] it would be some type of legitimate ranking but i would come up with some proprietary thing and that's how my ranking would be and i'll keep that updated at all times right uh yeah i agree and i think you could do this right now in crypto that was a great idea by the way the idea was great it was great that would [ __ ] work that will work yes it was an absolutely great idea now i think you could do this in other spaces so i think you could do this in crypto why because there's a whole bunch of different brands yeah there's a whole bunch of big money industry financial players that will happily pay twenty five thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars a year just to be like uh explain this [ __ ] to me and tell me whatever would be way easier crypto would be way easier to sell than d2c because crypto is fear based so you want anything that's fear based exactly and it goes after the biggest wallets uh people who people who like it's one thing to say oh these brands are crushing it but if you know which tokens are crushing it which networks are crushing it you can actually make money off them and on the other side you're afraid of them if you're the incumbents that have huge wallets so i think that's why it's better additionally with crypto you've got all these guys like shawn and jack butcher who are spending 24 hours a day on discord and twitter and like studying and they're like oh kevin rose just tweeted this out and then you have some gray hair guy at morgan stanley they're like why do i care what kevin rose does and what the [ __ ] is discord and you're like yes exactly forget about it i'm just gonna spoon feed this to you like big name influencer just tweeted this likelihood of it getting big pretty high right you know what i mean yeah for sure um yeah so i think i think that's uh that's something by the way if somebody does this let us know there's a guy who reached out i gotta show you this there's somebody who reached out that said hey you guys were talking a while back i think i came on the pod one day and i had this idea i was like somebody needs to do bar stool for tech and um this person reached out and they're like hey you had this idea a while back i want to do it i'm actually pretty uniquely qualified to do it and he explained why like i did this i did this and i did this if anybody can pull this off it's me and i'm like actually that's actually pretty believable and um and so i'm gonna like kind of help this person you know think it through and maybe maybe launch this thing so i'm gonna share that with you but i love when ideas come to life with a legit operator by the way i also hate the exact opposite hey i love that idea would love to talk to you about it no no thanks yeah i'm just like just zero appeal in that one yeah i think it's far more appealing to someone say oh i've been working on this for three months i've made fifteen thousand dollars so far exactly okay let's talk i have a stock reply now which is like hey uh glad you like the idea you know would love to support but i i get a bunch of dms all about the same idea every time we release one of these so my rule is basically if somebody shows me that they're actually like there's a lot of people who talk about it very few people who do things if you end up doing something actually building a product getting some users or making some money definitely hit me up that'll get my attention and i'll happily help then but just for you know peace of mind i can't help everybody who just says that's cool i'd love to think about it dude that's so much nicer i'd just say let me know when you have traction that's usually what i say i also if someone comes to me saying they're considering working on x y and z or they say this was amazing i'm starting to work on it and then a month later they say this is amazing i'm starting to work on this other thing i say oh you are disqualified right you no longer think of him yeah you're one of them people you have no grit i do not want to talk to you about uh if you jump from idea to the project to project to project and you don't without like a really really good reason yeah you're done yeah i just have to i'm super guilty of that but i understand why you feel that way and i think you're correct um okay let's do some let's do some other let's do some other topics um let's see what else you got what you got something else you want to do no you lead you got something well i see this amazing thing i kind of want to talk about that and then there's another one let's let's do actually i think this one's more this one's funnier uh the topic on our sheet says maybe don't fake it till you make it it's like it's timely right so um i tweeted out i retweeted this story of this guy who was like hey you know the the elizabeth holmes the founder of theranos her trial starts today funny story i actually interviewed at their nose after all the scandal happened so that i thought that was kind of interesting because a lot of people that were like oh yeah i met her back when everybody thought they were hot [ __ ] it was a 10 billion dollar startup and she was the next steve jobs and i had this funny experience this guy's experience was all the news had come out and then a smart mentor of mine was like hey you should take a look at this role at their notes like this high-level exec role he's like they're joking and they're like no no like you know it's misunderstood and she's amazing you should talk to him and then like another person said he's like okay i guess at least i'll get a good story out of this so he flies there and he interviews with her and he like kind of tells this story i don't remember all the details it was an entertaining story you can find it on twitter and uh actually you can't because twitter search sucks but like yeah just take my word for it it's an entertaining story so the the topic here is like there's been a bunch of these i feel like that have like happened in the tech world lately and i think in the tech world there was this gospel of fake it till you make it yeah that's that's the cool way to go about things that's the hustler way and then you see things like ferret theranos you see nikola motors which was like this like fake tesla basically literally like took the name right like tesla was the inventor's last name nicola was his first name so tesla was successful so he names his company nicola and uh he claims that that's not why he did it but obviously it is why he did it um takes the company public via a spac it runs up to this like 40 billion dollar valuation and then somebody's like hey bro have you ever seen a nikola car on the streets and like no nobody's ever seen a truck of theirs ever and it's a questionable if it even exists they have like one video of their truck and it's basically like just going downhill it's like they just had a truck and they released the neutral the put it in neutral and just let it roll and they're like look electric self-driving truck and uh and so anyways you know eventually the ceo trevor milton uh has to resign he forfeits some of his stock but he gets away with billions still uh he's but he's charged by the doj with securities fraud this year and um and so you know he's gotta still get at his peak yeah like a 10 billion dollar fortune now it's a one billion dollar fortune but likely to lose it all my buddy worked at this company called head spin and was like he was like he had worked at a bunch of i won't say the name so i don't want to give him away but you know high profile tech company you've heard of high profile tech company you've heard of he worked at the pre-ipo and then he was like i'm a head spin this is the next one and he sent me a investor deck for it and it looked great i was like i should invest in this company like it's a sas company what headspin does is they like uh if you have a mobile app and you want to test it you want to see how does this work uh on a shitty android phone in thailand on low network conditions well like how are you going to sit in your office in san francisco and test that they basically had phones everywhere in the world in these like little like data rooms and they would run your app and they would report back how your app runs this is cool as a great idea and they would give you performance testing performance data benchmarked against your competitors in every every region on every phone on every every cell network and um and so they're at the time in their deck they had 100 million dollars of recurring revenue it's like oh this is clearly going to be a multi-billion dollar company uh fortunately i just for whatever reason didn't invest i just got busy and i forgot about it and um it came out that the ceo had just literally made it up so he's like just making up the revenue numbers and uh so he's you know charged with fraud the company's kind of like you know in disarray a little bit and uh he was just reporting false revenue and like telling all the kind of bookkeepers in the company like you know they're on a need to know basis about what they can know and hey if we're gonna raise money i need the number to show this my take on this is there's good news and there's bad news here the good news is most people are good and they don't lie there's amazing things that i've done just off a trust for example i've told you this i bought a car one time i just called the guy and i go hey you have it i'll take it and he goes cool just send me the money sent him the money and then just like i was hoping that he was going to deliver i do that all the time that works most of the time the bad news is is that these people exist and it's very easy to get away with this i mean get away with it for a little while you know most of time you're caught but it's really easy to lie and it's to get away with it for a while so how many of your startups how many startups have you invested in uh maybe 40. okay i've done probably 25 or 30. how many of them could be lying to you think and and like if 100 of them could be lying to me and i would not know and that's for two reasons i'll just explain why i'm going to be honest about this most people are not honest about this but great i didn't want to call you out and i i do the same thing but i i didn't want to call each other so i want you to volunteer most investors myself included do zero due diligence we do not we meet the founder yes we play with the product right those are the two easy things we we see if you know i can use your product that tells me something i can kind of just check twitter see do people talk about this is there good reviews about this product whatever and uh and i talked to the founder and i just see uh have you know were they like you know a drug dealer before this or did they work at google right does the stuff they're saying add up or are they saying things that just like you said this number last time now you're saying this other number which one is it um but do i go audit their financials no do i um audit their data room even if they send they don't usually even send a data room but even if they do do i go in there and uh look at the numbers no even if i looked at the numbers would i know that these numbers are real no these are they're self-reported no they're they're they're oftentimes a photoshop of their quickbooks yeah exactly and i i don't know if you mean photoshop as in uh edited or just sorry um a screenshot of their screen which could be photoshopped or their analytics tool and it's like oh what does active user mean it's like ah it's a lot of effort to figure out what the heck they're talking about here but you know directionally i can see what this is going so i do so little diligence most legit investors do so little diligence we are all banking on the fact that there's some angels out there i mean angel i mean i mean that's angel investor i mean like good good person on earth who actually does dig in and i know some of them they're rare and they only do it with a few companies um i i co-invest a lot with ankur from teachable and he does diligence and he'll send me ryan hoover does diligence like when i meet with a founder usually on the call within maybe 10 minutes i've decided yes or no whether i'm going to invest usually no but if it's yes it's like i'm in in principle i'll even tell them that i don't want to confirm i want to sleep on it but like i'm in in principle and the i want to sleep on it is just because i've learned the hard way that like my impulse investing is not always going to be the best so like there's no harm in letting it cool off and just digging in a little bit but like ryan hoover i send a lot of deals to ryan hoover he sends a lot of deals to me and he always is like great we're going to dig in and get back to you and that means they go they talk to customers of the product they use the product themselves they look at competitors i don't think they audit financials or audit metrics or anything like that i still don't think that they do that but um but they do more diligence than anybody than most other people i know who go off of cool if you're saying this i trust that what you're saying is factual and true and that you are not uh you know essentially lying and committing fraud so this whole fake it to the maker thing is what we're talking about and uh my point here is you it's so easy it would be it would be totally easy to do this yes intellectually speaking it's obviously you gotta go you gotta be you gotta be [ __ ] up and you gotta be willing to you know hurt folks but intellectually speaking this is very easy to do it's also easy to um and by the way if you're smart even if you looked into it it's easy to fake it so like i remember one one company we bought we did an investment in a purchase of we um looked at their google analytics we were like okay you're saying you have this much traffic let me see your google analytics dashboards they send us access we go in ourselves not screenshots we're looking google analytics okay all looks good and then i don't remember how this came out but we looked at the code of the website which again most investors don't even know how to read the code let alone are they going to take the time to go what do they they put their anal they put their analytics code on someone else's website no they had it on this website but they were multiplying it so they just doubled every event so if it said one user's here no actually two users were here so they just inflated by 2x i don't remember exactly if they just put two pit two they told the pixel to fire twice or they were doing something else but it was a multiply by two on their traffic and usage and i was like wow like you know [ __ ] do i need to go read the code or like you go use crypto am i really gonna know how to audit the smart contract no i don't know how to do that a handful of people on earth know how to do this and so there's a lot that happens that is trust and there's a sort of cost of doing business of getting into business with liars the good thing about silicon valley is it's unlike crypto and unlike you know some other other industries it is a long-term players game you you see repeat players in the game and so what that means is your incentive to have a good reputation matters now does it fully matter well no because if you could be adam newman and you could walk away with i don't know what he walked away with over a billion dollars i think out of the wework thing and maybe his reputation is tarnished but he's guys got a billion dollars now right the size of the prize makes it worth it to like flush your reputation for some people sometimes but at the early stages with early stage startups where i invest um you your your reputation matters more than what you can walk away with financially from that that round additionally i think that you you can actually screw your reputation but as long as you have a reputation as someone who turns one dollar into two dollars regardless of how big of a piece of [ __ ] you are you'll always be able to convince someone to give you money for example there's this guy named garbash i believe he started a company called radium one and blue lithium am i getting all these names right that's amazing if i am you got that one wrong uh it was something like that i think i think so my sister worked for him so i know i know this guy very well so give give the background of this this guy it's it's crazy fascinating this is actually great the guy's a young successful entrepreneur i think his first thing was like a he he got big in ad tech so he did like a tech company he sold it for like 200 million dollars and i think he you know raised very little so i think he owned a lot of that so he became 100 million he goes on oprah oprah's like wow you're amazing you're like a bachelor like wow any woman would want to be with you he's good looking yeah he's like he's like you know has some charm he's got a lot of confidence i don't think he's a good look he's got a lot of confidence he was very rich and successful at a young age and he would say very motivational things his instagram was all about you can do right like he was barack obama with the hope poster on his instagram so fast forward he does another another ad tech company but things start to go a little bit weird he ends up getting busted so there's a corporate weirdness and then there's a public weirdness most people only know the public weirdness the public weirdness is he got caught on tape kicking his girlfriend or beating his girlfriend he kicked her like 127 times on tape basically he had kidnapped he was charged with kidnapping he wouldn't let her leave the house like she was his girlfriend she was there they got to fight they got an argument and he he's he's assaulting her and the cops literally the footage is out there on the internet you go see this now cops take this footage he goes so he so he gets fired as ceo of i think radium one at the time or whatever whatever kind of like new ad tech company he had built that was like valued at 500 million to a billion dollars something like that he gets kicked out of ceo because like okay even though he hasn't been charged yet dude there's a video of you you know beating a woman on on the internet like you're not the ceo anymore and he's like i'm i'm innocent i don't know how he tried to say i'm innocent but he said trying to say i'm gonna say basically so he goes to court he ends up getting off because the footage was collected improperly like they collected the evidence uh in an improper way so you couldn't use it so even though everybody saw it everybody knew it he ended up getting charged for like uh kidnapping instead of assault or something like that like it was like you know something softer i i don't have all the details right but basically i remember there was some problem with the way the evidence was collected and so he goes you know has to do some public service and rehab he goes lays low for a bit but he comes back with a new company uh gravity four i think was the name of it i think and do you know nick sharma yes i think nick sharma what was his was was that nick sharm nick sharma was his assistant i think sharma was like his chief of staff i think i think it's his uncle um if i'm correct like blood uncle i think it's his blood uncle uh wow or relative in some way i i hope i'm not wrong on that but i'm pretty sure i am so basically so here's some other kind of inside stuff that i that i know so then so he's building gravity for and it's like in the ad tech space ad tech's very competitive space so my sister worked at a startup that was a different ad ad network platform they did like retargeting for a bunch of big brands like booking.com and whatever and they were doing all right but they go and they start to pursue an acquisition why because facebook's always changing the rules and today we're a preferred partner but tomorrow facebook you know might give that out to every agency or whatever my business is very fragile i'm super dependent on facebook and being one of these preferred partners and so they go out to sell the company and um i think they get some good interest they get some offers maybe it's from facebook google uh other ad networks whatever it is and uh gerbash wants to buy the company so this is what i heard so you know uh rumor birdie tells me no no i can't confirm any of this bertie tells me that he hears about this he goes to bid on it and he's a low bid uh he's not the winning bit and they're also like dude you're no way we would ever sell to you um knowing what we know about you and uh what he does is he goes and he basically gets he tanks their their prospects in the market how he basically goes and spreads fear uncertainty and doubt to the other bidders and he gets facebook to pull their their access or their privilege or whatever it was so he somehow gets them basically like he takes away their one like core business asset and like just ruins their ability to to sell the company and now they're like short on cash can't go raise money everybody knows they just tried to sell the company and it flopped for some reason and he goes and gets it for pennies on the dollar and like has a big falling out with the fact like you know not on good terms it's not a happy sale it was a fire sale and uh you know they got something out of it because they needed to get some value but like against their good against their will sell to gravity for it he's rolling up these ad tech companies and from the start he's saying in 18 months we're going to take this public we're going to go get 100 million dollars in revenue we're going to take this public it's like dude we have like no product we have like no team you're just buying these companies and we're supposed to like integrate them like instantaneously like you just bought five companies this month that none of them like are succeeding and they were supposed to make them all work and this was after he got caught this was after he got he got arrested twice i believe twice for beating two different women both i think both caught on camera what like blatant blatant horrible crimes this was after right and he's got like a bodyguard at the office like this huge bodyguard that travels with him everywhere he's got this like model like supermodel like like a 12 who just comes into the office and out that's his new girlfriend i guess i don't know what's going on there why would anyone work for this guy after completely erratic behavior and like on one hand like very ambitious inspiring and like you're seeing your shares go from one penny to he's saying we're gonna go public at a billion dollars so you're like oh [ __ ] okay we're gonna make i'm gonna make 10 million dollars if i see this out like i'm gonna make 25 million dollars if i see this out like okay maybe i should do that and the other hand you're like this is a house of cards like there's no like we we don't actually have like a stable product we haven't integrated all these acquisitions the revenue is a little bit flimsy because again like we're just rushing this whole thing through and then he got in trouble again and that whole thing fell apart and i think he's back now with another company like if you go look him up i think he's back again and that's my point which is you can have a horrible reputation but if you make money you will always be able to get money and i'm not saying that's good that's just what it is what did your sister do for him well she was at the company that got acquired by him uh by his company so then and so there was like a a temporary period where like the whole company went over there and then like i think within six months there was not a single employee left from the 40 that got acquired or 50 i don't know how many was like something like that there was like one person left um you know at the company by then why would anyone choose to work for this guy if they know that he is he's a piece of [ __ ] that that amazes me like i don't understand why you would continue to trust someone like that yeah so now he's doing something called vendor cloud he's got he says on his twitter profile three exits for 400 million dollars plus uh philanthropist and i think he i don't think he lives in a i don't think he lives in america anymore i think he like moved to bangladesh or uh which i forget where it says um hong kong hong kong okay yeah yes he's going for it again i i don't know and you know who knows who knows what the other side of the story is i only know one side of the story and uh yeah ben make sure i don't get sued from this bleep out whatever everything that we just said is is just a story and uh a lot of it was factual but we definitely could have gotten some of the facts uh incorrect yeah exactly but the story is like the story is like eight years old maybe or six years old it's not that recent yeah it's pretty wild dude go watch like the oprah video with him it's just it's pretty crazy yeah he was a a piece of [ __ ] so [ __ ] that guy that's what i have to say about that that's a fact we tried taking a piece of [ __ ] briefly we tried to edge so briefly that it's like no dude [ __ ] that guy like i think like maybe i didn't get all the facts right but i saw a video personally yeah my eyes saw this video yeah my my opinion is go [ __ ] yourself garbage or whatever his name is um all right what do we want to do now we want we want to wrap up or we want to do one more uh let's do one more thing you got anything quick no let me see one second let me look at my little my little stash file here of uh of i think did i talk about canva last time dude um just how it raised more money at a 40 billion evaluation or something yeah so dude okay so check this out um this is gonna be a bad segment because it's really all i'm gonna say in this is go read this go read this article but go go read this article so what i want you to do is just google canva journey linkedin um so what what what happened was the founder melanie perkins she uh posted on linkedin a kind of like she's pretty amazing and when i say full history i mean like details and i love details i love the art of the start and so like i want to share with you some of the things okay so what's the story with canva canva awesome product i use it it's basically like it lets you design things like marketing brochures infographics ads banners emails whatever without being a designer so you don't have to have design skills they have enough templates it's easy enough to just change photos and colors and text that like you'll get a good looking output without being a designer that's great because it brings a whole new group of people into the world of design all right so what's what's interesting about this so first they i think just raised a 40 billion valuation uh which is insane it's one of the most valuable companies to come out of australia and secondly this story is wild i actually didn't know a lot can you link to it link to it for me i don't like it i'm just going to tell you about it and then i'm going to i'm going to link to it i want you to just just hear me hear me tell it and then ask the story i ask questions all right so so basically um she was i think a design t a teacher or she was like teaching part-time at like a uh like a school for like design and art or something like that and um i think one the way they started was actually not with a product called canva it was with a product called fusion books and all they were doing was they're trying to solve the problem of if you ever put together like a yearbook or like a photo book it's like very hard to like lay it out and like oh i want this collage with like eight photos but i need them to fit right and then i want the background to look pretty and have a flower and then like you know page two i want it to be a big picture and two small pictures whatever right the layout of photo books so they created fusion books which is basically like software slash like um yeah software basically that that would that would make that easy and so they were like okay um they like they got they got a little money back from their tax return and like their part-time jobs and they were like all right that's our funding for fusion books and it's like you know you don't need a year to make a yearbook do it in minutes with fusion books and it's like the most like non-impressive looking startup ever and she doesn't just like what a lot of people do when they tell the story is they they what i say fast forward through the hard part it's like yeah we started with fusion books and then you know through after a couple years we started canva we realized canvas a better opportunity and what canvas is trying to do is empower design it's like blah blah it's like wait what happened to those two years so what i love about this post is it actually talks about those two years and so it's like a photo of her at some like trade show with her like fusion books yearbook thing and she's standing there like a dork behind the table no no people are at her booth and she's like smiling and she's like yeah this booth was a huge waste of money because like there were more exhibitors than attendees so that was a flop and then like she's like we didn't i didn't know how to code and like we didn't know how to find a technical person and so it's just me and my boyfriend trying to do this and like we convinced this one part-time engineer to do this but like here was the problems and like here's our printer we're literally printing books yearbooks for people and dropping them off and we're trying to go get every school to use us blah blah blah all right so they start doing all that and so at one of these um what's it called like i think it was like either a competition or like you know inventor of the year like uh western australia inventor of the year competition they come runner-up and she's like you know i'm wearing this dorky suit i'm holding this runner-up prize but at that event i met this guy named bill tai and bill ty is like a kind of like a famous investor in silicon valley he's definitely famous now because he was the seed investor of canva but he's done many many big deals i think you can probably google him and he's like he was a vc who just like happened to be speaking at the event and he gets there and he's like oh you know like they talk for five minutes and he's like hey if you ever want to like if you ever end up coming to silicon valley like let's meet up and she's like oh cool and then she does the thing this is the fake it tell you make that actually works it's not fraud till you make it it's fake it till you make it where she's like uh wants to meet up with him but doesn't want to be like hey bill i booked a flight to fly from australia to san francisco to see you so instead she says we have to be there i happen to be there this month like would you be free i would love to chat and like if he says yes then she'll book the flight and so he's like um he's like yeah sure you know happened to me and you should also meet this guy lars from facebook uh his ex google like you know you should meet him and she's like wow this is amazing and then she posts every step of the way she posts the full presentation that she made for him which i love because she released slide by slide the good the bad the ugly like this one's like the future of publishing dot dot is the cover and it's like fusionbooks.com.edu right it's like this shitty thing oh my god and um it's like she posts this pitch deck and like you know she posts like five of them in this blog post like you can see the evolution all the way to canva um so she goes to meet with bill and uh and so she's like uh she's like google's like how to dress at a silicon valley investor meeting it's like you know just just get comfortable you know just look smart casual you know um you know you don't have to dress up too much so she's like okay i'm not gonna wear my like woman pantsuit tracksuit thing i like my power suit um she's like wore like you know business casual and then she gets there and he's like oh you don't you didn't need to dress up for this by the way and she's like [ __ ] i thought i was dressing down she's like i'm i started off the meeting just like totally mortified and um you know whatever and so then she's like you know i presented him this pitch deck and um you know um you know he's just like i'm explaining the future publishing and he's like cool like do you have a ipad or an iphone she's like no you're like you're telling me the future of publishing and you don't own an ipad or an iphone and she's like uh [ __ ] but she shows this slide and her thing and it's so funny dude you'll see it when you when you get there so i'm gonna send you the link now scroll down to where you see this cartoon character it's like clipart cartoon character and it says fusion books and it's right by the finish line and there's a trophy at the end of the finish line that says the dominant online publishing system that's the trophy for winning and then behind her you see two cartoon characters of google docs and microsoft office like falling behind falling over and fighting each other and it's like basically she's saying like we're gonna beat google docs so we're gonna beat microsoft word and so even at this point where she had like terrible name terrible design didn't know how to dress didn't know how to pitch in oh my god yeah didn't have an engineer she had the like the um the thing that is like porn to investors which is the ambition to say we're not just building yearbook software we're gonna beat google docs in microsoft office and like if you're crazy enough to say that an investor will listen to like the next three lines you say to be like oh you're just delusional or actually maybe this person is crazy enough to pull something like this off so what was the turning point so then she she hits uh so so there's like a long period of time where um where she's trying to find an engineer so bill's like i'll invest in you if you can bring on an engineer that this guy lars this facebook google guy i'm introducing you to he's an engineer if he approves of the engineer i'll back you because then i think you have the software skills to pull this off so she goes to lars she's like hey can you introduce me some engineers and he's like you know what like yeah but it's hard to introduce your engineers how about this if you find engineers i'll screen them for you so she finds like 20 engineers he screens all of them and just thumbs down initial screening and like no matter how good she thinks the engineer is he's like not even close and she's like oh my gosh she's getting demoralized because like bill's not going to invest unless lara signs off on the engineer and lars like i don't know what the hell he wants but he's just not signing off on any engineer and so this goes on for like a year and so then she like hustles like crazy bill ty is famous for kite surfing she had like kind of kite surf so she's like [ __ ] it i'm going to become a kite surfer so then she's like hey billy i was just kite surfing and he's like oh you should come to come kite surfing with me so she like gets in with him again until like oh my god completely not the way i would advise anyone to do this like just chasing one investor like this but whatever this is her journey and uh and so then she and then she posts this thing where she like uh talks about it she's like uh she's like i was so down like as large as rejecting investor engineer after engineering she writes this note to herself and she posts it she goes mel you're extremely tired you're in a challenging situation though you could pull through nothing bad is really happening but you're feeling depressed because you are used to achieving things quickly this is a hard environment and there's no doubt you will succeed you will find the team that you need you'll get the investment that you need and you will build the company you always wanted you have chosen to put yourself in a challenging situation if it wasn't challenging that you wouldn't feel satisfied when you get to the end goal and i love it like she was like you know writing herself these pep talks and she posted it which is like you know kind of vulnerable to do um anyway she looks exactly the same now like she's handled this woman she's a ceo right yeah so she's been through hell building this business she looks totally the same now it looks like the stress did not bother her that's crazy i'm looking at these photos i'm like but in these photos are 10 years old she looks exactly the same yeah i love this woman so she goes okay so this so then she finally okay let me just fast forward something she finds the engine laura's like hey this guy is like the best engineer i've ever worked with you should uh you should hire this guy she's like oh man amazing this guy's already pre-screened so she talks to him the guy's like interested um but he's like oh i got my own startup right now and i have a team of six i just can't do it so she just checks back in like three months later she's like hey how about now and she checks back again three months later he said hey babana and one of those times he's like yeah you know what let's do this and so he says let's do this she's like oh that's amazing blah blah blah let me fast forward this story because you should really just go read the post but i have it up this is amazing there's a whole bunch of things like she posts every um invest like a bunch of investor rejection letters which is just like uh sorry i just don't feel comfortable investing in australia or like you know would love to stay in touch um it looks like we're gonna have to sit and wait this one out or the valuation's too high or you know it's pre-launch or you know whatever i don't think the timing is quite right and she's just like you know whatever we just kept kept going kept going kept going and then um and so she recruits this guy out of google she like makes them google almost retains them and she puts the presentations like you know this is i don't know his name but let's just say sam's greg this is greg he worked at google he had a great life but he started to get bored started to wonder is there more for me out there and each one of these is one slide this is like a little flip book it's like he thought to himself what if i could go and help you know a small team where i could bring my expertise and do this what if i could bring the power of design to like a billion people on earth what if i could do this wouldn't that be better than just sitting at google for another five years but then google said oh we need you greg but then remembered google's gonna keep googling whether he goes there or not but canva may not if if he doesn't join or whatever see you know he makes his pitch and he's like oh i love it you know you really like made me feel special so like i'll do this so i feel like it just showed a lot of the grit and the hustle and it did not fast forward the ugly part to the point where i'm like dude get to the canva part like what is all this but it's like yeah that's probably how it imagine if i'm feeling amazing imagine how she felt living this for three years or whatever it is and then yeah like you know they launch it it takes off it's like you know super successful and um you know it's a 40 billion dollar company now so happy ending at the end of that one yeah and i think her i don't know if she was dating or if she's now married after they started but her and her co-founder are married and so dating then married now i think so it's pretty badass they have two times the wealth now um this is a good ass story i missed this i don't know how you found this i guess you found this on twitter uh it's on linkedin which is funny at it and somebody sent uh ishan who used to uh who used to get my original podcast because he's australian yeah he's australian and i have him in a slack channel with me still and uh where we just post cool links and so he posted this one he's like damn this is actually really good this is amazing this is a good find this is totally badass all right that's it for today uh good episode i think i know what do you think how do you think that was dan how was it the uh the harvard business stuff is uh really cool i really liked that segment all right we'll see i think that was well researched we'll see we uh we took oh by the way we gotta give a shout out to mario what's mario's last name mario gabel or something like that yeah he's actually i actually stole a ton of information from him so good job mario mario gabriel sorry he's badass he has a the generalist is his uh newsletter that's right so that was awesome all right that's it all right we're outtie see i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back

i think if you're starting a media company and if i started it again if you didn't go subscription first you're an idiot and you're a fool i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i [Music] all right we're live um so did you see i uh got ariel helwani to agree to come on i know good job how'd you do that a friend a good buddy of mine is like best friends with him and i just begged him your uh your outreach i had never seen you try so hard normally you're pretty cool about things i don't think you really care with too many people but i could tell you wanted this one i did i uh so basically eric for the people listening there's this guy named ariel hawani he's got a million followers on twitter so he's not like that niche but basically he's like the god of mma journalism and the reason why he's interesting is because he just quit espn where he was probably making close to a million dollars a year as a host and he created a sub stack his own podcast and he's kind of building like a little media media empire yep and uh so we'll have him on and talk about that yeah and you know the thing that's interesting about him was he's been in it for a while so like you have this phrase i think you've said like niches get riches basically which is like yeah a lot of people are afraid to go into a niche market and is it niche or niche by the way i have no idea both can work okay good so you know a lot of people are afraid oh is this too niche and i think you have the opposite reaction which is tunish fantastic um at least that's my my understanding you tell me if that's that's right or wrong well it's the the two things one when you when whenever you start doing something it's definitely better to start for a very small group of people in a very small niche and corner that or at least get big in that and then expand or the second thing is you can stay in a growing niche and grow with but you know start your start your business on top of a huge wave for example twitch video game streaming super small niche they never expanded really right it's still the same thing from david we've tried but it's still you know dominant where it's just gaming yeah and that niche has just they're in it it just is no longer really a niche or you have like an amazon only books and then you dominate that and then cds and then this and then this and then this so yeah i think starting small is always the way to go or is often the way to go yeah i think in ariel's case what he did was um i know he's a fan of i kind of want to ask him this he's a fan of the nba like he's a big basketball fan but he didn't go for journalism basketball journalism which would have been a more obvious safe choice instead he went for mma which was like this fringe really niche sport that you know it was kind of like you know john mccain in new york is calling it human [ __ ] fighting it's like not allowed in certain places yeah and so it wasn't really like a very safe choice but he was the only dude doing it it felt like it was like you know you can go back you know 15 years basically and you see clips of him talking to people backstage and just budget production value but he was like the guy covering this regularly and because of that he's got like deep relationships deep respect amongst the fans to the point where even though dana white who's the president of ufc hates him and has banned him from like ufc events um he's still the number one journalist so imagine you know like this guy that roger goodell the commissioner of the nfl just hates and bans from the game still being the number one you know journalist for for the athletes that's kind of uh unusual and so yeah he's an interesting dude with a cool story yeah i'm excited to have him i i actually think that i i think that it's gonna it'll be a hit with our listeners even the people who aren't into ufc i think it's gonna be a hit but i am a fanboy so we'll see yeah that's all good can i tell you about a business that is built on trust that i'm obsessed with at the moment okay go for it all right have you heard of examine.com no what is examined you've never heard that okay can you go to your computer now you have okay i'm at it let me go there all right so do i tell you what i see yeah okay i go to examine.com and i thought it was gonna be about books or something no it says nutrition information you can trust and then it's just like a giant kind of like google search bar it's like uh like for example oh it's perfect actually my trainer was telling me about ashwagandha i see ashwagandha i uh i've been taking that for eight days now great so it's a supplement and so i go here and i guess the idea would be hey there's gonna be a lot of if you google this you're gonna find a lot of information but we are a trusted source we do the research we put the pros and cons here we make it easy to understand is that the idea yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna summarize this so the reason this interests me is i have a friend named seoul s o l orwell he's a good buddy of mine i've never even met him but we went to a bunch of conferences and we were in the same room and we never met up but we became friends and um he's a great guy and i just met him as a guy and then i saw his business and it's called examine.com and what it does is they do a few things so first they get about 40 000 visitors a day and they get those visitors by having this free content so what you're looking at where it examines that supplement ashwagandha but the model in which they make money is that they have a membership that membership has supplement guides and then they also have a thing where they look at all the recent studies and they summarize it to tell you exactly what you need to know and it'll say this is a strong study and the conclusion is this this is a not great study and the conclusion is this and you shouldn't you should avoid it and they do that with all types of studies and basically the what the company is and i'll explain why i think this is a big deal but basically they take knowledge that's locked up or complicated to understand and make sense of it into a really easy to understand uh way and so they have i'm gonna give you some stats 40 000 visitors a day 20 employees seven figures in revenue 50 000 people have signed up for their membership or um bought some of their guys and that's only been around for about two years the guides have or the membership and so uh they made money by selling guides and so i bought this supplement guide they have one on like i have like uh panic attack problems that i'm trying to fix and they have guides on it it listed all the it said here if these six supplements have been proven by clinical trials to help with panic attack and it lists them all and it says take this one if you don't feel anything in two weeks pair it with this one and then pair it with this one and they tell you and they go and when you buy it make sure that it's magnesium not magnesium oxalate like they tell you very specific stuff and i think this business is amazing it's amazing because they've spent years building up trust so men's health dr andrew huberman do you know who that is he's that guy who has a youtuber he talks about health stuff he's like kind of going viral right now just on joe rogan and tim ferriss they all saw everyone's sites examine.com new york times sites examined.com they've spent years building up trust every word that they write is very meticulous now they're starting to monetize and this model i actually think it's amazing and i didn't at first i was like there's no way this can be a big idea but there's this company called up to date you've probably never heard of up to date if you're listening and you're a doctor you probably have heard of this and so it's basically examined.com but for doctors i mean it's been around before examine.com so examine.com is that for nutrition in this business doctors pay i believe 600 a year and they get the same exact thing they get access to a content database that very explicitly and clearly says which clinical trials are proven which are not and what the conclusion is and then uh summarizes a bunch of stuff guess how much money that makes a year uh i think a lot i think i think probably i mean i'm just looking at up to date and i think it has 15 you know similar web shows about 15 million visits a month so uh that's pretty impressive i would guess okay i'm going to go high ah no i'm going to go low it's always fun to be blown away so i'm going to say 50 million a year so the estimate is closer to 500 million dollars a year in subscription i'm blown away just as i hoped with my low because isn't it isn't it shitty when you're trying to yeah when you're trying to blow someone's mind and then they estimate over it you're like well okay not not that much but it's still cool it's like god damn goddamn it like you know that should just be a rule amongst friends if i ask you to ballpark something you know let me let me blow you away and the company that owns this does the same thing for finance tax and accounting i believe and that whole company is publicly traded it does like 5 billion in sales a year crazy business model and i'll tell you why this is interesting to me this is interesting to me because i love content businesses i love them there's a huge problem with content businesses which is they suck at making money if you're gonna make money in the most traditional way of banner ads or some type of buzzfeed style native ads i [ __ ] hate that this model i love i think that you could use this model for a bunch of different categories including skin care including beauty i think that would be the next the the easiest one according to seoul what do you think about this business it's pretty neat right genius yeah uh so up to date makes total sense uh yeah like i am i'm surprised i haven't heard of it i am not surprised something like this exists and works it just makes all the sense in the world examine.com also very very cool and i think sort of like if if up to date is kind of like a b to b examine is kind of like a a b to c where it's like you know the average person who's just curious like you i'm curious about panic attacks i'm curious about ashwagandha i'm curious about you know whatever l-carnitine and you know i hear about it i hear some buzz but i'm trying to be like smart and safe about things where do i go that's not just trying to sell me [ __ ] and not just trying to like print page views as like a content form and so i think that trust is uh you know like sort of like one of the only things that matters you know like world of abundance and that's where we are we're in a world of abundance and so trust is like one of the key uh these things and examine.com their rule is they don't uh recommend any brand so you can't find any brand on their site if they say take magnesium oxide i was like sol just tell me like which brand so i could just buy it on amazon he goes no we can't tell you that you got to go and figure that out because wait for the day we start doing that is the day we start like incentivizing the wrong [ __ ] so it's a pretty amazing business model you know who else does this is consumer reviews so consumer reviews you probably don't use anymore a lot of people who are younger or my age and younger don't use it anymore so consumer reviews it's wirecutter but they charge a subscription that company it's actually a non-profit so you can actually look up their revenues their revenues uh they charge a subscription revenue what did i say consumer review consumer report yeah consumer report it was around it was a round before wire cutter i prefer wire cutter now but consumer report is pretty amazing they charge subscription revenue they still do like 120 million dollars in subscription revenue and they're telling you like the best tv the best microphone the best computer and they crush it yeah so let me just uh consumer reports subscription newsstand and other sales 20 in the year 2020 they did 212 million dollars in subscription revenue crazy right subscription revenue that's insane 245 million overall uh overall revenue in 2020 insane i think if you're starting a media company and if i started it again if you didn't go subscription first you're an idiot and you're a fool and you're a masochist and you like pain if i if i could do it all over again knowing what i know now i would only start that way and it's totally the i think it's the best business model clip it uh all right yeah that's a good one i like that a lot you've talked about this on like consumer reports for other things right so you've talked about it for sas tools um and then some people have tried that g2 and and others uh have tried that what do you think about that what's your latest thinking on that because you've been thinking about that idea for a while i think it's an amazing idea and someone could still do it g2 has raised another round of funding uh at like a multi-billion dollar evaluation i think i think it still could be done there's a company called j2 global have you heard of j2 global no all right look up the stock of j2 global right now for me i i i act like i'm setting you up i actually haven't looked at it in a while uh is it good okay so j2 global um all right it's trading at 130 a share the market cap is 6.3 billion dollars and uh yeah you know like sort of year to date it's almost double so j2 global what they do is they own a handful of publications including i i gn mashable pcmag um offers.com and one or two more but basically they make the bulk of the revenue i believe from suggesting which software to buy in pc magazine and that's how they make most of their revenue and it's a publicly traded company new look it all up so i think this model can still crush it i think pc magazine is pretty much garbage g2 is okay um right but anyway i think it's a really big business that so many people are sleeping on and uh you know what else could you do this sort of trust trust model for so i have i have one idea but i'm curious what else comes to mind for you skin care and beauty that's what i i think it could be done with skin care because there's there's an ocean of there's an ocean of brands and you kind of care about you know the problem i think with that is you don't have fear so there's this one really good thing about supplements and medicine is that there's like a fear component to it right like i don't want to actually like die or get side effects from this thing or have a you know sort of a big problem occur because of the potential benefits of something whereas with skin care i think yeah you might break out or you might just want to know which one's better but it doesn't have that fear component where people are going gonna look it up and say before i buy this i've really gotta check and so i think that's one of the keys um you know there's like which one of these dishwashers is best i think that's a consumer reporting it's like i don't wanna research this like oh these guys test this for 5 000 cycles and they tell me which one lasts the longest and works the best like okay that's great i was never going to do that myself um you know i think that's one version where it's like tires which tire is the best tire to get which refrigerator is the best refrigerator to get and then on the other side there's the fear one like supplements medicine sort of like alternative medicines what's what's gonna happen from those i think those are two like especially good categories and i think the difference of choosing the right category versus the wrong category is a multiplier of like 10x 10x or 50x of your outcome i i would imagine you could do the same for physical therapy so the reason physical therapy is interesting so basically i've had a injured achilles for about a year now and i've been researching like crazy and if you search achilles tendonitis there's loads of different stuff and i've been reading so many studies and what my conclusion now is this there's only one way to fix your achilles tendonitis and that is to do um well no no it's rest but it's to do six sets of 15 achilles like a eccentric drop down so what that means is you stand on a curb or a step and you slowly let yourself fall and then you uh kind of step up and then slowly and if you do that and i read study after study it's almost like been unanimous that if you do this for three months every single day your achilles tendinitis will get better and i had to dig so deep for that and i think that something like this could exist for physical therapy and injuries and things like that right yeah yeah i i kind of agree with you right now my mom has this like she had vertigo but then it kind of went away but she still feels symptoms and the doctor's like uh you don't have vertigo she's like no no i get that but what do i have i have something this is not right and they're like uh blood work looks fine and then she has to call back like hey i know the blood work looks fine but i'm not right yeah what do i do they're like ah go to let's do an mri same thing and then it's like finally okay do these like do this physical therapy so she literally walks around the house with a piece of paper in front of her that has like a letter on it so her eye has to focus on it and she moves it to the right while she's walking and then moves it to the left while she's walking dude is this the exercise like maybe it is if it is fantastic but where how do we know that this is it and that there's not like a much faster better way because previously when she had vertigo um that was like vertigo proper she went to three doctors and nobody knew what to do the fourth doctor was like oh lay down and he like shook her head like vigorously and it's like this known cure and basically like loosens up the crystal in the inner ear or whatever and she was like fixed in 10 minutes and she's like wow like if i just hadn't come to see you how many more months or years would i just had vertigo that's like a pretty scary thought yeah i think that could work or here's another thing do you know ky you know anything about chiropractory i know i know what most people know which is like uh skeptical skeptical hypo eyes as our boy brandon chomp says and i didn't know that i thought sorry to chiropractors or chiropractors uh fans out there but basically chiropractor it was invented by a guy i forget his name but he was like a snake oil salesman he was full of [ __ ] and he thought that like i'm gonna someone's gonna correct me because i'm kind of getting it wrong but basically like there's like evil spirits or something in you and if you just if you adjust the spine it releases it now some chiropractor like can help very little like but ninety percent like ninety percent of what chiropractors what we think they do you you can't adjust your spine and like your headaches stop like that's just not how your body works but it's nonsense right also the the acceptance rate of chiropractor school is a hundred percent so like and it's like it's like it's like a google adsense certification it's not like you know what i mean i know i'm gonna get flack for this and yes there are some chiropractors out there a lot of it though is nonsense and i i think an examine.com can exist for all types of parts of the body so anyway that's my idea on xamarin.com i thought it was interesting i'm a bit obsessed with it i'm currently on a vitamin regimen and i discovered it on there i thought it was cool you want to do another one yeah okay so let me give you another trust as a service so this is just like a i'm calling this my two dollar blue collar side hustle right now which is here's a side hustle that will make you some bucks it's not going to be a huge business probably it's not even maybe going to be around five years from now but i think right now it's a thing you could do so um are you big on did you order a lot of food because i'm a door dasher right like i am i do but not but not like you you do like every meal well i i got a chef now but even with the chef there's still you know two to two meals a week where i'm like let me just fire up the door dash and see what happens dude it's so expensive it hurts me and so when when you get your meal they all have this like sticker on it now that says safety sealed and it's just all it is is like you know normally it's like in a bag and they would like tie the bag in a knot and now they like sticker it to show like no human like the food went in and then we sealed this [ __ ] because there's like viral videos of like door dashers eating the food eating food coughing in the food i don't even know what the fear is it's just like i can't lie when i see the sticker i'm like good i'm glad they sealed it like good i'd rather be sealed than not sealed that's for [ __ ] sure and there wasn't even a thing i was thinking about before but somebody is out there selling branded safety seal stickers to restaurants and i just think that in general there's gonna be a whole wave if you just said i'm gonna sell trust and safety as a service i'm going to sell it to every business that needs to reassure its customers that it is taking coveted safety protocol seriously and then you can you can dial that knob up to level 12 of like chiropractory where you're like i'm just gonna mail these to everybody they yeah put it on your self honor code this is honor code system you know like just just put this sign up in your in your restaurant uh put this mat on the outside of your thing put this on every door knob hang this on every doorknob uh you know stick put the sticker on every cup you know whatever um you could just send it or you could actually like go out and verify and say hey here's our five point you know safety inspection and we send mystery shoppers out or whatever we like actually create kind of like a zagat reviews type of of sticker or seal of approval specifically for trust and safety around covid that's the general idea what do you think i love it and i'm gonna show you an example of of something similar to this have you heard of uh i think it's pronounced lead l-e-e-d leed certified the like green buildings thing yeah so i was looking this up so it's a non-profit so you could easily see their sales so that that wow they do uh i think this is i i'm almost positive it's run by a company called the u.s group it's not a company but a nonprofit u.s green building council and i think they is that it do you know no but uh yeah i believe you and they do 31 million dollars a year in sales and basically i have no idea what the i have no idea why buildings are incentivized to do that but i imagine the business model is such where you pay led lead i guess is what is what it's called and oh here dan says he's a former accredited professional for lead so okay on a scale of one to chiropractor where is lead certification it's nowhere near chiropractor it's legit and uh you are a lead accredited professional what the heck does that mean did you pay for the first did you pay for this accreditation my company my former company did yeah okay so somebody paid for you to get certified and then you charged other companies to go give them the stamp of approval is that right yeah so as a professional you get like one point towards the point total you need to become a lead building and then there's like a silver gold platinum scale and it's [ __ ] like you know you use the right kind of light bulbs you use the right kind of insulation that sort of thing when you're building your building right or renovating yep stuff like that um air quality indoor air quality which is really bad normally low use water things like that no smoke you sound like a lead professional right now bro i feel like i'm getting lead certified as we speak why does the building care about getting lead certified look good that's a good question yeah i think it's a little bit of uh just wanting to be green but there's no incentivized incentivization dude the government does the government like give you anything or is it simply just for branding and awareness i don't know it's been 15 years since i took the exam so i'm uh a little out of pace on it but i'm not sure if there's a big incentive for it dad how old are you i'm 35. you did this when you were 20 you were a 20 year old lead certified might be around a little bit i think i was 22 when i took it okay um more importantly i got a lead certification go to my twitter profile real quick just see what you see there dude [ __ ] that i think you're the worst that is so lame so did you be verified so lame are you kidding me john got verified he's got a blue check mark i think that is the lamest dude you are not one you're not a man of the people anymore you're so out of touch i'm used to [ __ ] on uh ah i don't need that i don't need that you know what what does that mean anyways who cares about that anyways you know i actually prefer not to ha and now that i have it all that all that [ __ ] is out the window i am so glad why did you get it so glad i got the blue well i got it for like actual legit reasons like first i was just i wanted it for my ego for many years when i was you know whatever didn't happen who cares but then people started actually like uh impersonating me and scamming my followers so they were all these accounts get created every month and they would go dm my followers like hey yeah what's up and people like oh hey thanks for the dm like no problem you know i saw you follow me um you know what are you doing with your portfolio lately and they would scam them into either sending them crypto or buying random crypto [ __ ] coins or they were um getting them to like buy stocks or like send them like send them money to go like invest in their like they like pretended they were my fund and so people were actually like you know it used to just hurt my feelings that i wasn't verified but then it was actually like hurting other people and so i was like dude what the [ __ ] i was bitching about it yeah and uh i get i get that prize i get that but that's the only reason i'll accept i think every other reason is [ __ ] i don't i think they're stupid what's that it's a little jealousy i'm smelling i i don't know like i think you kind of want the blue check mark too i think the people on twitter twitter need to help you out i think i'm i think i'm barely famous enough to get it but i i will not get it i'm not you have crypto tell me right now you push a button and you could just have it or not have it no no nothing else just push this little key on your keeper you tell me you wouldn't push that button i give you my word i will not push that button wow but but if i am not if i end up having scams like you then yes but i've not had that i've not had that problem yeah it became like a legit problem uh anyways so okay lead certification so yeah basically i think i think lead is another good one like i would love if somebody just took on lead and just called it like you know green home oh you oh you're you're a green home triple star wow [Laughter] doesn't that sound good already yeah and like again you could turn the knob however like you can go super legit if you really like find ways that you could kind of score buildings um or you could like be somewhere in the middle and you know build scam but like dude i would do that trust as a service is a great business i actually think that the health department's scorecard is [ __ ] so i had a hot dog stand i mean duh uh i talked about that you told that story yeah yeah you know i don't drink either um and uh when they when they did my health certificate certificate like i just bullshitted through it like hardcore and like i mean my [ __ ] was clean but like they had all these boxes we had to check and it was [ __ ] but in the day that we were doing it i actually was wearing flip-flops and they gave me a 95 instead of a hundred and so like i think it's kind of not gross toes out while you're making hot dogs yeah nobody wants we're outside in 100 degrees selling meat that's been sitting there for like you know what i mean like forever like it's it's [ __ ] disgusting anyway it is super just i worked so without my first thing was a sushi restaurant and we had a comment we worked out of a commissary kitchen which is like a it's a central kitchen where like caterers and bakers it's like a kitchen without a storefront so in there was all the food truck guys and so you so in that i saw the hierarchy of like degeneracy it's like caterers okay so like bakers bakers are good people bakers are nice women who uh care about their product and they do a great job and they're very hygienic and then caterers are like kind of like they're like bakers they're they're legit but you know the the neat the demands on a caterer are so high it's always high urgency they're preparing for a 200 person party or whatever so you know they're kind of get [ __ ] done they'll cut through the red tape but you know you you respect their decisions then there's the [ __ ] food truck guys food trucks guys they think this is a bar they're just drunk while they're prepping their tacos they're pretty disgusting and then you have the hot dog guy at the end this guy straight up okay so there's like a sink and if you don't know what a three compartment sink is you haven't paid your blue collar dudes but basically a three-compartment sink is like kind of where you do the dishes in a commercial kitchen and like the three three compartment sink is just literally it's full of like the dirtiest dishes and just a chemical bomb you put in there to like clean them and the [ __ ] hot dog guy in our comfort kitchen would just go and he'd just fill up the sink with the hot dogs that he's gonna be selling like three hours later he'd just be throwing the hot dogs around there washing them dry you know put them in the other sink to dry off and it's like this guy there was zero and i literally i don't think i've had a hot dog since uh because i saw how the sausage was made and i you know never want to see it again so that's my public service announcement don't eat me yuck i agree i was clean i mean i kept myself clean but i can see why most don't you can get you don't have to you can just get away with it it's not even counting what's the meat i'm not like forget the meat let's say the meat was pure the way it's handled disgusting so i think you could build a new version of of a health department score actually i i actually think that's legitimate how many other can we just do this like okay i'm bullshitting about twitter right now could you just do this where it's like you have a con you have like a content score like you know just like how uh you know either like how like you know uh safe and kind of like non-offensive your content is like maybe it's something that's like you know it's around your cancellation you know what we should do you know interestingness or your fan score like how much your fans care about you are we just [ __ ] like your engagement score but we make it really visible it's like sam he may not have the most followers but his followers love him it's like we make your q score yeah you know what qq is it's like a popularity ranking uh we just make some it's oh you haven't heard this q score it's like a thing for celebrities yeah it's a thing for like a hollywood celebrity it's like what's your what's your popularity kind of like it's not an approval rating it's like your popularity rating how how well do people know you and like you know obama has a high q score and oh yeah i feel like you could do that on social media with clout but just like [ __ ] the whole thing yeah i i i think that's crazy and i think that's good klout score i actually think clout was amazing so clout was a company that was around it was spelled k-l-o-u-t uh they had like a hundred employees they raised a lot of money they ended up selling for a hundred million dollars i think it was like a hundred million dollars of stock in a privately held company like i don't think it was actually that kind of an exit but they um great idea clout early you were just too early amazing idea way too early amazing idea if it were around now it would be the best somebody restart clout and just dm us i thought it was it was a great branding and people still to me make jokes about clout like they'll be like oh i got to create that cloud score i know what they're talking about i had a cloud score and basically what happened i mean my cloud score wasn't that great i had like five thousand friends on facebook though and so i qualified and so maybe the fact that you're justifying it shows how good of a hook this is how much i would use it all the time mcdonald's would send me a five dollar gift card once a month right um yeah like amazing it was it was so cool i loved clout so i think that could exist and i think that could that could kick ass um i think this is like yeah i think there's a lot of time i don't even think you really need to do that much differently right like there's i'm sure there's like 20 of things you would tweak uh maybe in the execution like you know maybe you don't have to raise that much money i think the timing is the biggest tweak that you needed to make maybe you change the way it's calculated or the way you promote it or the business mod whatever i don't think you need to change that much i just think that the time the time is now and like as donald trump basically created this thing called fake news i think fake news is very underrated how like big of a wave that actually was created how much distrust there is around around brands and entities now and so people are kind of like the atomic unit of a brand at this point and so yeah i think that uh that cloud cloud should be remade how about the fact that so hubspot has a hub so this one woman who works with me just got scrum certified and we paid five grand it was five thousand dollars or four thousand dollars and i'm like so scrum i i don't even know what it is i guess it's just like a um a project management uh yeah that's how you manage like engineering sprints yeah and we paid five grand and i was like who the heck like is the scrum like decision maker and then i realized hubspot scrum master by the way is it really oh my god it's much more like legit that it probably really is hubspot has hubspot certification courses and if you look on people's linkedin they they brag about passing hubspot certification courses we gotta talk i gotta talk to us i'll be like how did i'm like look like you guys are amazing and wonderful and legit but like you weren't always amazing wonderful and legit you were just starting out and you somehow convinced people to trust you and take this seriously right how on earth did you do that because that's amazing so they paid hubspot so the so hubspot is the collector of the 5000 dues for the scrum training no sorry there's a different organization that does scrum but hubspot you've never seen people brag about their hubspot certification so like if you google hubspot search certification they've got like these classes people if they tried to brag to me about that so so that's an immediate block so there's like inbound sales hub stop marketing software inbound marketing and if you google people if you google like that and linkedin there's so many people that put that on their linkedin like certified in uh uh whatever like there's so many people that cite uh hubspot as their thing and so like and so they put it like you know how like one time if you look up tyra banks on linkedin she probably still does this she puts that she graduates from harvard okay she went to a harvard exact executive learning day and people probably yeah it's like a two day look at look at if you look at tyra banks okay okay okay so she did a nine week uh program for executives called the the owner president management extension program yeah dude harvard makes it unbelievable i'm going to break this down actually next podcast harvard's kind of whole business model around online programs harvard business review the media company i'm gonna break that whole thing down because it's crazy i'll do it with you i've studied the business review a bunch um all right can i tell you about another another idea or a person actually yeah all right there's this guy named matt uh how do you pronounce his last name from uh which or whatever uh man i don't want to butcher this guy mick sorry matt i like you i just don't know how to say your last name make him like mickey and then with the wicks at the end mickey weeks all right mickey wits i've known about this guy for a long time but i'm gonna tell you everything that he's done because i bet you you know all of his work but you maybe didn't know he was the one behind it so in 1998 when he lived in australia he started this company while he was in high school called sitepoint sitepoint basically is a publisher of books courses and articles for uh developers and so you can like learn html css java ruby all that they've never raised any funding and they have like 50 employees i imagine if i had a bet they'd probably make five to ten maybe five to 15 million dollars a year um that's my guess um well how do you spell it mitscovich mizkovich his name is matt mcmiskowicz um have you heard of sitepoint sitepoint.com no is that still around all right it's still around and so like i've heard his story he was like basically i started this like as a forum and then a blog and people would come to my forum and blog and i was taking like 10 000 advertising checks when i was like 17 high school so i dropped out of high school and went all in on this then when he went all in on it his forum on sitepoint people were buying and selling businesses on it and so he spun out one of the the forums into his own business called flippa you've heard of flippa right yes so i believe that prolific he's got really proud because you haven't even got the two of his hits listen so we started flippa which is a marketplace for buying and selling smallish websites and stores and and things like that they've got millions of users flippa is like not micro acquires in the space but flippa is like considered like the thing and in fact i think they just raised a little bit of funding like 20 million dollars recently it's got hundreds of employees it's a pretty big business third on sitepoint he also discovered that people in the forum were uh um buying and selling designs and so he started this thing called 99 designs which is amazing 99designs is one of the best sites that i've used it's a great place to you basically you own 99 designs you give them a thousand dollars you tell them what you want and like a hundred designers give you a mock-up of what they think that your project should look like and then you pay for you select the one you like and they get the money so they've they do close to 100 million i believe in revenue they raised 45 million dollars in funding okay from there he also saw that people were hiring all types of devs so we started hired.com hired.com i think it kind of fizzled out a little bit it might still be around it's definitely around but it kind of fizzled a little but they raised 132 million dollars in funding definitely could still be quite big so that's pretty amazing then he now his next thing is he's creating and so this is all has to do with site point he started site point 1998 his next thing is called unstoppable domains you know what that is i bet you know that is better than i do go ahead yeah it's just a way to buy uh buy domains in crypto so like i have a domain that ends instead of dot com it ends in dot eth which is dot eth right so it's a it's a domain name service like uh it's a domain domain i think it's a registrar this is a domain registrar for making crypto domains and the reason it's called unstoppable domains is because when you own that namespace nobody it's on the blockchain nobody can sort of take it away from you nobody can switch the rules on you um it is sort of there forever so this guy matt uh mitkovic has done it i don't think he started by the way i think he joined it which is i dm'd and when he joined it because i was like if if the guy who's a founder of all these successful companies joins a company it's like one of the strongest signals that there could be um like just recently uh i was saying this about uh my my friend has got david macintosh he started tenor it's a it's a gift keyboard sold it to google for i think a couple hundred million dollars and then he joined instacart as like one of their execs so you know like any time you're you it's like this person's independently massively wealthy has they want to start their own company and they if they want to join as like not even like join his number one he wasn't joining a ceo didn't join a cto just cpo he was like you know maybe like in the top 10 of the insta work execs so that's when you know like oh [ __ ] this is like uh there's a jugger or not that's the this person thinks this is a 100 billion dollar company if they're doing that that's crazy to me so and there's guys let me just tell you so i dm'd and i go you join unstoppable super interesting move i said what makes you bullish on it here's what he said i'm just going to read it out loud may or may not mean anything he goes there's a trillion dollar asset class which is basically domains that people are navigating using the equivalent of an ip address if web encrypt if web3 and crypto is here to stay then building the identity like the the basically the address for consumers is one of the most important companies of the decade that he's like in the normal normal web you have icann you know what icann is it's not yeah so it's like a it's like a it's like a committee which it's kind of [ __ ] to me but it's the committee that decides [ __ ] about the internet what domains can be you know can you have a dot photo or dot biz yeah uh domain like i can kind of decides those types of things he goes it's one of the oldest monopolies on the internet it's begging to be disrupted crypto gives us a way to disrupt that because it's creating like a new a new ground where they don't have jurisdiction they don't have rule of law over there um that's one of the few crypto examples or blockchain examples where i wholeheartedly agree and i think that's actually incredibly useful and totally right i don't know who's going to host the domain or like how that works but i agree with that like idea because if if you're doing something i can or whoever can can pull it right um yeah anyway so uh so then he was just telling me a little bit more about it but i was like yeah that's that's great that's cool and i saw i bought an unstoppable domain this guy is amazing so um and get this he's 37. he's only 37 years old amazing this is a have you you've heard of him people don't really yeah people don't really know about this guy like or they don't really talk about this guy but he's it's a pretty prolific career and he's kind of like independent and definitely like a um he's an independent thinker i could tell right because 99 design is actually a pretty like very novel mechanism it's like oh what if we created kind of like a design auction right it's the best it's the best like we used it for our podcast thumbnail or our cover photo yes podcast we did gone through 99 designs and check this out when we did it hubspot um like had all these designers work on this stuff and they made like some pretty good logos and but we still went with uh this guy in the philippines who made this logo and it was even it was better than all of them the the trends.co website i had designed on there because like you know like when you work with a designer you don't want to be rude to your own designer be like no this sucks can you just do exactly what i told you to do please but you can do that with a freelancer a little bit more than a full-timer so i'm a fan of 99designs and by the way it looks like there's this guy mark who is his co-founder because it says co-founder of nine indesign's flippa and sitepoint so it's like that's pretty cool i like when people create this kind of like duo it's like yo let's just build a bunch of companies together i find that to be like pretty inspiring uh and it tells you something about how somebody is to work with if somebody wants to keep going back in and work with you again and i've talked to this guy i actually invited him to hustle con two or three different times and he committed and then some scheduling stuff happened and we weren't weren't able to make him make it happen but i've talked to him on the phone he's very humble so uh i'm a big fan of this guy yeah me too um okay so he's kind of like our our little you know internet founder of the week i don't know we need a name for that that uh we had the billy of the week we got the blue collar side hustle we need something for just founders who are badass who have done like yeah serial serial entrepreneurs yeah this guy's great um all right you wanna you wanna do one or two more uh yeah let's do some other ones okay so um do you know this company guthy ranker i bet you know about it and i bet i can tell you tell me all about so last night all right so i've been on this i've been on this binge i gotta say i've been on this binge um i i'm rereading the book that really got me into being like kind of like a startup founder can i guess can i guess yes think and grow rich no but that is a good guess especially if that's what we're talking about i actually haven't read that book so i'm gonna i want to read it now after reading about guthrie ranker but um i i'm rereading f four hour work week so uh your bud tim ferriss um wrote this book i got it right when i was starting my first company so i started my company before this but once i started reading it i was like oh wow this there's people that are like me that are out there who think this way and this guy's got like systems about this i'm just i just started figuring this stuff out this guy's like been doing this for a decade great and i got what you call the four hour fever which is what happens right after you read the book uh it's my own term because i i've given this book to maybe 50 people since and they all get the four hour fever right after i infect them with the book and um we already lived the four-hour work week so now we live it and so i'm whipped back and i'm re-reading it right i'm like okay i'd rather yeah i want to reread the classics and so i went back and rereading it and i just want to see uh you know what of it do i still believe in what of it do i disagree with what's changed anyway it's pretty interesting i'm taking a ton of notes and i texted you this while i was reading it i go let's write a best-selling book 10 million copies sold the next four hour work week and then you're like okay easy and i was like all right perfect um because i'm serious about that i'm like obsessed with this so i've just been writing content i've been writing and i've been reading all weekend long like i've just been binging like i'm up till four in the morning every night doing this and i'm like pretty convinced that we could put out like an amazing amazing book so anyways that's like you know just calling my shot um gonna do that well don't be surprised we're gonna use well i want to be involved let me let's go i i invited i wanted to do i'm like i'm doing this either way but i was like what would be the best i go what if the best writer i know partner with me on this and we trade it off chapters so like i can say something i'll write a chapter and what i want you to do is basically i want you to read it and then you write what you would write right after you read that so it's like uh you know like actually i totally agree with sean with this one i have my own story of how i did that or disagree i do it totally differently and i just think that if we play off of each other a little bit it can become a very interesting book because there's not many books that are out there that are like that that may all change but that's what's in my head i also think that we should do there's one book that had a pretty fundamental change in my outlook and it's called founders at work and it was by jessica livingston the woman who started uh y combinator with uh paul graham their husband and wife and basically it was just interviews but for some reason it was really special and it was just interviews transcribed i think we could do just interviews and write our analysis and reply to the interviews and we i read that book on a plane i still remember it because there's a chapter in there about hotmail and i just remember reading that book and being like this is awesome this is what is this what it's like to start a company or be around people that start companies this is [ __ ] awesome and you know by the way i hope this podcast ends up being that for some number of people in the world but that could be our first book if you want because that's like a pretty easy and actually amazing and could be fun i don't even care on the details i i just know 10 million copies sold best seller for some people this is their version of for our work what for our workers what's for me i want this to be that for like a whole you know a million people out there i think that would just be amazing so let's talk about gun three raker can i tell you what i know and you could tell me if it's true or not yeah explain them i i did a deep dive on them last night so uh all right let's fill in gaps all right so they are a marketing and ip owner so they own like a it's a business that markets other stuff they mostly don't develop their own products but they buy products or they license them um it's started by a guy named steven gunthri is that his name there's a guy one of his last names gunthy guthy guffey not guppy and then the other guy's last name is ranker so that's and they and they started i think as early as the early 80s they're in marketing and they basically bought infomercials and one of the first big hits was they bought the rights to the book thinking grow rich and they created infomercials and direct response copywriting ads that they put in magazines and they sold shitloads of this book like millions so then they just repeated and then they eventually bought proactive they own proact they own proactive and they own a bunch more they probably do a bill north of a billion in sales and they do the same type of model go ahead so it's an infomercial it's a direct response company which basically they made their name by doing infomercial based sales and they do about between one and a half to two billion in sales a year they own brands that you've heard they they they brought brands to market that you've heard of like proactive also tony robbins his kind of personal power or like audio books um thinking grow rich so okay so here's kind of some of the cool stuff i i found out about them okay so how did it start one of the guys i think guthy he had started a company and this is how funny the world works and why really all you gotta do is just get in the game and start making [ __ ] happen because nobody could have predicted this path right so he starts a company that just does audio cassette production so like uh copying so like you have a cassette you want more copies of that cassette send me the send me the original recording i'll make you a bunch of copies so it's basically like this guy's a [ __ ] like kinkos right like it's just like a printer uh for audio cassettes and he gets this order and this guy says hey i need 200 to 250 oh sorry i don't know why i said that this is a small number basically the guy wanted almost almost 100 000 cassettes made he goes 100 000 what are you making and um you know it ended up being 50 000 copies of a cassette that was about real estate about how to make money doing real estate investments and he's like wow this is that's amazing and he looked up the company and the guy was selling through infomercials so he goes to his buddy uh ranker and ranker at this time i think had his family owned like kind of like a a resort like a tennis resort or something like that so i think it could probably come from a good family so he goes hey dude this guy ordered for me 50 000 copies of this cassette it's amazing forget making cassettes like let's do this infomercial thing that must be amazing and so they go okay what are we going to do we need a product and so they that's when they were like hey what's up what's something we're both into it's like they both had made their bones they both really loved this book think and grow rates so that's when they went bought the rights to it for a hundred thousand dollars they ended up making 10 million dollars in the next three years off of sales of think and grow rich right they basically bought the right something to grow rich and they produced this infomercial they hire this football player frank tarkinton to do it they go and i by the way i watched the full 30 minute infomercial last night at four in the morning i'm like i'm like watching this thing and you can find it on youtube and it has 875 views on this video and basically it's this infomercial and it starts with like um this production and it's basically like these people it's kind of like testimonials but they don't tell you what the product is it's like you know i always wanted to just own my own business i was so tired of working for somebody else and then finally i felt like this is the solution broken down into tactical steps but they don't tell you the name right and then it's like an interview with the founder of domino's he's like i never went to college i had the lowest gpa in my high school class but i read this book and afterwards you know like it became my blueprint for how i started dominos and like it's like it's like what's the book what so they just get you like salivating what's the book and then three minutes and frank tarkik comes on he says you know the richest people in the world andrew carnegie and the rothschilds and whoever else like all these people our andrew carnegie commissioned this guy to go study what the most successful people on earth the ross childs and others were doing and he went and he interviewed all of them and he packages and he packaged all that that knowledge and wisdom into a book that's been a bestseller for years it's the book that executives say is their secret weapon blah blah blah it's just like so it's like such a hard sell but that's like what infomercials are it's like once you get in you're like all right i'll bite what is it so yeah like [ __ ] it i'll order the thing and so that's how they sold think and grow rich it's kind of like an amazing information i recommend you go watch it if you're kind of like a marketing person by the way they bought that in 1988 so 100 grand is the equivalent of is this true only 225 000 so it's only 2.2 x um and when they uh well the takeaway here should not be like i can't do that nowadays but actually the if you look at the infomercial and if you go and if you google like guthrie raker infomercial breakdown or if you just go and make your own and you look at you break it down and you like copy it word for word and you break down the sections and you apply that section to a sales letter right now it 100 will continue to work right like if you see their infomercial like the ladies are gonna be wearing like 1980s clothes and the guys will have weird haircuts you're like oh my god it's so old no it will continue to work and tv infomercials at the time was like dirt cheap so they were babe when they did the thinker girl which they just bought tv space in six small tv markets and like you could buy the midnight slot the 2am slot and these are basically like is essentially free they needed some programming to fill air time and so these started out really really cheap now it's gotten much more expensive right so like let's take proactive i think proactive at its heyday or you know kind of like some you know this maybe 10 year old data at this point but they were spending about 250 million dollars a year just on the media buying so just on the infomercial space and then they're spending like because if you go if you watch a proactive thing it's like justin bieber was their like signature person right because proactive was basically saying hey teens you don't need you don't have to have acne you can get rid of your acne this way and justin bieber was like you know the teen idol with great skin and so it was like uh justin bieber and adam levine and like you know the maroon 5 guy like there's all these people right britney spear i don't know who else it was but they would get paid five to ten million dollars to appear in a proactive infomercial like crazy money for for an influencer like that's a big influence or spend and so this is just influencer marketing done like at level 12 as i like to say right like what is that what is the maxed out version of this proactive is the maxed out version of it and so they own like a bunch of brand they own like glow by j.lo it's like you want jlo skin by j.lo's glow then it's like oh you want uh this other supermodel skin buy her thing it's like very much around skin care because that i guess is like one of the like you know that's like the sweet spot of like price big market and celebrity endorsements go a long way the two big niches are fitness or i would say three skin care fitness self-help so like tony robbins became like a household name using this on the self-help side on the fitness side they had a bunch of different brands and then beachbody took the same playbook and they created p90x and the beachbody program using the same same idea they became competitors there's a guy i'm trying to think of what what's it called it's called uh mind something i'm trying to look it up but basically there's a guy it's not mind body but it's similar to that word i can't remember what it was mine valley you knew exactly mind i was talking about there's a guy like the philippines or thailand or i don't know where they're based yeah there's some i don't want to be disrespectful but there's some weird stuff going on with this company i don't know what the truth is but basically if you look at this company mindvalleymindvalley.com he does this now and basically this company what they do they probably do 50 million a year in sales and what they do is they buy programs from people so they have one called life book one called om ombana i think that's a yoga thing and then they have ever coach which is uh i actually don't know what some of these services are but they have a bunch of these and what they do is they find people who have like a yoga course or some type of program on so they have programs on sleep they've got programs on yoga on uh meditation health wellness and hippie dippy [ __ ] you know it's like a combination of like very legit to like uh you know like tantric astrology or whatever you know like it could be anything and they're experts on long-form copywriting which is basically an infomercial and they're really good at buying traffic and they make tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue all bootstrapped and so if you want to look at the internet version of this there's also agora which is a 1.5 billion dollars and another version of this is uh we have a guy named craig is craig clements we had a guy named craig clemons his business is called golden hippo they own i think eight or nine brands and i think if i remember correctly didn't he say they do like mid nine figures in revenue yeah i think i think gold and hippo or our buddy craig company i think it's on par with guthrie ranker um in terms of like sort of like success uh i i think other record does does over a billion in sales so you know it's it's the next level but golden hippo is that from the internet for you for the internet instead of instead of tv infomercials they basically just do it with like long-form blogs and then long-form embedded videos so if you ever like go down the rabbit hole like i've tried to do it i've tried to figure out like look at some of his brands they hide their brands they hide them really hard to find but when you do find one you're like oh okay and then it's hard to find where they advertising it's like okay so they buy a display ad through taboola on some random article and it's for a toe cream toe fungus removal and then you click that and then you watch a 40 minute video that auto plays with no pause or skip button and then by the end of that you're like god damn like you know if you ended up making it there you're almost certainly going to buy this token then you subscribe to the sms is and you get like text messages from this legit doctor who you know is the face of the brand it's kind of like the the the the um like rodan and fields is another one which spun out of gun three riker it's basically like two they created proactive so i think it's two dermatologists that created the formula for proactive and then they left it created rodan and fields which is a multi-level marketing company that does this that created their own they created new formulations and this one they owned a 100 i think that's a multi-billion dollar company as well and if you're on your computer listening to this one of golden hippo's brands is called uh gundry md i think dr steven gundry uh a lot of people he's kind of famous i think he's not famous in my world but i think he's famous in like kind of mainstream world actually gundrymd.com is their website go to that website and look at this website and it they make it look like it's a small like almost thing first thing peak mobility plus it's all about you mobility you love mobile mobility and they even sell dog food it's like it's it's a pretty wild business and i think this is their most popular brand this brand if you told me does 100 million in sales i actually wouldn't be surprised but if you didn't know better you go to it you would have no idea right and this is all about like gut health plant-based you know plant-based eating uh stuff like that and so like you know i get their text messages all the time like don't you know don't get leaky gut syndrome like buy this thing and uh so you know it's very fascinating and the reason i like bringing these up or like what you brought up i think all the companies you brought up today are cool because if you work in our our like most of our friends who are like successful internet entrepreneurs tech people silicon valley executives at big tech companies they will have never heard of any of this in fact i did a breakdown of one of golden hippos flows um and i sent it to all the execs at twitch i go hey i went down the rabbit hole of this like they laughed at you they laughed at you they were just like ha fascinating and they went back to doing like you know spending millions of dollars on facebook ads that just said download twitch and it's like okay like you know like is there any creativity we could do here like to try to like like i just showed you one of the most creative things and like nobody really cared nobody asked any follow-up questions some people were just like huh cool to me it was it's crazy to me and so like so i feel like there's a lot you can learn from from these kind of under the radar brands or non-traditional and a lot of people just write them off they're like oh infomercial sleazy affiliate marketing sleazy mlm sleazy and like you may be right about like the the sort of like that that these aren't the best products that they're maybe the best sold products but look i'm trying to get great at sales so why would i not look at the best sold products it's like a no-brainer to me this was a good one i think yeah i think it's a good one uh this is definitely sort of like unusual slash potentially gray hat trust and untrust trustworthy businesses um you know i think i think it's gonna be entertaining so yeah can we wrap up with well let me wrap up first of all gun three raker is amazing i would love to see your notes on that if you can share them um also i want to wrap up with one thing that you on twitter you said you wouldn't call me to invest in your company because i'm risk adverse you you said this and i want to explain myself because that was a dig at me i don't think you meant to be rude but i took it as you being rude and i think that a lot of our friends call me this as well you guys are so wrong i just don't take dumb breath so here here's my philosophy listen here's my philosophy i so from age 20 i said by 30 i'm gonna make enough money that i never have to worry about money ever again you're not and so that's when i started my company many would say that was incredibly risky i would say compared to the average joe it was but it wasn't that risky the reality it wasn't that risky then i got the money and i invest in safe stuff but here's the thing when i find [ __ ] that i love i go all in on it i just what you and a lot of our friends do is they go they go to they spread their [ __ ] like wild i try to go all in on a couple of things so i think i don't think i'm risky a risk adverse i think that i just pick and choose them differently yeah that's true like okay let's say uh let's say i'm starting a company uh and i think i think i know what your answer would be let's see if i was starting a company and um let's say i either didn't have an idea i decided i'm gonna start a company or i said it's gonna be in this space but i don't know exactly what or i said an idea that you're like i don't even get that or that sounds kind of dumb or fuzzy to me um would you just invest then or would you want to wait because you know i would let you in at any point so you're like you could well i would ask one question are you going all in and this is going to be your only focus yeah if the answer is if the answer is yes i would be like i wouldn't raise money i wouldn't even ask the valuation i would just say okay so that's what i think the answer is and that's kind of the so the person asked a good question i did a twitter kind of like i don't know like an ama um where i was like yo just shoot me questions my wife took the kids out to target i got an hour i want some immediate rush of twitter love let's just do some q a and the person said you're raising money for a company who you're who's the first person you call and i i said all right i said like here's my first five phone calls and i basically name them name them uh i don't really remember what i said so i i'll tell you silly silly ali i totally agree with that he's an amazing operator very good investor scott belski amazing investor good signal to everyone uh the third was uh justin called back i think i had on there who's a i don't know him well but he's an amazing investor and then i had uh biology i think i had on there they put both down okay obvious reasons yeah pretty much then i had one more person who else is on there i can't find the tweet i forget who that fifth person was as well but i i'm not offended that i didn't make that list i'm offended that people think that i'm risk adverse okay and and i had a friend text me he goes do people think you're risk adverse and i was like oh i think they do but i think they're like the first person i had was michael burch the person who backed me with my previous company so that yeah that would be my first so here's my like in reality you know i'm answering these questions fast in reality i would actually not uh like two people who would uh two people who i would not actually go to first would not be scott belsky or biology right because two reasons i don't actually know them that well they're not like my homies they're like from you know like biology i consider like yeah we're kind of friends but we never like hung out yeah we're cordial uh scott belski same sort of thing like even even even more distance actually and so like you know respect but you know i can't say this is like my homie and so in reality my first five calls would be to to like you sully michael birch uh you know ramon like a bunch of our like my true friends who i'm like hey i'm doing something like yeah it's basically like family exactly and so that's like the true answer uh for twitter you know i kind of like i didn't want to put only people that people would not like not recognize their names you know a couple people that they would know in there um and there's also kind of aspirational like who would i want to be in my company i think scott belsey is an amazing product person so i think that's just like an amazing person to have on there i think bollywood and he's like the greatest and i mean he's one of the best angel investors right so he's done well and i think it's well connected so i think that's useful to have and i think uh biology also is like a different kind of signal so super obviously like hyper intelligent uh he comes from the future so that's helpful in general and i think that um i think that having him adds credibility because if you only have your friends there it doesn't help you get the next investor on board necessarily because they look at who else is invested and if they don't see a name that they recognize that they respect that they don't it hasn't been like kind of like they don't see the harvard stamp of approval on there so you need that mix in there so that's my justification for it but yeah in reality i of course would call you i know but you said i don't care about that i care about oh then i told other people that you're risk-averse i think that's crazy i think i put the smiley face that means it's a joke the smiley face means it's a joke oh my god you think that i'm ready and and to just i'm gonna wrap it up with thomas scott belsky scott belski his grandpa started kaplan kaplan really no way i did not know that yeah his grandpa started kaplan sold that for like 80 or 100 million dollars in like i think the 80s or 90s so it's like you know that's like the equivalent of like 300 then when he was 24 he invested fifteen thousand dollars into pinterest when it was worth three million dollars and fifteen thousand dollars into uber when it was worth three million dollars he did this while he was running his company called behance which was mostly bootstrapped until like six months before they sold it they raised a series a but prior to that it was bootstrap and when he sold it he owned i think 75 of it he sold it for like 150 million dollars um and then so he made probably 100 million from the sale probably 100 million on uber and 100 million on pinterest or give or take 50 percent and now he's next in line to become ceo at adobe uh which is like the 40th largest company in the world yeah total gangster um and good dude just fun fun hang

can non-technical people apply there you think of course right every technical company definitely needs people that are in non-technical roles whether it's again marketing community sales whatever whatever whatever the rules will end up being i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back okay um this episode is gonna be awesome and then the there's a story behind this i don't know if i told you this story sean but basically my wife sarah she about four or five years ago so my wife is like pretty type a went to an ivy league school isn't particularly risk doesn't like taking risks doesn't want like she she's someone who's going to rise up in a in a big company and be an executive one day and she wanted to she was like i want to join a new company and i want to make a lot of money and she was uh sarah's uh gonna be 29 uh next week so she was what 25 and she said i want to join a company where i can make some money so we made a list of a bunch of companies where we thought if she was given let's say 250 000 of stock that would invest over four years we made lists of places where that stock could like 10x and that's how she eventually she applied and got a job at airbnb that was like five years ago and now they're i think when she joined what was their last valuation before they went public like 18 or 20 billion i think and now their valuation is like 100 i think so uh it what's that 5x maybe so it did okay and we and you and i were talking and i think you're underplaying it it did better than okay let's just frame this this fully right so joined a multi-billion dollar company that already had 3 000 something employees no it wasn't that big i think it had 1200 but yes it was big all right so over a thousand employees so uh you know not joining a risky startup not buying a lottery ticket and uh so she knew this is going to have some gain it's just a question of like some value it's just a question of how much got a job and she wasn't like an exec so it was kind of like an achievable thing like she came in as like yeah i don't know like a mid-level manager is that fair to say mid-level yeah i would say yeah lower low like lower to mid right lower to mid so it didn't even come in as a hot shot and before the age of 30 was worth it was a multi-millionaire because of the stock that that appreciated from this thing right from from from joining airbnb right so self-made multi-millionaire stuff self-made multi-millionaire without eating [ __ ] as a startup founder right right where you're stressed and you're making no money and you might fail all the time and all that stuff and you have to make payroll and all that good stuff and um you know so so had to kind of like cushy you know every day got to go in and pick which flavor of soy milk she liked from the company fridge and like had health benefits and had all the things that you get the good things you get at a company plus got to see it grow right so so i thought by the way i am i i cannot confirm or deny the multi-million dollar i i i i can't completely blow up her spot or the the soy milk spot shouldn't drink soy milk but the point is the point is is that airbnb was like they they pay come very competi you know they recruit people from google and facebook so they pay competitive salary you get very competitive and wonderful benefits you work really hard but it's not a startup of 20 people where you don't have any resources you know you have resources to to get help and so the idea with this we're calling this sarah's list we should come up with a cuter name one day but it's the idea here is that we made a list of companies that are cushier than like a 20-person startup but still have wonderful upside so you can make a very competitive salary have wonderful benefits and there's like a 5 10 15 x upside so low risk great reward you're not going to become a billionaire doing this that's okay most people don't really care about that so when i heard this when we were talking i was like oh wow like um i think of myself as the hustler but this is the ultimate hustle right you know not in a bad way what i mean was like this was the hack this was the lowest low effort low risk way to get a great outcome meaning didn't have to work 120 hours a week didn't have to like carry the whole company on their back didn't have to like pick a winner uh and it's really hard to pick early stage winners it's like no pretty clearly he was going to be a winner and still walked away with a great outcome or you know still had a great great outcome so i thought wow that's that's actually fantastic i think there's a lot of people who would love that path there's some people who want to be elon musk they want to go change the world there's some people who want to make a billion dollars there's some people who want to just have go sit on a beach and do nothing right but but there's a lot of people who would love this hey let me work at a great company with really smart people working on a cool product and let me build you know uh you know financial independence without risking it all like you know like a degenerate gambler so to me we got craigslist we got angie's list what's the one with the child predators i don't know what that one's called like molly's list or something like that we got whatever molly's list and now we have sarah's list and sarah's list is the companies that we think you could go join today they're already valued you know over 250 million dollars um they have we think a low risk profile but if you stayed there for four years and you came in as a mid-level person and you got your grants which is like 50 000 in stock every year or something like that that that could make you a self-made millionaire or multi-millionaire that's the that's the thing before we get into this everything that we're gonna say it's not like financial advice or anything all the information that we have it's basically what we've just read online or rumors that we've heard amongst friends none of it so like everything is hearsay and a lot of predictions right yes yeah we could be wrong but that we thought it'd be fun you know like we're not going to go take these jobs but there's a lot of people out there who would love to know hey what would you all recommend we know it's not a guarantee we know it's not set in stone we know this is just a prediction but hey some prediction is better than nothing so we'll go on the record and we'll see how these play out all right so we each did a research we got five yeah so you go so we have five i got more than five but let's go you go i go and then we'll go back and forth okay great um okay i'm gonna save my best one i'm gonna bring in second i'm gonna first jab just feel fill you out see how strong you're coming in but my best one is coming next my power punch is coming second okay but for for the first one my first one that i'm gonna present for sarah's list my my nomination is flexport okay okay what's flexport so flexport is a company that you use when you are when you are shipping things so you so for example my e-commerce company we ship things we need to arrange between an international supplier we need our goods to go from their factory to our our warehouse well how do you do that you gotta you gotta go to a bunch of uh shipping carriers you gotta say hey when are you when do you have a boat leaving my my ready date is august third do you have a boat august third what's the price they get some quotes so what flexport does this is a job called freight forwarding flexport is basically software that does this thing that used to be done pretty manually or with very old clunky software they made modern slick software that does this freight forwarding thing right so you go online you can see all your quotes you book your boat with a simple click you pay the fees it's all you know like very nice and then the notifications come through and basically it is modern freight forwarding software so flexport's currently valued last public valuation was about three billion dollars um the softbank put in a billion dollars at a three point uh 3.2 billion dollar valuation it's got about 2 500 employees these are abouts so you know about 2500 employees and they're in a huge space so global shipping is is massive it's only getting bigger the bigger ecommerce gets and um and what they did was there was all these small mom and pop freight forwarders and they just sort of like did what many great companies do they they sort of take a fragmented market with low nps and they build a best-in-class product that's you know integrated and so you don't have to deal with kind of the the mom and pop telephone call game that you would have otherwise had to do and the founder is pretty amazing zayn's is ryan peterson i've hung out with him once or twice and i've read a lot of interviews with him he's very charismatic he once said that uh this company's either gonna be worth zero or a hundred billion dollars or something like that you know he's like this is gonna be all or nothing right and he's pretty he's very very good we should compile an ebook of quotes like that that's like talk dirty to me the vc edition it's like what are some offhand things you can say as a founder that just get every investor to like salivate and they they sometimes sound dumb like why would i say my company's either gonna be worth zero or a hundred billion it's like but that's exactly what a vc wants because that's how their economics work so we should just and you could just cherry-pick these phrases they're like pick-up lines for vcs and uh and we should just make a little e-book out of those but that's a good one all right um next one uh i'm gonna go first mine will be easy as well zapier uh so what they do it's always really hard for me to explain what this company does but once you use it you immediately get it and i'll give you a use case so basically what they do is they connect apis so for example when the hustle first started we had we didn't i didn't want to buy like greenhouse or one of these like really 500 a month applicant tracking systems and so i created a google form and then i use zapier to connect that to asana and so every time someone applied to a job the information was automatically film filled into an asana board and that's what we use to track our job applicants another example and this is like a really simple personal use case is i had a scale and every time i stepped on my smart scale it told zapier and zapier put my weight into a spreadsheet and i compared it to all my friend's weight and we had a competition now that's like a really simple use case but they do incredibly complicated ones where they'll attach loads of different so you could build an entire company using basically google spreadsheets and zapier um they're interesting for a few reasons first they bootstrapped it to like 60 to 70 million dollars in recurring revenue and they did it very quickly they recently raised a little bit of funding at a 5 billion valuation by uh i believe sequoia they currently have 350 people um my opinion is this is going to end up very similar to atlassian so atlassian is an australian company that went public i think in 2014 and when they went public it was like a 15 or no maybe it was like a six billion dollar valuation and they sold uh widgets to small businesses software to small businesses and people slept on them and it slowly scaled i think today at blasting is worth 100 billion dollars i think zapier is gonna be similar wade foster the founder of zapier spoke at hustlecon and i hung out with him and he was like everything i he was just like perfect he was wonderful there is one downside i've heard through friends of friends that they don't they so their pay is they they're a remote team they've been remote from day one they don't they pay against chicago market salaries so they don't pay san francisco salaries so that might be a downside but i would love to own zapier stock yeah okay so so what you're saying is it's a 5 billion company and kind of amazingly this was it was at 1.3 million in funding to get to that 5 billion in value is that right yeah they basically only raised one million dollars in funding and they got that to 60 million arr they're probably north of 100 million arr they're probably worth their rest valued at five they're probably worth 10 at this point i mean it's like a crazy valuable company that's insane they're growing crazy you would need them to become a 25 to 50 billion dollar company and you're betting that they can and will do that yeah over the course of four or five years when all your stock would vest yes i think that okay all right sounds good okay so uh do you agree or disagree uh they've surprised me every step of the way so far so you know when you first it's like zapier i'd be like oh cool indie hacker project and then it's like no no it actually got to like a million dollars aor it's like oh you know that's cool cool bootstrap software company maybe you can sell for 25 30 million dollars oh wow they're doing 50 million in aor okay uh jeez what how many times again am i gonna be wrong here so i'm just debating do i really want to bet against them again and i think the answer is no i don't want to bet against them again so i think i'm gonna give you thumbs up on your on your on your one here i would include it in sarah's list flexport would you have given it the thumbs up or thumbs down to be included on sarah's list can it be worth 50 yeah definitely okay good so keep in mind we're keep in mind we're talking about like five years from today yeah five years exactly yeah so okay so we have two two successful nominations to sarah's list i'd like to give you my next domination you're gonna hate this one or roll your eyes or something okay uniswap do you know what uniswap is no oh my god that's insane to me okay so uniswap uh if you go to like i don't know because uniswap.org is how you get to to the thing so you you know swap what if i told you let's just play this game there is a company in the cryptocurrency space and i have an opportunity for you to join here's here's some of the things you need to know about this it is um it's bigger than deutsche bank credit suisse and state street um all combined it has um bigger in terms of what current market cap and yeah in terms of current market okay let me tell you some other things about it oh is that just market cap is that just one of those crazy crypto market cap things hold on let me just tell you a little bit more what if i told you it has the trading volume of coinbase with 50 times less employees would that be something you're interested in yes what if i told you that this company is doing 10 billion a week in trading volume and what if i told you it was doing that with less than 35 employees what if i told you that it took coinbase eight years and a thousand employees to get to a billion dollars in revenue and tells you that uniswap is only two and a half years old has less than 50 employees and is on pace to do over a billion dollars in revenue this year would that be something you're interested in because that's unit swap right now in in so what do they do so what do they do okay so let's say you've heard of all the different like um tokens that exist so let's say have you ever heard of um you know dye or ethereum or whatever like yeah all these different tokens right there's thousands of thousands of different currencies so coinbase what they're really good at is to say you have us dollars you want to go buy some bitcoin or ethereum you want to go buy some you know some some solana great um we'll take your u.s dollars we'll connect with your bank and you can buy this crypto asset what uniswap does it says thanks coinbase we'll take it from here you're kind of slow and expensive uh and you have you know you have all these employees and all this red tape and stuff like that from here once you have a crypto token this is uniswap is how you trade any crypto token for any other crypto token so lets you swap between any crypto asset instantaneously and it's what's called a decentralized exchange means um there is no central company with a bunch of employees that owns the exchange it's a protocol that they built um and all it does if you go to the website it just says what currency do you have what currency do you want here's the the exchange rate push go and it'll exchange it for you right there and what they did was the genius of it is normally for a centralized exchange like coinbase they have to have a you know sort of they're the market maker they they they find buyers and sellers and they match them together and they have to have you know certain amount of reserves themselves to be able to facilitate to bring liquidity into the market what what decentralized exchanges do what dexes do that's that's what they're called is you have a buyer you have a seller and then you have this group in the middle that i can also come in and be a liquidity provider so i can just go give uniswap some money and i can earn a portion of the revenue that they have that they make just by providing liquidity into the pool oh cool so they have it's like a three-sided market and so they have like um over 5 billion of liquidity that users just locked up into their market to create the liquidity for their markets yeah it's like a it's like a it's like a weird lending club type of type of thing that's pretty sick only 30 people what type of person would be a good tool wow what type of personality would be good to work there uh i don't know crazy nut i don't know but you know these types of things that it's like you typically these are gonna be engineering heavy like things and so you can come and be you know do all the other stuff so let's say you're a community person you're a marketing person you're a pr person you're whatever you can go and sort of say look i have this skill set that you probably need but when you're at 35 people and this much scale they kind of need everything they need more of everything probably and so i think anybody could probably fit in you just think they uh how to solve some of their problems do you think they give equity yeah so basically there's a company so there's a company and then there's the the protocol the company owns some of the tokens using the protocol but um like so so the company raised a series a from andreessen horowitz and paradigm and a bunch of others they raised only a series a so i think they've only raised 11 million dollars to date and they've reached basically the same scale as coinbase on 11 million dollars and coinbase is what a 80 billion dollar company so um so so i think you know this would be a very very very valuable group to be a part of now the economics are different because it's crypto and everything's weird it's like what's the valuation what's my equity worth i don't know it's all it's all funky you got to figure it out yourself but there's definitely enough value there so going super fast it's kind of for a person who's i imagine the personality type is like someone who's okay with a little bit a lot of chaos and some risk yeah and like uh not non-traditional you're okay with something that's non-traditional all right i'm gonna give you another non-traditional one this this this might be one of my stronger ones so it's called uh andrew i think that's how you say do you know what that is i had it on my list all right you stole it right off me wait did you really did you really i didn't see it on yours yes no it's not written up on here oh sorry i didn't put my i have my own little cheat sheet here that you don't have all right great so mine's called andrew so um i'll uh i'll tell you a little bit background but you actually might know a little bit more so basically it started by the guy named palmer lucky and the reason why this is interesting is palmer lucky started oculus when he was like 16 or 17 and then he sold it to facebook for some what like a billion dollars just like a ton and it's interesting because palmer lucky is very controversial so he's a uh a big uh supporter of donald trump which is very atypical in silicon valley he was fired from facebook and a lot of people or he was the one who said he thinks he was fired because he liked trump and he sued facebook for hundreds of million and one so regardless if you think that's cool or not he is controversial amongst silicon valley folks and so he started this company out of orange county and they here's another controversial thing they make stuff for the government their first product was an invisible wall basically so it was a way to build drones i believe to keep uh illegal immigrants from crossing the mexican-american border so controversial whatever we can we definitely can agree to that they've raised money and it's worth about 4.6 billion dollars they have 510 employees this would not be good for a liberal person or someone who like you basically have to be moderate or right of center to want to work here uh palmer seems like a like a fine enough guy a little quirky but definitely it's a right-leaning company um which isn't incredibly normal in silicon valley i definitely think this could be a palantir s company the way that i describe what they do if i'm correct is basically if you ever see the movie war dogs people or the government says we need blank and then people bid and they wait to get it and then the person they go we need some type of vehicle that can fly like a plane but land like a helicopter and then people go out and build it well what andrew does i believe is they build stuff that they think the government needs and then the government buys it from them and it saves a bunch of time is that basically what they do yeah so they uh yeah exactly their their primary revenue source comes from the government and what they build is like pretty fancy hardware software combinations so they're like one of their if you go to their websites like sentry tower it's like this solar-powered tower it's like this giant pole that is you know used to like you know basically monitor a border right monitor an area and uh and it's autonomous and so there's basically like the hardware to be able to do that so like top flight hardware mixed with software that makes it like you know smart intelligent work well you know it's like a nest camera for the government and so you know they have uh drones they have different different things like that it's not a huge product line because these things are hard they probably take tens of millions of dollars to make each one but they um they're basically trying to be the kind of like the most technology forward provider for you know the us defense budget which i think is like you know hundreds of billions of dollars i think is what you have here like 700 billion dollars a year and the question is can so they're currently worth a little bit over 4 billion they raise money from founders fund i think can this company be worth 20 40 50 billion in five years 100 it definitely can um it definitely can this guy already built a billion dollar company at the age of like 22 definitely all right your turn okay that's a good one i had that one on my list so so i like that one a lot all right sarah's list filling up we got uh thumbs up there okay i'm gonna do one um i'm gonna do one that i invested in actually okay so disclaimer it's not even really a disclaimer or disclosure this is actually a flex yes i'm an investor okay so this company is called replit you ever seen replit do you know what this does only because you have been telling me for years it's going to be the greatest so um so i'll tell you how i found them or how i kind of heard about them so i heard about them from two different places anytime these two people talk about something you're like oh wait that's like a winning combination so the first is like my teenage nephew is like using this tool replit to learn how to code i'm like oh okay i've never heard it before kind of like that's interesting uh stuff teenagers use you should probably like pay attention to stuff teenagers use because those tend to be big companies you know whether it's snapchat or you know minecraft or roblox or things like that and i was like all right so so yeah i stashed it away didn't really pay too much attention to it second time i heard about it was from paul graham the founder of y combinator he tweeted a combination a graph of a hockey stick he goes uh he said something you know like one of the fastest girl you know this is one of the fastest growing companies i've ever seen he goes he's like this is yes that's over 5 million users and that may not sound like a lot but when your users are all programmers 5 million is a hell of a lot and um and that's so true like five million programmers on a network is like worth its weight in gold every programmer ever yeah so and so then uh so i can't hear too much about it but basically companies value just under a billion dollars right now so if you're looking at this you're like okay can i does this end up at five billion or more what what's it do though what's it do so what does it do okay you want to learn how to code it's kind of like a sandbox that does a few important things the first is if you've ever tried have you ever like gone down pathway like dude i'm gonna learn how to code i'm gonna i bought this udemy course i'm gonna learn python have you ever like gone down that path at all because one of the most confusing things that happens is you're like oh [ __ ] where do i type this you don't write your code in a google doc right like you've got to type your code in a code editor and like then it's like oh great but you need to install these like python packages you're like what the hell's that it's like you need to like install npm or like what the hell is npm and then you're like it's like oh you need to deploy so now you need servers you're like server what do i get in one of those and so it's all just very confused just the environment which is basically like the equipment you need to code setting up that developer environment in itself is like for me was very confusing now i'm like you know average person so like if an average person finds it confusing that means it's too confusing and so what replied did was first they were like dude look it's just a website you go to it's already got all that stuff baked in you don't have to install anything you don't need five different programs just to be able to deploy code like you write the code here then you push run you test it here and then you push deploy and you deploy it here great all built into one so that was really useful for young hackers young engineers and hobbyists who wanted to like learn this stuff so the first thing was they made all the stuff you need to learn it then they were like okay cool but this is kind of like a social network because we got all these programmers all writing code it's kind of like if you've ever looked at github github is this big network it's probably the biggest network of developers and they all put their code here well what github did was like you could fork something so you put some code you make it publicly available i can read it and then i could fork it make my own version of it and you'll get notified that hey sean remixed your thing so riplet does that like on steroids so they basically it's almost like a game it's like all the different programmers can see what all the other programmers are doing they can get inspired by those they can literally take their code and remix it make their own version of it or they can like contribute to each other and they could take little parts that somebody made somebody made this bouncing ball cool i'm gonna grab that i'll i don't have to remake it from scratch i'll just use their bouncing ball program you know code and i'll add that to my basketball hoop thing that i'm making and so it's like a multi-player little like game almost for programmers to be able to like not just not just write their code not just deploy their code but also you know like find other pieces of code that they can interact with and monetize it so you can actually launch full apps full programs on here and make money um it's like all built in so the bet here if you look at their graphs it's like everything is a hockey stick like crazy crazy upwards curve all right i'm on board with that scale so so i think that's they do this side by side comparison like here's our growth compared to github's growth from your zero you're one year two year three or four and they're like outpacing github's growth all right i'm on board with that i think that's a good one um can non-technical people apply there you think of course right every technical company definitely needs people that are in non-technical roles whether it's again marketing community sales whatever whatever the roles will end up being um yeah for sure and in fact usually those companies technical companies get built kind of like engineer first and so they actually need people that are non-technical to to be able to join all right that's a good one um i'm on board i'm on board with that one um all right my turn uh this one is similar to zapier air table so air table is a is a microsoft excel alternative it's a google sheet alternative when they first came out i was like why on earth why on earth would anyone need this like google sheets works great and then i used air table and they i realized they're kind of making it their own category it's very sticky it's very neat right now they're valued uh since 2021 they raised money at a 5.7 billion dollar valuation i actually think they could be much larger there's another company that i kind of compare them to they're not quite the same but they're i think they're a little bit stamp same in terms of stickiness and that's and they came out the same time uh or they got popular around the same time that's monday.com and they're worth they went public at like 18 billion i think that airtable could definitely do really great they currently have 645 employees um they the guy who started it i think his name is howard liu howie lou and he's kind of like this prodigy genius guy like that's like how they stereotype him in the media but i've seen interviews went to my tour he went to duke did he yeah i saw interviews with him though he was definitely like a prodigy young genius but he was very like wise and like he wasn't like a wacky weirdo he was like pretty well thought uh well spoken and you want to know something funny yeah so seven years ago so we were in a mastermind group if you remember me you and a couple other guys we used to get dinner every month or two or something like that talk startups and we would occasionally invite other people in and so i have a dm where i dm'd howie back when air table was very you know it was was a lot smaller i think it was still probably i think it had just raised money maybe under 100 million dollars i think was the valuation at that point in time and i was like howie you love airtable think it's [ __ ] great i think it's going to be big um you know you're a fellow duke guy that's awesome hey i host these mastermind dinners you should come to one and he's like oh i'd love to and we scheduled it and uh you were scheduled to go to it and then i think you and one other person cancelled and like oh i can't come and so i canceled the dinner and so i never met him and like you know [ __ ] who knows what could have been we could have been homies by now we could have been invested yeah a long time ago uh you know under 100 million dollars did you hang out with them no that was the that was the excuse i had been i was like i do these as excuses to hang out with people right i don't want to say hey i'd love to meet you it's like yeah great i don't love to meet you i don't want to ask him to coffee but i was trying to invite him to something cool he's like hey we do this founder thing it's great my bad howie i'm sorry dude um all right so i have one a yeah yeah uh yay because excel is like the there's this great quote which is like every sas company you actually compete with excel you don't compete with other sas companies you compete with excel because people just use excel for everything and um and so yeah i think that like i don't i don't know what excel's market cap would be but i think excel is more i don't know what it would be dude excel is like airpods to apple like yeah airpods would be a 100 billion dollar company on its own that's what excel is exactly so if excel is a 100 billion dollar company i think that the the best threat to excel is going to end up being worth you know 20 30 pretty i think there's a pretty good chance of that and so i like this a lot more it was recently at one or two billion i liked it a lot more there than at 5.7 but like you know we didn't do the episode then we did it now um so okay so i'll give you one that's very very similar real quick figma so figmas too instead of you know and i'll do it quick because people already know figma but i would put it on the list uh you know the way irritable airtable airtable's doing for excel figma's doing for photoshop so it's the younger slicker cloud-based uh sexier version of design software and it's kind of eating photoshop's lunch i don't know worth now what is it seven billion now it's like no it's uh so in july of 2021 they raised 200 million dollars at a 10 billion dollar vote uh valuation but here's that sounds like a lot but to the listeners and you sean how much is uh what's adobe's market cap so adobe uh i believe almost all their revenue at this point is from photoshop right well it's the creative cloud which is basically a bundle that you're like i want photoshop to like but buy fireworks and uh you know like buy all this other [ __ ] that we like bundle in with creative cloud okay so tell me what you think it is i would have guessed um adobe's market cap is i don't know 150 billion or something like that what what is it uh it is 315. and if i'm not mistaken that might be one of the uh let's look it up it might be one of the 50th let's see adobe would be would is it's one of the biggest companies in the world so adobe is the 30th largest company in the world so when you think about how big this can be you think 10 billion dollars that's so much money well adobe's the one of the biggest companies in the world a figma's going after it totally should be on this list it's like it's like all the business trends like first unbundling it's like well creative cloud brings in 12 billion a year well let's unbundle the most valuable part of it photoshop and let's do it differently okay what's different second trend cloud-based right uh third trend multiplayer right like when i'm using figma my mouse is moving around your mouse i'll also see what you're doing on the same canvas that's really cool right um and so they they're they're piggybacking off all these like kind of macro shifts and doing it right just just sort of like by the way if you think oh it's already at 10 billion is it really going to 5x last five years adobe has 6xed so adobe was trading at 100 a share it's now at 660 a share in five years and that's at adobe's large thing you know that's their growth rate figma's growth rate should be in the next five years much faster than adobe's was in the last five and um and so i think there's a fairly good chance of that in fact i should just go invest in all these companies uh that are on this list this is this is a great great list to be on all right my turn uh so i agree i had to think about mine so i completely agree so we're about 100 so uh rippling that's my next one rippling very boring company i used it it's a payroll software provider but it also manages devices and gives you permissions to different stuff so basically um if if you're a small startup and people sign up to your to work at your company it you i can easily track which person has which computer and i could pay software through there and i can do hr management and issue health care stuff to people why it's interesting the founder his name's what's his name parker conrad so he has the controversial pass he started zenefs which was at the time of the fastest growing companies ever he got fired because he kind of the culture was kind of crazy people were like having sex in the hallways and kind of being bro and [ __ ] like that and so he was like oh you know in order to do this hr thing you have to like have this like compliance training it takes 60 hours well cool here i just i created a macro that will go through the training for you just push the enter key every you know five minutes or something like that and you'll be done in six hours instead of 60. like [ __ ] like that that was a little bit like oh that's actually like slightly illegal i think yeah but the good news is he has experience the also good news is that he [ __ ] up and so you would think that you'd learn because he got ousted so i kind of like that i always like that in a company where someone is like it's their second time around and they've already been mildly successful i think that's actually a good thing they were here's why i think this company's interesting so they were last valued at 1 billion 1.3 billion dollars and i use them and they're amazing i've used them for years every company problem every company on boards new employees and needs to get their computer set up needs to get them connected to all the systems it's at every purse every company problem and uh that's why it's kind of genius and there uh so workday which is in the space is worth 67 billion dollars paychecks which is a uh just a payroll provider it's worth 40 billion dollars so i don't think that this their valuation is still true their own category which is why it's even better like if you said does rippling end up i think rippling if it's at a billion now i think it's maybe one of the best candidates uh to like 50x on this list right it's one of those that like you know when square went public square republic at like i think three billion or two billion valuations else like 150. now it's like 100 so square after it ipoded which was again d-risk d-risk d-risk now it's liquid it's already had like a 30-40 x since then um and so that's like wow that's you get some insane appreciation on your on your stock and so i think rippling is one that if you told me this 30 to 50 x's i'd say of the things we've said on this list that might be the number one candidate so far all right so then uh we're we're we've got a hit and when i use the product it did everything well but it was still pretty clunky so i think a lot of your product designer if your customer support sales i think these guys are hiring for a bunch of different stuff so that's my pick all right your turn okay uh i'm gonna do one that's a little by the way i think these are hits i think yeah i think so too um all right so so here's one open store you know what openstore is uh it's new isn't it it's new okay so uh this might not this might not this might well no this might hit but this might be too early but go ahead yeah so okay so what is this um so first let me say who's the founder so the founder is is two kind of powerhouses now i don't know how much of their time they're spending on this but one is keith or boy who was the ceo at square he was part of the paypal mafia he's a big-time vc he's a total dick on twitter entertaining dude i i enjoy he's very smart and he's an [ __ ] on twitter uh which i find to be hilarious and then this other guy um jack abraham jack abraham was kind of like wonder kid built a company sold it to ebay pretty early on uh was like kind of a hot shot at paypal spun out and he has his own like studio and so they together came together and they made um they made open store which is a riff off of keith or boy's other pre last company that's now worth five billion dollars open door so what open door did was you want to sell your house don't go through the whole like dog and pony show i will buy your house now you don't have to stage it you don't have to fix it up you don't have to hire an agent you don't have to do anything just sell me the home i'll just give you a price right now and you can sell it today so i give you liquidity in this house market instantaneous sales open store is the same thing for e-commerce they're saying you want to sell your e-commerce company i'll buy your shopify store right now you don't have to go through the whole banker process make a dag do do all this stuff i'll just plug into your data and i'll just give you an offer right now and so what they're trying to do is roll up shopify stores and so they're they raised i think their first round maybe was was at a 250 million dollar valuation so to get your 5x here you have to bet that it becomes a billion dollar company with this guy's track record square open door with jack abraham's track record it's a very good shot that they sent up being being worth more more than a billion dollars this space is very hot so do you know thracio that we've talked about before it's the one that thoracio was was was the first hot company that was rolling up amazon businesses businesses that sell products only on amazon they're called fba fulfilled by amazon companies and uh they rolled them all up do you know what thoracio's valued at right now what it's like 510. they're gonna go public at a 10 billion dollar valuation i think they might be the fastest company to a 10 billion dollar exit um ever i think i think they're like they're three years old they're four years old three years old and you know very capital efficient how they went there because they used a lot of debt to buy these companies because the company's already are profitable or producing a lot of revenue so they're able to use big debt to do this and so open store is doing the same thing without the amazon style it's for shopify and so i think that this model this open store model is one of the fastest easiest and fastest ways to build a billion dollar company and i think that this company at 250 million i see a lot of value in this pick here yes it could go to zero this could also not work this has higher risk than the other stuff on this of this list so that's the that's the disclaimer it's much higher risk but i think the reward is a lot higher here too okay so this i agree this could 10x this borderline wouldn't be considered part of the list because no it's because they just launched they're they're it's a year or less right it's july 15 2021. so this wouldn't fit in the category of being like a cushy gig but i i i i'm cool with adding it but yeah i think i think it might be on the like hey you're on you're you're in the the batter's box you're not on the batter's box you're in the on deck circle right we're just waiting for you to mature you got to season up a little bit in order to be on this list given the criteria of the list also but we could swap it so keith boy has another company that's incredibly interesting i believe it's called fair f-a-i-r-e-i he's just an investor in that one yeah i didn't add it to the list but it's a wholesale marketplace for retailers and brands so you could just basically uh it's almost like it's a database but i used it recently for my brand i was like oh yeah we should sell wholesale too i was like okay so what am i gonna do go contact every brick and mortar store and say hey would you like to carry my brand my online brand and your store it's a good brand here's the details here's my catalog i made it in in excel and i have to update it weekly and then here's my pricing and then here i just go to my shopify store and just buy some stuff like it's like you have to string together five tools to set up wholesale fare is basically like you want wholesale list yourself as a company the brick and mortar stores can all like just choose to to buy from you your catalog is stored here it just takes for that whole problem i think it's like a 15 billion dollar company yeah i don't know if that can 10x but it's doing really well and i didn't do research on it for this pr project but i've uh i tell people if they want to look whenever people ask me this question of where they should join i say that company sounds incredibly interesting um all right we'll do maybe one last one yeah one last time on yourself all right i'm gonna do one that i also i'm an investor in this one so i'm there's a disclosure it's called next health and the reason why i think it's cool it's basically the very simple dumbed-down version it's almost like shopify for doctors so basically when you go to a doctor you have to fill out a form and they've automated the form so you just fill it out online but then if every other doctor uses the same uses next health all your information is on that platform and so it's much easier so you have basically one medical record and also they've opened it up to third-party developers who can build apps using your health data and your like uh your whole health record and you can see uh interesting stuff an example a very tiny example is if you're on smile direct club and you want to find out where an orthodontist is nearby who could fit you for your orthodontist they say hey next here's all the doctors in next health that are in that network just click here you're good to go and that's like a third party app that whatever they are worth 500 million dollars their ceo is young 26 27 i've gotten dinner with him he basically has told me and i don't exactly remember how he said it but he was like yeah i kind of want to take over the world like he he was like i i've i thought yeah he was like yeah he was like well i think he's i think he told me his his parents are from bangladesh and i think he goes you know bangladesh is an interesting country because it has a really large male population and it has a low unemployment rate so if i wanted to take over the world i think i could go there and rally the young men and we could build our own army and i think that'd be a good place like like he had this like well thought out and i was like you're nuts i love you i'm id so next health is interesting to me and they've raised uh 150 million dollars i think and so it's big enough that they uh maybe they've only raised 50 million dollars it's big enough that it's a little bit uh settled and they can pay well right all right you want to bring it home you bring it home with one one one that one that's a little bit unorthodox i think we said a lot of popular names uh here's an unpopular name one trust so one trust is a company that specializes in making your company gdpr compliant and oh my god the most boring [ __ ] on earth valued at five billion dollars um you know you have to you have to sort of endlessly keep up with privacy laws uh are different in all these different countries if gdpr for europe us is going to have their own version of this other country's gonna have their own version of this and they're always gonna evolve and um and they have the customers and they're going to basically continue to service these customers and for the companies you have huge huge risk because it's like if you're not compliant on gdpr it's like fines that are like you know multiplied per user or something like that it's like your fines can be exorbitant and nobody wants to deal with this nobody wants to become an expert of this nobody wants to throw huge amounts of engineering and design and and policy uh head count towards doing this it's going to be much easier to like buy a solution and pay for pay for somebody else as your cover your ass insurance to take care of your gdpr needs i think it's one of the fastest growing companies in the country right now it's called one trust i think they're based in atlanta if i'm right um i might be mixing them up with another one there's actually two companies that are both billion dollar companies in this space i love these companies i want to invest in these companies and if i you know was going to send send somebody to go work at one of the work at a company that has this profile this would be one of them so i think it's a good contender for sarah's list all right i think um i think that's the list that's i i think i think this is this to do a listener applying to jobs this could be one of the most life-changing episodes uh this is good i think this is a really interesting idea when we when i i used to have this product called just jobs where i would write companies that do this and i would pay users to people would pay to have access to it this is going to become maybe a recurring segment we'll see this is pretty interesting well i told you the thing i wanted to do with this was i'm going to curate 50 companies that meet this criteria and i'm going to basically create a job board from this and the the thing with the job board is you can't just be a company who wants to come list on here no only these 50 companies that are curated can post on this job board uh they have to pay to do it but but but if they don't pay they're just on the list but no jobs will show up and so i want to have a running job so we take this segment idea uh but basically the reason i had a bunch of these companies listed is because me and ben have been cooking up oh we should launch a job board and when we launch a job board what would add some value well if i could curate companies that i think people should work for this is not an original idea i think you did something like this there's just a bunch of people have done things like this curated companies that you think are cool and you turn that into a product and so we're gonna do that with a job board pretty soon uh we'll launch that pretty soon with pallet sick well that's freaking awesome good episode all right man i gotta run [Music] let's travel never looking back

i never lie but i think a lot more people should lie you could look cool yeah uh i don't think more people should lie because as somebody who used to lie it's uh it's really exhausting what did you lie about feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right i uh i want to talk about this open c thing i'm laughing about it but before we get into that people like story stuff let me quote not a story but do you know who laird hamilton is surfer yeah so he uh he like is like when you think of the word like surfer hunk he's like the guy you like think of right like blind he's like kind of the most famous one i think and he's a little bit older now right yeah he's in his 50s he could be as old as 60 but uh he's 57 and there's two amazing things about him the first he has this thing called layered superfood have you heard of that no okay it's interesting for a bunch of reasons the first reason why it's interesting is laird is interesting to me he's basically so laird hamilton was a surfer in hawaii he had a troubled childhood but he dedicated his life to surfing he says that he might be a little autistic and that he like focuses on a goal incredibly uh like he he'll achieve it no matter what he obsesses so for a long time he was obsessed with finding the biggest wave he invented toe in surfing and then eventually he got into uh health and he got obsessed with eliminating sugar eliminating flour and just being very very very healthy and so eventually he launched a company called layered superfood and he's obsessed with coffee he drinks tons of caffeine loves coffee and he didn't want to use like almond milk or oatly or anything like that and so he invents this thing called layered superfood it starts with a creamer now they sell a bunch of different stuff a bunch of different creamers a bunch of different health foods it seems legitimate i'm gonna buy some of them some of it because uh it does look i like him and i like the idea of what it promises although i don't know the science behind it but the second second reason why it's interesting it went public it's publicly traded it went public with like 18 million in revenue currently has a market cap 163 million dollars revenue of like 50 i think uh but kind of cool right and laird interests me because he's kind of like there's no such thing as a perfect human but he checks all the boxes in terms of he's doing getting a bunch of stuff so physically fit great he seems emotionally incredibly healthy very stable like when he talks to him he seems very wise and like he understands uh how to treat people got a great family it seems and now financially very successful adventurous this guy's my hero uh but i don't know if he had ever i thought it was interesting that they took the company public yeah that sounds also just did it take it public in the us or somewhere else here it's uh where it's on it's on the new york stock stock exchange it's called layered superfood doesn't it seem too small it's like a penny stock like what is the market cap of it if it has 18 million in revenue it doesn't have 18 million in revenue now maybe what's it have now you could look it up like 40 or 50. it ha it's market cap right now is 163. its highest ever was uh two times that interesting okay uh and yeah i'm kind of like you where there's something you know some um like if you're just like a normal instagram influencer and you're like talking some product uh or whoever you're whoever you're me you're you're just like normal person and you're you're talking some product it's like okay you know you probably tried to do a good job with this but like this is a business for you and you're doing this for the business and then when you see someone like laird hamilton who's like walked the walk for like i don't know how many years you guys like 50 something years old and you see he's just like ripped absolutely ripped at that age you kind of know that he's lived a certain lifestyle and um i have a higher level of trust when this guy's selling me a tea or a you know a breakfast waffle keto breakfast waffles or a creamer or whatever this stuff is that he has i do feel like i trust a lot more than uh you know whatever ryan gosling's gin or something you know like where it's like clearly just celebrity face plus generic product equals like branded product now the second thing i wanted to ask you okay so when i look at this guy i've been reading a lot about him i've been obsessing a little bit about him and i've been watching all this stuff he's always working out and for the past maybe four months i've been working out really hard i'll do like maybe 10 workouts a week so sometimes two days and i'm always sweating yeah i'm moving a lot and i started thinking about this because there's this thing that trump said and it's always stuck with me and and for some reason the way that he said it i just it never went away and someone was like this is right after his physical and they go trump why don't you exercise he's like it's a waste of time i don't want to waste my energy and they're like what he goes yeah look like i only have a limited amount of energy in my lifetime my my body's like a battery i'm not gonna use my battery on exercise when i could be using it building businesses or doing whatever and i have no idea what the truth is of this but it got me thinking i paraphrased it but yeah so if you google like trump health battery we call it like it's like trump's battery theory or something like that and i have no idea the validity of this this could be the stupidest thing ever i've i don't know it just i just thought it was hilarious when he said it but it got me thinking like i read david's goggins biography and like the dude's sweating all the time and like can like let me read this out let me read this out uh trump gave up athletics after college because he believed the human body was like a battery with a finite amount of energy which exercise only depleted he said uh what did he say he goes i don't know here's a scientist a better analogy would be it's like a fire that you continue to fuel with more coal or wood you need to continue to add fuel or your flame will die this is true whether you're exercising or not simply by existing we're burning energy okay i don't know what this guy's talking about so well i was thinking about it i'm like if our if our life only if our hearts this trump battery thing is too ridiculous i can't get over it and it's great right that's great a possible val this is like i walked in on my sister once she was supposed to be studying and she was i walked into her room and she was just laying down sleeping and i was like oh my wake up like you're supposed to be my mom like i was a little kid my mom i sent me in to be like is she studying for the test i was like mom say you're supposed to be sitting for the test she's like no no i'm reviewing in my head and i was like oh sorry sorry sorry and i went back to my mom and i was like she's reviewing she just closed her eyes to review like she was definitely just sleeping that's what trump's battery thing is to me it's like some [ __ ] excuse for not wanting to exercise yeah well i i was thinking i'm like what again i'm an idiot i know nothing but like if your heart can only beat some number of beats throughout your lifetime am i wasting it by just like being sweaty all the time and working out all the time and i uh i was thinking about this layered habited guy and i'm like dude maybe you should just go for walks instead of like like how much exercise like do we actually need you know like when i say david gaga's like running hundreds of miles and he's like on his instagram he's always working out it's like i i just i want to start reading about like where where's the threshold of where it actually doesn't matter because yeah well okay i i think you know here's my my very basic theory which is it's not like a okay it's like a battery but batteries can be recharged and whatnot uh it's basically right your heart and other parts of your body are muscles and the muscles can grow stronger with you know exercise and then they develop or they can grow weaker without use and so not using them doesn't just preserve your precious energy marbles and you're going to go live till you're 200 it's uh it's that if you build your muscles up including your heart your brain by you know studying or cardiovascular exercise you're going to get more out of it you're going to be able to do more now plus it'll be able to like last longer through atrophy in your life i hear you but but when i see laird hamilton at 57 and i'm like working my butt off right now i'm like he all this stuff is about recovery he talks about recovery he talks about how this helps and i'm like well just like do less and don't you don't need to recover just like do less stuff you know like like okay look at laird hamilton and then look at trump and just look at their results and say which body do you ultimately want do you want that guy's body and energy or do you want this guy's body and energy and i think it'll guide you down the right path like i'm just saying i'm thinking out loud here this is something that i'm questioning myself like how hard am i going to go and like why do i want to recover all the time like i just i there's there should be no need to recover all the time um do you want to you want to before we get into topics do you want to do you want to talk about this uh nft thing or no so i just finished up my crypto week which was i talked about the last pod basically i took a week of time cancelled all my other meetings i said i'm going to go into i'm going to go neck deep in crypto what does that mean all these ideas i knew about but basically i wanted to go play with i wanted to go do right so if you think about like how you can participate in things you can sit on the sidelines and watch you can kind of uh you can kind of jump in and be a player but not not the driver you can participate or you can create and that's when you're really hands-on you're actually making [ __ ] happen so i wanted to create as much as possible this week i had already been on the sidelines watching i'd already been a participant there's a whole bunch of protocols and tools and ideas that i'd never done so anyways i had this idea and tell me what you think so i think we should create an nft and i s you know side note i created it it's ready to go if i just push this button um push it okay push it okay great so i created this nft called five minutes of fame and what it is it's a one-of-one token that anybody can own that gives you the right to five minutes of air time on our show now or anytime in the future you can hold this thing for five years if you think we're gonna be massive bit much bigger in five years just hold it it'll appreciate but once you use it and the way to use it is you burn it right so you own this token and it's only one of one and when you want to use it you send it to our wallet and that when you send it to our wallet we've received it that tells us this token has been burned the five minutes of fame now you can come on the show and you can hang with us talk with us and you can do whatever you want if you want to just repeat the name of your company for five straight minutes annoying but doable you could do it to promote your [ __ ] that way if you want to come brainstorm with us we like them ask questions you can do whatever you want as long as it's obviously not like you know vulgar or hateful or whatever not some like uncool [ __ ] you know like can they can they sell it they can sell it yeah so say somebody so i've started the floor price at 0.5 eth right so less than one ether i wanted to see how high this ends up going so i'm going to start the bidding there it's going to run for one week after this episode airs and when it's going to run for one week and so anybody can go on openc right now and i gotta figure out how you find it it's called five minutes of fame my first million and uh but i'll tweet it out too you gotta spell my first million it's just mfm now yeah yeah i'm gonna i'll i'm gonna change the title of it i'm also gonna put it in the show notes of this description so you go to openc if you don't know how to do nfts in openc there's a hard way to start but if you kind of know what this stuff's all about you know what we're doing here what we're doing is we're basically saying look money has always been like a frozen block of time right i go do a bunch of work i put in time i get money i go give that money to a restaurant i say hey thaw this frozen block of time out and uh you go work for a bit you you go you go spend some time for me make some food for me and then you know like that's how money trades hands it's just frozen blocks of time so what i did was i just took five minutes of air time and i froze it and i said anybody can buy this you can hold it you could use it or you could sell it you could flip it and i want to see what happens with this thing over time and i want to see if who buys it i want to see what they do with it i want to see if they use it or if they wait because our show's growing like 20 percent month over month 25 month over month so you know you wait a year and all of a sudden you're gonna have it's a bigger show it's a big it's a it's more valuable air time for you to go on and by the way we don't take sponsors anymore right we sold the show to a hubspot they're the only sponsors if you wanted to come sponsor a show and buy some air time you literally couldn't right now this is the only way and so i this is an experiment i don't know what's going to happen but i'm excited about it it was one of my things just make and mint an nft of my own that was part of my crypto week all right great i'll share it yeah i'll i'm going to wait for you to tweet it and then i'll i'll take lead on how you write it and then okay sounds good all right let's see what happens that's awesome uh yeah okay so what do you want to do let's do this let's do this in order so let's let's first do another story let's do this guy who took our stripe for vice idea which was a long time ago so he's i don't know i don't know if i buy it okay we'll we'll preface it with this might be total [ __ ] right sounds a little made up sounds a little bit fanfictiony but uh i'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt so okay so so we said this idea i don't even know how long ago maybe a year ago which was uh my friend our mutual friend sully had this idea and i i brought it to the podcast which was uh stripe for vice verse ventures right so what does that mean so stripe is a payment processing uh platform so if you want to take payments on your website you use stripe but the problem is stripe has like many payment processors like paypal like others terms and conditions which basically say you can't use this if you're cannabis if you're crypto if you're um you know porn if you're all these different use cases and so um the idea was to build a product you know clone the product quality and developer friendliness of stripe but have your terms and conditions open and this is like kind of a strategic move because one of the best ways to compete against the big monopolies is not to do what they're not doing now right a lot of people do this they pitch us an idea that says oh you know you know twitch isn't focused on this right now music so we're gonna do twitch for music it's like yeah but you know they could if they wanted to yeah especially if you proved it out they could do that or facebook doesn't have you know doesn't let you see this so i'm going to add this feature okay but they could easily add that whereas whereas these are they can't do it because it would go against it would threaten their core business so stripe can't type might even the the ceo might say hey i think cannabis is great but he can't do it because it's going to threaten his relationships with his banking partners and so it'll put the core big valuable business at risk which is why you're actually safe going and pursuing this because they're just not gonna do it in the same way that um like only fans is safe because it's something instagram will never do instagram could have all those same models on there but they will never release this feature which lets you pay for kind of this locked locked not safe for content because it threatens their advertising business with their clean with coca-cola and whoever else and so terms and conditions is actually an amazing way to compete against big successful incumbents go do what they explicitly say they won't do um and they can't do so okay anyways there's this guy on twitter the name is skyler mr schuyler is his hand and he says public service announcement for all the my first million pod fans from stealing ideas from the pod don't play short-term games because take it from me i took their stripe for vice idea i grew it to a business doing over 400 000 a month in 60 days in less than 60 days and then i got pushed out by literal gangsters i wish i was joking here's the story anyway so he tells a story he basically says he looked at stripes terms of service and it said you can't do get rich quick schemes you can't do cannabis you can't do a mug shot publication or pay to remove websites so he's like great that's my prospecting list i will just make a list of these companies that do exactly those things and i'll start cold emailing like crazy he's like and then in parallel i went i went to galileo and synapse and i tried to find payment providers infrastructure companies that would let me do this they both said no so then i called some like new fintech companies they also said no it's like but then i went and i found this small like canadian bank that i had used in the past like a local bank and it turns out for a monthly fee they'll work with it will work with me great and so then he sets it up and he starts getting like online dispensaries cannabis companies start using them and this is where it gets a little bit weird like that business is working but one of the dispensary companies i guess like that he knew that was super profitable like they needed help and he's like oh they asked me to come on board and i didn't really understand this bar did you get this he like basically joins their company uh he joins their company or something like that and um anyways it starts making 400 000 a month and he's like you know i moved into a dope condo in vancouver downtown vancouver i fly first class to turks and caicos i spent 13 000 a night at this hotel and you know he goes the girl i'm seeing is now running around with the fake senate a new set of fake titty somewhere i wish i had saved this money but instead i was spending it right and then he's like so this is where this part of the story sounded a little unbelievable because i don't think you would even be balling out that much on this small this little amount of money but i guess some people just don't don't say it so maybe anyways he um he says you know the company that they were buying product from which is like a publicly listed company is run by crooked gangsters they started harassing me and my family blah blah blah i ended up paying them i don't know i met up with them with a bag of cash and i told them to leave my family alone and i left the business forever and uh yeah that's my story of you know i i've traded peace of mind i traded my money for for peace of not peace of mind and here's what i love subscribe to my newsletter i so i'm i'm good i googled this guy a bunch uh he i think he's full of it this is just maybe i i think that maybe there's like some truth here like maybe he tried to start this maybe like someone sketchy emailed him and that's about it yeah it definitely seems like the bag of cash i met them in a park and they told me uh are you lying bro are you lying is this is this you lying i think you're lying so i don't know i don't know if he's lying or not he needs to show some receipts if he wants us to uh to fully vouch for it but i thought it's an entertaining story nonetheless i think that actually like more people should lie to be honest i don't know why more people don't lie whenever i'm on the internet and i'm like talking about stuff anonymously i always tell the truth like like what a great zag everybody else is all about honesty you know what lying underwriting i never lie a lot like i'll comment like in different posts and they'll say like like just ridiculous stuff and i'm like no no like i've done this before like here like just like on a random fox news thread or or on reddit i'm like no that's not true for this reason that reason and i'll explain my personal experience i never lie but i think a lot more people should lie you could look cool yeah i don't think more people should lie because as somebody who used to lie it's uh it's really exhausting what did you lie about dude i used to like i used to exaggerate so you know i used to do everything that i wouldn't call a lot but if you look back it's a lie right like i would exaggerate or somebody thinks something and i like let it run i'm like oh yeah i'm not going to correct that i'm going to let you run with this mistake and assumption i didn't lie you got it wrong and i didn't i didn't correct you that's not my fault and so there's all these little things like that or i don't know like it would just be where it was always like insecurity so it's like you know if i wanted to seem cooler smarter richer more successful than i was i was willing to kind of like embellish or lead somebody on it the wrong way or whatever and um and maybe i still do sometimes i don't really know i don't want to say like i've completely gotten rid of it i can't remember the last time i did that but i definitely remember a point in time about five years ago where i was like i'm just not gonna lie anymore i'm just gonna actually say what the situation is and then i'm gonna let the chips fall where they may and it was so freeing and uh relief it was like just relief because um somebody who said this once they they go like in programming there's this thing where like any time an application slows down one of the one of the reasons that people will say if you talk to programmers they're like oh you know it's like a threading problem or like there's a multi-thread problem and what it means is basically there's like multiple processes running at once and they start to like use up all the memory of the computer and basically that's what happens in your head when you lie is your brain has to keep two threads open there's the thread that basically is like what i said and then there's the truth and you constantly have to keep track of what you said versus the truth in order to like maintain the lie and so that becomes like having two processes running in your head just drains you of energy is what i found so i don't lie anymore but i think you're right that in the short term there's a big benefit to lying um which is like you know like most people can't figure it out most people don't don't check you even the people who do check you just like their voice is like small compared to the most people that will just take in a fake value right like fake news i think is popular for a reason like i've done stuff like i've bought i bought my car so i bought my car it was a it was over it was six figures and i bought it i saw a picture of it online and it was like three hours away and i called the guy and i go hey what's up uh you got this car i go great i'll send you the money right now will you drive it over in a few days and i just why it was all done on myself on the car i just wired on the money and he brought it to me a days later and i've done that so many times motorcycles vehicles i buy [ __ ] all the time and i'll just say like yeah i'll just give you the money now don't sell it and so many people are honest and i'm in my head i'm like everything would be so much more profitable but way worse if like you can get away with lying you can you can totally get away with it and most people never do it and it does shock me uh all right and we'll end that segment there um all right let's go let's do another one uh you want to do an idea i got something yes yeah okay so this idea this comes from ben so ben gave me this idea today and i like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna burn you hard on this one so keep going okay good good um figs for construction okay so for those who don't know what figs is figs is a a brand that came out that basically was making like cooler looking scrubs medical scrubs so the stuff that doctors and nurses wear those little blue outfits that were like kind of traditionally like well it's all blue the same color of blue they're all kind of baggy and they all kind of look shitty and here you have these people that are like working really hard they wear this stuff all day it's kind of like their identity it's like their uniform and um and they make good money there doctors make good money and yeah why are they wearing this stuff and so figs came out i think it started with nurses and they just started making like better fitting so it didn't look as baggy and loose a little more flattering and they had some different colors and patterns that you could have for your scrubs and we we talked about them right i think right when they got going yeah like pretty early on we talked about them and fast forward now a couple we're two years into the pod um things is a public company now wow seven billion dollars seven billion dollar market cap if you go read any of the articles it's like why figs is the next lululemon why it's the next nike why figs is a starbucks for scrubs it's like they just put companies sexy brand sphinx is several years old i think fig's like probably eight years old or something uh figs found good let's see and the woman who started it does not look like the woman who would start she i mean she looks like a like a like a fashion like a supermodel oh really okay that's like i would have thought like i guess a nurse in my head like she's wearing like fancy ass [ __ ] in her picture so so figgs is yeah i think i got it right eight years old i went public at 4 billion it's now 7 billion and um and i think what what is it so so there's this guy thomas tull who i didn't know but he's the founder of legendary pictures he had sold that to a chinese company for three and a half billion dollars and uh and he was the majority shareholder and so i think he owned 58 of figs at the time of ipo which is kind of a ludicrous amount of a public company to own and then uh you know is this the person you talk about heather heather hassan yeah you see like in a lot of her photos she looks like she's like i was like uh she just looks like a like a she's in what's the equivalent of gq for women i don't know i'm an idiot but you know what i mean vogue like she's wearing vogue i don't know she's wearing she just look i would just imagine someone wearing a nurse's outfit he put 50 million in in 2018 and became a majority owner so 2018 is when he puts 50 million in become buys you know 58 percent three years later goes public at a 4.4 billion valuation so his 50 million turned into 2.2 million of equity value so good on him um okay so anyways so basically the uh okay so the idea here so figs seven billion dollar market cap i think it does just over a quarter billion dollars so over 250 million dollars of revenue a year i couldn't find the exact number quickly during my last minute research here but here's the idea figs for construction so how many other industries have a large workforce that kind of needs specialty clothing for doing what they do and today they have like a generic default and um and maybe you can build a sexier ddc brand like figs for construction so this is the idea um this is the idea thanks for construction you know construction workers have a lot of different things that they wear listen i know that you don't know who dolly parton is and you're just so disconnected to like normal amer americans it's called carhartt you dummy this is a thing i've been wearing this for years and it's awesome google carhartt obviously there's brands that do durable you know rugged wear no carhartt is like i remember as a kid like we used to go to the hardware that sounds like i'm real redneck but i'm not that redneck but when you go to the hardware store and you get a coat and you get a carhartt carhartt is like it's like the thing it's so like and it's even like cute now like they've like cutified it so now if you're in college and you're in like a country area the hot girls will wear like car overalls and that's like they're like cute now they have like carhartt louis vuitton collabs okay so when did car heart start carhartt started in 1889. is this the company you're talking about yes it's coming from it's bro i'm talking about building a modern day thing you're talking about this 1800s it's modern at this point they've they've revolutionized it like go to carhartt fall collection they've got like a whole like cute kid like it looks like a [ __ ] like the kids are wearing cars and vans and doing everything yeah bro for modernizing they totally changed it it's like yeah carhartt is like it's like it's like cool now i mean it all it was like the workers man thing just said where's the business here's the mistake you're making first of all you're yelling in the mic that's a mistake for the podcast second second of all uh the mistake you're making he's thinking that because something exists that that's not how e-commerce works bro economics i agree i agree on clone crime it's just one oh this works great i'll do it too thank you take my piece of the pie and uh and so this working tells me nothing more than that this is a even better idea for somebody to go start look i agree i agree to say oh does does this exist like that's a dumb we always get those dm's all the time why doesn't this exist i'm like i don't know and it doesn't matter it probably does yeah it probably does it has to just do it or don't do it but whether something does or doesn't it doesn't matter but i just gotta check you for a minute acting like you're like coming up with this oh we should just do figs for construction where like dude there is an opportunity for somebody to do this and by the way i'm looking at their stuff and they definitely have a lot of the like like there's like this i don't even know what you call this thing this like you know it's like super yellow neon jacket that's like you know you're not a fireman but you wear this for some reason so so uh they definitely have a lot of the pieces but when i was going down the rabbit hole of looking at what what what are all the things that basically outdoor workers wear whether you're on you know you're in a shale fracking you know field or you're doing construction of homes or you know it doesn't really matter which which version of these but it's like there's a premium to be placed on super rugged durable shoes but also mud shoes but also heavy jackets there's a towel that goes on your neck that's a cooling towel there's like this whole line of stuff and the reason i think this might be bigger and better than figs is if you look at carhartt or duluth which are a couple of companies that do this i think they're both like 600 million plus in annual sales duluth i looked up before this there are 638 million in annual sales it's only got a 500 million dollar market cap so double the revenue of figs so and you know what's duluth one-tenth of the market cap duluth trading company is another it's like carhartt um their d2c business is growing 70 year-over-year so it's a it's obviously like where where the action is versus all their retail retail shops and so i think you could come in i think you could build a new brand in this space and get acquired by delivery get acquired by carhart these multi-billion dollar companies as just another another brand and you know there's an existing d2c playbook that's like some combination of facebook and instagram ads influencers blah blah blah like cutesy colors nice packaging all that good stuff and i think you would want to not do so cutesy here for for the rugged wear but i think there's an opportunity to create a pretty iconic brand here i wouldn't be surprised for somebody to do to do yeti coolers for this carhartt brand right like i think there's a yeti coolers type of brand to be built in this space do you remember land's end did you ever shop there as a kid like your parents get like you don't remember land monument in san francisco uh well yeah but yeah it is but it's also like uh it's a store like remember east bay as a kid like easter everybody it lands then so it's american made clothing basically you probably know what their boots are so if you google lands in and then the word duck it'll probably with it's called the duck boot you definitely know what that looks like it's like the traditional like snow boot that you wear as a kid and it's way popular now again land zen i was just is another thing it's just like duluth but yeah these companies are trading for crazy low 1.5 billion dollars in sales 800 million market cap yeah i don't know why their multiples suck so bad and that just kind of shows me that figs is figs's story the thing i talked about at the beginning like we are you know starbucks for scrubs what does that even [ __ ] mean that means nothing that's just words uh you know we're nike we're lululemon we're kids we're the next one you know that's the story yeah that's true it is just words that's just words that's that's a good diss to anybody at any time by the way those are just words immediate shutdown yeah so i think they're you know i don't know if they're overvalued or what but they're definitely like trading outside of their categories but you need to do if you're gonna do this so construction is interesting if land's end is interesting because it was like midwestern people but you have to do like a brand and a niche where you feels like us against the world so nurses feel it's predominantly women so they already have that little like segment of like you know we're we're the underdog nurses they probably think that they're overworked underpaid so you got that vibe going and it's like look we're overworked we're underpaid this thing's going to make us look good and actually feel good that's we that's the least we deserve you know what i mean so so you ha it's been far better you got to go with this angle of this group who feel downtrodden brand that we talked about that's the like america grunt grunt style grunt work what is it called i don't know what you're talking about what do you what do you mean grail no it's called grunt style so go to gruntstyle.com i think we talked about them no what's that it's it's a us against the world um you know proud for the we are proud of the police we are people oh yeah these guys like kill us proud of our country we we don't you know vaccine you know you can stick your vaccine here uh that's the vibe you get when you go to grunt style and you know it's very much a us against them flags flying everywhere using american ip basically to build the brand right like here's a whiskey glass with two cross rifles you know uh you know here's a here's a here's a hat that looks like it's been used for for you know 10 years that's the type of stuff they said this company crushes i think they do over 100 million in sales this company you know alone so so i definitely think that us versus them is a it's a turbo charge when it comes to marketing especially for especially for d2c um all right can i can we can i tell you about an idea so this one has this is weird how i got to this but basically i am interested like my dream there's this guy named george barber george barber in the early 1900s his father started a dairy farm and eventually george barber took it over now george is either dead or in his like 90s i can't remember if he's dead or not and he sold his dairy farm based out of uh arkansas or alabama barbarella i forget and he sold it for like five or six hundred million dollars and he crushed it and with a lot of that money he opened this thing called barber uh barb the barber museum and he created a f1 race track in alabama and now um if you are motors they do for motorcycle race races they do it for uh f1 races for nascar all types of stuff you can they people from all over the world go to watch races there and now he has got the largest collection of motorcycles in the world and the way that he set it up and is how the way that a lot of these places set up so have you ever been in like a small town or or somewhere outside of san francisco and you see like a car museum and it's usually just like one person that owns it it's just like a rich guy who like sets it up but they okay let's pretend i have yeah too american for you but anyway they set up a they set it up as non-profits and so you can actually go and like see their assets and stuff and so that interested me anyway i just got really interested because i want to own a [ __ ] load of cars i want to own like historical memorabilia and the way that you do it in a tax advantageous way is you create a museum and so i went down this little rabbit hole have you heard of this company of like basically i've i went down this rabbit hole of places that you can go to just to see interesting [ __ ] and like that's all you're doing you're just sightseeing and you just leave and you pay a little money and that just got me interested have you heard of meow wolf meow wolf sounds familiar let me just let me look it up what is it okay i put their deck in here so i came across their deck it's an old deck it's from 2017. and what meow wolf is it started in 2008 in santa fe and it started as a a a place to explore immersive art what the hell does that mean like that like that does a very who the hell knows that could be anything and so basically what it is is they would rent out these massive old warehouses in santa fe and i believe also in las vegas and they would hire these artists who typically don't make any money and they would say hey come and make stuff here at our place and we're going to create like not quite a museum but almost like a haunted house meets a museum meets circus soleil and and you pay like 50 and you just walk through and it's like an immersive feeling it's very challenging to explain but do you see the pictures yeah i'm looking at it you i think you described it pretty well it's like like the haunted house meets kind of like uh a you know like some kind of rave i mean it's like a museum and it this this thing got me interested because i was like i want to own like a warehouse and finance it with this stuff and just collect cool [ __ ] but uh guess how much revenue these guys well guess how big this business is um let's just say 50 million a year so they've raised like i believe 250 million dollars and they projected that just one of their locations will make close to 40 million a year in sales and they're having like over a dozen locations throughout the country is that freaking nuts would you ever have thought that how old is this is this like was it started like in like this yeah oh wait okay and so they opened one in las vegas in 2021 and they already sold 500 000 tickets for it then they're opening one in denver they're uh going to austin they're going to los angeles it's crazy is this it's just a crazy crazy crazy business and they said that their projections for the the santa fe location uh sorry their awesome projections were 60 million in revenue 30 million in profit off one location right what would you uh like how do they get people to come to these what what is it like what's the what's the marketing to get to sell 500 000 of these tickets like obviously there's some word of mouth and stuff like that because it's a pretty remarkable looking thing but do these guys advertise like crazy do you like you have their deck do you see much about like their growth like i put the deck in the i put the girl i put the deck in the zen caster thing by the way so you have it um but oh it's locked uh i think i don't have access um and so yeah sorry about that and so what they do is um they team up so they teamed up with santa fe the government of santa fe so the government of santa fe was like funneling people to them if you google meow wolf santa fe they even put together a um they even put together a like study an economic study to show how much meow wolf is helping the local area and so they team up with with local governments and that helps them like so like they funnel people in there but i actually don't know i don't think they do a significant amount of paid advertising i've not seen it anywhere right yeah i think that uh i'm really into this idea and by the way i see they have a bunch of facebook ads on so i don't know how much they're spending but they definitely are running a bunch of facebook ads and they look pretty cool because the exhibits are cool so i'm pretty into this idea um and i feel like there's a whole bunch of different niches you could go with this that are like hyper um have like hyper engagement and so i think there's you know if you just go city by city and you say all right what what could i do that's a pop up here that would um be able to consistently draw people so i think i told you about this once but there was this um what's it called two-bit circus are you familiar with two-bit circuits no what's that so so look it up it's um it's like the number two you know like two two-bit circus i think this is the name of it so there's a guy who um [Music] okay so the guy who invented chuck e cheese his name's nolan whatever his name is his son or grandson i don't know which one um bush some bushel bushnell or whatever their names are his son or grandson created this thing called two-bit circus right so so grandpa maybe or dad creates chucky cheese this person created stupid circus and what 2-bit circus was was basically like a traveling pop-up museum like this but it was all for like interactive um like kind of like technology so like imagine like like if this is like kind of like a haunted house vibe this is like you know you're in the year 2050 watch this like move your hand this laser will move and follow you oh okay kids come into this room look at this like with one small mirror you can reflect light and create this like crazy thing or put on this vr thing and play dance dance revolution you'll feel like you're in space dancing or whatever right like just a whole bunch of high-tech kind of like attractions um that existed and they would take this from city to city and the video made it look like dude i want to take my kids here this looks like so much fun and unlike those other ones that have like a fixed location this would pop up a tent and they would run this thing and in one weekend they would have like 60 000 people in the bay area come through um you know like in a four-day period or whatever and then they would like pack up the tent and they would go hit the road and i thought this is like a genius idea and the guy who i knew who was working with them he was kind of like an exec there he was like dude this is a it's an amazing product he's like but uh you know the founders have kind of like shiny object syndrome they you know they want to do this and then like uh you know like whoever like you know facebook will say oh we want to do a private exhibit and they'll be like cool we're going to create the most epic thing ever or obama wants to have us for a party so like hey everybody like forget the like systematized process that we could just grow repeatedly like let's blow everyone's mind with this thing at burning man and like just let's let's create something nobody's ever seen and they would go do that he's like dude it's like so annoying like we just can't stay focused but what ever since i saw this idea like i don't know when this was seven eight years ago i first heard this idea this two-bit circus thing i just thought it was such a cool smart idea and i was so i'm shocked i don't see more of this where this traveling circus where it's a pop-up tent that maybe leverages science or technology because i think parents care to take their kids there and i think science and technology naturally make for great exhibits and demos and like learning learning plus like visual stimulation like if you just think back to like science fair or a science class with a volcano exploding or whatever like basically that on steroids and i feel like that's a pretty big thing but you know these are hard businesses to do i would never go try to do one of these because uh yeah they're hard but they seem i don't like events either but this is a little bit different than an event but uh it does seem cool speaking of events let me tell you about something so i got dinner uh the other day with jason my friend who runs this thing called blockworks and he had just hosted an event any and i asked them for i go can you tell me numbers so i could talk about the pod because i think it's interesting so scroll down to the bottom and you'll see we're scroll down past where it says digital asset summit you see it yep i see it okay so uh this is jason he's got this company called blockworksblackworks.com it's like the hustle but for uh crypto um so two day conference that he just hosted recently uh it did uh two million in revenue he said he told me it did about 50 in profit 800 attendees ticket costs one to two thousand dollars and uh and then they're doing another event he has another event coming out in may of so uh uh uh in about what's that six months eight months and their goal is eight million in revenue with five thousand attendees and then most recently he did a and a digital or this is not even a physical conference right uh the eight million dollar one is and the digital asset one yeah it's it's it's uh like you go there you see people yeah yeah it's live okay and then he most recently did one called uh i think it's called brenton woods and that's for where he basically he had 200 people come and or maybe like 100 people come and they were basically large asset managers and all they did was talked about crypto and uh he it did close to a million in revenue and they only had four sponsors and it seemed like a pretty sick event and i was just talking to him and we were at dinner and i was just i was just like just tell me everything that everyone said like what are the takeaways and i thought a few things one i think jason's only 26. so kudos to this [ __ ] guy for building this business uh and second what a great hack i mean just to like get the it gets get the intel from the best minds in the world and like he's smart but he's just the he's not smart enough to predict the future like you know you could if you sit around with 200 people who are asset managers for you know the oregon state pension fund things like that right um pretty amazing that he pulled this off yeah this job shout out to him this is like well this is what i would call crushing it right you have this new wave of technology and you say all right i'm gonna go be the hustle or be whoever i'm gonna be the hustle for for crypto and then on the events side it's basically a win-win win right you do one of these events you make money you get to rub shoulders with all the most interesting people that's going to open up a whole bunch of other doors that you don't even need to think about ahead of time and then all of them are going to like think highly of block work subscribe to it pay for your premium stuff like tell their you know tell their employees about it that sort of thing as they go and in doing so you're promoting that you're evangelizing crypto amongst these like really wealthy people who will start betting on it and it'll grow crypto which will just make your business more popular plus your individual holdings more popular so it's like win win on top a win for a 26 year old i think that's very very impressive um i think by the way this is a thing anybody can replicate not just in crypto okay this is like let's say i'll call this a home run and it's in crypto but i think there's a lot of people listening to this that would be happy with you know half or or a third or a fourth of the type of success of this and i think you could achieve that with in any profession so it's like take any niche whether it's like gaming or like in venture capital right like we have rolling funds like why isn't somebody just doing this with all the vcs constantly like i know chamath tweeted this out the other day he goes hey uh yeah solo solo gps that are out there if i organize like an event or retreat for all of us to get to know each other hey we're all solo gps right but if you just said new vcs right you could be at the bottom you could be some associate somewhere or not even have a job in venture capital and you could arrange the kind of like next gen the next wave vc thing where you invite all the new people to vc to this badass retreat you know in wine country or wherever where it's like we're all off the grid we're going to do some cool stuff there's going to be some speakers you're glamping whatever it is you would be able to make a couple million dollars network with every single person you want to and you'd kind of have that little mini industry in the palm of your hands i've seen people do this with digital marketing and every niche there's this guy uh or our friend nick went to went to this thing the other day and it's got a great name it's called capital camp and i believe it's in columbia missouri where i'm from and i forget the guy oh brett brett started it i think brett b sure yeah yeah i don't know if he runs it or what the deal is anymore i think they started it yeah they started it and it was like it's hard to explain what the niche is but i totally know what it is or who would go but it's basically at this point we talked last week about the circle of people on twitter who tweet about finance and tech and real estate it's kind of this group of people who talk about real estate and sweaty and uh blue collar businesses on twitter and they all go to capital camp and it's like ten thousand dollars i think private equity is like the bucket but then like nick's not really private equity he's like self storage uh but like you know he'll go to capital camp so that's you're right it's basically private equity is the big umbrella and then like any kind of sweaty business or uh like cash flowing things or reset real estate business kind of non you know non-fancy fancy-schmancy tech basically and it costs 10 grand to go and nick went and he said it was totally worth it and and the people who i know who go they say it's totally worth it and they're going to go back every year and it probably made a good i bet you it made uh it probably made a little bit of profit but in a fair amount of revenue yeah i'm gonna spin up like a mini one of these um i've one that i'm gonna do for club ltv which is my like e-commerce likes all store owners who do between one and a hundred million in revenue um basically i'm gonna do a retreat for them which is just my own excuse to do something fun i'm not really going to try to like make a profit off of it but as long as they cover all the costs of hosting everything that'll be great and so i'm going to do this in the e-commerce niche but i just feel like you could do this across like just in the two two of the camps that we were in right uh startup investing and and i'm in e-commerce i think you could do this in either one of those and have you know have fun profits big build your network all that stuff it just takes it just takes hustle which unfortunately i don't have that much hustle anymore all my hustle goes to my kids now there's no no you will soon i think let me tell you something really quick i ha so you're you're you've been angel investing longer than i have um uh i would not claim that i'm like nearly as good as you or some of our friends but i um two things i did i did these two things in 2019 um one of them just 50xed nice and one of them just uh 12x amazing on paper or or exited already i'm paid actually i know one of them the the the 50x i know it's on paper the other one paper yeah they're both on paper so they're not real but i i i feel good because because this whole angel investing thing you just you spend you spend you spend and i'm like is this ever going to work i'm just spending all of this money it's just leaving my bank account i don't even know if it's there and when you count it as part of your net worth like i pretty much don't i'm like oh this sucks what's going to happen and we'll see like if it starts actually hatching those eggs are hatching okay so let me tell you i have something related to this so i texted a friend who i won't say their name um but they're they're an investor they've been doing this much longer than me angel investing seed investing that sort of thing vc personally all they've done it all do i know them i don't think so and um and so they they've done very very well bunch of eggs a bunch of winners that are like public companies that we know about which is like you know the that's the that's like as high as it goes basically and so multiple winners like that so i texted him i said i say hey i gotta ask you a question i said feel free to just brush this off if you don't want to tell me but i'm not asking to be nosy i'm asking because i'm trying to weigh out my options here and i said you know in terms of investing you've basically done as good as anyone as good as i could hope to do right like i would say you have done extremely well it's kind of like best case scenario type of outcome and what does that mean personally in terms of what you end up making i said here's what my guess here's what my guess is tell me if i'm if i'm on point or if i'm off and i basically said i thought can you can you give all the numbers because the person's anonymous yeah i'm going to say the numbers so i said i think that you probably will make 15 to 30 million dollars over a kind of 10 to 15 year period of investing so it takes probably probably you don't see any of it till 10 plus years but between 10 and 20 years you're gonna make i don't know 20 to 30 million dollars and that's that payday at the end of the day and i think along the way you're making half a million bucks cushy kind of like off the management fees your salary i said is that about wait oh this person has a fund they have done many things so they've invested personally as an angel they've been a vc at a big fund they now i think kind of like our solo gp maybe have their own fun maybe it's personal i don't really know i don't know all the details but they've done both i said either way along the way yeah they're not it's not i'm not saying from their personal money they've had other people's money right opm they've always been using opm or they've definitely been using opm for a lot of it right maybe some of it was angel money but now it's a lot of opm so i said all right um am i right uh so first like let me let me ask you to guess do you think they said that's right that's low or that's high okay so 10 years they've been doing it let's call it 15 years they've been doing it for 15 15 years and they've been using other people's money for most of it yeah how much money did they invest i can't tell you over under 100. um [Music] let's say they they're they're a seed investor they're early they're early stages i understand i would say i didn't check that might be like as low as 100k and maybe high as 500k or a minute and it was their fault a full-time job for 10 years yeah this is what they do my guess is way above 15. that i'm low my guess was low i would guess like 40 or 50. yeah so you're right that my guess was low so what they said was they go yes it should be much more than that but it's hard to say because a lot of it's still a liquid they go uh they go it should look more like hundred fifty to two hundred no way [Music] um yeah and this person this person they're not a boaster but they are one of the best of the best meaning their portfolio you could stack up against pretty much anybody like obviously if you hit one like you know i was you know the lead investor in google okay yeah you're gonna have like the outside but i'm saying this person has multiple like you know almost i don't know more than five somewhere somewhere around 10 like known big winners and so i'm like okay cool but you know you don't know what round how much they invested like in each of those right so look at that look at the message is that the person no that's not the person so um so so basically i was like whoa that okay that's a lot more and have they made money along the way other than their management fee or their salary uh well just like you know the exits as they as they come through as they do trickle in yeah so like you know first five years not much next five years some next five years a whole bunch but you're recycling and you're reinvesting so you know you always have kind of a new batch of companies that you're waiting you know you want these things to age 10 years for you to go get a big win out of them um you always have a new vintage right when i did 20 20 i want to i want to go uncork that bottle in 2030 and see how it tastes oh my god sorry uh is your ringtone a duck yeah it's [ __ ] up country [ __ ] dude that sounds like the hunting duck call you used to attract animals i don't know i just liked it i just wanted to be a duck i just like them i just like that noise um so wait so this person but are they investing their own money so so what i told them i go i go wow so that's basically like you started you're like a founder of a billion dollar company if you're gonna net 100 million to 200 million dollars uh at the end of this that kind of like this journey this career i said you know it sounds like it happens a little bit slower but you're making more money and way easier way less way easier it's way easier like way easier not even close yeah exactly and what did they say um they were like i mean they were like they're so humble that they're kind of like trying to deflect they were like well you know tell me how you're thinking about it so i can help you here right because they're like you know what are you asking me all this [ __ ] for and like you know i don't enough about me i've done well but like let me help you if you're trying to get some help out of this and all i really wanted to know was like what's the size of the prize if you knock this out of the park and like what's the real what's the real nuts like what really comes through at the end of the day like for somebody who's because you know any time you go into something there's like you know you could i can go read about real estate i'm not a big real estate investor i can go read about real estate i could talk oh yeah you're gonna make this much gross this much net you've got to cap rate blah blah it's like then you talk to somebody's been doing it for 25 years like yeah but like you're you know all these hidden costs you're not accounting for all this extra heartache you're not accounting for all this extra stress and then you know one of the four buildings you know burns up in a fire and you have to account for that loss so there's always the reality first what was your takeaway though like what did you do what did he what did you what i wasn't looking i i wasn't like trying to make a decision on anything i was just thinking where's your head at though my head is basically like surprised frankly that that it can be that big um and again this person's not a boaster i'm pulling this information out i think they were just doing me a favor of being honest about what they think this nets in the end and i was like wow the reality though is do i believe i can have the same hit rate as them no uh like i think they have had like an ex they have extreme skill and extreme luck and so it's like okay and they do this full time right so it's like i'm not planning for that but i like knowing what what winning looks like today or what is the top top range of winning look like uh so i was pretty impressed by that so that was kind of my my takeaway or something you know something i learned kind of from i don't remember what you were talking about before you talk about your your your multiples and so yeah it's pretty pretty impressive but i would say you know that that's on a large amount of invest capital i should also say that you know it's much more capital than i'm investing because they've done it for longer and they write bigger checks yeah it's way more boring but it's definitely way easier and that's the show right yeah all right we're out of here [Music] never looking back

what's the most annoying thing in the world an unhappy billionaire and i think he said something like that i was like wow that's so true actually like if he came to me about being glum and whatever it would be hard for me and my initial reaction to be like dude you have it i all like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right let's get into it you ready yeah ah all right what's going on not too much um can i tell you uh a quick story that i just read i love when we start with the story the last the last story uh got rave reviews big reaction for the psychedelic story oh did it great all right let me tell you a quick one this isn't about me though and i'm and i'm actually reading the book called story worthy because you told me it was a good book but uh and so i haven't read it enough that i'm gonna implement what it's what i've learned so don't have your high expectations but i'm reading the biography of the wright brothers do you know who they are of course that's the airplane well you didn't know who dolly was first people to to have a flying plane yeah that's good yeah the the wright brothers they uh they created like insulin right um so wilbur wright was like the smart was like the smart brother or he was like the lead brother and when he was in high school he was very smart he was gonna go to yale he was like the it was gonna be a big deal and he was an athlete and he was out one night playing hockey in the neighborhood uh he lived in ohio dayton ohio where it was really cold in the winter and you could you could play ice hockey on the lakes and he was playing and this kid comes from behind him and smacks him in the face with a stick and he knocks out most of his teeth he breaks his jaw and he has digestive problems for years and he's basically like not in a coma but he's like he doesn't he doesn't leave his house for four years the guy who hit him his name is um like howard howard hoth or something like that and he this guy this kid who hit him one of the reasons why it's hypothesized why he hit him is this kid had been suffering from a cold or some type of flu for a really long time and the at the time they gave him this medicine that was cocaine-based and so basically he was like a drug addict at a young age and he was a bully he was known to be a bully and he smacked uh wilbur right the face really bad no one knows if it was on accident if it was on purpose turns out years later this guy who hit him uh turns out to be one of the first serial killers based out of ohio and he's put to death because he kills like 20 people so he was like a bad guy for for from since the beginning and he hits wolver right in the face and so wilbur wright was gonna go to yale that year and he ends up not going to yale he kind of uh he was like a good student but he wasn't like a homebody like he had since now become and he was like that for four or seven years and so he basically locked himself in his room because he was having digestive problems he was embarrassed because his teeth was all [ __ ] up and he just felt horrible for years and years it's not like there was like they didn't like do surgery on this and they didn't have like amazing pain pills for you so he just had to suffer and in that time he started reading a lot and he actually like read a book on bicycles and he got really interested in bicycles at the time someone bought him like a toy plane that was kind of like a kite but it was like a plane and he started getting really fascinated with mechanics and fascinated with planes and once he once he healed he decided i'm gonna this is gonna be my life this is what i'm going to do is instead of going to yale like i was going to do him become a doctor his i believe his father was the doctor he goes i'm going to study mechanics and i'm going to create a bicycle shop and then from a bicycle shop he says i want to create a glider and then eventually i'm going to create a plane and it all started with getting hit in the face and it like like with a debilitating hit in the face and he thought that his life was over and i love stories where you think it's all over you have so much uh uh adversity in front of you and that totally shifts the outcome i had that one time when i got fired from a job when i moved out here i had nothing i was like i don't know what's gonna happen so i ended up starting my first company but i love that story and i wanted to bring that up because i love when when bad things happen and and i've gone through it enough times that i'm like don't worry this bad thing well right it might lead to something really amazing have you ever had something like that where it led to something where you're like my life's over well okay you know not the wall not wilbur wright level so first i have a few questions about the world right so what's the other brother so if wilbur's the smart brother who overcame you know this debilitating smack in the mouth what's the other brother story um well i'm only halfway through the book but they they get along they get along quite well the younger brother's a little bit more gregarious and a little bit more outgoing and so wilbur is the calculating one orville's the one who says um hey all right that's a great idea let's go do it let's go so they find out that there's this place and here's another amazing part of the story so they just talk to friends they talk to officials they go where is there a place that has a lot of open land that's windy and it gets they talk to the for some reason i don't know why at the time but the postmaster knew of a good place and that postmaster connected them to another postmaster in kitty hawk which was dayton to kitty hawk i don't know the exact exact distance but without a car it's a massive trek and the boat brothers are like you know screw it let's do it so they go out there and they knock on doors and they find someone to house them and let them camp on their land for four weeks at a time while they test their stuff and it was so like this is why i love america the postmaster of kitty hawk was like yeah you know this whole flight thing i don't think it's gonna work but like i give you my thumbs up go out and do it no one will bother you we got you if anyone bothers you bothers you holler at us there was so little bureaucracy i loved it but uh orville uh was more a little bit more outgoing and pushed wilbur who was the more calculating brother and you said from the beginning because i knew they had a bicycle shop but that you're saying from the beginning you said i'm going to do bicycle then eventually i'm going to make a plane or did that just happen it's like you know um toby from shopify creates creates a snowboard shop online for his snowboard company and then creates shopify but he didn't think to himself first i'm going to do this then i'm going to build a platform that will have millions of stores on it it just sort of happened that way so which one was it was it was it a master plan or was it uh you know what progressive ambition it was progressive ambition so basically he saw this plane his toy glider that he had and he always thought that that was interesting and but he just kind of let it sit in the back of his brain and then he got into bicycles first he started a a pressing prince a pressing a print press where he made his own newspaper and then he's like this is kind of cool but they learned about bicycles and like this new cycle technology is amazing we gotta get into that and again start getting that and he's like you know what the key to riding a bike is the the that's how you balance and he started staring at birds and he started looking at this old glider that he had and like man that balance is the same thing like that's so important i bet we can translate that to this you know this dream i've always had of flying i bet you it's actually quite similar and so they just they they they kind of carried it over and uh and i think there was like a bunch of other teams that were way better funded working on this at the same time and i think they just beat the other teams to manned flight by like four months or something very a very thin margin where they go down in history and nobody remembers the second crew that made it is that right well i'm not that far along but throughout the book now they have guys saying hey i'm friends with andrew carnegie i can get you guys some money do you want some funding we can get you we can get you about 200 000 a year which is probably like two or three million now and they go no no our cycle shop is making enough profits we can we can afford it which they really like they they kind of could afford it like as in barely but they would they would they would go to kitty hawk and they would um they'd go to kitty hawk and they would find places to crash and and and so it wasn't like they were rich um by the way if you like stories like this we may have something coming down the pipe even left we'll announce later yeah okay so i'm excited about that so uh okay have i had stories like this um you know i probably have and i probably need to go dig it up that's one thing i've learned especially from story worthy one of the things in story worthy is he does he he's not just telling you how to tell a great story like he does that right there's mechanics about what makes a great story and he talks about what is the beginning supposed to look like what is the end supposed to look like how do you raise stakes in a in a story that sort of thing but the other thing the main point i think the guy's trying to get across and story worthy is that we we all think that like our day-to-day life doesn't have stories but once you start looking you'll find stories everywhere and it gives you these exercises to do to find stories from your past there's like this exercise called first last best worst and i do this in my course i don't teach the course anymore but like in my power writing course i help people come up with ideas of what to write about and i use this exercise and it's it's killer you could take anything so like we'll just play the game real quick we're gonna do it with uh jobs okay so topic is jobs or career right so give me the first job you ever had i worked in a bakery sweeping floors okay great uh give me the last meaning most recent job you ever had and that's probably you know the hustle or maybe this podcast i was the ceo and owner of a media company called the hustle right then it's uh give me worst so let's go what was the worst job you ever had the worst job i ever had was um the worst job i ever had was cold calling people in college to sell seo services out of the yellow pages there you go all right and then you have best what was the best job you ever had the best job i ever had was co-hosting this podcast all right there we go it's and then there's another one called weirdest uh that i added in that's not story worthy but i added weirdest because i found that this gives this gives a lot of good stories out of it so what's the weirdest job you ever had that might be the hot dog stand no i was a skateboard instructor at the ymca when i was 15. i learned something new every day about you all right so so you could do that so that that gives you a bunch of stuff that you're like oh if you show that to somebody else it'd be like what like what you know like skateboard how did that come about or how did like how much money does that make or how did you get the idea or what's the hardest part about doing that or what's the what's a day in like oh you scooped ice cream at coldstone like dude like what do i need to know about cold stone ice cream that you know only you know because you were there every day making it and so it's this great way to generate a bunch of stories so that's like one of those exercises he has another one which is like you look for a five second moment in your day you just try to jot down at the end of the night what would have been my story of the day if today is the last day of my life or whatever today was the only day of my life what would have been the story of the day and you just looked for a five-second moment everyday stories i think he called right and so yeah it's a good book so i i think everybody myself included probably has their version of a wilbur moment it might not be that you literally got punched in the face it might be that you like you said got fired somebody you know slammed you in a meeting and told you you know you're you're a dumb ass so this will never work or um you know whatever you got rejected in some way you've tried and spectacularly failed in some way you publicly failed in some way and um the other thing that came to mind when you tell me this is my brother-in-law who's come on the show before it's a crazy man brother aaron he's a crazy man we gotta have him back on he basically just goes down rabbit holes and internet conspiracies and things like that so he has this story that he tells and i'm gonna half tell the story right now i'll do the fast forward version so he's like i was in college i was just having a great time kind of like 50-year senior type of [ __ ] and um i think maybe he was in grad school actually for this and he doesn't really care about his grades he's just partying he's playing basketball all day he does he really doesn't care about his grades and he finds out that and he's taking out a bunch of loans and he finds out that you know his gpa his first semester sucks and um there's something happen where like he had one semester left and in order to graduate he needed and not like have to pay a whole bunch of extra money uh for his loans because he didn't graduate or whatever he needed to essentially get a 4.0 gpa so he needed to go from like a 2.1 to like he needed to graduate with a three point something or i don't know what the numbers were but basically his first year gpa was so bad that he needed an absolute perfect gpa in order to graduate and not be like 50 000 in the hole and for somebody who grew up like on food stamps like 50 000 was like an insurmountable hole at the time he didn't want to be in that hole he wanted to graduate and he was dating my sister and my sister was like yo you can't just be like a broke joke who's like not graduating in mountains of debt so he's like i'm gonna lose my girl i'm gonna like oh all this money it's all crashing down and so he's like okay you know what i'm gonna do this and so it's like in the story-worthy format it's like you have a hero who has an um intent an obstacle so he has an intent he has to do this if he doesn't do this what happens loses the girl of his dreams is in a mountain of debt will never recover um you know like basically has to drop out doesn't finish his degree and if if he does that whatever happens those are the stakes and so then he tells the story and when he's telling the story he's like there's all these like additional obstacles that come it's like he actually like starts to study super hard and he's not like you know he's not like the smartest smartest guy who it just oh if he tried a little bit he'd get an a he needs to get an a plus uh like he has to get a 97 to 100. if he doesn't get that he he flunks out of the program and he starts studying he actually gets his first test he gets like a 98 and the teacher calls him into the office and is basically like you cheated he's like no i swear he's like dude you were a f f student and you're g you want me to believe you have an a plus here no way you cheated you you know whatever and so he gets obstacle after obstacle and then they change the rules or something so at first he needed an a which is like a 95 and up then they changed the rules on the on the gpa system he now needed an a plus in every single subject where it's like he needed a 98 99 or 100 and he's like oh my god and every day every time you hit one of these obstacles he just feels like he can't do it and he just the way he tells the story he just keeps repeating goes but then i dug deeper and he just keeps going he's like i hit rock bottom but then i dug deeper and he just keeps saying this over and over and by the first time he says it you know it has some effect second time he says it's losing its effect third time you're laughing by the 17th time because by the way he's telling the story not of him telling the story now it's he went to a job interview with nasa and nasa was like yo you're not an engineer like why would we give you this job and he told that he tells the story he's like because i know my limits and every other kid you have coming in here is from a good family who's got good grades their whole life they don't know what they're made of i tested myself i know what i'm made of i dug deeper when i hit rock bottom when i couldn't do more i went further and he just keeps going and he tells us he got the job and he and when he tells the story just makes everybody laugh and i when i heard that story not only does it make me laugh it made me think everybody deserves to have a story like this and if you don't then when you're in a shitty time just think to yourself this is my dig deeper story okay pile on the obstacles because you know what i need it for this story to be great in the end yeah he's uh i've hung out with him a bit that guy is crazy and i enjoy i enjoy that story can i tell you um can i tell you about something that's going on on twitter that i find to be incredibly fascinating yeah so right now i've singled out four people but there's probably 12 of them or maybe 24 of them so there's something very weird going on about real estate twitter okay and i just and i contacted three of them and i posted all my notes you see my notes on there yep i see them i know all these i just okay i'm actually meeting up with one of them tonight uh strip mall the strip mall guy so for the listeners basically like twitter is experiencing some crazy stuff right now and obviously me and sean are deep in one particular niche but i have a feeling that that niche is quite large and that niche is like techy startupy people tweeting stuff and also there's like a big overlap with crypto and nft stuff and that's even probably much larger and then next to that is like robin hood and stocks and fin they call what they call it fin twin and that's probably even the biggest but there's this new subset of people that i'm seeing and i think it's new and it's nowhere near the biggest there's like marketing twitter there's like teacher twitter there's like every profession has like oh i mean like some culture i mean like some of the i met some of the bigger uh i meant the biggest of the the ones i had mentioned uh okay and yeah yeah and and keep in mind that like if we're looking at a piece of the pie the everything i just mentioned is like maybe like it's like it's like a like a maybe like a 15 of the pie so it's like not big but if you're listening to this you are likely part of that and so there's a very new and emerging part of that pie and is these guys who are constantly tweeting about boring real estate stuff and as as a whole the leaders are [ __ ] crushing it it is some of the most not boring as in sam's judgment boring as in that's actually their positioning is like oh you guys talking about all this fancy [ __ ] i just do boring stuff and i make a bunch of money that's actually their brand that they want to bring in so that i think at least i think it's intentional i don't think they're trying to be boring i think they're trying to say hey boring businesses print money and there's like this counter culture counterculture appeal to it in the same way that some people are like oh vc it's all just a big waste of money and you know it's a bunch of you know it's a fool's race i actually bootstrap and i make profits i have my profitability and they use that as their badge of honor but the reason why i want to bring this up now is because we are in the early stages or maybe in the middle we're right in the thick of it it's not huge huge yet but we're seeing something happen here and i want to call it out because i think it's very fascinating to watch this and so here's there's actually four guys i only talked to three of them ahead of time but i'm friends with the fourth one so i can kind of like riff off them a little bit but there's four guys that i went and dm'd and the first there's a guy named strip mall guy uh his handle is strip mall guy or or but his name is trent and people call him strip mall trent and so we're gonna talk about him the second guy we're gonna talk about is a guy named moses kagan moses kagan uh so strip mall guy buys strip malls and it's hilarious his twitter the second guy is moses kagan he buys multi-family in la the third is keith wasserman who is one of your third fifth eighth guest on the podcast and he does multi-family and then the fourth guy is this guy who we're both great friends with nick huber who i'm an investor of and he buys storage units and he's made it so popular that he gets mocked regularly because of it and so i want to tell you a little bit about each guy i will go really quick so strip mall guy so fax so he has 500 million dollars in assets under management his twitter is anonymous um i'm actually about to go go for he's actually staying down the street for me i'm gonna go hang out with him uh right after this he's 41 years old he uh uses none of his own money so 99.9 percent is other people's money and he has bought roughly 500 million dollars worth of strip malls and what he does is um he finds strip malls that he thinks are undervalued and he just fixes them up and he either holds them or flips them and his the reason why he thinks this is a huge deal is because the the there's a huge lack of uh data in this business so the rents that people are paying versus what the market rent is like it's really hard to know if if you're if you're charging your attendance market rate and for some reason that's incredibly challenging and he goes that's where the opportunity is so i just work really hard and i knock on doors to find out what everyone's paying in rent and i come up with uh and then i find a strip mall where they're underpaying and i buy it and i increase rent and i fix it up a little bit so anyway that's kind of interesting and so he told me that he pays himself or he personally cash flows three million dollars a year from this kind of interesting and he does it with a team of four that's pretty fascinating isn't it right yeah of course so is he a syndicate or it's a fun i think it sounds like it's indicator i don't know i actually i don't know um i think a fun but he has like family offices behind him so i guess if he's a syndicate that means he just does a deal by deal versus having a fundraiser deploy um i i yeah i don't actually know um kind of fascinating the second guy is um and he's in this guy strip mall trent i believe he just started when did he start uh like his mother sounds like less than a year old and i dm'd him and i was like uh oh by the way he he told me actually i had asked him he said deal my deal basis um and i think he's now gonna now gonna raise the fund he's like it's insane how many people are dming me about investing in my deals and stuff like that he's like my twitter account is an anonymous i'm an anonymous cartoon character i might you know i could be anything he's like you know i am the real deal but like they don't know that that's crazy that how much how much opportunity there is on twitter for somebody who's vocal in their space and then um and he was actually he's like should i you know tell my friends about who i am like my account or whatever and i told him i said keep it super super tight to the vest uh it will get out if you if you if even if you everybody you tell you trust them they trust three people they trust three people and like by the by you know three hops later the word is out and so uh so i told him i said don't tell me who you are just just uh stay anonymous keep doing what you're doing it's gonna get really big and i agree and it's one of the reasons why it's interesting there's another there's a guy uh who doesn't think he's 22 000 followers now i bet you he's at 100 in less than six months this guy's going to be big and uh there's another guy who runs this [Music] newsletter called petition where he talks about um companies that are going bankrupt and who can buy them and he runs that all anonymously and one time he called me and asked for advice and i sent him a zoom link and he screwed up and he put his name in the thing and i go bro i just saw it turn it off and i like deleted it from my brain so i don't actually remember his name but i talked to him on the phone uh a regular basis but i'm like just you know i still don't remember your name so okay so you just said that this guy tr uh was able to raise money or is it being offered let's go to the second guy his name is moses kagan he currently has 200 million dollars through au on under uh management and he's deployed 30 million dollars of uh sorry he's had 40 million dollars come from twitter so this guy started tweeting about his deals he got 40 million of his twitter followers they came up with 40 million dollars to invest in his fun he said one guy gave him 20 million and he found it through twitter is that nuts we have a friend who put a couple million bucks into his thing yeah i know and i i talked about him and did he say that he's happy with it uh i think it's early so i i think it's probably too early to say but he recommended it to me he's like i think he should do one of these guys deal so that means he kicked the tires and was like yeah i think it's worth you know like this guy seems to be smart uh seems to know what he's doing so so i think that was you know trusted enough i flew down and i met up with him i thought he was great and then the third one is keith wasserman so keith currently has close to two billion dollars in assets under management for for his real estate deal and he said um that uh uh he's so he's got a thousand a thousand investors he said and uh twitter 5xed his his uh his fund so that's pretty nuts and then the last one nick huber is who's a good friend of both of ours i came became friends with him through twitter basically i was doing a live video and he popped in and i just became friends with him and now we're like i'm gonna go visit him in his house and hang out with them and we um i invested 100 both have that redneck energy to you you guys both you know you just want to be out in the sun all day get sunburned while you're like hunting fishing golfing and shooting something at the same time like if i could just put those four objects one on each limb you'd be a happy person put a rifle on the hand a fishing pole on your toes you know that's what you guys want both of you you're like i love you he texts us he's smoking a cigar it's tuesday at 1 p.m he's like kids are running around his giant like i don't know farm or wherever he wherever the hell he lives he's got a bunch of anchorage and he's just like yeah life is good we're going we're going to go white water rafting in like you know my backyard right now he's awesome i i invested in it and uh the returns have been pretty good and anyway i thought it was crazy fascinating and so i'm going to give everyone a take away here's my opinion here's an easy one where this can be made so there's a guy already who's doing this with vending machines we talked about him his name was quinn miller i think he's doing pretty good um but there's another one that i think that this could be done so click the link uh you see where it says car wash advisory.com yes okay so i found this website um and basically what they do is if you go to carwashadvisory.com and then you click buying and then you can see car washes for sale you can look at how much car washes are selling for and i'm honestly shocked at how expensive these are you can see what their eba does you can see what their profit or what their profit with their revenue you can see all types of stuff um and it's pretty fascinating i think because this is so interesting i think that there's a world where someone could get into this business and start tweeting about it constantly and just tweet publicly our youtube people put the put the website if it put this like put the website go to buy and put that on the uh on the screen right now like this is how you know this is a great website because all the listings that are sold it goes it just has this huge stamp it says sold and then there's balloon like these clip art balloons all over the listing that's that's how i know that this thing is amazing uh it's like you know when you see somebody who's like you know driving a fancy car and they get out and they have like total like dad wardrobe it's like yeah this person's it's the opposite of the person who's really slick getting out and you're like ah did they lease this thing and is this is this a rental like you know they're doing it for the image versus when the image is so bad but the money is so high it's like oh yeah that's where there's dumb money it's great yes and i think that you could do this so nick's got a thing on this guy's doing strip malls uh moses and keith are doing multi-family nick's got storage um there could be there's this guy quinn's got vending there's a there's room for car wash i think i think that that was that you were going somewhere else i think and maybe this is just me probably you too right now which is like once you get a little bit of money it's like you go get your phd in tax avoidance and i think it's crazy that nobody has just taken the throne here of saying i'm gonna talk all day about these little financial hack strategies for high net worth people around um you know just either examples or strategies or loopholes or little did you know about you can go into an opportunity zone and then you can roll that through a 1031 over here and then you could backdoor the backdoor ira and then you can do a super roth it's like you know like whatever i'm just making up terms but i think everything you said made sense unfortunately i'm pretty sure it didn't but there's somebody who should be owning that like there's one guy his name is mitchell something mitchell baldrige i don't know like it's one of those names i've never said out loud i just see him on twitter all the time he kind of does this it's basically a cpu wait is he does he look like a really really white dude like a grown-up dennis the menace yes exactly mitchell baldwin yeah 21 000 followers i did a call with him because i was thinking about you know should i use him for my stuff um and it's like yeah he's a texas cpa focused on family and helping high net worth 30 to 500 million investors and business owners preserve and grow their wealth and then it's like you know this is not financial advice um but basically i just think that there is such a lack of information last night i was like i do this thing because my daughter's bedtime schedule is like all screwed up it's like takes forever to put her to bed now um and like you know there's probably some way to like shorten that but my hack is always like how do i just have more fun doing this rather than try to make it more efficient and so my hack to have it more fun is headphones in while i'm like putting her to bed and i learned something so like um you know either audiobook or listen to a really good talk or right now my shtick is like this week is crypto week but besides that i've been doing tax text learning so you know like what are the different things that people do in order to generate a lot of income and pay minimal tax and it's so hard to find somebody who's good at this on youtube like there's definitely stuff out there but it's like i don't know how to describe it it's like dollar store [ __ ] it's like yeah it's kind of cheap it's kind of tacky it's like way too surface level um and it's like too it's like you know it'll be like did you know there's a 401k it's like okay i need more than that but you know like still delivered to me in a way that's like simple and understandable and like walks me through cases like yeah i have a client who's you know made a bunch of money through selling a company and so then we started buying real estate and here's the type of real estate we bought and here's how we managed it and here's what we did with the depreciation to offset these things right like i want more and so i feel like tax is one of those boring topics that's a great one get super big with like this now the incentive is kind of not there in that it's a service based business more so than you know these real estate guys because they just want a bunch of investors to pile in so they can go buy bigger and bigger deals yeah but look like who doesn't want more customers yeah yeah exactly or better and better customers i so the to wrap this up the more the story is there's some amazing people out here particularly in this real estate niche but i think that you can do this for many things there's loads of services loads of like real estate things i mean we're talking about vending machines car washes uh taxes and these these guys are making in like i guess like in order to be good at that i'm gonna disrespect these folks a little bit but like it doesn't seem like you have to be that good to be good at it you know what i mean like if you just do if you're just pretty good and and you're consistently at least pretty good and you do it for 30 years you can be a [ __ ] winner and what they're doing is they're making it really hard to lose by getting this massive audience and creating this incredibly interesting content around typically boring stuff and so everyone who has money is like oh can i give you some more can i give you some money please so anyway i think that's interesting it's and it's happening right now and so that's why i wanted to call this out this is not something that we i don't want to look back i want to say look this is happening it's kind of neat yeah basically the fewer the people the less common it is uh for people in your industry to be blogging or tweeting or podcasting the more of an opportunity there is for you to go do it there is an insatiable appetite for this stuff and if your industry is sort of backwards slow it's private behind closed doors bigger opportunity for you than it is for guys like us because in our industry everybody's doing it so it's less it's less cool it's less opportunities for just to be the 30 000th tech person to tweet their tech views you know so all right i'm gonna let you lead because you actually have a ton of good stuff and i kind of dominated a lot of the time okay so i want to talk about this thing i've been doing that this week um called crypto week so okay what dude i almost got i almost got so mad at you when i saw that tweet because you go i told bad kids i was like sean we only have one meeting this week it's only 10 minutes please i hope you don't showed up i showed up but i did tell i did tell ben and i tell that i said hey no meetings this week so i did one with you for our youtube channel because that's ten minutes it was ten minutes it was great um shout out to essie and then it was at this podcast this is the only two commitments i have on the calendar this week good all right thank you so besides that i cleared everything off and i didn't just clear the calendar of meetings i just said i'm not working on my other [ __ ] e-commerce business not doing it this week and ironic things like having its best week ever but like i basically just told our ad guy i said hey i'm on vacation now am i actually on vacation no i'm sitting in my garage 18 hours a day neck deep in crypto and uh why is it so basically are you are you just sitting with your phone right now no is that what you're doing because like i met whenever i do these weeks which i do them as well i i'm just like surrounded by books reading but are you really you really just leaned over on your chair with your phone in front of you and you're just like drinking milk laptop my laptop drinking milk exactly i'm on that i'm on that edison diet right now i'm just drinking milk and i'm inventing the future so um so what i think is uh this is kind of amazing so i had read that bill gates does this uh like once one week out of the year he calls it his think week or his reading week or something like that where he's just like throughout the year he gets interested in certain topics but he doesn't he's so busy that he doesn't get to go as deep on that topic as he would otherwise want to like he's got more curiosity than he has time in the moment and so what he does is he carves out this one week a year and then it's let's say that that he's all about crispr right let's say that that's what he was really interested in and uh and by the way for all the people who are like oh bill gates he's trying to like [ __ ] poison everybody it's like okay yeah step aside please um basically he he takes his all his books on crisper and he goes to a cabin he doesn't take his wife and he doesn't take his kids and he locks himself in the cabin and he just reads he just immerses himself in that thing and he comes out the other side with a greater understanding of this topic that he was curious about so i wanted to do this for crypto now i'm like i'm not like a noob at crypto right like you know we've been talking about it on this podcast i i've you know been buying and owning assets since i don't know 2014 or something like that and so like it's not like this is like a completely new subject but it was wow this space is evolving so fast and there are so many toys that i haven't got to play with i'm gonna do this and so um and i can't tell you how fun this has been i i want to tell you why but like that's just the highlights the intro where do you want me to go with this well uh for so i don't want to talk too much about this concept of doing a crypto or book reading week because it's so i i'm totally on board with it everyone should do it so i don't even want to talk have you ever done something like this um not lately not in the past couple years but i have before so i've done it with like copywriting i'm like i'm gonna learn everything yeah it's very you can you can learn so much you have to shut down slack facebook twitter and just not look at anything and so i'm gonna give you a few things that i've observed during this so first about doing one of these weeks it fits my fits the like framework of how i see the world which is that that work like a lion not like a cow and that this is a sprint week and it's a sprint week around learning but it's a sprint week nonetheless it's like a lion when they find their prey and they want to go sprint uh at it um it's like a mini vacation or a mini retirement in a way it's like what would i do if i really wasn't working actively on anything well i would just be kind of learning and you know i'd be like interested in all these things because i had all this free time well i gave myself a mini shot of that for a week uh it reduces fomo like crazy because there was always this itch this this this uh this aching feeling like i'm missing out on all this opportunity because i'm busy with you know my good projects that i like but like i just don't have time to even know what i don't know and so this reduces fomo and last thing is learning by immersion so i'm not just the only one doing it my team which is ben and andre i cleared off their whole calendar too and i said don't do any of your normal things you're doing andre andre andre new guy he took my power writing course dude andre's story is [ __ ] nuts can i tell you this i didn't tell you about this guy he created this website let me actually find uh go to go to uh sup shawn.com so sup and then my name shawn.com and just read this for a second hi sean i'm andre okay so this guy made this website he sent it to me and you go it's called sup shawn.com so i'm curious and he says hey sean i'm andre i'm a future student in your power writing course i built the biggest large biggest student startup conference in canada uh blah blah blah oh by the way i just recovered from being wheelchair slash bedbound for two years check out my blog post for stories about why i made this site for you i'm not looking to grab a copy of your chat i love you i like the hustle of this website i just have one quick question i want your help with and then he has like he stole like the design off my website and he just put a bunch of fake quotes of people being like you're a legend wow like quote wow sean when seeing this website um and then he's talked about what he's working on now and then he has a question and he's like if you were me you've just been strapped to your bed for a couple years and you're now starting your career how would that how would you change your approach to life and work some context i had this thing of a jig for five years and i've just got over it and i feel like i've been given a second life by the way the fact that he didn't like go into a sob story and explain yeah just calling it a thingamajig just told me yo i'm on your level of like i'm not looking for your sympathy but this is true and i'm just explaining to you this situation i'm in uh so so mad respect for the way he did that he goes i just want to maximize every year blah blah blah you know blah blah blah and so anyways he uh he got me to reply and he took my course he was great then he sent me this video after my course like yo here's three things you should be doing better in your next cohort like really loved it here's three three ways where i would make this better i just hired him i was like come do that and then he came and he did that for me and now i'm like he's brought such good energy where like literally every day he's like just he's on one dude he's never in a bad mood he's always in a good mood and it's amazing how far enthusiasm and having like positive vibes goes as far as like my books at least and so uh that's always important but i brought him up and he's working on your course so he did my course but now i like the course was like a smash success last month and i was like i'm kind of bored of this let's go do some other [ __ ] so like uh he's not doing that right now but he's helping me with with other [ __ ] so this crypto week thing uh anyways we're all doing it so a couple things that i've learned so i'm a big believer in learning by doing and so my attitude for this week was what are i thought of it like disney world i was like okay there's all the and if you go to disney world it's like you can go to the magic kingdom you can go to like whatever the harry potter land you can go over here to this other area so i started mapping out the different worlds there's like the nft world there's like defy world there's like kind of like security world i need to learn how to i got kind of like a like a good amount of this stuff like i wanna what are the best practices for securing this and i've been putting off uh okay you know what's better than what i'm currently doing um and so i just mapped out all these different areas i'm curious about and that we started diving in one day on each just going as deep as we can uh with each one but are you are you like messaging your team throughout the day like let's everyone let's sit for three hours and read this and we'll come back and talk basically so it's like we're just sharing stuff in slack and then we do these like slack has that huddle feature now which is like really dope yeah it's like a quick little discord chat basically so we'll huddle up and we'll be like um we we kind of set out at the beginning which was dude what would i want but what i would want is when i wanted to spend a week going deep into crypto and get a real understanding i wish somebody just had this had a product like this where i could just it's not a course it's not like a vlog it's like uh the best way i've learned about crypto has been furcon my smart friend basically who knows this [ __ ] inside and out he just sits me down on a zoom call and he screen cheers he's like all right so like do you have meta mask and i'm like uh do i maybe i feel like i might have made one once he's like okay well like here's what that is it's this wallet it lives in your browser it's how you do [ __ ] in the crypto world so like let's get your set up and like by the way don't fall for these scams like here's the smart way to do it and so then i click it click it and i'm like hey this says this he's like yeah that's normal go ahead and he just holds my hand and sort of teaches me like he's like okay have you ever um taken out a default loan i'm like no why would i do that he's like well you know let's say you wanted to not sell your crypto but you want to go buy some [ __ ] in the real world and the banks don't recognize it so let's go take out a loan for like super low percent rate and let me show you how you do that you're going to go to compound.finance and then you're going to put your ethe in using that wallet we just made and now you're going to take a loan and let's take that loan let's go do something with it and so he's walked me through step by step and so i'm like i want to do that with all the new areas of crypto and then secondly when i was talking to the guys yesterday i was like dude the way we are learning this by having our hand held where we like have trust and confidence that we're doing the right things we should just make this the next course which is like it's not really like a course it's like a zoom call you join and it takes you on a tour through disneyland it's like here's all the attractions and like i'm not just going to tell you about them like actually like you're first editing who's leading you right now is leading me so i do it oh so he's and he's when he gets stuck yeah when i get stuck i say hey can you show us like like liquidity pools i heard you saying you make money in this i don't really understand what's the point of this liquidity pool and like how do i actually do this and like what do i do to do this in a way like tell me the pros and cons and the risks so i can make a smart decision on whether i want to do this in the future but like let's do my first liquidity pool trade together and then like i have my dashboard of how much i'm making off this right or like oh yeah you um you know you you have this nft great like i want to display that how do i do that how do i secure this how do i store this safely great how do i mint one you know like all the different like questions that i have if i can't figure it out myself by doing i call him in and he kind of like shows me he screen shares and shows me what to do step by step so what are the learnings so crypto week what are like the top one to five learnings that you have so far so one big learning is like dude this is evolving so fast it's like it's like if you you know when you go by a club and you kind of hear the music faintly from the outside you're like um huh like you hear this little hum like little you hear the bass from the outside but it's not that loud you walk by you go on to your you know your cafe or your bus stop wherever you're going you leave it's like i swung open the door and there's a full underground rave going on and everybody's having you know this crazy time and and now that i'm in it i'm like wow the energy has really picked up last time i was here was like you know a year ago and i was kind of on the outside now i'm on the inside i'm seeing what's really going on how crazy this energy is what does that translate to well there's a whole bunch of like developer tools because anytime i see something cool that i'm using i'm like can i invest in this company and so like the way that during during the internet explosion you had companies like twilio or pagerduty or you know like all these just like basic infrastructure stripe it's like oh yeah people need to take payments people need to be able to send notifications send sms's every every product that's on the internet that's going to build at the internet is going to eventually want to do these things they're going to want to have cloud hosting and so i'm finding the equivalent of cloud hosting and twilio and all that stuff these dev tools that are in in what's called web 3 or the crypto world and i'm like dude i need to be investing in these because if crypto is going to be a thing then these are these infrastructure companies just like they did great in the in the internet age they're going to do great in the crypto age so that's the first what else what else have you learned so like then it's like okay how do you actually you know nfts it's kind of this thing that like i thought it was interesting i owned a couple but like it also seemed a little bit nuts and like why are people doing this are they all just like trying to make a quick buck and they're just you know you know doing some crazy [ __ ] or is this actually the new art and i'm missing today i'm laughing at it and then three years from now i'm gonna be the one pimping it out because like now i aha get it uh you know the same way i was with bitcoin early on where i was like that's kind of weird don't really get it move on and three years later i'm like oh this is the you know jesus christ our lord and savior and so um so what i've learned is like i've been actually using the tools so like check this out go to go to a site called rarity.tools [Music] so i've been using this as i've been looking at which nfts i wanted to collect and buy i gave myself a quarter million dollar budget for this week to to go play in crypto world and some of that's used some of that's used on buying nfts and i haven't used most of it yet i've only bought a couple things um but but basically that's my like learning budget if i want to do something i can do up to that amount and look at the similar web traffic on rarity.tools holy [ __ ] holy [ __ ] that that like that it's like a water slide yeah exactly april it's like at zero essentially uh you know it's like a convert ramp it's like under under half a million uh uniques and then you know july just under a million august it's now at three and a half million it's just hockey sticking up and what is this this is just like what we talk about like this is a picks and shovels business so anytime there's a gold rush you can either go try to find the gold meaning go find the best nft and oh you bought a crypto punk and now it's worth seven million dollars okay that's one way you found a nugget of gold or this is a great picks and shovels business which is like hey a bunch of people are interested in nfts cool we will make a site that helps you figure out the rarity of different nfts it helps you find underpriced assets that are you know the price is good given the rarity and so um so i think this is a great example of like of a picks and shovels website for the crypto world so i've found a bunch of these types of tools as well and then met a bunch of the people behind it and so uh you know like one guy who's behind one of these tools is like dude i'm a big fan of the show like my story's nuts at 15 or 16 i entered an online scrabble tournament that was like a million dollar tournament and i just wrote a bot for me back then that nobody else they didn't know how to outlaw this so i won the tournament like i won the million dollar scrabble tournament using a bot at age 15 and then at age 17 i did this and i just 21 i did this and then now i have this discord with 90 000 people in it called rarity sniper and it's all about finding like nfts that are undervalued and i have like 90 000 people in this discord server and i'm like you're finding all these people and the biggest lesson i've seen is it's a whole different demographic like these are new rich people the the winners and the builders like the people who are going to be the mark zuckerbergs and the larry pages and the brian chesky's like it's not the it's not the people we all know that are like twitter famous that are making it big in the crypto world it's a whole new set of people and most of them are like anonymous just icon accounts and then i'm talking to them and i'm like dude you're fascinating you're also like a madman but like wow this is crazy what um okay so right now where where do you stand and uh you're okay so i would place you i think on the correct side of reasonable but not exactly so like parts of you are reasonable like normal person reasonable other parts of you you're you're a crazy person so i kind of trust your opinion on this but not always so try to try to be try to keep that in mind you want the reasonable person is that who you want to talk about reasonable sean or you want to talk to a rational show where do you think do you think okay so what's your take right now on the nft world are you as bullish as some of these our friends and uh where what's your current stance on it so i was in this like one-hour conversation with some random ass nft anonymous guy on twitter in dms and i was talking to him but by the way just just these 90 000 person discords and talking random people that alone is this that's a phenomenon right the way that all these people are like this thing got minted it was called rookie nft and i like bought a couple it was real cheap it's like it's just coming out like 45 minutes before that something's like hey check this out you're into sports you'll probably like this and i did like it was actually a really smart concept so i bought a bunch of them right away and again these are lottery tickets you buy you most likely you just scratch it you throw it away and you got nothing and sometimes you you hit big and so like one of mine that i bought you know has i gone up 5x in value already um and you know of my of one of these nft bets that i made in the last two days but the and the others are just like flat like cost of doing business basically and so i said look early on i wrote off bitcoin because i was like i don't get it it's not this has no intrinsic value it's imaginary money it was made up by an anonymous person and like it's going up and like what happens when the music stops meaning what happened you know it's going up people are buying it because they think it's going to keep going up and that seems like a ponzi scheme that seems like a pyramid scheme that was my initial like this is 2014 2015 me thinking i didn't really understand 2013 maybe actually and um and over time as i got to unders that was just my lack of understanding over time i started to understand that actually all the things we call money they're all this they all operate the same way why is this piece of paper valuable why is this lump of gold valuable why is this diamond on a tiny diamond valuable because there's a social agreement yeah there's a social agreement and the social agreement happens because we justify it through rarity uh right gold is somewhat rare diamonds are somewhat rare um so scarcity basically is there um and then there's like you know some intrinsic poll or or whatever but really it's a social agreement and a lot of the meaning we place on it comes later and so i was like i get i i didn't get that at the time when it came to cryptocurrencies money i didn't realize that actually it's not just a ponzi scheme that actually the more people who buy in actually is what it what makes it valuable so it's not a bubble that's going to pop it's that the more believers that you have that's the stronger the social agreement is and therefore the thing actually that actually gives it real value and um and this appeals to certain people and so it's going to it's going to grow in this that social agreement is going to grow and i think there's some crazy charts by the way that show like bitcoin adoption is i think one of the fastest if not the fastest adopted technology ever so i don't want to say the word ever of all technologies maybe like i don't know the printing press or like the telephone was a little bit faster from what from what i heard i haven't gone and verified this before i heard it was faster faster than all those but if you just look at the internet for sure it happened so mobile phones and the internet were probably the two most recent technologies that took over the world right and if you look at mobile phone adoption and and uh and internet adoption bitcoin is on a faster pace than both of those and so um so the the social agreement is what gives cryptocurrency value and so i was like but this art thing like dude i remember cryptokitties in 2017 right for condo sitting next to me at the office and he had two kitties and he was breeding them and he gave me a kitty heat bread and i was like what the [ __ ] is this and he's like it's an nft's he was explaining to me for the first time back in 2017. i was like oh that's cool but like and there was this hype i remember one day cryptokitties overwhelmed the ethereum network it was like eighty percent of all activity on ethereum was just cryptokitties and andreessen horowitz put all this money into cryptokitties and then like a year later cryptokitties were dead and um it was like the beanie babies fad but even faster and by the way that same team who built crypto kitties they're the ones who built an a top shot as well um and so so anyways i was just like who's to say that today you guys are spending millions of dollars on crypto punks and millions of dollars on this board ape yacht club um who's to say two years from now this is not crypto kitties all over again and then a bunch of those believers kind of gave me a bunch of reasons and what i realized was it's the same thing it's the same same idea which is that art has value because of a social social agreement a social construct so why is the mona lisa more valuable than the next painting of a chick looking sideways well because we as a society have over time decided more and more that the mona lisa is valuable and it's not doesn't matter what type of paint was used what size of canvas it doesn't matter what year it was made like art can have value based on the social agreement how many crypto punks are there ten thousand okay so my argument is like well maybe there was like a few then yeah could it be valuable in a hundred years yeah maybe but there's like ah mona lisa yeah but you know you say oh how many you know monets are there how many uh how many how many paintings did this artist do it's like in their lifetime they maybe made a few hundred or whatever it was and so you know you can go find any picasso painting and it's valuable and that's the idea is that these are like these are the picasas right it's like the og stuff i think it's the first nft project uh ever was was crypto punks and that's what has it's kind of like story value uh and now the people who believe it it's like bitcoin so there's this great quote that came out that was like again i don't know if this is true or this folklore but recently some of the big finance guys started buying a bunch of bitcoin and i think it was um stanley druckenmiller who was on the podcast with uh trunk he came he said you know the thing that turned me around on it was i thought oh this thing gets pumped up then it crashes down it's too volatile isaac and then paul tudor jones who's this billionaire hedge fund billionaire hedge fund trader uh one of the most famous guys from wall street he called junker miller he goes hey did you know this that when bitcoin crashed from its all-time high which was like 17 18 000 down to 3 000 that 86 percent of the people who held it never sold a single coin and he's like wow that's amazing the people who own this thing they're like religious zealots about it and he said well if people are that religious about it meaning if the social agreement the social construct is that strong the belief is that strong that it can withstand an 80 crash and they don't liquidate this thing is going to go up and this thing is going to be like have long-term value and that's the thing that i see right so that's the probably the only area i've changed my mind is that i wasn't going to buy crypto punks for 48 but i thought it was just another crypto kitty that's probably going to go away and now i'm starting to realize is that the people who own punks like if you go to openc right now you go try to buy crypto punk you can't just none for sale it's like these people don't want to sell them they're like the bitcoin people who are like bitcoin's gonna be worth a million dollars a coin someday the the crypto punk holders they have infected each other with this story that says this is the original nft this is like the most valuable art that will ever be created in crypto world um this these are going to be worth you know 10 million each and they've convinced themselves that that's true and that because of that there's like no supply on the market uh and then you know supply demand will sort of tell you so you're you're okay so nft's got it you're not now after you're halfway through your week of learning your current stance on on crypto as a whole i mean i was super bullish before i'm super bullish now it really wasn't i'm trying to judge whether this is good or bad that's not really what this was it isn't even really i'm trying to understand it better although that does come it was just dude i haven't had time to actually go use all the different stuff that's been built like i already owned the cryptocurrencies i already own the assets what i didn't do was you know there's a lot of things built of what you can do with your ethereum you can stake it you can trade it you can blend you can borrow you can buy nfts you can fractionalize those nfts you can create a dow which is like this organization it's like this group but it's got a wallet there's all these different things you can do and i knew of them but i haven't done them and there's like a lot of value in actually going and taking the time to go use the apps right it's like go use the products and then form your own opinions on how you feel about them but for me it was really isn't even about the opinions it's like it takes time to actually learn how to actually go do all this stuff and if i was 20 today and i'm just you know my time is worth jack [ __ ] and i have nothing else to do this is all i'd be doing and this is how i would become valuable what i noticed was that like it's kind of like the people who didn't really figure out the internet because they were successful in real estate or doctors or whatever it's like i don't want my success to inhibit my own ability to go play and learn and so that's what this week was for me this is i'm i'm like chewing on all this i got to think about all this this is nutty to me i your it's like the way that maybe like maybe um maybe like some fitness stuff the way that it comes to me and i just like i grab it easily and i enjoy it and i am obsessed with it that's how you are with this it's so hard for someone who's not pre pre uh i don't know who's predisposed to this type of stuff to like when i hear you talking this stuff is a great example because you're athletic so if i say there's a track nearby you go you go there and you [ __ ] run on this track in circles and i'm like oh man that sounds like a lot of work i don't really want to do that or if i'm like yeah there's this knees over toes guy you go by the program and you spend the next six weeks trying to do pistol squats on one knee and then like you're like oh boxing cool then you go join a boxing gym and you go sign up for an amateur fight like i'm doing that in the way that i'm athletic which is like great yeah like when i go to when i go to a discord i'm like i it's like i'm like i'm like a little autistic going into an ikea i'm like i just i'm overwhelmed i don't know what to do i want to clam up i'm freaking out there's too much uh all right you want to do want to run through a few of these things or are we going to wrap up i have a two i have a two interest i have two interesting things i wanted to show you uh okay let's do this this is related there's this great twitter thread i thought i wanted to get your opinion on it's about levels of levels of wealth and something we've talked about on here before but i thought this guy's take was interesting so okay this the account is i i i 529 and i read it but i i like your i like yours he didn't do a very good job of writing it uh did he not okay maybe he didn't okay so his writing wasn't as clear as yours okay i thought it was pretty good maybe i'm wrong but anyways i thought the material was good so this is one of those anonymous twitter accounts that's like this guy's clearly wealthy he owns something crypto punks and he's like kind of smart i would say like he's a little navali for like the crypto world he's like pseudosynonymous a little bit in the vault right so so he has this he has his threat he goes uh here's how i think about um about making it or like wealth basically he goes level one crushed by circumstances these are like refugees in syria you're born in a civil war in the congo unfortunately billions of our like come you know comrades in life don't even have the faintest opportunity to make it because they were born in you know for circumstances outside their control they were born into like very very tough situations he goes for me he goes this this feels like this makes me feel funny inside uh i'm paraphrasing for it but it makes it makes me feel funny inside right like thousands of little kids will die today and i'm on the internet buying you know jpegs for for thousands of dollars um you know because and they don't have access to a 50 cent pill that could like end their agony and like give them like you know some peace and they're you know their dreams are being cut short because they don't have access to basic you know water or sanitation and medicine he goes because level one is not a um it's not a like niceness problem it's a coordination problem he goes literally everybody on earth would skip having a soda today you know and they would just have a glass of water instead if they knew it would save that kid's life if that three bucks could go to the kid's life instead for that coffee or that soda that you would skip but the systems are not placed in order for us to be able to just push that button easily and have that outcome happen he goes for for now society hasn't fixed this this tweet alone i thought was like one of the most insightful and maybe i'm just a [ __ ] sucker for this [ __ ] but like when he said this it rang so true to me that yes we all in the like privileged world would happily skip over a cup of coffee or more just i skipped that that money goes into this thing it actually saves this person but like we need the coordination we need the certainty we need we need a lot of people to do it for that effect to happen and then we need the money to actually go to the right place and then we need to see the result in order for us to actually like fix these problems at scale so i thought wow if you want to go work on a startup idea solve that make it so that lots of people can very easily skip this thing and that they can that money actually gets the result done and then everybody sees the result of it and it would bring so much gratification that we would all want to do it again um okay so that's one tweet then he goes all right if you're at level one maybe crushed by circumstances you're not reading these tweets i have no solutions to level one i hope humans progress and we can solve level one we can reduce level one problems every year if you're if you're ordering your key point if you're reading this tweet you've already made it past level one keep going all right level two is the struggle is real this is where day to day you have financial problems they're kind of finance is like a stress for you you might have a job or two you don't have much in terms of savings you worry about if you had an emergency where would you find the money to pay for it if a car breaks down it can cause a cascading set of crises and problems just because you didn't have enough money buffer if you're in level two and you're in good health do everything possible to get out of level two work overtime take another job push harder right now because just getting out of level two to level three the life change is massive uh when money problems are like front and center in your life or that stress lingers in your head all day it is a tax on your happiness and your productivity and unlike level one there's a lot of people in level two that i know and have been there in life and have gotten out and if you can escape do everything possible to do so uh he goes here's my my practical advice if another if you're in level two and you might own something like an nft that if you sold it it would move you into level three just absolutely sell it right now and get out of level two uh the life benefits versus level two and level three are huge and he goes level three middle class in the u.s everybody thinks they're middle class i think this is so true um if you're if you're making 50 000 a year in ohio you think you're middle class if you're making 500 000 in san francisco you think you're middle class so uh despite the fact that there is a definable middle class and he's like for you know for simplicity let's just call it this you got a house you have a car you have some some savings but you don't have enough where you have like [ __ ] you money you can't just buy whatever you want and you don't really know how you're gonna pay for big things down the road bigger house college et cetera um i spent most of this guys talking to you guys i spent most of my life my life in middle class it's a great happy place to be if you're there don't keep looking up at the people who have more first be appreciative that you're not in level two or level level one where you're crushed by circumstances you have a great life you're in the top one percent of anybody who has ever lived on earth uh that is very true he goes level four i call this we like nice things he's like this is where he goes this is anything from like the up the top end of middle class to like the uber rich and it's a state of mind it's not a specific income level your basic life issues are sorted and now you just buy things you enjoy this might be like a trip a vacation a hou a second house or it might be a private jet there's an endless playground of [ __ ] to buy and however much you earn you can spend it there's enough things to go by congratulations once again you've made it you're now in the 0.01 percent of people who have ever lived on planet earth and then he starts talking about like you know but level four is tricky um you think it brings you a lot more happiness it doesn't really in fact sometimes it brings more stress or this anxiety that you you you got it all and you're still not happy and um here you go so actually level three kind of only had upsides compared to level two but level four actually has some traps if you made it to level four congrats you know like um here's my take you know you get you really want to get to level you want to be first he says be honest with yourself no he goes first do all the things go to paris rent a boat upgrade your flight to business class check out how level 4 lives he goes then ask yourself are you happier did this bring you joy which of those things brought you joy what was the is it the stuff is it the experiences what felt great what doesn't like ask yourself those questions it goes level five is when you're post consumption where you no longer care about the [ __ ] you can buy you're just caring about sort of like how you choose to spend your time you want to spend your time in ways that bring you like peace and happiness for some people that's a small house and a truck on a farm in wyoming for other people that's you know living large you know in new york and being a power player and on cnbc every week don't make any judgments uh it is what it is just you know figure out how you want to spend your time are you playing golf or are you working on something with a higher purpose for you the happiest people seem to be the people that are satisfied through level five by working on things that intrinsically motivate them intrinsic happiness not external goods blah blah blah blah um and that's the that's the truth so i was just curious what's your what's your take on this that's awesome that's awesome is there any part of this by the way he goes question i get what level is his username 6529 which is his username he goes i balance between level four and five based on how much i enjoy how much i worry about the world and nice things i see on instagram any given day i spent most of my life in level three middle class loved it my family had brief moments in level one level two but i was too young to notice i feel blessed that's good this is a good ass thread this could be a book um he did a good job i guess you're right he uh his writing was pretty good if that's if you read it exactly i was skimming it and i was like it's confusing but that's amazing i think intel hook sucked it was way too much jargon but the actual content was solid the one thing i told him i go i dm to my go this is a great thread it resonates i go the one thing you're missing is that there's a moment somewhere at the top of l3 right before l4 maybe this is just l4 which is that you decouple time and money where before in your life you were always trading your time to earn money and now you start trading your time your money to get more time back and i said actually i think that's what level four really is not just being able to buy all the stuff you want it's the freedom of time and recognize that and like get to that point as fast as you can i think it's this is an interesting conversation for us because both of us probably have very recently gone from three to four and very likely are not entirely far from four to five um and so but we kind of experienced all that very we we experienced both all those jumps like in a in like a incredibly short amount of time um can i do my wannabe naval thing for a second yeah so we were right we were level three when we first met you know last seven eight years of our life and then probably in the last two years when i sold my company and you sold yours is when we jumped into level four and if we the naval thing is basically we got financial freedom which meant we don't have to like worry about money anymore um but then we need uh freedom from finance which is level five which is when you stop making decisions based on money and i think that's what the truly wealthy people do is they choose how to spend their time not because of the financial outcome at all but look bro listen listen though let's let's no longer pulls at them let's be real here though we just first of all we're getting paid stupid money to just sit here and shoot the [ __ ] second of all we just shot the [ __ ] about you taking the week off to learn so like we're not are like maybe that is five or is that four it is five but at the same time why am i doing this ecommerce business is it because it lights my soul on fire every day no it's because there was an opportunity and i'm trying to capitalize on it and it's working and now i don't want to give it up because i think it's going to be super successful and i like i like feeling like i'm successful i like winning i like when a project works and i like the money that comes with it and so like there are still and i like the way he said he bounces between them it's not like when you're at a level well then 100 of your decisions and you 100 of your life you you're you're acting that way it's not you you like fluctuate between these things and i personally have not been able to like let go of like i i haven't been able to remove money from my kind of like core decision-making criteria of why to do something or not do something it's still there that means i'm not actually free from it because it's still like part of the contract part of the part of the thing i'm optimizing for whereas i know some people who don't do that who like michael burch uh right who's my main investor i got to work with him sit next to him every day he he does something he invests he does things that will make money he thinks he's you know he gets excited when an investment or business starts to work and makes money but when we were deciding what to do in any really any given case like i feel like money was like i don't know 12th on the list of things he would think about is he a billionaire you think or he's probably he may not be but it doesn't matter he goes most people that you think are billionaires are not not quite there but it doesn't matter it's probably not that you know what's there between 500 and a billion right um yeah and so um do you think he so the the weird thing that i've noticed is when you when money is now no longer part of the equation it's kind of depressing because you're like [ __ ] this has been like the goal the whole time and now like my decision-making process has totally changed it's kind of a weird spot and so is he depressed do you think because of that because like he's the same motivating factor isn't there anymore and he's like oh man now i'm like changed no he's happy he's really happy but he did tell me he goes actually he didn't tell me this okay the reason the billionaire conversation came up is because the bbc did a documentary called how to be a billionaire yeah by the way your boy has a camera a cameo in it i saw a minute or two um i don't know where this thing plays it's like on airplanes so sometimes i'll get a picture somebody sends me their head rest as they're watching this documentary and then i popped into it and so like you know because they're talking it's about michael it's not about me but like there's they follow four people that are billionaires i think he told me three of the four he goes i don't think are actually billionaires himself included and he goes he says something in there he goes yeah when we sold bibo and we had like you know all of a sudden all this wealth he goes it's obviously great and like you know but kind of anticlimactic like i had more fun building it than i did selling it and he goes um you know the weird thing was that anytime i felt like not so good like if i felt sad or whatever like nobody wants to hear it right like what's the most annoying thing in the world an unhappy billionaire and i think he said something like that i was like wow that's so true actually like if he came to me about being glum and whatever it would be hard for me and my initial reaction to be like dude you have it all and it's like that's what a person of the third world would say to me and that's what a crippled person would say to that person in the third world like this there's a never-ending chain of looking at somebody and saying you're unhappy you have it all and so he did say there was time such people where they were kind of like well what do we do now and um that was a little bit weird and you can be unhappy for other parts of your life that money doesn't solve those problems and uh whether it's like relationships or other stuff that can happen too but since i've known him which was a few years after he sold it he is extremely happy and at peace he doesn't have like fomo or this itchiness to like go prove himself and all this stuff i didn't see it at least um and then he worked on projects that gave him joy so like he loves building like buying real estate buying buildings and like designing a space and having people use that space so what that's why our office was so pimped out because he just loved the idea of building a dream office and coming to work in it every day and having you know this is the perfect playground to go work in he did that with the battery bought a 60 000 square foot old candy factory retrofitted it and then put you know turned into willy wonka's factory he made all the rooms unique and fun to be in and that project was never going to make money in fact everybody told him dude you're burning so much money doing this is such a bad financial move he's like well that's okay it's not a financial move how did that end you know what was it he got well he built a dope space it had like the who's who our members like through it he's made all these made all these different connections like you know when justin bieber comes down and beyonce they stay there and you know elon musk hangs out there like dude i'm pretty sure i was i'm pretty sure i was there one time and i saw a monk and snoop dogg sitting at a booth together yeah dude it's crazy you could bump into a lot of people there uh you know i saw leonardo dicaprio walk in i was like oh [ __ ] leo um but you know it's not just that the fame like obviously like i think that i think that side still pulls to him i think the social side obviously he does a lot of things to like maximize the social game but it's not financial so he had told me once he's like he's like yeah this thing cost a lot of money to build and we we blew our budget on like trying to make it a dope space uh he's like but my thing was my rule was like okay once it's operational i don't mind if i never get my capex back as long as the opex doesn't continually bleed more and more money every year and that's what it got to where the opex basically the membership and the the fees of the fee the membership dues plus the restaurant bar and all that cover the cost of running it so while he may never get a positive return on actually almost certainly will never get a positive return on the i don't know maybe maybe 100 million he put into like the building and the build out i don't know what it was but like i wouldn't be shocked if it was 50 to 100 million uh i don't think he'll ever get that back but it doesn't believe money now and so he's like happy with that so yeah anyways i don't know long story short he's super happy he goes he goes on trips to africa all the time where like he doesn't just give money to charity water he goes there he visits the villages he stays there in a tent and he like experiences that he brings his whole family with them and that's like their favorite time of the year is when they get to go to like rural africa sleep in a tent you know and uh and live in this village and then like bring help bring like better work life conditions to the people there well that's badass do we want to um do we want to end there or what do you want to do yeah we can end there because uh somehow we went pretty long they told us to keep these under 45 minutes for youtube but uh i have a feeling it's gonna be hard for us to do that that's all right this one was maybe extraordinary i i i was i was long-winded yeah well all right this idea you said something about let's do one more uh panic attacks you said you've had panic attacks and you started you asked twitter for panic attack help this gave me an idea but first tell me your panic attack thing and then i'll tell you my idea so i've had panic attacks since the seventh grade i remember the exact day it was the third day of school at 8 55 pm i had this weird thought where i thought like what's outside of the world and like if you like you go into space you just like keep going and like there's nothing out there and we're meeting and i remember i if i flipped out and i got panicky i went to the doc i went to the downs to the nurse i was like my heart i'm having a heart attack i can't breathe like i do and so ever since then i've had i've been very panicky and i get a panic attack i have very very distinct triggers and i take daily medication and like a xanax for that i keep with me just in case so like anything that involves tight spaces that i can't get out of or uh like being really deep in the wilderness and i can't get out of i flip out and i hate it so i get crazy panic attacks because of it so like when we fly i'm very medicated um i just i can't stand very claustrophobic i don't go in elevators or i try not to i don't like rooms without windows and i don't take the subway okay and when you get a panic attack what do you do i keep medication on me at all times and i'll take one pill um if i didn't take that pill it feels like i'm dying like i feel like i want to kill myself like i'm like my heart is is going so hard uh i feel like i feel like i'm dying i feel like i'm about to die i literally think the world's gonna end and i like i'm flipping out okay that's crazy i've never experienced something like that my buddy had one in college while we were he was sitting nationals were playing halo and then like he was doing something else and he had a panic attack and like we called an ambulance and it was the first time i've ever heard this and at the time i was like bro just relax like yeah it's hard it's like right that was my time it's like telling it it's like telling a drug addict like dude just don't do heroin right i know i know that's like i didn't understand it and um it was my first time experiencing it yeah it sounded like a heart attack like all his symptoms were like a heart attack symptoms and so uh one thing i wanted to share with you somebody had tweeted this and i saw that emmett who was my my manager at the time but he's the ceo of twitch he had tweeted this back somebody said tweeted to me no no somebody had tweeted this out they go any advice on how to help someone experiencing anxiety and potentially panic attacks relax and ground themselves i don't have experience with this uh blah blah blah and then emmett randomly replied sorry sorry i want to get contacts they retweeted my tweet no no this was a tweet i saw two years ago that your tweet guided me okay i saw him reply to this and he goes this may sound weird but the mammalian diving reflex is triggered by triggered by submerging your face in cold water and cuts the panic attack loop can be very very effective but obviously hard to do in public have you ever heard of this no but i would love i would be interested in it so then he linked it and i you know so i went to it so like here you can uh i'll give you the link so emmet had panic attacks i think a lot of high-functioning people get it because like i think in order to be like high-tech consume so or why would because in order to be in order to be like high-functioning and successful often times you're motivated you're like you're you're neurotic right you're motivated by some anxiety driven thing and i imagine there's a huge correlation between the two so i'm looking at it so basically my understanding so i look i remember reading this two years ago when you tweeted it reminded me of it so um i remember looking into it and basically there's uh you just need to change state so there's a state that triggers the panic attack and so if you want to undo the if you want to stop the panic attack you need to change state that's hard to change state when you're in a panic attack and so the when you feel it coming on this is the thing to do you go into a very cold uh a very cold ice water you have to get really cold water and plunge your face for 10 to 20 seconds and what that does is it automatically triggers your heart rate uh to slow down and your um your blood gets sort of like centered around your core and that will short-circuit the the panic attack loop and so for you or anybody else who has this that's good i don't know how you would try this but but try it well it's not that bad it looks like there's like an example of a guy in his kitchen with just a bowl of ice water like i get him in the middle at night sometimes i'll wake up and i'm like what's going on where am i and i start flipping out uh and he shows his heartbeat right going from 103 beats per minute to 47 beats per minute after just 20 seconds with his face in the thing so this guy so okay so by the way 103 beats per minute just from a panic attack that's pretty wild that's a that's a high that's a high heart rate it's hard like i can't make my heart rate go that high just sitting still right now isn't like resting heart rate like 70 to 90 or something like that it should be less than 70 yeah uh okay so that was the first thing that came to mind the second thing was um uh patients like me so the thing you did where you were like i have this thing and like people have kind of like an aversion to going to the doctor in general right some people don't go because of cost some people don't go because of convenience some people don't go because they don't like the doctor some people don't go because they just want to feel they are worried they're going to get diagnosed with something and they just they'd rather be a blissful ignorance and patience like me has always been this thing that fascinated me are you familiar with patients like me no i'm looking it up it's this community it's where you find other people that have the same condition medical condition that you do so let's say you have some rare form of leukemia you will find a group of other people with the same form leukemia and then you could go there and like maybe in your real life you can't find anybody who can empathize with you or share ideas or share suffering or share you know uh in this there's a bunch of other people going through the same thing as you which is one of the most bonding experiences there is is going through suffering that uh going through a unique suffering that other people have gone through and so i think these groups are probably incredibly valuable to the person and also sticky as a product now they've raised 150 million dollars which tells me that this is a real like business opportunity but our patients like me has been around for a long time i bet that there's an opportunity to like reboot the sort of like patients like me idea and just do it simpler more mobile-friendly and i think you'd be doing a lot of good in the world plus be building a very valuable app around community where and maybe you could start this with facebook groups you know there are lots of facebook groups for people who have certain conditions um and and i think there's probably a way to bootstrap this but i think this is a really valuable company to build both in terms of the value to science how does this make money value as a business i don't know how patients like me makes money i don't know if they you know have like sort of like you know pharmaceutical companies sponsor certain things or i don't know what they i don't know what they do as far as that goes maybe it's a paid membership i don't know i'm assuming people would pay once they find some value in the community for like maybe premium education or like a member's lounge or something like that um i'm not sure how they make money but i do think that these are probably very very valuable and the thing you did where you just kind of go ask if you want other people who have had similar who have the similarities the the response is crazy right i've gotten a hundred and dms exactly because if you if you've experienced something like the way i felt the urge to share with you this a solution like this is what happens whether it's like hey my pet won't eat well you know i have a maltipoo and she's picky eater i've tried everything any help and it's like people will [ __ ] come to the rescue on facebook and be like here is like a 10-part guide i just created for you because i went through that too and i found something that actually works and so there's this very strong psychology around that so i think that there's an opportunity to reboot patients like me i would use google adwords because i think people go to google when they have a problem this is interesting how to stop panic attacks and i would just use adwords to uh to grow this thing and try to get like you know each niche uh thing to have like you know tens of thousands of members inside what calls it like the crazy crew um crazy crew.co uh this is awesome i've never seen this i got to research this maybe that's a good idea yeah i mean i got so many disease things right dude when you had your lyme disease problem who saved you you put it out there in public like i got this [ __ ] thing and then somebody was like yo i got you she's yeah i got you and then she gave you like the miracle cure and then you're like fine now right like you literally kind of got your life saved through doing something yeah yeah the lady i told the story lady oh i don't even know bought me a 25 000 treatment and i uh she didn't even know who i was it was it was wild i'm gonna have to research held yeah all right well good suggestion i'm gonna research this i've never heard of this i've never heard of so many of these things mental agility and uh patients like me what a crazy business i have to research it um all right i think that's the episode we'll see if this is gonna be good this is our longest episode ever i think yeah this one went awhile all right we're out here [Music] never looking back

if you got into ethereum early on in the crowd sale and you you bet on that thing at 30 cents because uh you're a developer and you you really believed in this new programmable blockchain you deserve your tens of millions of dollars you deserve your 100 million dollars if you're rich because you bought like a picture of a rock you know three months ago or you know a computer generated squiggle that's now worth a quarter million dollars [ __ ] you yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back i'm looking at my uh my phone i just got a text message because my my three nieces went back to the winter you know first day of school today and uh i was talking to one of them this morning and i go ellie how you know how are you feeling first day ever going to a school and she goes i go i go how are you feeling in one word she goes my heart is going fast i was like oh i'm melted i'm melted your uncle is a puddle on the ground now he cannot function anymore so that's awesome shout out to ellie for uh her first day of school hopefully it's going well that's awesome that's a great one okay um can i start by telling you a quick story that i don't think i've ever told you but i think you'll get a kick out of so about this is the bitcoin one we'll tell that one soon but about three years ago i so i talk about solid time so i don't want to like rub it or like continue talking about this [ __ ] because it gets boring but basically i don't do any drugs i don't drink i'm pretty straight lace all right i've been straight laced for eight years i don't do anything i'm i'm fearful of anything but i was getting really curious about uh uh psychedelics so like mushrooms okay mdma therapy ketamine therapy i did what a lot of people did i read the book how to change your mind by michael pollan and i was like oh this is great i'm really interested in this and so i found a person who was going to lead a an mdma therapy like session and so i went to dinner at her house with my wife came with me and it was like three other couples and we went to this thing and i was we were and she wanted to do like a session to get to know people in order to determine if this was a good fit because basically what you do is you take a dose of mdma and then like she's talking about molly i think so yeah i believe so uh it's all or similar at least i'm not i i really frankly don't know but i think it's like the same thing and we uh you eat it you drink it it's like a pig it's like a pill i guess it's a pill you swallow it okay and we go to this group and i'm into like the the idea of psychedelics for therapy like uh to like you know for veterans but also people who just want breakthroughs or who have depression i'm on board with i've got friends to do it i love it i don't really do i don't do drugs because i just don't feel comfortable doing it but i really wanted to explore it and get and get to know these people and try this out and i went to this group and they were crazy hippy dippy like super hippy dippy but mind you this is in san francisco and she had a really nice place and so like we start talking and all of a sudden it gets so hippy-dippy and woo-woo that she's like you know like this medicine needs to be free for everyone and capitalism is just ruining everything and like you know we need to live in a society where we can just barter and trade and like this way we can get some medicine let me just guess sam triggered it starts a debate triggered so hard and uh and then we start talking we i'm like in my back of my head i'm like well then why am i paying you like four thousand dollars for this but you're like yeah refund me right yeah so give my money back and we start talking and like this is just sitting in my head and i'm like oh man four grand this thing was four grand to do or 2500 it was like multiple thousands of dollars i think it was closer to three or four thousand than it was two thousand i forget the exact amount because you can take a family of four to disneyland get the fast pass get the turkey leg go get the mickey mouse ears and still come in under four grand that's a real psychedelic experience if you want yeah i look i agree it was crazy but look i'm trying to be open-minded i wanted to explore this i i just read the book i was all enthused but in my head i'm just sitting there at this dinner with this in the back of my head and i'm thinking about this i'm like oh my god like i can't believe like this is these people are so [ __ ] and and then i i asked her and i go what what did you used to do for a living she used to work at lehman brothers and now has a venture capital firm on the side and this whole and and i like when i heard this i was like i started giggling and i was like well you do realize that this is like just ridiculous what you said earlier right and i said this at the dinner i'm like you know that's that's just like crazy and they are also talking about how like this medicine needs to be available for everyone and like they need to help the masses and they're like where are you from i'm like i'm from missouri and they said oh flyover country uh and i'm just like oh my god this is the most smug thing ever so eventually i get into an argument with her at the dinner table and she was just like you know i don't think this is a good fit and i was like i agree this is not a good fit i can't do drugs with you not a good fit and so i can't even do dinner with you yeah i can do dinner with you let alone like get high and talk about my feelings with you like not going to work this is a horrible fit and so i just i had to leave i got kicked out like i basically got asked to leave and they're like sarah you're cool yeah i i just wasn't in a good place and so i got kicked out of the group i wasn't able to do drugs with them and that was my experience with psychedelic uh that was my only experience with like the psychedelic therapy but i think that these style these retreat styles for psychedelic stuff starting in like 2015 i had friends that would go do ayahuasca you know ayahuasca is oh so i've heard ayahuasca many times so i know of it i know kind of what the what the the why people do it you should explain it anyways but if you said hey this is like my dolly parton thing i couldn't pick dolly parton out of a lineup if you said hey draw ayahuasca i draw some feathers in a in a bowl of liquid i don't think that what the hell is actually i don't think you're far off again i'm a total noob here as well but my friends do it i believe it's like a powder and you mix it with water and you put it in a bowl or whatever and you like pass around like this thing and you take a drink out of it and then you stay up all night like doing wild stuff and like you a lot of times they make it makes you throw up and that's like part of the the journey and experience it's freaking weird but like whatever i'm open to it and i've been had i've had friends like start doing this in 2015. now on instagram i am seeing so many of my friends go to south america go to mexico all talking about like these journeys i started listening to this health podcast backpacking through europe is 100 america and i and i like to make fun of it because it's some basic bit [ __ ] but you want to know what it's i'm on board i'm so on board with this i am totally on board with this and i think that psychedelic retreats like i've been i read a bloomberg article about them and uh this guy in jamaica and they charge like it ranges from 25 000 to 2500 to 30 000 and they bring you to this like nice place they get you they give you the the drugs like it's a variety of sometimes it's ayahuasca ketamine um uh what's it still asylum what's mushrooms um yeah and they like do this therapy stuff i am so on board with this and unfortunately my one experience was horrible but i'm so on board with this it wasn't the drugs it was the people it was the people it was the hypocrites that they're trying to get me to take this drug yeah i'm like like i can't trust you like you're gonna tell me like you want to solve you want to like like solve the world's problems and you're gonna make fun of me for being from missouri like that this like this is a bad fit uh you know right just tell me your [ __ ] first dude i i have so many yeah exactly it's like a a meeting it's like hi i'm sam and i'm full of [ __ ] yeah all right so so i have a bunch of thoughts about this uh where do i begin first shout out to the guy who came to our live podcast show in austin who is apparently his mushroom dealer don't remember his name i remember that showed me some show he loved that like i loved to take out his phone and just show pictures of his he opened up his camera roll not a single friend or family there just different exotic mushrooms in his hand and they all look the same they all look so he kept showing like dirt i was like yeah cool man cool somebody who's never never done mushrooms couldn't couldn't tell it was like showing me different bottles of wine and i'm sober like i uh yeah okay it looks great it looks fantastic that one's that was dark red cool so that's one thing i just remember that guy when you were telling this story second i've i met this guy who's really interesting uh did i tell you about this guy robbie bent no okay so this is this is cool all right so this guy so robbie ben what's his story so he's a founder of a he's a startup founder he has this idea for um by the way when i tell stories i'm pretty sure like at least 40 of them are just the details are completely wrong but i always get the essence of the story right so i'll say that so robby if i butcher your story sorry about that all right so i think he had a startup that was like this was back when cell phone roaming was a big problem like you would go travel somewhere and you're if you like turned your phone on for one minute you'd like spent a thousand dollars so basically roaming was a problem and so he was trying to build this like sim card company for like international roaming like an international sim card and raises i think like 25 million dollars or something like that and uh you know like pretty soon after that uh like roaming became like free or something you know something happened the company like was pointless at some point and he's like oh [ __ ] okay uh what do i do now company kind of fails he's kind of in a funk he's in a depression and so i think he was uh he was i think he was depressed i think he was using drugs i'm not sure exactly what the story was but he's kind of in a low place in life and his friend is like you know what you need to go backpacking through europe you need to go to south america and do some ayahuasca or he decides he's going to do it so he goes on this ayahuasca trip and he's like uh you know same story as everybody who goes to burning man or south america for ayahuasca they're like oh life-changing best experience i think if you don't have a good experience they must just kill you because i've never met anybody who didn't have a life-changing experience it's all positive so so he's got this all positive experience and he meets this person there also doing the trip and um and they're you know i was hanging out together and this guy's like hey he's like you know so what do you do he's like oh you know robbie's like i just went through this crazy thing i'm like broke my company failed i'm like in the dumps and this guy's like oh you know i'm uh i'm actually creating this crypto venture capital fund this is five years ago six years ago now he's like you know i'm we're raising one of the first funds for crypto to invest in crypto and um you know like a lot of these people we invest in they're like you know great engineers or they're uh they're just really into crypto but they're not great at marketing and so like maybe you could just help out some of my portfolio companies like if you've got nothing else to do just come hang out with me and let's let's do this and by the way you should check out this thing called ethereum and uh and so he's like oh ethereum what's that they just done its crowd sale i think ethereum was like at six dollars at the time so ethereum today is like 3 500 as of this morning and uh and so he he starts organizing all these like meetups so he's like i don't know anything about crypto but this guy said get in there's a lot of energy here and he followed his gut after the ayahuasca trip and was like look i got nothing to lose so let me do this and he starts organizing like basically like hackathons and then with the hackathons he gets engineers and then he tells the engineers hey you should go work at these like portfolio companies potentially so he's like kind of creating some values just helping a bunch of people out and he starts getting really interested in ethereum because he's like that's where the most energy is so he starts organizing like all the ethereum hackathons and people are loving it the ethereum foundation reaches out it's like hey you should come on and be like the first marketing person for ethereum so this guy joins joins uh the ethereum project and he's the first kind of like marketer guy non-technical person working on the thing and he's basically building the community and the passion around it he's hosting events and things like that and so he went from like the dumps he gets into ethereum like under ten dollars ethereum runs up and by the way i was like i asked him i was like did you like how big did you bet on this he's like well i had nothing he's like but i took every dollar i had and i put it into ethereum he was like i didn't have much i heard it's probably like 10 grand or something like that he's like i think i borrowed money from like my parents and i just put it all into ethereum and it was like amazing for me and so anyways he makes life-changing money and uh and after a couple years in the crypto scene he's like you know what um crypto's great i made a bunch of money doing this now but i'm ready for my next thing and he's like goes back to his roots he's like that psychedelic trip ayahuasca trip was like so meaningful for me so he in the meantime had been getting into all kinds of like different types of like kind of therapies so he was like cold therapy heat therapy breath work all these like kind of like you know kind of like these hippy-dippy like sort of alternative ways to like improve your body and so when i called him i met him for the first time he's on the zoom and his background is like this oasis i'm like oh cool background like cool background image he's like no this is like my garage i built out and he basically built this in he's in canada he built this epic like wood cabin looking thing it's got this custom cold plunge he made it's this 20 person sauna that he created because he hosts events there it's got all this greenery it's like a greenhouse he's got this like musical stuff and he created basically this experience where you could come if you wanted to have one of these experiences you could do hot cold therapy and he would take you through an intense cold plus heat like you know you go back and forth between that like a like a banya bath type situation and then the second thing he did was these like kind of facilitated mdma type i don't know what drug it was but facilitated like psychedelic experiences where they have a doctor on site and then they do this like group experience together and you're guided through it exactly like what you're talking about yeah and i was like dude that's a great idea i was like because you know i'm a [ __ ] i don't i kind of want to have a life-changing experience but like with no risk can you like give me that and this is like the closest you're gonna get which is like doctor supervised in a group of people with people who've done this before and like it's for beginners and it's not just go do drugs in the in the in this like sketchy place like in a nice beautiful environment with music and it's controlled he's like yeah dude i put this up like i think he put it up on airbnb as an experience or he put it up a groupon or something i don't know where he put it we put it somewhere and he's just like booked out his his little like garage is basically booked out like 24 7. and since then he basically uh he's he he's like his next thing or the way he like evolved it he's like still he still does the live events but to scale it up he created this app called um inward and so i invested in this thing it's basically a breath work app so i started doing this every morning now the app's not even like fully out yet like you just sent me doing it yeah because i'm into i'm into breath work i like kind of heard about when wim hof and dabbled with that and i went to this buddhist thing once and like they do chanting which is like a form of like meditation i've done it before too it's great and so you should i'm gonna send you the soundcloud link uh and i had him come in my course when i taught the writing course i was like dude this thing's amazing i use this now for my morning routine like wake me up basically so i was like you know teaching over zoom can be the most [ __ ] boring thing and so i had him come in and do a five minute session for the students at the beginning and everybody was like hyped out of their mind by the end of it also some people were like yo i'm like lightheaded i need to like go sit down it's like yeah yeah that happens but he has this five minute guiding thing where it's like dope music mixed with a guided breath work session and he did in five minutes he was like waking everyone up anyway so i'm pretty like excited about this and i thought his story was pretty awesome of like his little journey to get here so i wanted to share that with you so well let's just keep going so i went to um when i lived in san francisco these guys i met these young guys on uh they went to stanford they were [Laughter] they weren't that young uh these guys these guys that went to stanford they basically i found this thing on eventbrite where they were doing like it was very clear what was happening which was it was two guys testing a startup idea and they either got someone to donate them a really big room uh or they like rented it for a very little amount of money but i think someone just donated them this room and one of them was like an enthusia enthusiastic person or enthusiast of breath work and he they basically we all went there and they put this eventbrite link up we each paid 30 and 30 of us went there so uh what's 30 times 30 is that 900. okay uh well we yeah we don't do public math and so yeah i take that i bleep that out i don't do public math uh so i went to his i went to this guy and he the the lights were down and they start playing this music and like i went with my co-worker he was like hey i found this thing on eventbrite let's go check it out and we went to his place and 30 of us did breath like a breath work session it was it was have you been to a soul cycle studio i was gonna say yeah it sounds like exactly yeah it felt exactly like that and it was the best business ever and they were clearly i talked to him afterwards he's like yeah we're just testing this out and we might turn it into a business and they didn't do it and they totally should have because it was way better than soul cycle why they had nothing it was just a room with lights sound and you're sitting there and they just hit play and the guy guides you a little bit he kind of talks to you and it was awesome but it was like the you walk out with a high so you've given people an experience so we talked about this a while ago with the simone biles thing we made a prediction that next five years mental fitness not mental health mental fitness which is training your body and your brain to sort of like be able to master your mind a little bit better um and not just avoid disease and illness but actually be fit mentally um this is gonna become more in vogue i think that this breath work i think breath work is gonna be the new meditation um i think that the same way that you know soul cycle and barry's boot camp and hot yoga have become these alternative you know we had the gym which is this kind of cold sterile isolated solo one player experience and then you have soul cycle come in it's like no this is multiplayer with a leader you just submit to they just tell you they just shout tell you what to do and they're like they look heroic on the stage with their body and their voice and their microphone and then we're going to program you with this music that you can't help but feel like you just went to the club we're going to heat you up so you sweat because that feels good you're going to feel like you've got a workout in and we're going to guide you through a process and whether that process is cycling or it's boxing at rumble or it's barry's boot camp and you're running on a treadmill or it's hot yoga and you're you know trying to touch your toes this is a model that works it is an experience that you give somebody is a feeling it is a one hour guaranteed high that you get to you get to get without the use of drugs and so um so i'm pretty convinced that there's going to be a breathwork style version of barry's boot camp or or hot yoga that becomes just as popular as some of those other ones perhaps even more popular and i think that the app that he's building is going to be like a calm comm style app if they execute well because i think there's a big market for this you know these are sort of like ancient techniques completely can be modernized another thing that stood out for during your story was i i've actually read about this so i've there's this like recurring theme of people i look up to so chris sacca or is it saka chris saka there's this uh israeli guy named uh uh vivi have you heard of vivi v so his uh his full name is uh aviv nevo so a v iv space n-e-v-o so this guy he's an israeli guy he's probably in his 60 now 60s now he kind of looks like sting he's like this like good looking like suave looking dude who's like in shape he's probably in his 60s uh he came from israel his parents were wealthy they died when he was young gave him 10 million dollars uh in an inheritance he used that 10 million dollars to invest in some stuff ends up becoming the largest shareholder of time warner and now is this like big shot guy who hangs out with like bono and like he's like a jay-z like they all looked like he's got like they think yeah yeah he's like this like spiritual guy you could google i mean there's a lot of like really interesting articles about him he's kind of like the great gatsby so anyway there's him there's chris sacca another person who this story applies to is this guy named cowboy cerrone cowboy cerrone donald truoni he's a famous ufc fighter they all have locations outside of major cities so cowboy cerrone has a place in denver this vb guy has a yeah he's got and this vv guy has a place right outside la and then chris sacca had a place in tahoe three hours outside of san francisco and their competitive advantage in getting into interesting deals is they have like interesting places that aren't necessarily expensive vivi's got his place is expensive expensive donald cerrone's at first probably wasn't that expensive chris hacker's not that expensive and he gets these like founders to come out to his place he's like hey look i have this cabin out in the woods you want to come chill and hang out and he like shows them around and gives them this amazing experience and that's how they like end up investing in different stuff i actually think that strategy is amazing to have a place just to live you can live a little bit on the outskirts and like everyone comes to you they're on your terms because that's the best way to like get [ __ ] done is everyone on at your house on your terms where you're the boss they get to know you i think that's a competitive advantage i've thought about doing that in either texas or new york where i'm staying now is getting a place that's like two hours outside of the main area dude let's let's time share it my my first million ranch i'll go in i'll invest in it with you we'll get five other cool people that we like and then whoever wants to retreat to the ranch at any given time can it would totally work like i think it's a real like a huge competitive advantage don't you i well i think it's cool i think it's definitely cool i don't know if it's a competitive it's a competitive advantage in that um you can go deep so there's this idea of like do you go wide or do you go deep i would say most people go wide i go deep in terms of in terms of your strategy with people so what what is wide wide means you have a lot of light connections loose ties you know a lot of acquaintances a lot of a lot of friends but not a lot of friends that you could call when you need something or not a lot of friends who are gonna think of you first when they see something awesome and going deep is the exact opposite it's having a group of you know 10 or less people that you're like okay i would go i don't go to war for you and you would go to war for me and i think that both of us have more of this deep strategy than wide where it's like we have a handful of people that we just trust implicitly i could give them my bank account and sleep well at night and um and because of that we can share information we can say dude so like how how do you do this how much you make doing this how do i set this up like what is this good for me bad for me you know what do you think or a deal happens and uh like this morning i'm in a deal that's going really well startup deal is going really well and a buddy texted me was just like hey look like get me into that and i was like okay i will i will put as much credibility as i can into this to get you into that deal and uh and vice versa if they if they had something then then the same and so i think that the ranch style escape is a great tool for going deep so krasaka talks about he would uh he had the founder of instagram early on uh he was like i think working out of dog patch labs as his like co-working space and he invited him up to his tahoe cabin to come like work out of there and i think he like stayed there for like a few weeks if i remember the story correctly like living in the guest house or whatever and then travis kalanick when he was starting uber the story is yeah he came to tahoe we spent four nights or three to three days together he was we were in the hot tub just jamming on what what could happen it's like immersion by the end of three days with somebody like you really trust that person you like that person it's so different than a meeting than a zoom call and trying to have eight back-to-back zoom calls and we had what's her name uh brie kimmel on the show and she showed us her calendar and it was like 30 minute zoom then 30 minute zoom then 40 minute email follow up then 20 minute zoom then it's like okay that's one strategy i want to basically say clear the calendar you know let's go road tripping together let's go you know let's spend a day let's go to this mma fight together let's have unique experiences that are longer more in depth and that build more trust and i'll i'd rather do that with a few people than try to do it try to know everybody same we're the exact same i find it to be exhausting um you want to do a few topics here yeah let's do it which one you want to do you drive um okay i'll do [Music] let's see let's do this um let's do the i don't know you want to tell the story about the consultant one i think that's probably the most interesting one all right uh so i i i i've not told you about this guy i don't think so it's a pretty memorable story all right so i have this friend that i was i was talking to recently and um i'm i'm trying to be a fair bit vague but i'm gonna try and give as many details as i possibly can and basically this person um they had a normal job a normal high-paying job like a lot of people listening to this they were a consultant at a large place and they lived very frugally and they were able to save a million dollars by the time that they were in their uh lower to mid thirties and when this happened this was around four years ago bitcoin uh was priced around twenty five hundred dollars three thousand dollars when this happened and this person is eccentric they're crazy um even though like they have their normal job and you would talk to them and you think that they're normal he likes to bet he just loves gambling like in a sense of like betting at all like he it seems like he's that's just like in his dna he's not afraid i think you're a little bit like that um not as extreme but definitely have a touch of that and so you know he started talking he goes you know i don't see any good place to invest this money right now and i've been doing crazy amounts of research i'm gonna go all in on bitcoin and this was when it was three thousand dollars twenty five hundred dollars we thought it was crazy so he cashed out his 401k he borrowed a little bit of money and he used kraken or something like kraken to get massive amounts of leverage like five or ten times leverage and he invested all of his money to the point where he had like four thousand dollars left of his one million all of it into bitcoin and recently when bitcoin hit its house by the way this was this was bitcoin after it had crashed from about twenty thousand down back down to three thousand so it's not like it was just all on the up and up no and recently when it got to sixty thousand dollars his some his one million is it was worth about like 95 million dollars and and and you talked to him you caught up with him i i had a a mutual friend was with him and he and he called me and he goes man this guy you like we were talking you know i was like hey whatever happened to this this person he goes well you know i caught up with him he's worth almost about a hundred million dollars right now and it totally worked and i was like wait what he goes yeah he's got a hundred million dollars at bitcoin right now and started with a million and did you know him when he was making the bet like were you there yeah what the hell are you doing yeah and i and i went out to dinner with him uh in 2000 and uh when did the one three years ago was what uh when did that was i think i think 2017 or 2018 i remember which one but there was a uh it peaked at the 2017 december or something yeah and then it crashed back down we went out to dinner and he was telling me about this and i was like you you're crazy you're a crazy person this is a horrible idea just invest in the index fund you know i'm really conservative and i'm like just invest in index funds you're nuts this is a horrible idea do not do it and he was enthused so enthused i couldn't talk him out of it and he was like thinking i was crazy he was like what are you crazy this is like it totally makes sense and i'm like it doesn't this is a horrible idea do not do this and he did it and so recently uh when when about four months ago whenever it was at like 50 60 grand it was worth close to 100 million dollars and i was asking about their lifestyle like not a lot had changed um and it was just or leaving it letting it run cashed out a little bit i think like 10 or 20 percent i believe but still letting it ride so now it's halved or i guess it's back up again but and and and the point of the story is basically i am so enthusiastic the point of the story is a dude bet a million dollars and made a hundred million dollars there is a plural but that's the point of the story let's be clear the point is that like i love that part of the story crazy people exist i'm not one of them and i'm happy that they exist so we just did this episode remi and i align with the ramit we're both fairly conservative just like 10 a year boring [ __ ] i love that these nuts these nutty people are real and exist because that's where progress come from comes from and i'm happy that they're real and so that yeah i just wanted to tell that quick story because i caught up with them recently that's an amazing story uh so i saw this um i saw this tweet that was great and basically what it said was um great uh to be great at investing just make bets that everybody agrees with dot dot dot later i thought that's so true which is uh there's a lot like baked into that which is that ultimately uh was that by shane parish he tweeted something like it and then somebody somebody replied with a simpler version of it shane had had the original one i think sahil bloom had the the the the punchier one-liner version of it yeah um and i thought there's so much baked into that which is you have to remember that if you're going to invest if everybody agrees it's a great investment then the price is baked in right so ultimately if you want to have any kind of outsized return you have to be betting on something that not everybody is agreeing with you is a uh is a good investment and so um and so i think that's important i think so i think it's important to know and so when you're doing something that doesn't mean everybody disagrees with me that's gonna be a great investment it's almost the opposite is true if everybody agrees with me on this then this probably isn't going to be a great investment it might be a good or solid investment it's probably just not going to be it's almost definitely not going to be a great great investment so that's how you kind of use that advice yeah i saw that i thought that was good um all right what do you want to do now uh by the way on this uh because the world's crazy and we're talking about like people just making 100 million dollars on random bets there's this great blog post that i think everybody should go read um i don't know how they'll link to it because it's weird maybe put in the show notes it's got a great headline the everything bubble and it's written by ftx which is a crypto uh cryptocurrency exchange we we talked about the the guy he was our billy of the week once this guy sam bakeman freed um and who had also made a pretty crazy trade uh to get the bankroll to be able to do this to build this exchange i think he's the youngest crypto uh billionaire or he's the youngest he's the wealthiest known crypto billionaire i think he's got a net worth of 10 billion dollars i think something like that somehow that's more than vitalik i don't know how that works but i guess so so anyways he um it's just packed with data so it basically starts with like bubbles people talk about bubbles and um and it's like what is a bubble right bubble is when you get this like sort of enthusiasm delusion greed and everybody sort of thinks that everything can only go up and then you know then there's just pull back or pop and it talks about like the size of pops and um and how when they happen and how that's played out through different bubble times and where we might be in this thing then it talks about like maybe this is a bubble that will never pop right why would that be and it basically talks about it goes through all the data around stimulus right so it's like 32 trillion dollars of stimulus has happened globally just since covet which is the largest stimulus the world has ever seen in terms of a perce even in terms of percentage of global gdp uh you know global banks are printing 100 834 million dollars per hour to buy bonds right now and um and 25 of those bonds are negative yielding so it's just like he starts to talk about all these different macro indicators and there's all these charts and graphs and numbers and it's very simple and it basically talks about where are we at um where are we at with with stimulus where are we at with commodities like copper aluminum uh why you wire used cars up 45 year-over-year and then it talks about um you know what's happening in the crypto market and equity market and i think there's one great quote which is basically it talks about like risk assets so traditionally you'd have like a risk asset which is let's say bonds and um bonds are like the safest thing and so the quote here i'll just read this out which is because of the amount of printing so the quantitative easing because they call it qe infinity which is basically the central bank and the fed just deciding to print an unstoppable amount of money with no end in sight so it says because of this your savings account turned into your checking account the bond market turned into your savings account the equity market turned into the bond market the venture market turned into the equity market and the crypto market became the new venture market basically like everything shifted over one unit so things that were low risk became everybody seeked higher higher risk and higher returns because the safe stuff was this sort of negative yielding and so everything shifted over one notch and i thought that was a good kind of observation so anyways there's a bun it's very you find a blog post that's this high density of like signal to noise i would go read this it's called the everything bubble and so what's your what's your opinion of i know that you're uh texting with me and a few guys earlier yeah you you have some strong opinions what's your opinion of what's going on with like the the nfts and and and all the rock like the the i don't even know yeah i was joking around i basically said like look okay if you got into bitcoin early because you you understood the difference between fiat currency and sound money and you're a technologist you understood cryptography like props to you you deserve you deserve your tens of millions hundreds of millions of dollars if you got into ethereum early on in the crowd sale and you you bet on that thing at 30 cents because you're a developer and you you really believed in this new programmable blockchain you deserve your tens of millions of dollars you deserve your hundred million dollars if you're rich because you bought like a picture of a rock you know three months ago or you know a computer generated squiggle that's now worth a quarter million dollars [ __ ] you that was my that was my point of view um i like my level of respect and like the level of durability i think that comes with these different waves um i might regret this later it might be that all these people they just truly understood this intersection of technology financial markets and art in a way that i don't get and you know to basically to get rich with with bitcoin early on you had to understand like uh the you know the financial you had a certain economic understanding of the world and a technical understanding of the world and you had to be sort of a little you know a little libertarian you had to have those three to bet on it super early on and for ethereum the same thing you had to have a certain mix of technical plus financial like uh savviness for this it's basically like art plus finance uh plus technology if you if you're gonna get rich during this and i just feel like i don't know if it's my twitter feed or if it's everybody's twitter feed but um i feel like half the people i know have lost their mind and um and i know i sound like that sometimes with crypto so this is just one of them that i don't get but i really don't see the sustainability of this nft market i think it is like it is built on greater fool theory this is people that are not buying things because they like the art they're buying things because they think they're going to get rich they think that the next person is going to come in and buy it i think there's a whole lot of like either you know wash trading or painting the tape which is basically when when two friends sort of pass something amongst each other in order to drive up the price and then they sell it you know and then you know the next sucker comes in and buys it you know for because they think that's the market price and i think that it could be one person with multiple accounts it could be you know a handful of people that are manipulating these markets i don't believe in the nft craze in the same way that it seems like a lot of people in tech do i think it's really cool technology i think there's a lot of cool stuff that's going to happen but i think people are just diving into every freaking project and that to me seems misguided and the the crazy returns that they're getting like i'm the hater you know sort of rooting for it to fail because i don't get it i'm not participating in it and it just doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like a true value creation it just seems like you know um delusion i completely agree i'm freaked out by it we're on the exact same page it like that and by the way as you say when i when i say that like i will still buy a few nfts because i'm a i'm a believer of like when i have this strong of an emotion it's a signal to me that that's where i need to go lean in and learn now i don't go crazy with it i will make small bets i'll talk to people i will be open-minded because i've felt this way many times before and been wrong i felt it and i've been right but i felt it and i've been wrong and so all i know is that that means there's something really interesting going on i will still play in that field i will make small bets i will meet a bunch of smart people and if something changes my mind i'll go make a big bold bet but i would say like the thing that seems off to me is um you know it just seems like every third week there's a new crypto project like yes just yesterday there was this thing called loot did you see this well what is that i don't understand it explain it to me so here's what i know about it the uh the founder you know you know this guy dom hoffman he created vine and then he created uh some other [ __ ] since vine i don't know if he was with h maybe he was hq yeah maybe maybe he was uh he's one of the one of the vine founders early on so he just released a new project yesterday called loot and so instead of it being like a uh you know a crypto punk which is like a little eight bit character or uh you know an ape from board 848 yacht club which is like a you know monkey a picture of monkey this is a black square with like i don't know 10 words of white text that make no sense just gibberish it's just computer generated gibberish and that's the whole nft and just yesterday you could just all you had to do was pay the gas fee which means just pay the processing fee to like mint one so it came out ben saw the tweet ben minted one and uh i think today it's worth 10 to eat which is about thirty thousand dollars this is in one day he paid he paid you know probably under a hundred dollars to mint one of these just to just the processing fee he paid 50 bucks or whatever the gas price and then today i think the floor is like six or six or ten eats which is like you know no for this black square that will say like lions mountain spiking diagonal line castle you know valorant you know it's like doesn't mean anything right and then and it's like open ip you can go like you can build like games on top of it there's cool stuff you could do on top of it but like it's so hard to wrap my head around like this and it just feels like every third day there's like a new one and um and this is where i'm like the old guy on the lawn shaking my fist like you kids don't understand the meaning of hard work and usually i'm the one laughing at the old guys you're saying that just saying you don't get it in this case i don't get it do we want to keep hating on stuff and go to whoop [Music] uh yeah okay this is the play what would you call it the player haters ball this is the player haters ball episode because i have another one that i could hate on uh let's do let's do whoop first yeah so um well you go ahead go ahead i'll frame it whoop raise 200 million dollars a series f whoop which if you don't know is like a wristband uh like a kind of health tracker fitness tracker thing you wear i have one i lost the charger so it's dead right now um but it's basically like a little fitbit you wear and it tracks your sleep attracts your exercise it's like i think that the the word on the street with whoop is basically amazing marketing and product is uh it's like you know not the most accurate but who gives a [ __ ] and uh basically they charge you you know some amount for the band and then there's a monthly subscription 20 30 bucks a month or something like that i think the the part right now the band is free and it's 30 dollars a month if you subscribe for the year or something like that you have to subscribe in order to use it yeah so that's whoop uh and then same thing eight sleep which is a bed that tracks your sleep and it can kind of it can it's thermo regulating so it can make you cold hot i had one i returned it because i wasn't super impressed by it um they raised 86 million dollars at a 500 million dollar evaluation so what do you which i think i know based on the way you started it i but the reason i put it on here i wanted to know are you a believer or are you like you know where do you bet that these end up how how much do you believe in these how much was the what valuation um i don't know i think whoops over a billion dollars that's my guess i don't i would have to think i would have to see that yeah 3.6 3.6 billion dollars oh and and also the wonderful kiss of death softbank and then kevin durant and other athletes are investing you know that's uh that's called the sucker round it's not called the series app it's called the sucker round so the eight sleep thing i'm well check this out look up right now what's casper's market cap right now so casper between one and three billion dollars is my guess uh let's see oh my god way worse 200 million dollars okay so casper has a market cap right now of 200 million dollars we had the founder of casper speak at hustlecon awesome guy great story really great business when it was just getting started i made a million dollars and i think it's first week they raised prior to going public around 250 million dollars i think as of this second they have a market cap they went public of 200 million dollars so they are worth less than um the amount of money that they raised point five x of revenue point five x of revenue i think that for eight sleep i i and i think that that is a good valuation for casper i'm on board with that because it's really hard to do i think that that is what's gonna happen to eight sleep whoop i think is a little bit different because it has subscription revenue um you know i i i'll buy by the way i think i think eight sleeps trying to do the same thing so they don't just sell you the mattress they sell you the subscription with the mattress they're like they won't they think the bold case is it's peloton it's a piece of hardware everybody sleeps you sleep eight hours a night you can optimize your sleep it has some such good health impacts for you right like all true and um you know mattress industry is big so what we're going to do is we're going to sell the best you know connected mattress and then we're going to charge you a monthly subscription on top of that that's my guess i think they might have no man i think that's a really hard argument to make but that that's expensive that's it that's another tesla of beds says their their ad i um so when we first when we were getting the hustle going um this company called quip advertised with us and i used to write these advertorials i'm not sure if i made this up or if i stole it from somewhere else that's a toothbrush right yeah and i wrote and i when we were getting started i used to write these articles and i wrote this one article for hint and the headline was like um i forget what the headline was but it was great like and it got like 10 million views 5 million views and they spent so much money driving traffic to it and so if you go to outbrain and you scroll down and you see these little articles um you see these little articles on the bottom of cnn and it says like a headline you would see the hustle's article and i wrote that article and it was called like it was like a hint yeah it was called like it had the word sweetie like sweetie this is never going to work said this one coke executive or something like that or what was it do you see like i'm trying trying to find it right now and so i wrote an article like that and it crushed then quip saw and they're like that's great write one for us so i wrote one for them and i called them the tesla of toothbrushes and that crushed and they said they spent a ton of money driving traffic to them now i'm not going to take credit for it i actually think i did copy it from someone but i don't remember now the tesla of like a bed the tesla is it's it's it crushes it um what do you see the article what was it called dude why didn't you start a d2c brand i feel like everything every bone in your body was made to build a brand like this i'll tell you why so um all birds filed to go public today i was reading through their s1 here's why i didn't start a d2c i think it's fun i think a d2c brand is like the hardest thing that one of the hardest things that you could do in business it is so challenging i looked at their the auburn's s1 here's why commerce kind of sucks the more revenue you you make the less money you have it's such a pain in the ass am i wrong about this uh yeah you're wrong about this let me show you something real quick that's crazy dude you i i think these d2c companies are are such a pain in the ass to run can you see this number aj hang on come on camera focus on that there it is that's that's the last 30 days so your your business has made sales in the last 30 days that's right it's not that hard to build these businesses it's okay it's a lot of schlep work there is a lot of shelf work right like i spent hours yesterday trying to find a forklift for the warehouse but the electrical and the building doesn't support the battery that we need and i'm like uh where do i get this forklift from i'm calling forklift providers turns out by the way great business to be in just selling used heavy machinery like forklifts um and there's a lot of room for like building aggregator there but uh but yeah dude if you have the marketing chops you have it's like it's like where do you plug in that if you're a plus at that skill and i think you are like your writing skills and your advertorial skills your marketing skills are so strong if you had plugged that in on a d2c brand uh and by the way this is we are one year and one month into this business that's crazy and that's in a month doing basically so okay um how much how much cash you have in the business bank account uh a good amount yeah a lot why because are you buying a [ __ ] ton of stuff for november in december uh yeah we have we have a bunch of inventory yeah we do spend a lot on inventory but there's uh yes it took cash uh so i put in when i started the business uh i put in a good amount of money because i put in so do you have wow you don't wait and you don't have to say these numbers but do you ha do you or you can but do you have more money in the business bank account than you started no uh we so we have a line of credit basically that we we use so since then we basically pulled that out use the line of credit um but what i'm i guess the point yes it but yes we you do have to wait some time to be able to pull profits out because while you're scaling great this month is profitable you're going to reinvest that into either marketing or inventory for the next month so yes you are cash poor for a while but you do turn the corner like this month is it turn the corner type of month where oh good like there's actually leftovers after you reinvest everything in growth and all that and so i think that if you have a good product if you have a really truly great product do you think that you have a great product we do we have a great product like a truly great product and so uh and so when i think when you have that you're not just like is you're not just an arbitrage you're not just a drop shipper just taking some [ __ ] from uh you know random [ __ ] off of aliexpress and and sending it to customers and trying to capture your margin like we spend a lot of time on product development things like that uh to get it right and we also use the product ourselves so so it's not like so so we have to live with any issues with the product so i would say you um you can turn the corner and also there's a bunch of different companies that have popped up that let you float money so like let's let's just take a normal d2c business here's how it can work you can uh let's say you rank facebook ads you put the facebook ads on a credit card cool your facebook ads should be returning more than one x um you know within seven days how much you have 30 days 30 um yeah it depends on your product and your your brand all that stuff but let's say you're returning 1.4 x or you might be returning 2.5 x whatever different brands do a different amount you know if you're doing 3x you're you're you're amazing you're laughing if you're doing one and a half x you know you're all right you're doing okay um so let's say you uh you do that you're paying back your ad spend in seven days but you don't pay your credit card for let's say 30 days so all of your marketing spend you should be paying it should be paying itself off you don't need an external investment to do that okay so now you have to deal with inventory well for inventory you have supply you have terms with your suppliers so you don't have to pay for it all up front as we get bigger we get better and better terms with our suppliers in addition to that there's all these companies that have popped up like clear bank or settle or whatever way flyer different companies that will basically say cool for one percent interest we will front your inventory financing for you we'll pay all your kind of accounts uh payable for for you and so one percent is one percent per month is not cheap but that basically replaces the need for external investment and so then by the time you have to pay your bill for your inventory you've already received it and sold it and so if you do those two things you can manage cash flow well you your ads pay themselves back before your credit card bill is due and your inventory pays itself off before your inventory bill is due and you just pay a small vig on insurance so there's a lot out there now to help you scale and i think a business uh these businesses i think sell for about 1x revenue um which is you know maybe four or five x times even uh and do you think that um what do you think's gonna happen with it do you think you'll sell it or is this something that you want to run for and own is this like a family business that you want to own forever yeah i like running it so and i definitely think we can grow it more so you know if we could do this in one year you know let's give it four more and let's see where we can take it i do think that there's like some amazing thing about these companies which is you probably if i had a guest have i i don't know how you quantify because you have so many projects but you probably have a skeleton crew right yeah like this doesn't require there's no office you know there's there's some employees the biggest thing we have now is we brought the where we you know we do our own warehouse but you could also not do that you could use a 3pl uh you know pay somebody else basically to to do your fulfillment for you and uh and then you don't have any crew there so so you don't have that headache um so so you could do this with a pretty small team of people there are people doing this with like like i think you know um we had we did an episode with the founder of native deodorant i think he was the only employee for like the first i don't remember what it was maybe five times yeah and then you know and then and then he hired a customer service person which is basically you know you can hire somebody for six dollars an hour overseas to answer your customer service emails and that's your first hire then you might hire another one of those people then you might hire somebody for operations to deal with like supply chain you know but so so it depends on kind of like how complicated your business is but yeah like you don't need this is i would say i think it's probably whatever you had with the hustle this is probably one-fourth the manpower you need for that it is cool i look i think there's a lot of i was down on it but i there are a lot of cons i think there's a lot of pros as well the cons it depends what month you catch somebody you catch them in a month where the facebook algorithm is not treating people well and they're crying you know the business doesn't work anymore it's like it went from great it was a money printer and now it's a money suck uh and there's nothing you could do about it facebook just change something or there's a pandemic and you can't you can't order anything yeah or shipping containers went from three thousand a container to twenty thousand dollars a container uh okay now you know how does that mess up your money and that everything's stuck at the port it has i mean all these things have happened right like all of you we've had theft we've had uh facebook ad changes we've had container costs go up we've had our stuff sitting on a boat at the port for three weeks and it's just floating there um you know we've had to go get line of credit we've had to do a lot of things in this amount of time but um so i would say that's what i said there's a lot of schlep work it's not clean and easy like doing a podcast and just having a bunch of people listen to it and make money like this is a lot easier a lot more fun but those can those can get bigger and i guess i don't even remember how i started this but basically i was just saying dude i can't believe you haven't built one of these um it's insane to me given your skill set so maybe maybe i will one day and we'll wrap up this in a second but let me ask you one more question because this is interesting to me because so you've done a social app that is like the most poppy cute thing ever and had had some had some mild success you've also have family that are mega successful in real estate we have interviewed all types of people you now have an ecom thing that's like appears to be a potentially a home run what would you if go back now to uh 10 years prior you're you know what you know now what do you think you would like to do hmm that's a hard question that's a really really hard question okay i'll i'll rank i'll give them it's like the oscars i'll give them some awards okay so um most likely to succeed goes to real estate congratulations come up and get your prize uh if i had just said cool i'd like to be worth you know a few million bucks you know in my 20s by the time i end my 20s i want to be worth a few million dollars maybe you know liquid maybe a couple million on paper i could have you know 10 to 20 million net worth uh i could have done that in real estate um with pretty much like no luck required right most likely to succeed is real estate because there's no luck required it's just hard work blocking and tackling doing the things uh so that's real estate but i wouldn't go do it myself like if i could go back now i wouldn't switch paths to that but i would have told myself hey look here's here's one option um and uh the award for absolute worst idea goes to trying to create the next social media app you know this required maximum difficulty uh light highest luck factor trying to catch lightning in a bottle and honestly the prize okay it would have been [ __ ] sweet if we had invented twitter or youtube yeah i gotta admit that would be amazing but i can be just as happy not having done it and yeah i can name all five guys who've done that so like you know uh that's that's not the path okay then if i say all right um you know sort of like medium return this is the mediocre playbook you know the sort of mild success playbook a pretty good chance of a pretty good outcome but kind of a lot of work and uh you know would i do that e-commerce is the answer for that one which is like e-commerce is one that i think you can definitely make work if you just keep trying um it's kind of a pain in the ass and it's never going to be the most fun or the most successful right however however ecom of of maybe all three of those i think is the most exciting the most exciting no way most of you have been running ads and seeing cash like that is so exciting okay that that loop is fun uh that i give you that the feedback loop is instantaneous and it's [ __ ] it's monetary it's not real reviews real estate's not that very like real estate can be kind of fun but i wouldn't i wouldn't call it it's not like an adrenaline like a dopamine rush right so okay so if i was going to go back and convince myself of anything it would have just been to say this uh look you could you could win in all these different ways every flavor works the choose the one with the most fun journey corny yeah i know this is cliche but choose the one that's going to be fun before the success comes basically in that case you win win you have fun while you're doing it because you have fun you keep doing it because you keep doing it you get good at it because you get good at it you eventually win and uh look all these things that as long as they leverage you know either either like physical real estate or the internet the scale is big enough you you'll have enough money you don't need to worry about money ever again and so i would have advised myself to say look there's some pretty interesting [ __ ] going on in these like new waves like genomics you know biotechnology uh cryptocurrency just go dive in become there's no experts because the things like a year old go become an expert meet all the cool people doing it take a bunch of invest in [ __ ] and build build in that space um you know create a podcast talking about that stuff like yeah just do all the things in that space you know information so you know podcasting so media you know information like courses and you know uh crypto you know investing so i mean you have a pretty a collection so i i i think the of all of them i've had the most fun doing the podcast the media thing and really it's more of just like do the thing that doesn't feel like work to you do the thing that feels like play to you right so like imagine you already had the money but you still were going to work on some projects what would you work on that my answer was i would want to basically like i would want to make content based on stuff i'm learning stuff i think is cool i think it'd be really fun to have an audience i find it like energizing i don't feel i don't feel like it's work when i have to do the podcast and prepare for the podcast and um and yeah it keeps me kind of like on my toes because i got to come up with new stuff to talk about so i got to keep learning so that's like that was the most fun path for me so i would have done that or i would have similarly done this in a domain like this is a general podcast i would have done the same thing but like in crypto like there's these guys that do this podcast called bankless have you seen them no is it awesome it's like yeah it's cool i mean i don't listen regularly but like okay defy is this new thing this is new wave crypto is this new wave there's so much to learn about so much to talk about so these guys they went in they created a podcast called bankless and bankless is basically great great name great name and they just talk every week they're just like oh here's the new [ __ ] going on in the world of d5 here's the new thing to talk about here's the ups the downs the prices because of that they're building a good community around them they can make money off sponsorships they're seeing a bunch of stuff if they're smart they're investing a bunch and getting equity in all those businesses and eventually they should launch their own branded business in there maybe it's an exchange or an etf or something else with that following and so that's kind of the playbook i would do given my strengths and what i've seen but like yeah tried all i've tried a bunch of these different things and that's that's what i think this is good i think this is um i think maybe we should end here i think this is a a a sick episode i was thoroughly and uh like i was enjoying hearing hearing the stories hopefully people will enjoy it what do you think we gotta title this one this is the play haters ball we will try next time to hate on less stuff and we will talk about stuff we like more but that's all right this is this is the episode that we hated on everything well i'll pat ourselves on the back here we don't default to hate most of the time like right like we hate on everything except for ourselves we compliment it we typically are not haters i i think i default to optimism so do you on most everything we want it all to work but uh yeah i i feel you and i complete i agree with just about everything you said all right dope uh okay i'm gonna go eat a steak and a salad and enjoy myself all right that's the pod [Music] let's travel never looking back

would you rather own a small piece of something huge or a big piece or everything of something much smaller i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to sam where are you dude this looks awesome you're at like a pool or backyard you're in the hamptons what's going on i spent the weekend at my in-laws house in the hamptons and i felt pretty sick yesterday so i just stayed the night here i didn't feel well but i'm feeling fine now but i'm in i'm in the hamptons it looks good right i mean it looks amazing yeah it looks like what i've never been to the hamptons not even close never got an invite i don't even know anyone that lives in the hamptons let me let me tell you away okay my opinion of the hamptons incredibly overrated you want to know another thing that's incredibly overrated central park central park so overrated central park and the hamptons both overrated the hamptons not it's not that pretty it's not that pretty at all so very so what's the appeal what is good about it if you're in new york it's only an hour hour and a half away without traffic so you can go to the beach there so it's a little bit like sonoma or napa like i think those places are nice they're not the best they're kind of boring as far as napa is napa and sonoma are prettier than the hamptons without a doubt in my opinion oh okay interesting and uh do you like do you feel different you walk around every car is like a bentley or better you have to have a range rover to fit in it's crazy man i it's not my style at all it's very it's not it's not even remotely my style um did you see the jake fall paul and uh tyrone tyron woodley fight last night did i tell my wife i can't help with the kids bedtime routine because i'm watching the jake paul fight yeah i did that and i watched that fight and i thoroughly enjoyed myself it was an amazing fight i thought it was um a good fight i thought jake paul i had higher expectations the drama was there like the most time where the technical boxing was great i'm saying the drama was there i didn't know what was gonna happen beforehand and then every round it still felt like anything could happen which is what you want the drama was so high my my my anxiety level was equal to the best ufc fight like uh like the best grudge ufc fight my like anxiety level was equal to it i thought it was amazing we had jake paul in the podcast he uh was way different on the podcast than he was in uh like for the for this whole uh boxing thing but anyway it was i was gonna tweet it out i was like hey uh congrats to to guest of episode 170 on your victory tonight yeah it was it was a fun fight i'm happy i got to watch it it was more it was more intense than any you have as intense as any ufc fight i've ever seen it was pretty badass they've done an amazing job well let's talk about it a little bit uh so they for for those who don't know or kind of just roll your eyes at uh you're watching jake paul and jake paul fight this guy is this rigged what's the point of this isn't he a youtuber like i got a lot of respect for what they did i'm pretty impressed by this i think that this move they did to go from youtuber viner to youtuber and then youtuber to basically one of the best business models you can do as a uh as a single person is basically sell pay-per-views and uh why is that right so like this fight i wouldn't be surprised if they sold a million pay-per-views and so you sell a million pay-per-views at you know roughly 60 bucks a pay-per-view you know per um you know that's 60 million dollars and then they partner up with showtime to do that to that whole thing and so you know they can make 10 million bucks in one hour doing this right in basically a single event and you that's totally different and and it grows their brand like this whole thing makes them more famous because espn is talking about it and twitter is talking about it everybody's talking about it and uh they're doing kind of like a hobby that they like which is boxing right they train hard so it's not easy but man is it lucrative so like pretty impressive jump from one platform to the next and as a business person i think they're geniuses i think they are whether it's intentional unintentional they are geniuses uh the way that they approach this the way that they promote these things the way they leverage the brand it's genius also getting in a ring in front of a million people getting in a ring in front of 50 people it's incredibly frightening now to do it with someone who's like even though woodley's yeah he's at the end of his career he's 40. he [ __ ] kills people like he crushes people like he could he you definitely could die i mean it's not likely but you could and that's incredibly bold and very likely you could get humiliated knocked out brutally by this guy you know in front of everybody yeah 100 and so i do think it's incredibly courageous even though whether i agree or don't agree with like a lot of the [ __ ] they do it's wild i can't believe they've pulled this off it's wild it's incredibly wild the crowd on tv i've been to like three or four or five i forget how many ufc fights and i've been to some of the big ones at madison square garden the crowd on the tv like on the x in cleveland last night yeah it felt the same as when i saw ufc fight like the same energy it was pretty wild they built this they yeah they did it they pulled it off um i also went to uh a live mma fight a local one here in san francisco where uh in the uh the dragon den dragon house yeah amazing you went to one i mean do we go together this weekend i went to one i've been to a bunch there it's badass right it's way scarier than ufc it was way more intense so we get caged side seats because they're only 50 bucks right so like the yeah you know it's not a huge stadium it's keys our stadium it's a very small place but uh we went there we get cage site seats for 50 bucks since covid you know started and they said like oh everybody's got to be vaccinated they didn't check anything at the door so that was not so great but i walk in and the crowd is just lit i don't know what they're all they're all like super drunk yeah so so i think there's like four or five factors going in so first of all it's their friends fighting usually so like there's a whole in every fight there's at least like 20 people that are there because they're friends with this person because these are amateur fights these are people who by day you know they deliver for doordash or they like work in a you know consulting company or whatever and then this is like a nighttime fight club thing for them where they just like decided screw it i'm gonna try this um because i get there early i get there for the amateur fights before i find those way more interesting than the pro fights and um so first of all there's 20 people that for that that's their friend that's their brother that's their kid i'm seeing moms just yelling like kill him because it's like their son in the in the ring or whatever second thing is um it's like people are drunk yeah so people are drinking there's only like there's a drop in there if one consecutive it's only beer well they only sell they only sell beer and costco pizza right yeah exactly it's like beer and things that make you want beer and then third thing is um i think so i think the third one would be i'm so used to like you're in the hamptons right now dude i i just hang out online on tech twitter and crypto twitter and like the group of people i normally hang out with are so nerdy and like they're just concerned about different things the priorities are different i went to this thing and everybody's like super dressed up like not like fancy but they were dressed up like i might i might meet someone here like this is like a club to them right um i just feel like everybody here it was like more real people than the like kind of bubble that i usually live in and so it was just different it was like shocking there was three fights that broke out in the crowd just after after if i would be done i probably would break out in the crowd and i'm sitting there with my sister and my brother-in-law and we're just hoping it doesn't happen near us and the last thing was covet like covet i think has riled people up like when i came in i was telling my brother-in-law i was like dude this crowd is way better than the last time we came to dragon house rico he goes dude people are ready to live he's like people were just ready to get out and you could see it dude people were just like i don't know i don't know how the kids use the word lit but people were lit at this event this was the whole event was lit it was i love going to those i've probably been to three of them were the mongols there i guess they weren't there because uh they can't travel no i've been there and there's they have there's like a large like contingency and mongolians and and they have their family there was one mongolian fighter and he yeah his crowd was like his crew was pretty crazy and then he fought this irish dude and i swear to god it was like conor mcgregor came out as soon as the guy comes out it's like the whole crowd is chanting olay i'm like where did this huge irish contingent come from he's got a tattoo silhouette of ireland on the side of his body he gets in the ring and they had a crazy fight and so it was it was a lot of fun first of all so if you have like a i don't know if people i don't know if it's only people who like ufc but if you like ufc which is like maybe one percent of our audience go to a local show i bet it's more go to a local show i i didn't think it would be this good it's like amazing it was like truly amazing but it also made me feel like what is it about people who why would anybody sign up to do this and then i know you are the type who you signed up to get punched in the face quite a bit what's the appeal and would you ever do this well i signed up for a smoker so what a smoker is is it's uh amateurs so there's no judges and typically you can kind of have like in a like you can like say ahead of time like hey i'm new you're new like you're you don't actually at the fight that you went into they're going in with bad intentions you know they want to hurt you with the thing that i signed up for sometimes like you'd be like hey let's let's get after it and you'll try to knock people out and you might get knocked out but it's like not nearly as angry and you could like say hey we're going too hard let's take it easy so it's like a sparring session it's above a sparring session but it's not quite a real fight or at least it doesn't have to be and i signed up for it because it makes me feel alive it makes me feel uh like i feel soft when i just sit in front of the computer all day it makes me feel good to survive getting beat up because i know that i'm not going to be stressed out about anything else that i'm going to do throughout the day because like when i stress out about like this podcast or if i get mad that our freaking internet wasn't working really well i'm like dawg i just got my ass kicked like like this like everything else is fine exactly i went skydiving once and we did it in the morning it was like eight in the morning and so the rest of the day like you know from 8 30 onward because i'd have to only last like five minutes like you're just you fall for 60 seconds and then you kind of float down gently for five minutes and then it's over but the rest of that day i was like i couldn't be bothered by anything i was like dude i jumped out of a plane this morning you think i'm gonna worry about this presentation i have or this person who didn't call me back or this person who cut me in line like bro i flew i was flying in the air this morning and so it was like if i could bottle that feeling up and have it more often which it sounds like you get by by sparring what not that's pretty good i also have been re-watching breaking bad so did you watch breaking bad like once yeah so i just i just started re-watching it and uh it's like enough years have gone by where i kind of forgot it and that's basically the premise of the show the show is basically this guy lived kind of his whole life you know by the book and was like always like kind of just like worried about you know he didn't want to offend anybody he didn't take much risk blah blah blah and then when he finds out that he's got you know a few months to live he starts doing this stuff initially to help his family like how do i how do i provide for my family if i pass away i don't want them to have nothing because i'm just a teacher i didn't save up too much money and then once he starts to do it it starts to feel good he starts to feel alive and so this has become kind of like a theme i'm thinking about and like if we want to tie this to business i'll force it here which is there's probably a whole set of products or experiences that just make somebody feel alive and they're kind of counterintuitive like why would you choose to get punched in the face why would you choose to take this risk and almost get caught by the cops and then how do you bottle that up and package that in a product or service so that because i think a lot of people do want this feeling and once they get it i think it's very addictive but i would say that that's what you do with a lot of your investments right like when i think about what you're doing with an nft or what you're doing with crypto to me it's a high adrenaline high risk uh type of thing right uh kind of i think you'd think i take more risk than i actually do but uh but yeah i could see that that's definitely a piece of it there's a bit of the roller coaster that you get to go on and the roller coasters for a thrill seeker but i just think in general like you know we were in la i went to disneyland why are there even roller coasters right well because people in 30 seconds you can get that feeling like you might die and then you live and that little package that thrills it taps into this real secret part of people and i just feel like there's probably more experiences that could be built that are like that i think if you're building in vr for example instead of trying to build a vr like kind of like fantasy land i would build things in vr that make people feel a little bit afraid a little bit scared a little bit alive i think a lot of video games try this right like it's why a lot of video games are out shooting people and stuff like that because it's it's cool and it's an escape and something you can't do in real life so you get to live vicariously through this but i just think there's a lot more that could be done so instead of talking about fear can i tell you something that i read recently that's it's about happiness can i tell you something that totally kind of like i read something recently and the data seems pretty clear and it totally like goes against what we've been told previously can i tell you about that so layout layout what we've been told and then what you saw so the you know there's these like things that you see headlines so one of these headlines is like the average american doesn't have 500 in savings or something like that that's that's that's mostly [ __ ] by the way that's a [ __ ] headline but the other one was that after you make 75 000 your perceived happiness level doesn't really go up significantly and i read about that a while ago we read about i mean when did that come out you think like in 2012 or something 2013. yeah i feel like i've heard this kind of my whole professional life so maybe at least 12 15 years something like that i've always thought that that was [ __ ] i've always thought that was [ __ ] um i didn't pass the sniff test for you not even a little bit not even a little bit and so i came across this study and so what these guys did was they got 40 000 people to install this app and this app at random times would ask you like they would ask you a bunch of questions but it would be on a scale of like one to five or one to ten i see you're highlighting the app you can click it and you can see it it's called track your happiness yeah and it's pretty cool it's just a simple app and what they did was they got 35 40 000 people they ranged they had all types of ranges and they asked people how they felt during different periods of the week of the day and they would track your income and what they found is is that while it is true that after you get past a certain point your happiness levels doesn't necessarily go up in proportion but what this study found is like up until like 500 600 700 000 a year it was definitely still going going up like yeah we can we can show this graph if you're watching on youtube we'll put this graph on the screen and it's basically two lines it's your life satisfaction and your uh experience well-being and uh they're both like from fifteen thousand dollars of household income up to five hundred thousand dollars they're tracking like up into the right just like a straight line so the more income you were getting the more sort of life satisfaction you were having um during at each step of those it didn't just plateau at 75 000 like the the old kind of like that quoted quoted study is and it may like the difference between 2 million and 3 million probably won't be significant but like according to this study like the difference between 10 million and 1 million is significant and does impact your happiness and that totally like kind of broke my frame even though i always thought it would be true i thought this study was actually really interesting and there's a few reason why a few reasons why basically the other one was nonsense was the first one was remembered feelings so the 75 000 study basically what they did was they asked people how they felt in the past and that's kind of [ __ ] because you always think that you remember uh things better than you actually did or like during during one period you'll think it's great and then you'll say how you remembered it and you'll think it or sorry you'll during the time you think it's horrible then you'll look back and be like oh that was actually awesome right this actually asked you right then and there how you felt the second thing was before it said were you happier then or were you happier now and that's kind of nonsense because there's no variance like the variance is too low and like you know sometimes like it could be well i'm a little bit better and that matters and so that's binary it's it's just yes or no there's no like there's no granularity yeah so i don't know i thought this was interesting i wanted to bring this up because that's one of the it's one of those studies that i always thought that people base like you read this headline and you believe this to be true and a lot of people probably make decisions based off of this and i think it's important to say no that's i think it's [ __ ] and and you shouldn't base your life on that data or that study right yeah yeah and i i like uh i love this topic by the way i think it's great it's sort of like myth-busting of these like common things you hear like another one is like the ten thousand hour rule that got really popular because malcolm gladwell wrote this book called outliers and he's like oh you know to be great at something you got to spend ten thousand hours and uh and so then a lot of people run with that and it's like well there's obviously a bunch of caveats but like the caveats get stripped away as the thing just gets kind of like turned into a fortune cookie tweet right it's like ten thousand hours that's the rule and um and sure there's instances where somebody spends ten thousand hours it gets really great at something but there's definitely instances where it doesn't take ten thousand hours to get graded something i've had many of them in my life and uh and so you wanna like i guess question a lot of these things that you're told and try to figure out what what's the truth and what's the truth for me what am i going to experience what do i choose to believe and so i'm with you on uh on looking into stuff like this i also think this app is cool this tracker happiness app i'm gonna actually use it at my previous company when i was running the idea lab i was my first time uh like as ceo of like a larger group we had like 20 something employees uh at that time and that was i was 25 years old it was the most people i had ever managed and i was like okay well how do i manage people i was like well there's a whole bunch of books on this but i created something pretty simple i asked one of the programmers i went to this guy quinn and he's like this young hacker guy and i was basically like hey quinn i would love to know i would love to just kind of like if i could go have a conversation with each person each day saying hey how are you feeling uh how's it going i think i could be a better manager but that would take way too much time and it would just also be like a full-on conversation with each person i said can you just set up a thing so that at the end of every like work day so at like 4 30 p.m or whatever it just pings everybody individually in slack and it just says hey sean uh how are you feeling today you know one to ten and uh what's your happiness right now and it would just i would basically do what this app does and they would put it in and then i had a dashboard as the manager is the ceo that would show me all these different people and what i found was two things the first is some people have a very narrow range of emotions that they feel so like there's like our cto is this uh british guy paul he's a he's very kind of like stoic he's sort of like you know like british sort of dry humor and so like he never got too too high up too high down like he was always like a you know like a seven or an eight he didn't he never hit a ten he never hit a five he always stayed in that range so i had to interpret his data differently because i was like for this guy his self-assessment of his own like kind of like happiness or well-being his his range is different so i can't just say oh eight you're good eight is actually great for him and a seven is actually quite bad for him whereas for other people who are like you know the hot mess folks it's like some days it's a one and some days it's a ten and i had to interpret them differently so that was the first observation the second was when i would go and uh i could i could ping them afterwards i could just say you know it could basically ping them once they submit their score it would say cool do you want to add a note on why and the reasons that affected people's happiness were so different than what i would have expected i thought people would be unhappy because you know they feel like underpaid or overworked or you know maybe their colleagues said something to them it was always like the smallest [ __ ] it's like like what it'd be like you know it'd be something like oh you know uh at lunch today uh you know i whatever you know this table was full so i kind of had to go sit over there or be like you know at uh you know we're working on this project i really wanted to get more done but i got a phone call i got distracted it's like they were like some people were like really some people got off on high output and so their happiness was like it's like oh yeah we had to do that team meeting and so i didn't get to go work on my pride i didn't get to write enough code today or it would be like something really really small it's like yeah i'm really dealing with this kind of like back pain so this chair is really uncomfortable it was always things that i wouldn't have otherwise seen and so it brought those to the surface and then i could decide is this something i could affect and like improve or do i just like at least i get a better understanding of them so that was like one of the better products that we built we probably should have productized it and made it an actual like work tool for other people to use yeah i used to use this thing called 15.5 you remember that company they're doing pretty well dude i think they're they're pretty successful i bet i would bet they are so they kind of like went quiet for a little while and typically that means it's failing horribly or it's actually quite large like it's usually like one of the other uh and so it was called 15 5 and basically they would send you fi the whole product it was very simple and it's probably thrived during covid but basically they send you an email every day and it takes is it 15 questions that are five minutes to answer or it's 15 minutes to answer five questions one of those and that's all it is is they just send you an email at the end of the day and they say what did you get done today how do you feel yep and that's all the product is and i would imagine that it's quite large yeah yeah i think it raised that like 130 million valuation recently or something so you know maybe that's a little out of date that's 2019. so i bet it's doing doing pretty well uh all right let's do a different topic what do you want to talk about let me tell you about a different uh a different company that i recently discovered so it's called e-s-r-i have you ever heard of that no sounds like a government agency kinda okay so esri so basically there's this entire uh sector this entire industry that needs important map information if you scroll all the way down to where it says felt you'll see where i am yeah but basically the idea here is um there's this company called esri it was started in the 1960s it's 100 owned by this one guy and his brother so 100 owned by the same family no debt they've never taken any outside funding you can't find anything about it it does over a billion dollars a year in subscription revenue and basically what it does and subscription revenue nice yes um it's software it's assault i guess i guess you could call it information but probably at this point software because it started in the 60s so at the time it was basically information but what it what it does is very simple so 20 000 plus cities use it so most cities most like reasonably sized cities in america use it most states use it most fortune 500 companies use it and what it does is they have loads of um of information on maps and so if you're a government and you want to build new gas new new pipes or something like that in your city you're going to take their data and you can also give them more data and that's going to give you an interactive map that you can use to figure out where the other pipes are and you're going to be able to build this this this pretty complex system that you can continually use year over year that's going to show where your pipes are it's called geographic information system you never heard you never heard of that gis yeah i've heard that yeah i thought for sure you would have heard of that so um it's almost like uh google maps on steroids so in the same way that apple or sorry the same way it's like b2b google maps yes in the same way uber uses one of the apple or either uh google maps this is what like the city of like the hamptons would use when they're building new roads and when they're building new electricities now there's a few reasons why this is interesting one it's one of the most complex and one of the most interesting family-owned businesses i've ever seen total monopoly so in the way that they got their monopoly is they go into colleges and so they work with engineering students they've worked really hard on making sure all the colleges they give their software to for free so the engineering students start using it at a very young age and they're used to it then when they graduate they go oh yeah let's just use esri so they know exactly what they're doing and it has a total moat also because selling to a government is impossibly hard it's incredibly difficult why because when you're a government you want to make sure that the vendor that you're using takes 100 responsibility if something f's up and so when you're like signing up if you're a government employee if you're working on a fortune 4 500 employee you want cover your ass insurance you know you want a company that's like well known and like not new and like they're going to take responsibility if something bad happens that's esri crazy fascinating company but i'm curious about which businesses are gonna because whenever you see something old you know from the 1960s as a software company you think well like surely they're like you know you can't crush it forever also the founder of this company esri he's probably worth 10 billion dollars at this point i think he's like 85 years old so he's gonna die he's gonna they're gonna lose its way like this is just inevitably how it works this guy's name by the way jack dangermond is that his name right this dangermond i mean come on that's uh how old is this i can see why people don't want to compete with this guy he's pretty old i don't know he doesn't look like he's 80 it looks like he's you know well he's rich 60 70 something like that uh yeah personal fortune 4 billion dollars himself yeah and he started with his brother when he was like 27. crazy fascinated business crazy fascinating business and never taken a cent outside of a 5 000 initial loan from dangermon's mother crazy right crazy fascinating company and and he seems for i mean you know what i read about he seems like a good guy him and his wife he's so he's an environmentalist so he started this because he cared about like uh wildfires and things like that he was building software to help create maps that um somehow reduce wildfire which i'm gonna explain in a second but basically there's a new company there's a bunch of new companies coming out the first one is called felt so go to felt.com it totally does not went to this it looked it look it looked well this is like an early access site but my i saw and i said oh this is kind of interesting so i started looking into it i read your notes on it this felt thing seems pretty cool are you investing in this it seems like awesome nope i i we just i've i've never talked to this person so it started by a guy named sam hashimi he's his first company was called remix it was a city transportation planning startup that he sold for a hundred million dollars and he was doing that he learned all about the uh inadequacies of like basically using maps and creating maps for your service and he said well i'm gonna credit create a better map business uh something that uh um people can uh add stuff to and it's almost like uh where where esri is like google maps this is like waze so people can contribute to it if you use it uh kind of fascinating and um it seems very very interesting and i always like these old-school companies i mean i like this company this guy jack started i think it's badass i love seeing the new guys that are going to try and take this and kick their ass i think it's very fascinating yeah this is cool i like this a lot there was a company called um what's the name they're based in they spun out of like this lab hold on i think you actually might have their name here and while you're looking for that so felt they describe it as the world's first collaborative mapping tool and it serves a wide range of use cases so i imagine they haven't said this but i imagine actually anyone can use it a user can use it so if you're going hiking with your friends if you're planning a trip you're allowed to use this i imagine what they're doing is their grand scheme though their niche their wedge is to help wildfires uh uh go down and so the way that you could do that is you can actually use data and you can figure out where wildfires are where they're gonna happen and then cities will pay money to use your mapping data in order to reduce wildfires and i imagine what they're going to do is they're going to create this really cool because if you go to felt.com it looks very um user-focused whereas it it's they're going to make all their money from b to b so it doesn't look the same it doesn't look like a b2b product i imagine what they're going to do is like just like waze they're going to let the consumers use it and map out really interesting [ __ ] and then they're going to go and sell the data and mapping tools to b2b to businesses and that's how they're going to win crazy fascinating go ahead yeah i think it's cool so the company i think is called discard his and uh what this i meant the founder of this at a dinner and he was telling me about it and i was like wow this is kind of amazing and this became one of my one of my misses i was like oh i really should invest in this and at the time i wasn't really investing super actively and i missed the boat i think this has become like a very big company but at the time i was like pretty convinced that this is going to be a winner and why is that so they spun out of los alamos alamos national labs or whatever which is like in new mexico or albuquerque or something like that it's like this like it's kind of like you know nasa or something like that so this is like highly kind of scientific community they spin out they create this commercial company um that's called discard this labs and what they do is they do satellite imagery so they would basically take i don't know if it was their own satellites or other people's satellites but they would take the imagery of like cool there's this image from a satellite of a field and then they could run all kinds of machine learning and like kind of computer vision and different like tech more modern technologies on top of that and they could give a hedge fund an idea of how much corn yield there is this year or they could give you know so it's like if you ever watch billions they kind of do something sometimes where it's like oh look how many trucks are leaving this factory so before the earnings call i can figure out you know how much volume they're doing because i can see the rate of change from before to after things like that so so they have a whole bunch of different products but basically at the time it was like they were like trying to figure out how to use it i think he told me the story and this is many years ago so i may be getting this wrong but i think what he told me was at the time they didn't have that many customers but their business model was basically just betting on like futures of corn crop yields or something like that because they're like they're putting their own they were their own balance sheet they were just betting basically and they were showing that like look we can actually generate returns using this strategy because that's how valuable our data is and i think since then i think that was early on when they were like just making the technology and playing with it but um either was them or they've been a partner doing that and now i think they have a lot more customers who are looking for this whether it's like you know a agriculture company that has some need because they need to predict you know the way that the world is changing the way that the the the way that um anything any data that you can get from satellite imagery is basically what they do so i really like that business model as well some people are doing that in terms of getting satellites into space and other people are doing it taking the satellite imagery and making more sense of it making more getting more actionable like data and insights from that did you say the name of the company in front of the founder the name of what company oh no no he told me am i saying it wrong is it french have you heard of the philosopher descartes yeah what's the french philosopher's name renee descar maybe maybe that's what it is what did you call it descartes it's descartes yeah it's the car it's like it's like the i don't i forget uh renee descartes is he the guy who said i think therefore i am uh anyway it's that's well i think therefore uh i know i know that i got that pretty bad pretty badly wrong i i met this guy years ago so i don't even fully remember the idea i just remember thinking oh that's interesting all my friends are making like apps to like order pizza and like to-do lists and stuff like that and this guy's basically taking satellite imagery and looking at it and it my two takeaways were i should probably invest in this guy and the second thing was why am i not doing something more interesting with my life because that sounds way more cool and interesting and like probably valuable than competing in this competing around ideas that everybody has and that everybody could kind of do and so that was a you know a takeaway i had during that process um you want me to keep going or you want one no do one all right let me tell you a quick story about a guy named wayne hazinga i love wayne hezinga i read his book i believe it's called uh building blockbuster so there's this guy named wayne huzzingo where all right now i'm gonna sound uncultured is he from i always get it confused holland in the netherlands and dutch are they all the same thing dutch is a way to describe people i think from the netherlands i think holland might be a part of the netherlands i'm not sure dude i don't know i'm sounding on culture i'm sorry but what what does it say what does wayne huzinga say so he's of dutch descent dutch descent came to united states from the netherlands all right good all right so he's born in 1937 all right so listen to the story of this guy born in 1937 parents divorced at a young age went to the army and when he was in his 20s he started this company called waste management basically he had one moving truck or one truck and he started a waste management business where he would just go from door to door throwing away your trash and eventually like after only a short amount of time like two years he starts realizing that these uh this this business is incredibly um there's a there's loads of small players who all just own little bits and pieces and he goes well [ __ ] i'm just gonna buy all of them and so he starts buying a [ __ ] ton of them something like two or three a week um and is a business eventually because has become waste management today it's got a 64 billion dollar market cap it's uh the biggest waste removal company in the country and it's incredibly big and he left that in 1984 so he built this huge business and you think all right so uh that's great go and chill next when he was still in his 50s i believe he starts a company called blockbuster and so this is in 1987. he uh bought he found one blockbuster it was one blockbuster store he bought it uh with a little bit of money and he took it public like two years later so this guy's like a financial arbitrage machine so he's like is really good at raising money and deploying capital and so he raises this money and so blockbuster after like two years it has seven million dollars in revenue 19 stores and then in just a handful of years he gives it to 4 billion in revenue in 3 000 stores in 11 countries and eventually he sells it to vicom in 1994 this is about uh eight years after starting the company for eight and a half billion dollars and so it's pretty crazy and if you would have invested 25 000 and so he would let some friends invest and if you would have invested 25 000 in into a blockbuster when it went public in in 1987 it would have been worth about a million dollars when they sold so he's pretty amazing i mean he's he's got a good track record so he also started something else right he'll started yeah yeah so the guy all right so he's in waste management he's in blockbuster at this point he's in the 60s you think all right now you're just gonna chill absolutely not he starts autonation which is at this point it's the largest seller of used cars in america so he went from waste management to blockbuster to cars and then throughout this whole period he's also doing the same with resort so have you ever heard of uh extended stay america i believe now it's owned by marriott you never heard of extended save america so basically they've got they've got something like five six seven hundred uh motels that are nice enough that you could stay for like a handful or like a month or like two four weeks at a time he started that he also started a bunch of different golf clubs and then in the 90s he eventually buys the miami dolphins and i think he bought another florida uh what's the florida football team well so that's the dolphins and then he buy the the florida marlins also the baseball team the marlins uh pretty amazing is this and and and so i always was amazed at this guy and um the reason i was amazed at him is he had an incredibly positive attitude when he was doing this whole thing and so here's a few things here's a few quotes that i have from his biography that he talked about were his philosophy the first we made small acquisitions in different states around the united states it was just easier faster and cheaper to go in and buy a guy who was already established in a market even if it was very small then i'd hire a bunch of sales people to go out and do the internal growth the plan was always to have internal growth but in order to get internal growth growing quickly would sometimes either go out at a certain market and just buy uh buy a guy who had three or four trucks and say okay let's do this on our own and that's what he did over and over and over and over again and he did it in all those businesses except for blockbuster but even then he did it with blockbuster because he started the brand but and they grew on their own but eventually they started buying like loads of different mom-and-pop mom-and-pop movie stores and this was his whole strategy there's another guy who did this his name is bradley jacobs he's uh is worth like five or ten billion dollars he did this over and over and over again and i think that there's still a ton of room to do this so what what other industries could you do this in i've been thinking about this a lot and i'm not entirely educated on the topic but i think i think you could do it for all types of moving businesses because moving businesses there's not actually one leader that you trust who's like the best right it's like a lot of mom and pop stores um what other industries could you do this like consolidation stuff in i mean these roll-ups happen kind of in every industry i feel like people have done it with dentists right now dentist is like the hottest thing going there's also like pet you know uh vets you know veterinary hospitals or veterinary clinics there's pet cemeteries that somebody has told us about that that's like a pet cremation basically is like another one that you could do again fragmented market there's there's a lot of these there's rural wireless internet service providers there's there's a huge number of these where in a local market there's somebody who has maybe not a local monopoly but a large local footprint and uh and going in you can't it's very it would be it would be too expensive to go in and try to rebuild that it would take too long and be too hard to do that in a small place so you buy it at a fair price but you buy a whole lot of these and you make the the sort of the sum greater than than than than the parts and so i think this roll-up strategy is one of the more like i would say intriguing ways to build a monstrous empire like otherwise you kind of got to build a you know build a facebook build a youtube it it's very hard to build a multi-billion dollar individual company from scratch i think it is far easier to execute one of these roll-ups and create you know 100 million dollars create even a billion dollars of value in you know five to ten years it doesn't interest me personally but if i wanted to become a billionaire i think that this would be one of the lower risk ways to get it done um one redux did this with local newspapers also so rupert murdoch this is kind of what he did local newspapers and then local radio stations local television stations whatever he basically bought local media companies and then aggregated them and rolled them all up and created like giant basically news corp which is his his like mothership brand um so yeah by the way this guy wayne hazinga if you're watching on youtube put this guy's face on here from his wikipedia looks like an evil steve ballmer so that that's what this guy looks like bradley jacobs the other guy you mentioned who's done this with xpeo logistics and a couple other companies literally looks like couldn't be a sweeter you know someone sweet sweetheart dad who uh you know coaches the local soccer team uh i i love looking at these because i think to do this you got to be pretty i don't want to say ruthless but extremely aggressive ambitious a great deal maker and um and and you're moving like at a freight train's pace and so i love to meet these people now you can't meet them sometimes i love to just even look at their photos and just just read their bios who's this person where did they come from because it takes a very specific attitude to be able to go do this with self storage or local you know landscapers pool construction companies rolling them all up i've read a lot about uh both of those guys and i've seen them talk on youtube and my opinion of them is that they seem highly ethical they seem incredibly high energy super high energy and they seem very entrepreneurial even though they both look like wall street suits that don't like create these guys definitely are creators even though they buy stuff and you think well that's not like you're not inventing anything and maybe they're not inventing anything from scratch but they're definitely creators um and i because i remember i saw that guy bradley jacobs and i saw what he looked like and i'm like dude this [ __ ] suit like he's just like he's just some arbitrage square and he's not he totally uh he's a he's a creator and it's really interesting he's maybe not like mark zuckerberg where he's like coding [ __ ] but he's a different type of creator and i really like these types of folks doesn't this seem a little low this guy's net worth was 2.8 billion when he died i feel like how is this guy's net worth so low compared to doing autonation waste management system doing uh doing a blockbuster like how is that how does that add up i think that the number that we have there could be wrong but i think it's wrong what i read about in his biography was that with uh with waste management because they raised so much money and because they bought so many companies they simply didn't own that much of it i mean they owned a smaller piece of a massive pie and they were okay doing that and so when he started waste management and when he left uh he was the largest individual shareholder i believe but he probably owned like single digit percentage right yeah even just owning the dolphins i feel like the dolphins themselves are going to be you know 500 million to a billion dollar franchise so that seems a little a little low but yeah this guy's definitely the billy of the week uh extremely impressive career uh you know shout out to uh to this guy he looks like he passed away yeah a couple of years ago at age 80. um so you know respect okay what else we want to talk about i have a i have another kind of fast growing company i think it's worth talking about this thing called picasso have you seen this no i'm gonna google it is that how it's spelled picasso yeah p-a-c-a-s-o so two execs at zillow spun out and created this thing i think a year ago and it's already worth one or two billion dollars kind of in startup valuation world so i think they created all that value in basically a year and a year and a half and um and what does it do it's basically a [ __ ] time share so what they do is they buy homes they convert them to a llc and then they sell fractions of that home um to investors so they bought like you know let's say a house in napa valley they go buy a million dollar house they convert it into uh slices of one-eighth so you can own an eighth of this house for whatever 125 thousand dollars you can buy a piece of this home so you're a fractional homeowner and it's meant to be for second homes so you don't do this for your home you do this for your like second your vacation home and uh when you buy that one-eighth of the house that gets you 44 nights of a stay in that home for the year and you can either use them yourself you can gift them to others i think you can rent them out or get let them rent it out for you and this company takes this insane rake so they take 12 of the purchase price uh up front just straight off the bat and then they charge you a monthly management fee because they have the app that you and the other owners use to coordinate who's booking what what's the what's the rental share what are you how are you sharing expenses all that good stuff and if you know if the house goes down you you know you're on the hook for it they took their money up front so i thought this was kind of a incredible riff on a time share that uh i'm surprised frankly i'm surprised is growing this fast i didn't like it doesn't it's not something i look at and i say that's awesome i wish i had done that or thought of that idea i actually think this is kind of dumb what do you think so time shares i mean timeshare is a huge business i i like the idea of a time share is not bad i would i would be into owning one it's just that i don't want to go like through the sleaziness of of of you know what i mean like you want to sit through the webinar yeah i don't want to i don't want to go to the seminar so it's weird so i think it could be cool why is it worth so much so fast uh yeah i don't know i don't know i mean they've grown you know so it's picasso evaluation i saw it because there was a big protest going on so picasso raises 75 million goes from launch to unicorn in five months so i think part of it is what was the protest what's that you said there's a protest oh the protest was basically like in napa the home that they bought the neighborhood was like yo what is this uh like we don't want uh we don't want this we don't want this like timeshare rental we don't want all these different people coming through why why are they doing this and so um so they basically you know they were they're trying to like they were trying to say hey time shares are not allowed and what this company says is it's not a time share in a time sure you own a block of time in this you actually are a part owner of the home so it's different than a time share and then people were like dude you can't just call it cooperative ownership make up a new term and like it's a time share and so they're kind of going back and forth uh about that so the guy who started his name is spencel spencer raskoff is that how to say his name so he started and austin allison so she's actually the ceo they were both execs at solo so yeah so one of the co-founders name is spencer have you seen what this guy's done before no the name sounds familiar wasn't he one of the original like founders of zillow like yeah so check this out in 99 at the age of 24 he founded hotwire.com a leading travel internet company i mean obviously that's hotels right they sold it for 700 million dollars then he started zillow and he took it public he was a ceo through its ipo and bought loads of different companies uh he's resigned in 2020 so i guess he's out entirely uh then he started la which is a media company for a california startup so i guess that's kind of like a passion project and then now he's started picasso dude this guy's prolific and he's on the board of pallets here this guy this is why it's worth a billion dollars because it's like oh the ex-ceo of zillow is doing this new real estate thing cool we're we're in and we're sort of price insensitive on the valuation so i think it has more to do with the team than it does probably the traction in terms of that valuation yeah this guy's a badass i mean he's he's a hardcore badass would you would you want when i think of these types of things these companies that raise all this money we talked about zillow or we talked about this company picasso and the this guy looks like spencer that's his history also a podcaster he's got office hours podcast there you go oh we should have him on here spencer if you're listening come on do you think that do you like this strategy of raising would you rather own a small piece of something huge or a big piece or everything of something much smaller um i don't think about it that like that wouldn't be the deciding criteria if it was just between those two i would rather own the whole thing of a smaller of a smaller thing i find it to be more fulfilling and i think economically you end up doing better you have more options because when you own a small piece of a bigger thing if it happens to go a little sideways and doesn't have big unicorn exit doesn't go public doesn't get sold for three billion dollars it's very easy to kind of walk away with very little because you raised all this money so now you have the first 100 million dollars go back to investors and maybe you only sold it for for 70 or something like that whereas you owned like a huge amount of the hustle i think that path is better because you could sell for 12 million dollars and walk away with 10 million dollars you know like out of it and so and so i think it's a it gives you more options on how to build your wealth now that being said there's something fun about building something massive and going for something that's like truly game changing with three extra zeros on the back of it so like you know i respect both pat's if i was picking between those two i would own i would want to own more of a smaller thing because it gives me more options what do you think is easier oh for sure owning uh owning a small thing now easier in one sense which is it is easier i think on a day-to-day basis because you don't have to worry about fundraising shareholders other shareholder management and you can again you can exit for smaller amounts the harder part when you go rate like these guys just raise 75 million dollars they're not gonna feel like they're like roughing it every day whereas when it's your company and like i don't know you probably ran payroll for you know in the first year of the hustle and um and you probably had to worry like let's say you know advertisers pull out you know you probably were feeling that pinch because you were more or less bootstrapped you raised a little bit of money but like right i don't think you ever felt like you know you have this huge cash cushion that you can just fall back on well yeah i did not but my opinion i i normally would have agreed with you but we had mark laurie on the podcast and i talked oh i had a lot of his co-workers reach out to me after the podcast and basically mark laurie is our judge.com and what he's done is he uh he what was his vision he had his like he had this like phrase and i forget the phrase but it was like a vision capital people is that what it was yeah that's his uh his his fun name now so we could look it up uh but yeah it's it's vision capital people yeah you gotta write vcp vision and so he like that was his whole premise he's like everything i come up with the vision i get the capital we get the people that's what we do and when he says that i'm like that like what does that mean like that's a pretty like a vague fluffy thing but i started talking to people who worked with them and they're like he did that so well where he would raise all this money and he really like he did a lot of work but it wasn't like he he wasn't like doing like like like like you know the [ __ ] that you do when you're just starting out when you don't have any money you know uh uh like i i ran my own payroll i did all the banking i did you know i would go out and get all the vendors he was like he just like hired amazing people and they did most of the work and he just took care of the hard part of like selling people to uh join the company and selling people to give them money and i thought about that i'm like dude that does sound so easy yeah it's not crazy it's not that it's easy it's awesome i thought i'd put it nothing's easy anything anything valuable is typically you don't go to it because it's easy necessarily but um i i'm totally with you i what's what's more fun a small vision or a big vision a big vision right what's uh what feels better having a lot of ammo you know in terms of capital or being strapped for cash and always work not only having to worry about how to get customers and grow but can we pay the bills every single month yeah definitely on the other side if sean wants to [ __ ] off for a little while you can do that yeah you know you could you could you can bail for a little i optimize for freedom i optimize for freedom above above most things and so like if you ask me would i rather my my dad taught me this a long time ago he told me once because or my first startup was a sushi restaurant chain and i was like i was talking about you know why it's fun blah blah blah he goes he was trying to convince me to come work in the energy industry he's like he he worked at bp so he worked in the oil and gas industry and he's like he's like you know the minimum it's like you like to play poker right now when you go to a poker table you can either sit down with a hundred dollars or you can sit down with ten thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars you're still playing the same game you're still gonna sit there for six hours he's like it's why not play the bigger game and he's like in the energy industry the minimum stakes are in the millions nothing happens in the hundreds of thousands of dollars like you're saying a restaurant one location if it works can produce a hundred thousand dollars a year of net income or 125 thousand dollars in net income he's like why not just he's like a small project and a big project if you make it your your obsession which is what you're going to do when you go start a startup they both take the same amount of time they're both going to be all consuming all right so might as well do the one that has the bigger payoff so when he said it like that i was pretty sure like that's why my next start i stopped the food thing and i went and did a biotech company because he was right and biotech like our we made one deal it was worth five million dollars and i was like wow that would have taken us like five years and 25 locations to do in the restaurant industry and this was like one one great meeting one great presentation and like you know a year of technology development and boom five million dollars came through the door so i kind of got to taste both sides of it and so if i was gonna a big project and a small project both take the same time a big project's more fun but what i don't like is big companies because in big companies i feel like i lose my freedom of my time my energy of how i want to spend my day and so that's why i'm trying to find this mix of my perfect situation is i work for myself and pretty much by myself but i'm working on things that i feel are big and can pay off big and with the world of the internet that's now possible one of the most expensive mistakes ever made so trends now makes millions of dollars in subscription revenue it's a really good business had we made relatively minor changes like not that different like it wouldn't have cost us more money we maybe would have had a few more people and we right now we charge 300 a year there's a world where wouldn't have had to been that much different and it definitely would have been a similar amount of work we could have charged 30 000 a year right and i didn't understand that for a long time now i completely do where it's like well actually we were talking about that with hustle con when you were doing hustle con the hustle con ticket was what like 200 300 or something like that yeah on average and you had told me because i was like dude why are you doing this like events business dude events businesses can be big look at this one look at that one and i went and looked at him because you were right they did actually like make tens of millions of dollars but i was like dude the ticket price of this is three grand minimum and it looks like they have a 15 000 ticket package for like some people yours is like 10 times cheaper than that and you were like yeah we should we could but you didn't feel comfortable going that route or whatever i don't know what your reason was because you know yeah i knew i was being there's a few things one i was a [ __ ] so i was just i was being fearful and number two when i started my company i was like 24 what i don't and i never had a job before what i don't understand is how these young guys uh like people who are 21 22 23 like when the folks who started box.com which is an enterprise cloud company they were like 20 or 19 like in college still what i don't understand is when you're a 1920 or in my case i was 24 when i thought about the company i was like well like i don't have any money i would never buy something that was two thousand dollars now that i'm older and i have more experience i realize well two thousand dollars is not a lot of money and so what i don't understand is how these young guys who are in their early twenties who don't have a lot of experience how they even fathom that someone's willing to spend all this money on their product they're either just courageous or they have more faith i don't know what it is but i but kudos to them because when i was 24 and starting my thing even though i could have charged way more money and i tell everyone to do it now i did not have the courage or the knowledge to do it back then right and you see now because you're inside hubspot you see how much companies spend on just stuff like what amount of money it's like it's like going to a really wealthy person's house and then you see them tip you know you they tip some guy 100 bucks or they you know they buy this this fancy espresso machine for eight thousand dollars it's like oh these are normal expenses for them so then when you're on the outside you're like i should be charging a lot more but when you've never been inside one of these big companies it feels like a three thousand dollar ask dude i better be giving them like my left arm and it's like actually they feel more comfortable with larger price tags and that's like that in fact a 300 product is a little bit off-putting to them and sort of strange to them yeah it's it's like disrespectful it's like dude this this thing isn't good charge more so like knowing what i know now and i think uh mark andreessen like i forget like this it was a very like headliney quote but it was something like if marc andreessen had one advice for his his startups it would be simple charge more he goes two words charge more and uh because most startups do what i did you charge way little uh way less than you should because you i don't know you're trying to be cute i don't know what it is it's just it's cuter to be cheaper uh but it's like insecurity right because at the beginning you're like oh i just want some customers it's not that big of a deal then you kind of then that becomes the anchor point that you mentally anchor to and the market anchors you to and then you're afraid if you raise prices and everybody's gonna run out the door um you know what happens if i raise these prices i'm gonna get complaints people are gonna quit you know blah blah and so it's it's really like a form of insecurity and it's like a corporate insecurity and uh and so if you're out there uh i tweeted this the other day i was like if you're working at a company go ask for a raise today but do you think anyone did that there's a cycle i just got a promotion go ask for a raise today but i'm i'm i don't know i haven't really proven myself go ask for a raise today everybody should go ask for a raise inside of a big company why because there's almost always wiggle room like when i was hiring they would they had what they called a compensation band what does that mean it means for the same role we can pay this much on the low end or this much on the high end and guess what you start people low or in the middle of the scale and then you flex up when you need to when do you need to when they ask for more money and so like so there's already in your exact role without getting a promotion there is more money that can be had the second thing is what's the worst that happens they say no and when they say no you might learn something they might say no because like they might give you essentially a soft hell no well it's a soft hell no hell no is sort of like they say no and they they're like look if you want more you can go elsewhere and get it that's kind of you're not so valued here like go for it or there's a no that's like look we love you we value you i would love to give you more i just can't right now because of xyz or can you demonstrate can you hit these goals because that will help us build this case and hey you're one step closer to making more money than you were before you asked and so or they say yes and boom you get more money like there's no there's no loss i was uh except if you work for me don't come ask me for more money that doesn't count because i gave this advice so don't ask me but you know other people this is for other people i was notorious at the hustle because when people would ask me for a raise i'd always say yes it was i was horrible at confrontation i just said yes to everything i'm like oh my god i don't feel like dealing with this that is not true dude you told me a hilarious story we can bleep this out if you want to tell it i don't know if you remember me you and our friend sully we were at uh de la rosa or we were at some some restaurant and you told the story of okay bleep this do you remember this no i don't remember fully but you were just like um no and you can leave if you think that and it was just like it wasn't just nose like you don't understand like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the story was like well yeah so i remember this so i should rephrase this when people do good i'm i say yes to everything when people do bad they're like well i want to raise i'm all right so you're like you are a machine to me that sounds horrible but it's like look like our business is a machine and like humans are like part of the input humans effort are part of the input right and you're asking me for a raise right now i think that the money that you were paid like breaks even it's like we put money into this into this machine we put input out and we get the same amount out if i'm gonna give you more amount of money i'm putting more input how much bigger is the output gonna be because right now i don't think it's i don't think that it's worth it and so i don't think it's worth it it's and and so if you don't think that that's fair then you should go to some other machine and figure out where that input can have a bigger output because right now it ain't working right yeah exactly so i loved that i loved that because it was honest uh b it was a little bit brutal and uh you know it wasn't like i would say you have many many super strengths like a plus skills like i would pick you over anybody uh softly wording things is not not one of them so i found it to be super funny but but really again even if you find that information out and it hurts in the moment that this person says look it's not like it's not on the table with the way things are currently at if you find that out you know that's a good that's a good piece of information it hurts in the moment but it's a good piece of information to know because you might say [ __ ] i need to create more value here what would it mean and you could have a conversation you could say well what would i be needing to do for you to feel great about paying me double what i'm making today that's a question you can ask they might not know the answer on top of that but they'll come up with it they'll help work with you on it and then you'll realize oh that's where the value is created in my business and so maybe in this machine that's where the machine needs the oil i should go oil that part of it and create all this new output and then of course they'll give me some more because i've created all i've created disproportionately more value out of it and so it's a good conversation to go have if you haven't had it you know with with the people you work with all right good well i'll let people say we're going to do that um all right good pod yeah let's get out of here [Music] looking back

if you want to bet on the future of humanity and where a lot of growth is going to come from investing in technology is the way to do it yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right this is one of the best episodes i think we've done in a long time i'm going to tell you everything that we talked about but first spotify just has this like new feature i want to see how great it is so basically if you're on spotify go to pull the app up look at it look at our my first million page and you're going to see a little bell do me a favor hit that bell i want to see if you'll be notified when we have our next episode i want to see if this thing works if it does work sign up click the bell and then tweet at me tell me if it works and i'll like give you a retweet or something like that in exchange for clicking it but click that for me and let me know if it works so today's episode i think is one of the best episodes we've done in a very very long time we talk about the amazon liquidation business i'm actually going to record myself buying from one of these websites it's a fascinating business where they sell you a bunch of return stuff but it's packed in a mystery package we talk about fake data there's this new company called tonic that's selling fake data to help you test your stuff crazy fascinating business and then my favorite topic is this guy called harold alphon he's the billy of the week this amazing billionaire that started a shoe company and eventually gave away most of his money but incredibly fascinating we talked about a few other stuff like like how tiger global's making all this money in the future of vc that's pretty fascinating but my favorite part was the billy of the week check it out and by the way on your phone you're probably listening to this on your phone go to spotify click that bell i think they just released this recently someone was telling me about it tell me if you get notified like send like a like click the bell and then just send me a screenshot when the next episode comes out and tell me if it works the sampar on twitter i wanna know if this works i'll retweet you if you um send it to me all right enjoy the episode okay so what did you think about the remit episode i thought it was pretty good i thought he does a good job like i guess i always break it up into two categories how how interesting is the stuff you're saying and then how interesting are you at saying it so he was like i thought he was very interesting in how he says things like he bri he brings energy he is not afraid to like call something stupid like you know he brings a little bit of that flair that you need for something to be fun um in terms of the info i thought it was pretty good i think um yeah we talked a lot about courses and i just think not like we are interested of course because we can make courses that might be successful and so and he already does that i don't know how many other people really care as much about how much we nerded out about it but i don't really care because i wanted to know it and so it was usually good uh let me tell you really quick about this book i'm reading it's called empire of the summer moon have you heard of this no but it sounds very uh it sounds like a teenage girl book no it's about the comanches the comanche indians do you know what the comanches are no what is that all right so let me this is just a quick break how much time do you spend reading i feel like every time you get on the pod you're reading a different book are you reading like four hours a day what's happening i when i say reading it's audio books and i could do at least one a week so wow like yeah like if i exercise if i go for a walk i'll listen to it so and i listen to it at like 1.2 speed so like a 10 hour book ends up becoming like eight hours and so i could do that in a week easy is this a problem for you when i listen to an audiobook and it's read by like a professional narrator i just hate it and i can't get into it but when it's the author reading it i'm like okay i'm kind of down with that is that a problem just for me because it seems like most are professional narrator professional voice over actors or whatever they call them it's actually is a huge problem for me so i do two things the first if i find a narrator that i like i go oh oh you find their other books that they've read yeah so if i find it sorry my phone was going off if i find it like who's your favorite narrator like some random guy who nobody's ever heard you're like yeah craig smith ron chernow ron chernow is a great author he's he wrote titan he wrote house of morgan i'll go and read books uh he gets he has a great narrator that i like the second thing so if i find a narrator that i like i'll go and i'll read uh something that they've done the second thing that i do is i think more celebrities should narrate books so i just read this amazing book i loved it it was by john steinbeck it was like part fiction part not fiction and it was read by lieutenant dan from forrest gump okay you know come up his name's gary rizik or resign or something and it made the book so much better so lately i've been trying to find books sign i don't even know how to say his name sinus is his name i want to go and find books only by like certain celebrities that i know and that makes the book more fun so i actually no way and and you know what's funny i always think about this sometimes it's like the reason i don't like i don't really read like self-helpy business books that much anymore and the reason i don't is i found this one author that narrator narrated literally like 200 like self-healthy books and i looked at what he was doing now and he like still wasn't doing much i'm like well if this [ __ ] read all this stuff that it should have worked like you would like oh you i thought you were gonna say they all sound the same but you're saying this guy read all these books and he's still you know an average joe so [ __ ] it doesn't work yeah like i looked up like how much he charged to read a book i'm like dude what the heck like you're making like 50 grand a year and you just read yourself yeah what what the hell is going on so i'm reading this book right now called empire the sun of the summer empire of the summer moon it's about the comanche indians the comanche indians was like 20 000 indians in america but they were like in the colorado and west area but when you think of indians like you stereotype as like um like when i am in my head i have this picture of like the pilgrims and the indians coming together and then eventually the white people like mess them up so the com the comanches were badass so they were just like normal they were kind of normal they weren't like that particularly special but then they got a hold of horses in the 1500s and they mastered horses so much so that a comanche on a horse what they could do is they could get they could be riding the horse lean to the side so you can't see them and then pop up and shoot 20 arrows faster than one person could fire one bullet and then reload it and fire another and they were wild they were wild wild wild they didn't even have the word surrender in their language like it wasn't a word and uh this is great i'm now that's my criteria now when i what do you look for in founders when you invest could you have been a comanche indian right are you a comanche or not i want to comanche you as a founder that i'm investing they're crazy these guys were like were bad to the bone and a lot of stuff they didn't do was like great like like in their in their culture it was okay to torture and kill captives and they would kidnap people and so they're wild but the whole story is about the history of them and then also it centers around they kidnap a family or they like take a family like a white family and they kill most of the family but they keep this 12 year old girl and they end up like raising her and she marries the chief and she gives birth to someone who eventually becomes the chief and the white people america after like 25 years get her get her and they think that they're saving her and they bring her back and she's like no i want to go back and they're like no look lady you don't know what you're talking about you need to be here and she's like no no no like that they're my family now and so out of protest because she like inherited these like these like um you know these values of toughness she was like fine and she'll see starved herself and died it's it's the craziest book i've been reading you'll you'll have to read it's called the empire of the summer moon it's about the community i can tell you right now i'm not gonna read the book definitely not gonna read the book but i loved that story and i feel like i already got the win i feel like if i go in and read it now i'm gonna do a whole bunch of work and not really get that much more out of it than i already have i'm so happy with what you just gave me well i got like on this kick where i was reading about navy seals and i was like all right who else is badass and then i got to the comanches so is it because you met what's her name's husband and he's an ex-navy seal 100 yes i met him the other day he's awesome okay great that's good um all right we have a lot to go through uh this is gonna be interesting i could what do you want to start you want to start with harold uh no let's save him for a little bit later uh let's do some cool ideas i have a couple you have a couple i think um you want to go first you want me to go i want you to okay which uh let's start with this okay i think this one is as one of the more interesting ideas it's kind of random so i'll start with that it's pretty [ __ ] random but um it's this thing called tonic fake data and so i'm trying to chase this guy down because i really want to invest in this company now after i heard about it so my so i have a cousin i got a couple cousins that are in tech i got three i think three or four cousins that are in tech one of them my cousin samir he tweeted this and i think his tweet literally has two likes which is just a shame because like there's actually like an amazing twitter thread i'll i'll retweet it right now so people can go see it it's on my twitter feed now um but he's like you've heard about big data but what about fake data you ever heard of fake data i had never heard of this so he's like check out this company called tonic fake data and uh they grew about 600 this last year and uh and he starts to like tie some things together so he's like you remember when hbo had that thing where the intern accidentally sent an email to every subscriber and um it's because you know they were doing a test of a like some software system the email system or whatever it is but when a developer's doing a test they have to input some dummy data right some information um and and so typically like you know a developer will just kind of like make it up it'll be like first comma last name you know like they're just trying to get through the task quickly so they're just like inputting fake data you know just from their head and um and so you know if you think about this at kind of like a bigger level let's say you're testing um you know you're uber and you're tr you have a new feature in your app and so he gives us example basically like let's say your uber and you are releasing this new thing about notifications um and so you there's like this process of quality control testing right so they'll they'll have they'll try to like okay sign up as a new user and try it okay let's say you're already using log out log back in pretend you got a new phone right there's all these like if you have a product that has hundreds of millions of users that are living normal weird lives there's all these random different paths a user can take and you kind of need to test your product through each and so um and so there was a guy this is kind of the famous thing is there was a guy who he had logged out of his account on his wife's phone but even when he logged out she kept getting the notifications because of just this like the developer didn't test the feature properly of this use case you go to a new phone you log in you accept notifications then you log out you're still getting notifications somehow and so which we did all the time i would walk around be like hey who here at the office has an android let me see it real quick right yeah yeah yeah exactly who's got an android okay i think we tested all of android it's like dude there's like 200 models of this thing it's like 2 000 models you think you just tested android because you know the one guy who's an android bro like you know used it for a second so what happened with this uber guy is uh his wife got a notification that he was going somewhere or like you know your ride is ready or whatever and she's like wait he's supposed to be at some other place and she found out he was cheating he ends up suing uber 47 million dollars because you know why found out about this left-hand blah blah the cheater sued uber which is hilarious and so uh he's giving all these little examples i don't know if you're one or not it's not in the thread i've done more than so so he gives another example let's say um here's the last example it's 2008 um the financial system was crashing banks are failing and banks owned at that time if you remember like the subprime mortgage crisis they had basically on their books a whole bunch of mortgages that they needed to get rid of and so they needed to sell them super fast because they were like they were at risk of going bankrupt and so they they set up a call center that any real estate investor or buyer could call in and make an offer on one of the mortgages they had because like an auctions like you know closing you know final sale everything must go was that was the idea and so they hire palantir the big data company that peter thiel started and they say hey come up with a recommendation engine that will figure out what offer we should accept because we don't have time to like vet each offer as they come in it needs to be quick like a garage sale type of decisions of like hey i'll give you two dollars for it will you take it yeah go go ahead take it uh everything must go and so um so the developers were like okay we need to like test our recommendation engine for like should we or should we not accept the offer but they couldn't use the data because the data had like all this personal sensitive information right it's a person's name credit score their income their address like it was too much information the bank couldn't just give it to palantir and say hey use this real data to figure out what offers we should and shouldn't accept and so what they did was the developers went to the bank's office they go inside the building and they looked at the data and they said okay we understand we can't take this data and use it for our models but we can replicate this so like the way a mannequin is a replica replica of a human body or whatever they did that to the real bank data system of all these mortgages and so they created a replica that would have the same like let's say distribution and outliers and whatnot but it was all dummy data it was all fake data and so they'd use this they go back they create this thing uh they create the model it's all successful it all works so what happened is i think the guy from palantir took the spot i think he's for ex palantir he spun out he is and was like i'm going to create this yeah ian co i'm going to create this for any business because busi businesses need to be able to generate fake data sets to test all their scenarios from like the uber example show me all the things that users do all the all the different like they do this step and this step and the step and this step cool i need to be able to simulate those steps um accurately and so what they do is they basically say all right people are pretty sensitive about privacy and data nowadays you got gdpr so companies can't be using digi using their data for these things or giving giving data to other groups for it so tonic fake data can basically analyze your data create dummy data and then let your developers or other developers use that data those fake data that fake data that mirrors the real data and so i thought this is like such a niche problem that you would only understand if you'd ever been through this but then once you've been through it you're like [ __ ] this solves a big problem that they have no other way to solve and i love this this is the opposite of a guy who can code makes a to-do list app or makes a music streaming you know like a playlist generator based on the music you like right those are the ideas everyone has that everyone can do this is an idea no one has that pretty much no one could do and so i'm like dude i'm like super bullish on this idea and i love this i love this and especially now with machine learning with machine learning you need a lot of input data to make recommendation engines better well how do you do that how do you get more data well you can simulate or create fake data that mirrors a small sample of real data so i just think it's awesome it goes on two big mega trends privacy and machine learning and i just loved that i had never even thought about this this is amazing how are they doing i think they're doing well they raised some money he said their group 600 in 2020 he what he does my cousin does is he basically helps people do what he did like uh you're interested in tech but you're not a programmer or a designer i'll help you get your first sales job inside your cousin yeah so he went he went and worked at sift science this like fraud detection like machine learning thing similar story by the way ex facebook guys who are dealing with the spam problem at facebook spun out and created science so if you have any platform they'll help you fight fraud and spam and uh using the same stuff that facebook was building internally they exported that idea that's my old import expert framework and so he was the he was like a you know just like a what they call sdr like a sales development rep basically just spam cold emails all day and uh and then you kind of work your way up become a manager what's he do now he teaches people how to get a gig so he's basically like yo you want to break into tech and get a sales job like cool most people don't know how to how to interview for this or how to like do well with this so he takes you for one month he tells you here's a bunch of good companies like that you haven't heard of tonic fake data they need sales reps they have a great product it's a technical dude really i'll help you i hope you understand it and i'll help you get do the job interview well and i only make money once i place you and so he's like a one-man recruiting firm right now for this i think it's kind of a awesome idea i don't know i think he's just getting started so i think he's got like you know five people at a time right now per month that he's helping get jobs like very boutique at the moment i'll give him a shout out so his twitter handle is samir underscore joehr unfortunately no one's gonna know how to spell any of those things but if you go to my twitter feed you'll see i retweeted his tweet just now and i said that's great i i i samir is more interesting almost than than tonic i i i always thought you're gonna say than me well he might be you're pretty interesting but this guy sounds great too i've always thought that you should that that job that your cousin's doing samir is doing that that could exist for all types of positions because i've had when when i was just breaking into silicon valley and living there and i i would have so many people email me and they would say which company should i apply to and for this role or that role i've always i always thought that that could be a cool service that's so cool that he's doing that and he's got to take a cut like a like a percentage of their first year's earnings yeah it's like if i help you get this job then i get x x thousand dollars i don't know i don't know what his pricing is exactly but i get x thousand dollars but hey you just got a job that's you know 85k base plus bonuses whatever like are you cool paying 4k to this guy to who got you that job like really was pretty hands-on with it i think people will make that trade every day of the week plus the companies will pay a placement fee like once he establishes himself a little more like they already are playing recruiter fees of 20 000 per person so they will happily pay him once he builds his name a little bit but it's not super scalable i don't think he cares he's just like dude i just want to make money and i don't care like making 20k a month would be effing sweet and if i could just do that with my bare hands and not have to like run a whole business and have a big team great i'm going to do that and i kind of think that's actually pretty smart i've got a buddy who um was a executive recruiter for years and we he eventually needed to he was like i want to start my own thing and i was like i'll hire you i'll be your first client i was his first client in his first 18 months he's done close to a million dollars of sales wow just from recruiting a one-person recruiting of course he has like 10 years of experience and he's been doing it for so it's not like it's just like he just popped into it but recruiting is an amazing business it's a really good business for uh uh like if you have a one to three person shop i think you could kill it it's pretty ridiculous uh yeah of the of the like agency service-y type businesses headhunting executive recruiting executive placements seems to be like one of the best if you're gonna go into service that's like one of the best service industries to do yeah i completely agree what's uh amazon liquidation because you've been talking to jack about it i saw the messages you're hollering at them well i just start to pay attention right this is one of the one of the the meta lessons of listening to this podcast right you listen to this podcast you should start seeing business as everyone right like your cousin comes up to you you're saying hello but you're looking at everything that they're wearing and you're thinking oh what's this [ __ ] what's that brand i've never heard of that where'd that come from what is this thing you're wearing on the wrist uh and so you start to like see businesses everywhere you go you go to the i told you the story i was at the dentist he's doing a cavity thing i'm looking at his monitor wondering what software is that oh who's selling software to dennis is that that looks at the x-rays that it's like this looks like it's from 1980 like that's probably that's probably like a super successful business because they didn't have to update their software that's how i know it's that good on business whenever i drive by a library a university or a church or a uh school and i see someone it's named after someone i'm always looking them up on wikipedia i'm like right right where did this come from because if you if you have a library named after you you're a baller and we have uh the ability of the week i'm going to talk about this week is exactly that so all right so anyways the idea is you see business everywhere so same thing happens with ads now every time you see an ad it's not this annoying thing to scroll by it's like huh who are you that you can spend money to get in front of me are you making money who what is this business so i saw this ad on tick tock that was basically like it was somebody receiving at their doorstep not a package but a pallet of packages like a normal person was like so excited to open their door and they like you know like you see it like a shipyard like a palette of boxes just taped up and they were all like a mismatch of boxes it wasn't even like it didn't look good so i was like what's that and he said get a palette of amazon there's like amazon liquidation get a pallet of amazon goods for like ten dollars that's ridiculous ridiculous like claim and uh the one the one that i was looking at well do you remember what the service was called okay so so look up this this url charming so c-h-a-r-m-i-n-g charming z-r dot shop right so you already know this is some [ __ ] drop shipper [ __ ] who is doing this this is not a long-term brand they are investing into charming charming er got shot shop okay uh okay okay so yeah so it's like a drop yes it's just [ __ ] they're just trapped right okay like the crappy leggings that you see on tick tock so look in the thread that me and look at the thread that me and jack and you are in and look click that exactly so this says huge value backlog picking liquidation package 9.99 and then you see these giant like from an amazon warehouse packages and it's basically returns uh and you can get like the medium value you get the large you get the super large this is a super large one which i think is or the whole thing which is what the picture is of is 60 60 so 60 for the whole thing and so here's what it says uh if you just scroll down their site and you know it's good because look at this it has like the flashing yellow and red text so like this is some again drop shipper [ __ ] who's like i'm gonna optimize this limited stock it's flashing red he goes in the united states and europe amazon ebay and other e-commerce platforms have too many returns and there's no redundant warehouses to accommodate those returns therefore as a top liquidation company we've collected these returns at a very low price and put them repackaged into pallets for sale some of the packages in the pallets lack the outer packaging like there's no box um some of them and the functions are normal and do not affect the use at all this is why we can sell these at low prices and it says this is a mixed palette of amazon bulk which is also like junk um there's just a whole bunch of random things and it's like you get what you get and you don't get upset you know that's the only thing listen to their sizing it's medium large and super large with three fire emojis by the way and the picture is like a palette wrapped in plastic it looks like a like a nintendo and like an oven a coffee maker do we have to by the way right okay 5 to 14 businesses yeah we need to do that by the way you want to grow the youtube channel here's a stunt that becomes a youtube video that's i ordered an amazon liquidation thing for 60 bucks here's the unboxing of my liquidation so i don't know where you're at if not if you don't want to do it i'll do it but uh but we should do this and film it and i think i think you'd be great at this your american pickers days are going to come back in handy here all right so let me just tell you a few other hilarious things oh customer service guess what his customer service email is sam what is it is it is it help at a help desk at charming's easy shop no is it sub service is it returned no is it like big baller 69 yeah speed arver speed of villa 96 gmail.com oh my god this is awesome did you saw a facebook ad for this tick tock i've been getting tic tac ads for this thing like crazy i bet you this guy's found some arbitrage where this is hitting on tick tock and he's just he's advertising or retargeting me at least because i'm seeing quite a bit of it but there is this market and so i i mentioned this to jack because jack who is our clever friend jack smith who just finds [ __ ] like this before we do typically he's he's always like into interesting stuff so he had told me about this like a year ago he's like yo there's this amazon liquidation thing you should check this out and i was like what what is that and then he sent me something that was actually like the high class version of this so uh so a blue lot yeah so bluelots.com so that's the yc version of this i don't think it took off what they were doing was they were taking these pallets these liquidations and they were just listing them for like an instant auction like a live auction it's like the retail price of these items would be 500 you can buy it for 14. go like just like buy now and they're just basically taking junk i think on kind of consignment and um and flipping it and so this is like a flipper business of liquidations that i don't really know anything else about i just thought this was funny and interesting and i don't know what do you think about this so let me tell you what i would do i wouldn't do it the way the blue lot's doing it so there's this company that we wrote about in 2020 it's called it's it's called unclaimed baggage that's all it's called and right what it does it's based out of i believe alabama scottsboro alabama it has like 200 employees it was launched in 1970 by a guy named hugo owens and when he launched it basically the idea was he made a deal with the local airport and it says any luggage that has been there for like 30 days or whatever it is you know we'll take it off your hands and they just have a huge store and you and they also have an online store but they have a location it's like a warehouse that you can go and buy all the stuff and all the stuff that's in it and i believe he's crushed it and so it kind of looks like um kind of you know like remember like ross stores or like uh marshall yeah yeah the stores where it's like it's not high quality [ __ ] it's mostly crap but you can find some gems but it's like just there's stuff all over the place um you know and it's like fun it's kind of fun like you go there and like i don't even know what this thing is but like this bluetooth speaker i don't need it but i'm going to buy it i'm going to buy it right um that's what i would do with this is i would have a massive store and just sell this stuff i wouldn't do it online um i would do it 100 in person in a cheap area where it's relatively low income and i would have tons of stuff and by the way by the way the unclaimed baggage thing it says uh cool bags get lost uh and then 99.5 percent of them like get back to their owners but then it says less than 0.03 are never claimed and so they made an agreement with all the airlines it says with uh says we will kind of give these bags a second life we'll take it off your hand so you don't have these bags unclaimed bags are just sitting here and we can resell um we can resell the items that are from it they say only about a third one third of the unclaimed items can be resold they go through like a kind of a qa process that says and they have about 7 000 uniquely discounted items for sale each day where where they got from from unclaimed baggage and then they have like an online store and they they clean so what they do is they clean the clothes before they get them they clean 70 000 clothing items a month and a million people go to the store every single year and it's about 150 miles outside of atlanta so people are going like just for this store it's like it's like it's like a sticky type of like cute thing to do i have a friend you should check this guy out on twitter he's pretty interesting this guy's sunny bird bird with a y um he has a ret he created like a returns business he had a clothing brand and he saw one of the challenges is somebody sent something back for a return or an exchange and he was selling like suits that were like in a few hundred dollar suits or something and then what he did was he was like all right look um you you uh he basically was like all right you send back the suit now i need to like get this stain off or i need to reapply the tag or i need to do this other thing otherwise this is like an unsellable item and so he like got a facility basically in north carolina somewhere and started accepting these items for him for his own returns first and started getting good at refurbishing them like reapply the label get the stain out re-steam it so it's not wrinkly or crumbled up or like he's like dude i can't even explain the number of variations of how people send back the [ __ ] wrong and he's like so we just had to handle all those variations and once he started doing it for himself he was like oh cool i could just make this any brand you could just if you have items like this just send them to us we'll turn them over seven dollars per item or something like that and then we'll like you can go resell that item we brought it back to life for you to be able to resell as new and um and i thought that was pretty interesting he's doing well and he's like it was just one of those like kind of messy businesses that's like you wouldn't i wouldn't really want to start it but i totally think it's going to kick ass for whoever is willing to do the work there in 2014 when i launched my first conference hustle con i was like crazy cheap and i didn't have a lot of money and costco is famous for like taking so many returns and i bought like maybe it was a second conference but i think i bought like ten thousand dollars worth of stuff from costco ranging from tables to tablecloths to like two grand worth of soda and we didn't end up using a lot of it and i was like let's just return it and i returned like three to four thousand dollars worth of stuff and i was like yeah i'm so i'm so cool i'm like getting money back so big deal i'm saving and one uh it i like to this day i still lose sleep over this because i found out there the cashiers were like giving me a hard time they're like uh looking at me funny and uh and the reason why and i kind of overheard them say it they threw all of it away oh really they just threw it right away it was like but i was like but this is like a case of soda that's like still in the wrapper like there's nothing wrong and they're like our rulers would just throw it all away and i was devastated that was one of the biggest regrets that i've ever had is returning four thousand dollars worth of stuff that was like consumables that they ended up just throwing away like it it breaks my heart that i did that and uh so at least you have an answer to the question of like what's your biggest regret in life you got your answer actually this should be a thing people do there's all these questions of like oh you know what's the best what's your favorite movie what's the biggest regret you ever had you know what's what's been a turning point in your life whatever this is random questions that you only get so often but it's very [ __ ] hard to think of a good answer on the spot and so we should all just do ourselves a favor and like one day just be like all right i'm gonna i'm gonna write down my answers to all these questions and then you have them and i've got two because if you have a great answer in that moment you're like a star because nobody else can one of them that's one of them the second one was when i was in college i went to a tip a guy like i was staying at a hotel and the shuttle was driving me around and i gave the guy like 20 and he goes oh well thank you and i said oh no you need it and i meant to say like you earned it or something like that and i say oh no you need it and i was devastated i was like oh my god i'm angry that i [ __ ] it i'm haunted by that i said you need it and i was like oh my god that was the worst thing i could have said just to say you deserve it or you earned it is stupid already i don't know why i was right right already bad yeah oh it's like that those things i think about all the time i'm like what was i thinking right yeah that'll hit you once a week and you just have a wave of sadness like that's like the bad version of you know the flight attendant or you check in at the front desk or whatever for your at the airport and they'll like hand you the boarding pass like have a good flight you're like you too yeah you walk away yeah and you're like bleep that out if people are listening to the car with their kids all right you can leave that one out so okay so i'll tell you by the way i have a theory on this stuff which is it's my halloween costume rule all right so so what is this there's an art to these stories so the way you just did it was perfect which was you tell the story it does the job like you you did something regrettable but it's not like you said like you know uh you know i hit my girlfriend back they said whoa bro like you know you're not actually supposed to like put some dark [ __ ] out there or something really bad that makes you look bad like these are things that are kind of endearing like it's endear like it's it's funny that you did it you made an honest mistake and then you recognize it and it still haunts you to this day oh what a good guy and we all had a laugh and i feel like i got to know you and you're an interesting guy it's so this happens with halloween costumes one time i went on a i was in australia it was halloween and they had a booze cruise and so we went on and i always remember there was this there was you know the halloween thing most guys dress up as whatever but most most females there's like the it's like okay to be kind of [ __ ] on halloween right they were okay to dress a certain way to like kind of like you could spice it up but you don't want to have your halloween costume be accurate and inconvenient so i saw this one girl she came on the on the booze cruise and she was dressed up as a bushel of grapes and so she just had balloons all over her body like green balloons and so she looked like like you know like like drapes on a like she was this the vine or whatever and there's grapes all over but she couldn't like she couldn't have fun on the cruise like she was bumping into everybody everybody hated her she couldn't dance she could barely breathe it was like so hot in there and like she paid the price for having this creative and accurate looking costume and in my head when i saw this bushel of grapes girl just struggling the whole cruise she couldn't even get off this boat she was just stuck there in her costume i was like oh the halloween principle which is like there you don't want to be you don't want to answer all questions accurately if it's going to make you look bad so there's a way to answer something there's a way to do the game to play the game but still look good in the process i can't believe you're making frameworks up when you're like 18. yeah as i'm drunk on this boost cruise this is what i was thinking about i like made a mental note never make this mistake as i saw her because i would do this i would come up with a clever idea and then it'd be like i'd have like the most inconvenient night so i i it resonated with me what rami actually said something amazing that i that it was just one line and he said when i think of copywriting it's uh he goes uh effective not cute you remember when he said something yeah he's like effective not cute not clever something like that yeah and and that would and i i think that's always the best i'm like whenever i see websites that are i'm like that's not effective it's cute not effective be effective don't be charming or whatever he said yeah exactly you want to do one more or you want to talk about i'm eager to talk about harold but we could do one more if you want well let's do harold because it's actually it actually relates to the liquidation amazon liquidation thing i'll tell you why so okay so where did this come from this is the cue the music billy of the week is this guy harold alfond i had never heard of this guy did you know did you know this name before i wrote this here no and i added a bunch of stuff though for you okay great so let me give you kind of like the brief story and then you fill in the gaps of what you found interesting so here's the brief story i or i'll go backwards tarantino style last time we were on here or two podcasting or something like that we talked about universal basic income which is this idea of like every year you would just get like a ten thousand dollar check like oh why like oh so you know everybody it's like social well social service or whatever social security for everybody um including non-retired people unemployed everybody so i had said oh i heard this interesting idea and i forgot that it was chamath who had said this that i heard it from uh of a birth dividend instead which is basically giving somebody some money at birth if you if you're a citizen the government gives you x dollars at birth and the beauty of it is it's going to compound over 18 years so by the time you're 18 they only had to give you a thousand it was invested in the economy and then it grows over time to this larger amount by the time you're 18 you want to go for college you have something there so two things happened a bunch of people on twitter were tagging me saying dude i actually did this for my kid and look at this and so some guy was sharing screenshots of like i put in i think it was put in a thousand dollars or something like that and he's like and then i added um i think it was 50 or 100 a month and he showed that the balance was now 93 000 that was in this and he's like how much how much had they invested crazy that it grew i don't know i don't know all the details but he was basically saying like yeah i did this for my kid and you know it was a great idea for me and um i thought okay that's interesting and so then i saw that somebody somebody goes yeah it's like harold alfond and main i say okay i don't even know what any of those words mean what are you talking about so i google it and basically there's this guy harold alfond he was kind of like a shoe mogul basically he he uh he started off as a shoe boy working in a shoe store i don't know what the job title is but he went from like shoe boy to manager then he left and him and his dad buy a factory they buy a factory shoe factory and they flip it in three years to a larger company and then he goes and he buys another factory called the dexter either like the place is called dexter or something like that but it's like the dexter shoe factory something like that and he becomes he becomes a a private labeler so he's making the shoes that are being sold in jcpenney in sears and a bunch of other like uh department stores nation nationwide and so that that grew pretty fast as he became their their shoe provider and uh and then he says all right it's i'm so worried like if jcpenney cuts me off or they're always putting price pressure on me because they know i'm they're they're my big customer like screw it i'm going direct so this guy hires a sales force creates a public facing brand called dexter shoes or whatever and takes it like kind of nationwide himself starts to be successful but the thing that's interesting is or there's two things so his business story gets interesting because he actually ended up inventing the outlet store which is similar to what we were talking about with the liquidation thing so in any factory he knew this because he owned factories in any factory not 100 of the shoes are like up to snuff up to the standard right so what do you do with the like non first grade shoes that were made uh he's like you either throw them away like you mentioned or you would sell it to you called like a jobber i don't know what that means but you'd sell it to a jobber for a dollar he would go mark it up and sell it for five dollars somewhere he's like hey that's pretty good like 5x uh why don't i just do that myself a job is typically it's just a company that distributes so it's a they have shelf space at kmart and they just need to fill it gotcha gotcha okay exactly so so what he did was he's like i'll create my own and so he creates this this kind of signature look this log cabin looking store and he's like this is where you can go get the stuff for cheap because these are the the kind of like refurbished or not quite like kind of odd size slightly imperfect and so he creates an outlet store he's so he creates the concept of outlet stores it gets really popular other brands start to see that oh wow this guy's like he's turning his waste into revenue uh his cost into into profits like okay we want to do the same so they start opening up stores right next to his off the highway and so that's how you started to get these like fact uh what do we call like outlet malls where you would get a bunch of different stores all putting their outlet stuff together here and so that was kind of like one of his inventions anyways he ends up selling the company to berkshire hathaway so he sells it to warren buffett uh for 433 million dollars in an all stock deal of berkshire and i think you added some notes here but all i know is that later on um warren buffett apparently said like you know this was one of the worst investments i ever made so why did he say that what i added there was basically when he bought it i think he bought it in the 80s when he bought it he said it's this business is amazing he and he wrote dexter i can assure you needs no fixing it's one of the best managed companies charlie charlie and i have ever seen in our business lifetimes he's as a business jewel he goes when i go to work i sing there's no business like the shoe business he thinks he's excellent um but what the issue that happened around that time is basically uh cheap international stuff started coming into coming into america and he said something like he goes well cheap imported shoes from low-wage countries started coming um but someone forgot to tell the dexter's managers and their workers about that and they just forgot to address it and so over time he he predicted that i was going to make about 120 150 million a year in profit after a handful of years he ends up losing tons of money he merges it with burlington coat factory or at least tries to and eventually it goes it it goes it's done and the a big problem was that harold started the company in a small town in maine where basically 2 000 people worked and at this point they were mostly older people and buffett was like well we just lost all this money it was a horrible he goes if you look at the guinness book of world records it goes down it's the worst deal ever but the worst part is now all these people are all out of work and they pretty much are too old to learn a new trade and we and they're screwed and so he calls it one of the worst deals of all time the quote was we lost our entire investment which we could afford but many workers lost a livelihood that they could not replace uh okay good good good guy warren buffett all right so so okay this is where okay harold hof harold uh alphon now has a bunch of money a bunch of berkshire stock berkshire stock continues to appreciate over time so he he sold it in 1993 berkshire has just continued to grow and grow and grow uh over the years so anyways i think he owned one over one percent of berkshire hathaway stock wow that's kind of incredible because i don't i don't know what berkshire's market cap is now dan check check virgin market cap now but he sold it an all stock deal so whatever that 433 million was worth if he held uh it ended up being worth a hell of a lot more so what's interesting is like you said the guy's in maine and what he decided to create he starts giving away so he starts giving right he's like okay i'm gonna uh live you need a new library i'll fund it the the university of maine you need a football field i'll i'll uh i'll fund it berkshire hathaway 640 billion uh and by the way dan check what it was in 1993 when he sold i want to see how much it's grown so so he starts giving away one thing he decides to do is he says you know education is the most important thing i didn't get to go to college just because of my what my opportunities were i want to make sure everybody has that opportunity i think it's one of the greatest opportunities you could have so he creates uh a pledge where he says i will give 500 to every baby born in maine on their kind of like birthday you know when they're born that in a 529 account right so this like special kind of like tax advantage saving account if you open up your account i'll put 500 in and by the time they're 18 that will have grown uh over time they'll have appreciated um and so he starts doing this and at the beginning he does it for like you know whatever 300 people then a few thousand people so now life is let me just break down some of the numbers here so 60 million dollars has been given away to babies in maine for their college tuition uh that's 117 000 babies that have taken him up on his offer for free money uh statewide so it's a it's the largest statewide college savings program is sponsored by this one dude and his like family trust i suppose families the families because they open up the account they can kind of like his he was big on matching so everywhere he gave he wanted the recipient to match in some way whether it's money or effort or you have to do something rather than just give so in this you had to open the account which was a bunch of people weren't doing that before this and the second thing was you can then match the 500 that goes in because you realize it's a good idea and so here's the basic math if you had just if you just took the 500 by the time you're 18 it's about 2 000 right so it's gone up about 4x in the 18 years but if you contribute 50 a month it's 25 000 by the time you're 18. and that 25 dollars or so the 50 a month that's like achievable for many many families and then if twenty five thousand dollars it like can pay for for you know state college tuition and whatnot give you an education and so i kind of love this i thought this was a baller move to like build up your hometown and he's given away 500 million dollars just in maine across various programs i thought that was pretty remarkable the foundation has a billion in assets so they give away about five oh sorry six to eight percent a year of their total assets and i think his son is like a senator in maine right i think like that's right grandson uh so the family is i mean i guess they're legends in maine that's pretty baller this makes me want to like get wealthy just for that reason are you gonna go back to st louie and do a little something or what i don't know i've been out for so long but did you you can make a big donation to belmont you're belmont's finest alumni did you um i'll put you in the spot did you donate anything to the haiti thing or the afghanistan or any other cause this year uh we did the a bunch of stuff for the wildfires which i don't know if that was this year or not uh and then the other one was uh charity water we try to support i don't know if we did it this year or not um and then the last one uh sonia if she sees anything that's like for like animals or like it's like she's a vegan so she if she sees the animals or like distressed somewhere she really wants to give and so we'll give a little bit there but we're not big givers i was actually we were talking about this the other day it's like we have this idea like my wife really wants to open up an orphanage in india this has been her dream since we were dating she's been talking about this like she wants to have like if you go to india you see these like tiny tiny kids on the street begging it's like heartbreaking so she wants to open up an orphanage where you know they can kind of have a place and not be on the street and uh and i told her i was like you know like i feel like we made it and she's like no like when we really make it i was like you know that time will never come we should just start giving now proportionally whatever we can give now and then like when the time comes that we can open up a full orphanage great it will already have been like doing the thing it's taking some suffering away for some people and so we were literally just talking about this so i don't really give either i we gave um low digit thousands to the haiti and afghan stuff and that was like a big that was the biggest donation i've ever made right um and maybe sorry it was it might have been two grand i think one thousand each and i tip that that's new we don't ever do that and i realize that's a huge mistake that is such a huge mistake and i think it's a huge mistake for for one major reason two major reasons one it makes you feel so good to do that even you know no one has to know but i guess i'm breaking that rule i'm telling a bunch of people but um the second thing it can like giving away money i think will make you earn more so john rockefeller was famous he actually gave 10 of his income every single year starting at age like 12. like the year he started making money he always gave it away we talked to uh we we joke about mormons they do this a ton a lot of christians they do tithing i guess that's 10 i don't know how different other i don't know how other religions do i'm sure each religion has like their version of this we should totally give more and we don't and it's kind of messed up but it is i think it's wrong um i i like kind of convinced myself i'm like well if i i'll just tip a lot which is like kind of [ __ ] but it's not entirely [ __ ] but it's half [ __ ] we should totally give more we don't give nearly enough um and so that's cool to read the story whenever i read these stories i'm like i want to get wealthier just to do this there's a guy who um what was the guy's name in san francisco and there was this amazing article what it was called the billionaire who gave it all away you know what i'm talking about his name was patrick um uh uh patrick feeney i think is his name patrick feeney um let me look it up so anyway his name's chuck feeney so he created the basically the stores that you i'm going off of memory i read this book a while ago he's 90 years old he currently lives in san francisco i i'm reading this uh the building billy of the week on him chuck feeny i remember you brought up feeny the billionaire who wanted to to die broke and is now and did it basically and he's now worth two million dollars at his height was he the one somebody wrote a book called die with zero or something like that yeah that's a different that's a different topic but it's also good but basically the idea is like a lot of people wait to give all their money away this guy did it when he was live his name was chuck feeny he basically created when you're if you uh go to china and you're not china heated japan if you're on your way back from japan you can go to the duty-free shop uh he basically he basically invented that and now he's got a bunch of duty-free shops they're they're quite famous i can't remember what they are but his uh it was cash flowing like crazy and so at its height he had something like it was multiple digit billions i believe eight billion dollars and that's how much he's given it away so he's given all of it away except for two million dollars and he currently has an apartment in san francisco that costs him four or five thousand dollars a month and that two million is all he's got left crazy fascinating i remember reading about him and i was like i want to get rich just to do that so pretty cool but like a lot of people when they start making money i'm like oh i don't know that you know yeah i don't know what what is the thought there is some thought that like kind of like blocks you but what i can't even put my finger on it's not like i can say well i'm thinking about it this way but that's the wrong way it's like i don't i think i'm just not thinking about it or i'm i'm thinking about it and then it kind of becomes a heavy topic because i think i should do more and then i feel guilty and then i just move on with my life and i just do nothing i distract myself you know i don't want to blow up his spot too much but the guest we just had on ramit i've heard stories i've heard that he is a very good giver oh yeah i i like hearing how people give i have a friend who uh as soon as he made a bunch of money gave a ton of laptops away and i thought that you know there's like a there's something really cool about when you give somebody a knowledge engine or or like a monetization engine it's like you know it's sort of like a teach amanda fish thing but you're not teaching anybody anything you're just giving them a tool that if used well can generate like kind of an infinite number of returns and so i like that idea of like you know whether it's microlending or it's or it's uh you know that what was that project where they dropped a tablet off do you remember this they dropped a tablet off in the middle of africa with no instructions and did you know what i'm talking about so i might butcher some of the details they ran this experiment they left an android tablet which i think had like nothing like kind of like nothing on it i think it was like a wiped reset thing maybe it was just like the boot sequence and they just left it in this like village in africa and uh and then they came back like a year later and like the whole village had learned how to use this comp how to use the tablet they had like found it booted up got an operating system on it had apps it was like running it like they had like learned all put all these education games on it or whatever it was like yeah dan just linked it here i didn't remember the exact story so i guess it's ethiopia so a box a box of zoom tablets was dropped off in ethiopian village to kids who had never seen a computer before and by the time they came back they had not only taught themselves how to use it they were like modifying the android operating system on it to like work better for themselves it was kind of this like really inspiring story it was almost so inspiring that i'm like all right is this a little bit of [ __ ] or what like i kind of don't really care but i like that i think that's that just shows how much power there is in such a simple act yeah i think it's great we should have we should organize something for like our listeners to like yeah we should do something via the pod let's give some let's give something fun via the pod well the way that we gave to the afghanistan i think we only gave him a thousand dollars so it wasn't like that big of a deal but the guy his name is saul uh s-o-w-s-o-l space and then orwell is his last name he owns uh examined.com he just tweeted out that he was gonna do this and he was like i'm gonna give away he's like i vetted this i know where the money's gonna go to for this i know exactly what's happening you if you trust me then you'll then you can trust that this is gonna be good and he raised four hundred thousand dollars off a couple tweets um and that was pretty amazing uh yeah and it sounds badass so we'll have to do something like that uh i think there's a lot of work to vetting in haiti sarah's you know haiti had this massive earthquake you know about that yeah yeah and my mother-in-law is from haiti and she's got this brother so my my my mother-in-law's brother yeah no my brother yeah my uncle i guess he is a haitian immigrant and one and when the another earthquake happened what he did was he got all of his friends to donate a little bit of money collectively added up to like a hundred thousand dollars so he had a hundred thousand dollars uh maybe he had two hundred thousand dollars something like that um a lot but not enough that it's like too much and he took a hundred grand in cash and one dollar bills and five dollar bills and then he hired a private plane and they bought tons of toilet paper paper towels and peanut butter they flew into haiti they gave out the peanut butter and gave out the toilet paper and then he had all this cash and he's like dude they just needed money to buy [ __ ] and like do us currency was good so i just started giving everyone five dollar bills so anyone i could find i would just give him five dollar bills and then he goes and then we stayed there for a day and we gave it all away and then we just came right back and i was like that's pretty baller that's pretty great uh and so i don't know something like that it's inspiring to hear so we're gonna have to do something about that if somebody's listening to this and they have a good idea of a way for us to give that i would say is what my hope is that it's kind of like in line with the values of the pod like if you listen to this you kind of know what we're all about what we respect like i respect that kind of like tab giving tablets to people who never had a computer before i think that's kind of amazing and so if you can think of a good way for us to do this where you kind of you know where the money's going you know it's legit you know that this is going to like actually help people um definitely hit us up hit us up on twitter or whatever give us ideas can we go a little bit over can i have can i there's one something you want i have a lot of stuff on here did you see i did a ton of research on a variety of different stuff and you totally overlapped with a lot of my stuff scroll down look at all that stuff i'm not gonna get you at all it's like so much work that i put in we're gonna have to get to it next week but can we wrap up with the theory of of the future of venture capital yeah because i'm curious what your opinion is is why you're saying this is that one of the things you research or you want me to spiel i want you to tell me your opinion so i was thinking about this um so basically i was like all right venture capital i think is a great place to be because i think technology is driving a ton of progress so you basically if you want to bet on the future of humanity and where a lot of growth is going to come from investing in technology is the way to do it that's pretty clear to me all right so within that how do you perform well so i was thinking about all right you have venture capital venture capital is kind of changing and people like to talk about this so here's my theory why i think it's changing because uh like a there's just new like the secrets out that you should be investing in in technology so you have like soft bank coming over the top with the 100 million 100 billion dollar vision fund and you have tiger global do you know what's going on with tiger well i just know that i see tiger global everywhere i believe tiger global it started a guy named chase coleman his wife was in like some uh actually documentary about being like filthy rich years ago and he uh it was a hedge fund at first it was just a hedge fund like a boring like maybe high speed trading hedge fund right yeah i have high frequency trading you got to read this subset i mean obviously not now we're on the pod but it's called playing different games it's by this guy everett randall phenomenal sub phenomenal blog post about what tiger is doing and how they're playing a different game and um basically what it talks about is like uh what's the most beautiful headline by the way if you want to learn about how to package content into good stuff this is a beautiful headline it says playing different games the tiger phenomenon beautiful headlines it's not it's not too clickbaity either it's like seven unbelievable things about tire no it's like it's it's a it's a this guy has a a point of view or a thesis on what they're what they're doing because to everybody else it looks a little bit crazy because what you were seeing was oh new funding around happens tigers in it tigers in it tigers say dude how much how many deals are these guys doing they can't possibly be vetting and seeing this many deals this is unbelievable pace and so what he talks about is that they're playing a different game so a normal fund says okay i raised this fund i'm going to deploy it over the next three years and that's what i told my my investors i was going to do so over three years i'm going to find the best deals i can i'll be super selective i want to find the best deals and then i'm going to maximize the sort of like uh the sort of return the return i'm going to get the irr and um he says what tiger is going to do is like i'm going to deploy as much capital as humanly possible at a 18 irr so i'm not trying to maximize irr i'm trying to maximize the gross dollars that i could shove into a pipe that will give me 18 so i don't want to fall below 18 but i don't want to try to get to 28 if it means i'm gonna deploy half as much money so it's a very different game so so this happens in e-commerce all the time you have two people in e-commerce one one brand says we want to maximize our roi or return on ad spend as some people say well just call roi so they want to put a dollar in and make three dollars out and they're and if they if they get two dollars out they feel bad if they get four dollars out they feel great and so they they spend as much as they can while they're getting they spend like as long as they can maintain a certain like above 3x roi and they have other people that say no you know what like i'm happy as long as my roi is like yeah somewhere but somewhere above 1.5 if it's above 1.5 all i'm gonna do is just add more money into the top of this thing i'm gonna shove more money in because i'm taking a larger number and i'm multiplying it by a smaller multiple but my base the base amount of money i'm shoving into the pipe is getting bigger so this that's my return so you have different strategies so what are you saying was tiger's doing this in vc they're basically trying to deploy way more money way faster so that their and their returns look better because it's instead of deploying it over three years and being selective they're deploying it all in six months and so now if it comp if it starts to return it's going to already have a faster rate of return because the money got deployed whereas the vc might have held the money for three years being selective about it and so solving the hard problem of making sure that the companies are going to collectively do eighteen percent irr well they're sort of saying look uh if if the best guys who are selective are gonna hit 30 40 we can hit 18 just by getting we we can hit 18 by doing a lot of deals and sort of like a law of large numbers we should still get there because technology and aggregate the index is going to do something close to 18 and plus as we develop this reputation of being we are a trusted fast deal maker you want money come to tiger global we'll get you money in 24 hours we'll get you a lot of money you don't have to do this whole dance with the other vcs and they're going to debate bring you and they overpay and they're like yeah cool what's your what valuation you want 50 make it 60. and it's like oh okay cool i'll take your money so they're getting into a lot of deals and a lot of good deals because they're not price sensitive they're fast and they're aggressive and they're building a track record because when you do so many deals they're going to have a bunch they can point to as like yeah tiger was the one behind this winner and they'll just sweep all their losers under the table and you don't have to worry about that so they'll build reputation fast too so i thought this was kind of interesting so i would say there's a whole bunch of reasons why vc changes this is actually not even what i was talking about my thought was if you're creating a fun today you really the winning strategies are um you you play a different game which is the tiger one so that's that's strategy one you play by a different set of rules than everybody else i love that strategy though another example of that is uh uh when chamoth moved up market to spax so chamoth was doing early stage tech investing series a series b he's competing with sequoia and benchmark and everybody else and then he's like oh dude spax uh spax you know like spax weren't in vogue until he started to make the pencil the mechanism had been around but they weren't popularized and not everybody was trying to do a spack and then he started this wave because he's like huh there's a bunch of companies that want to go public i can take them public faster and get them a higher valuation and basically i can do late super late stage stuff and basically make 10x my money in one year um and so he and so he does once back he's like oh this is amazing he hits back a then he trademarks back beast backseat spec d all the way through spack z trademark 26 of these he's like dude this is a money printer i'm 10xing my money i'm gonna i'm going to do this 26 times if i can but the verdict's still out on that on that strategy i believe right the sponsors the sponsors are making their money dude they make their money regardless it's the retail investor who joins in and says i'm going to invest in in this spec they are getting a questionable return but the sponsor chamath what he's doing so here's the model by the way i learned this recently so i might be oversimplifying it i might have some details wrong this is i was at a dinner with somebody who's doing a spec and i was like yo can you say who no i was like i was like tell me the numbers behind this i was like i was like are these guys getting filthy rich i feel like they're making a lot of money doing this because just of how many they're trying to do this must be i'm wondering it's like it's unbelievable so here's what here's how the economics of us back work you let's say you're chama you have great reputation so for those who don't know what a spak is a spac is a special purpose acquisition corporation or something so it's basically a blank check holding company so you go to the public market and you you list your spac there and you say give me 400 million dollars i'm going to take that 400 million dollars and i'm going to go find a company to to invest in and so so he goes to the public market he says i don't know who i'm going to invest in but i'm going to invest in somebody but his reputation was strong enough that he was able to raise 400 500 a billion dollars bill ackman i think seven billion dollars or something crazy for their specs but they don't even know who they're gonna acquire you have a deadline you have a two year i think clock 18 months two years or something like that you have a deadline and and if you don't pay if you don't buy a company you have to buy it back plus a certain amount of interest yeah there's like a warrant basically so um so so and that's what's happening now with specs a lot of spac investors have been sitting around waiting for the company to make do a move they're just they're they're it's like a coupon like you can basically say give me my money back and they have to give you your money back and maybe plus i'm interested i'm not sure exactly how that works so for a spec let's say it's a 250 million dollar spec the sponsor who's you know a chamath or somebody in this case and he he's not the only one reed hoffman's doing his back a whole bunch of people are doing them uh they put down about three percent so let's say 250 million dollar spec i don't do public math but i think that's about eight million dollars that they put in in their of their own capital and then when they oh everybody froze oh we're back okay so you put you put three percent down when you find a deal and you actually do the deal you're going to get 20 of the action so you're putting three percent of the capital and you're going to get 20 of the of the deal so that's your flip right there you put three percent in you're going to own 20 by the end of it um in addition to that there's things called pipes pipe is basically oh i raised 400 million but i need turns out i found the company but i need 600 million to do the deal so so before it goes public somebody can come in and give you that that difference that 200 million difference you're short and they get a sweet deal too because they're getting they know the target they put the money in and then very quickly it gets liquid for them like you know because it go the deal ends up you know in the public markets then announced so there's a lot of money to be made in specs right now there's also a lot of money to be lost if you're doing it wrong if there's a lot of money i think to make made there's a lot of money to be made if you are a certain couple people certainly by the way is why it's so funny when people like chemoth and i like tomorrow i think he's great but i think he's a virtue signaler like i think he uh he loves to say the things that make him sound like the people's you know the people robin hood yeah i'm a robin that i'm saving and everybody else is playing these [ __ ] games why don't we do real hard work and solve real problems and and cut out the [ __ ] he's all about that like those rhetoric he's very good at those speeches but if you look at what he did it's like dude you're you're playing the game just as hard as anybody else in my opinion you might believe you have better intentions about why you're playing the game but like let's be clear and i don't have a lot of ins you're an insider and you're an elite you're not the every man everyday man that you're you're trying he tries to kind of champion for but i can't blame him like that's a good strategy instead of saying i'm a rich billionaire like with insider access you know that doesn't play over so well and i don't know if this is true today but i think it was true i believe that his spax chamas specs are like the an aggregate of all across all of them like the most shorted stocks on the stock market maybe they are now i i don't know i haven't i haven't looked at that but yeah definitely people have cooled off on on some of the because if you look eight what the thing is you look 18 months later after they do their acquisition target you're like how how are they doing so like the typical spac curve was they list at ten dollars before they find a target they trade up to 12 13 14 15 16 right so you're getting this return before anything has happened all right this is just like greed and then they find the target and then it either pops or it starts to shrink depending on how people feel about the target and then like 18 months later where where is that stock is it at 10 is it above or is it below i think people are doing some good analysis on this i'm not super up to speed because i didn't talk about specs today but um but anyways i think one example is uh open door have you uh look at open doors stock i think that's one of his specs uh he's doing well now well i just look at it it's the exact arc so you guys didn't couldn't see this but right sean's uh what what's that ark called it's just like a like a like a standard deviation cycle yeah like a no it was like a standard deviation looking like a chart and that's exactly what open door looks like it's like starts small gets huge goes back lists at 10 runs up to 34 and it's currently trading at 17 15 15 to 17. um and so you know if you were in the ten dollar bucket yeah you got it you gotta you do have gains right now so i'm not saying expects are good about i guess what i'm saying is if you're my my main theory here was you got to do something different that's one way if you found a different game now people are going to copy you just like they've written to his credit figured out that this is a good model was the first one doing it and then there's just been a flood of spac since then everybody and their mom who can's back wheels back right now and even startups who can't really raise well or don't aren't strong enough to go public they can go public via a spec and then all of a sudden hey we got liquid great um so so there's definitely a lot of like lipstick on the pig going on wait so we have to wrap up this segment which was vc you do the tiger thing you become like chamath or do something different and so those are one those are play a different game tiger and spacking that's an example of playing a different game the second one is you're the big brand so sequoia benchmark andreessen they're always going to get the best deals or they're going to get allocation if they want in the best deals because of their brand name and those funds are so big and you can't even invest in them if you wanted to if you're that seems like the hardest one to do well yeah because okay great it's like saying start off in checkmate you know like how do i do that how do i become that brand that's obviously that takes time but they'll do well i'm just talking about who's gonna do well people playing a different game then the big brands then the niche specialist so this is like i'm a vc fund focused on cannabis i'm a vc fund focused on automation and machine learning i'm a vc fund focused on let's call it sas software like david sacks craft ventures so there's like a whole bunch of these right vice ventures there's they they brand themselves a specialist in this one thing you could do a media one if you wanted to and basically what happens is if you picked a vertical that works like sas is a good vertical automation's a great vertical right um you're gonna see you're gonna see a lot of you're gonna see more deals than anybody else in that vertical than a generalist because you say no to everything else that's not this so you're only spending your time here you build your brand there by creating a bunch of content you're blogging you're podcasting about why automation's the future why self-driving cars are the future blah blah blah so those founders will come find you and then also you they'll keep you in deals so even if sequoia or benchmark wants to do a deal the founder will add you for that credibility because you're a specialist in that niche and by you stamping them it's valuable and they think you'll add value because you are more knowledgeable about this domain than anybody else so i think these specialists can do well then there's celebrity angels that's like naval biology same sort of thing as the as the big brand and then the last one is called venture services what are venture services are you familiar with uh tusk tusk ventures do you know what tusk adventures is no there's this guy this guy bradley tusk he's got a book that you might have read he was uh i think he's like a ex washington policy guy i don't know yeah know brad he's like a policy guy what he got kind of known for was when uber was uber was in its early stages growing uber was having hella trouble with cities and the the taxi uh cartel and like every every market they were fighting against taxis in the cities and the people wanted them there and so they he was giving them a bunch of consulting and advice and then he got to invest and uber was like one of the best investments of the decade for an angel investor and he did that also with airbnb another group that had policy questions so any startup that had a regulatory or policy challenge which actually many do uh it was like oh we should include tusk in our round that's what their value add is and so he had a services business that was his consulting business for for this that he built i think he owned a hundred percent of it i think it's a hundred million dollar business and then he created a venture arm just to invest equity and get equity and also just exactly this yeah exactly the sort of policy legal regulatory lawyer basically lawyer but specifically with like public policy i think so like lawmakers more so than like drafting your shareholder agreements and so you know built this really successful services business but didn't leave it as a service business added a venture arm to it and because of that you owned equity and things that ended up being very very valuable and a lot of uh ad agencies try doing this and they only do okay they only do okay i think that if you did it with a different a different shtick like what this guy tusk was doing then it could be interesting a lot of ad agencies that do that like even you remember red antler and all those guys yeah i think they took a sliver of equity you you had to give them like like there was a minimum it was like 50 grand plus some type of equity right well friend of the pod andrew wilkinson he was doing this with tiny right uh i'm sorry with uh meta lab the design agency so design agency and so slack is paying them cash to design the first slack client could have took equity also or could have had an equity arm that says great let me also invest in your next round or in this round with you separately we'll take the cash on the balance sheet that we're making from consulting and we'll invest it into the projects that we believe in that are in in this portfolio would have done phenomenally well but didn't do that in his case um he used it to go buy businesses separately did you hear do you know who david cho is no so david cho and this will be the last story david cho is this kind of degenerate gambler crazy guy he's um he when he was 18 he started traveling he had a show when vice was popular of him hitchhiking across the country it was called like david cho hitchhikes across the country and he's just kind of this degenerate crazy person but he's an artist and he's like a wonderful artist a graffiti artist he's so good at it and he's got some amazing work and right when facebook got started david cho was kind of like a cool guy uh like a lot of people knew who he was and they wanted his work but uh you know he was hard to get so eventually sean parker hires him to paint facebook's office they want this they want to paint this like amazing graffiti and david cho goes uh yeah you know be 50 grand and sean parker goes uh well you want 50 grand in cash or 50 grand in facebook stock and he goes well i'm a gambler give me the stock he takes a stock and it's worth like 300 million dollars uh a few years after facebook goes ipo and it was all from this facebook uh wall that he painted and i went to the facebook office and they ended up taking down the um or they moved to a different office but they saved the wall so throughout the office you could still see the david cho painting and so he ends up he at the time when i wrote the article like four years ago it was like 200 million dollars that he made from the 50 000 worth of art now it's way more he's actually on joe rogan all the time he's a crazy guy this guy david cho is nice i like it yeah basically i think there's this model of venture services which is um you know uh bobby goodlatte is doing this with design uh bain did this back in the day so you have bain and co the consulting company and then bain capital was their venture arm that they used so i think that investors who you can't just say you know i'm good at this i'll give you advice it's like i think there's going to be investors that say yeah use my like i have a company that does this as an agency as a conservative services company and then we also invest and that combination i think is gonna be pretty powerful [Music] travel never looking back

in our copywriting uh program we say be clear not clever clear not clever it's really hard to be crystal clear it's super easy to create marketees and be clever but in the grand scheme we believe clarity wins i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right so remy have you you can be honest have you ever listened to the podcast i've heard your clips and i love them all right good answer you know what you're getting into yeah you know what you're getting into and you're also we'll just say it you're you're one of the reasons you're here is because i like you we're friends another reason is you're smart and good at this stuff but the third reason is you just had a podcast come out and you'd be talking about doing a podcast forever now you actually have one it's about um are they the people are anonymous right there it's anonymous couples having discussions about money well most of them use their real names and they're all real voices so i always wanted to uh listen in on couples fighting about money discussing money but you can never do it you know the only place you've ever heard anyone fight about money is on a movie and now you actually get to listen to real couples sharing real numbers talking about what's going on with their money how do they disagree and then what do i help them do to get over it and what's it called it's called i will teach you to be rich with ramit sethi and so this is a little bit like uh what's her name esther perel is this sort of like her model where uh i forgot what her podcast is called it's very good she's like kind of like a relationship coach and she has a couple coming in she's a therapist yeah esther perel is amazing you know she helps couples with therapy mine is not therapy but if you imagine for example a couple where the classic example is you know he's an overspender we don't have enough money for that that's a classic one but then it becomes much more interesting for example we have a couple the guy hates hates paying too much for organic blueberries he hates it so when he orders blueberries he has two tabs open he's comparing notes i know all your personal finance nerds listening to this are like what's the problem that's totally normal no it's not normal he opens it up he's comparing cross compartment guess his net worth what do you guys think i'm guessing it's high based on the setup so uh i don't know we'll go over i would say over over 10 million sam uh a million bucks eight million dollars and he's comparing the price of blueberries and really what this shows is money is not just about math in fact we overvalue math and we undervalue psychology which is what the podcast gets into did did launch go well how how how the the the first episodes do great i mean we're learning right so i know all the metrics cold for email and even social stuff but for podcasts we're like i texted some of my friends hey what's good and they told me some numbers are like okay so we released it now so it's getting tens of thousands of downloads per episode we're happy about that i'm more happy that people are writing in and they go my wife and i finally talked about money for the first time we've been married for six years i'm like yes so the quantitative stuff seems to be good but i'm more interested for a creative project like this in the qualitative growing our podcast we've talked about it a bit on this podcast which people like and sometimes don't like us talking about it too much but it's been the hardest thing that i've had to grow what you'll learn i'm sure you've already learned this is that so with email you can advertise somewhere or you can write a blog post and you know exactly where the new email subscriber is coming from um and you know you can guess how long they're gonna stay with you with podcasts you don't really know that so like it's like itunes won't tell you how many subscribers you have they're not exactly going to tell you where they come from uh you don't you don't know a lot of information and so it's really really challenging and so when we grow we'll do a bunch of stuff and we're like did it work and it takes us a week and we're like well the numbers went up let's just continue doing everything we just did did it not work no it didn't work all right so let's just change it's been it's been really hard uh anyway but so you uh all right so ramit you have this your main thing is i will teach you to be rich and it started as a blog uh it's a book now and it's this major course business and that's actually what i wanted to talk about a little bit early on was course businesses sean just launched a course called power writing it's called power writing all right yeah wait you don't even know the name of your own partner's new course what's wrong with you well i knew it was called power writing i didn't know if it was like power writing and then like you know dash the how to write like i don't know what the [ __ ] hold on hold on i'm taking over this podcast right now sean are you offended that number one he didn't know the name of your course and number two that he hasn't bought it for full price not at all no uh sam basically taught me everything that i teach in the course so in a way i actually owe him some royalties really and then the second thing is uh when he asked that i just thought it's like a setup you know like you know when you kind of give someone an assist you're like oh you wrote a book right what's what's the name of that book you're just letting them plug their thing and it's like that's a podcast old trick okay that didn't go the way i wanted so oh look it did look it's called i know what it's called it's called power writing but there's a sub headline as well right sean no there's no sub headline and also also i think i'm you guys are retiring i taught it just this time and it was like it was really good and i'm like unfortunately i'm the type that gets bored of things really quickly so just when we got it where like after the the second one from the first one the second one made double the money and it took a quarter of the time which is like exactly what you would want and it should the answer should be go do it again and instead i don't want to do it at all i'm just like okay i want to move on to something else you written can you say you said the first time how much it did so can you say this time how much i did the second time uh just double that so for those who are following along just double the number that's how much you made this time really okay and you're not gonna do this again you're done i'm gonna teach something else something else i'm interested in something that's like totally different like which will be like kicking over the sand castle and starting over which is kind of silly from a business point of view but from uh enjoying myself and entertaining myself point of view it's the right move but your courses are different than remedies so remy i i bought your copywriting one um again i'm sorry i don't remember the name of it just it was just called matt it was sale up on sales pages what would which one did i buy uh we have our our biggest one is called call to action we have another one called behind the sales page where you actually watch me write a sales page that i think made millions and millions of dollars so it's maybe one of those okay i took it i took it two years ago i've taken a couple of yours but your business is different than sean sean's was the cohort one have you ever have you done one of these cohort classes yeah i've done several in fact i'm doing one as we speak right now uh cohort classes are definitely hot um it's fun to watch this new model if you trace the history of courses i mean they've been going on for generations but let's just say in the last 20 years um you know first off was e-books and this is they were kind of hot in the early 2000s um you had dating ebooks you had a famous ebook on how to train your parrot those were typically between 10 and about 100 bucks um then you started seeing video being added video added higher pricing um and it was technically very difficult because they didn't youtube wasn't even out uh when somebody started then it went on to higher value people got more sophisticated with topics you added masterminds which were hot and they've kind of fizzled out over the last few years now you have cohort based courses and there's some focus on completion rates which we can talk about that's a terrible decision to do if you choose to do that we can talk about that but yeah cohorts are hot doesn't necessarily mean they're lasting but they're certainly hot right now so how many courses right now do you guys have um we have between 20 and 25 live is your business doing north of 20 million in sales i'm not going to share my sales numbers um i thought you might not i thought you might not but i respect that you just you just told me that because if i ask someone and they're like oh you know i'm like just say you don't want to talk about it that's totally exciting yeah yeah we have a private business we have a great team and 20 to 25 programs and over 50 000 customs around 50 000 customers so we're thrilled with that you're not teaching these live then recorded generally they're recorded the biggest ones are we do do some live ones to experiment with concepts and it's just fun well you know like you mentioned sean you like to be able to engage and then you're like okay do we want to double down on that or are we done with that and what do you think uh so so i think some people are interested in your course business but i think more people would be interested in what you've learned about the course business having done a bunch of it being kind of like near the top of the game there which is like first and foremost who's crushing it when it comes to courses what's a model you look at where you say just from a pure like respect of the way that that business works i respect this course business what stands out to you might be your own great great question because crushing it and who i respect are totally different let me break that down who i respect i respect um people like marie forleo who has a awesome business she's runs it her way she launches when she wants to which is sparingly um it's beautifully done and she she just loves the way she runs her business that's awesome um i also respect people like like some of the the legacy people in our industry jay abraham who i just saw for coffee two days ago uh he's one of my mentors and he's been around since the 80s in fact even before brian dean high integrity uh matthew hussey in the dating space he's great he's a friend of mine um and then i think reforge is interesting although i think that that is quite different because it's venture backed than what the typical individual wants to create so what i admire about all those folks high integrity and we can talk about why integrity is lacking in the course business because it is uh they run the business the way they want to each of those could easily double their revenue easily if they did a couple of different decisions they don't uh and and and that's why i respect it john do you know who jay abraham is no okay so he's i'm gonna guess probably in his 60s and he wears a he looks like if i like told you like imagine what like a in the 60s or in the 60s what a rich british guy would dress like if he were like into hunting like in the countryside of england that's what this guy dresses up like impeccable you know the hunter and jumanji that's what i just that's what i got in my head that's a really good yes okay so google it he wears like a kind of like a scarf tucked into a tie and like you would imagine him smoking like a pipe right for me am i wrong like he like dresses like in fact let me add to that i once asked him jay because we're close and you know he's been a mentor for many years he tells me you know i flew to asia and you know i said jay what'd you wear while you're on stage because he loves he's a sartorial he's into it he goes well you know how many suits i take for a three-day presentation right i go one he goes 40. i said what and he said they're hiring me not just for the information i'm gonna teach they're hiring me to be theatrical it's a show and so at every break he changes his suit now to the typical silicon valley utilitarian they're like not so stupid what's the metrics there's more to life than metrics you silicon valley nerds that's a huge mistake that all these roi attribution positive sometimes in fact the best companies know that's why they advertise in times square they can't track that but they do it because it's the right thing to do and it's about brandon jay's a genius at doing that that's why he's been at the top of the game for decades and he's been at the time he's been he's been around forever and if you go and study like a bunch of copywriting books i think was that his background was he a copywriter yeah one of the best okay so he's a copywriter and when i don't know him i've i've seen him in person once or twice i know you know him well but this guy has got this huge cloud of mystery around him to me from the outside and and i think that's the vibe he purposely gives so like for all i know he could be a billionaire i have no idea like what this guy's story is he's just this like business like guri type of guy what what is his story what's the truth about him so the the truth is that he he was doing highly innovative marketing for the last 40 years he would go into companies like gold companies um umbrella companies all kinds of random industries dozens and dozens of industries and he would show them ways to exponentially grow their their sales icy hop was one of his and he has a fantastic story he bought remnant radio advertising he paid a hundred percent of the first fee to the radio station so it was no risk to them and then he took the long-term profits and grew that business in a massive way so i'll tell you what i like about him i like that his ideas are extremely powerful in fact on my bookshelf i have a very highly curated bookshelf of some of the best marketing books that i've ever read i have two of his that are on that bookshelf um he he takes a multi-dimensional approach to business so for example he would tell me early on ramit put your customers at the center of your world i said okay what does that mean and he's got this thing called the theory of preeminence he would say look tell them explicitly tell them you are here you might not be ready to buy today that's fine enjoy my free material to use it for as long as you want when you are ready i will be here and i will be here for the rest of your life which is totally true and you know i do some things in my business that are very unconventional for example i don't allow people with credit card debt to join our flagship programs the higher end ones that costs us millions of dollars every year and it's funny people will plagiarize our sales pages they'll plagiarize our email copy for some reason they don't plagiarize that policy i wonder why that is because 90 of their customers would disappear overnight but when we do that even though it costs us in the short term it benefits us tremendously in the long term so jay helped us really articulate that vision clearly what does he sell what you you're talking about course businesses that you like what what's his course he doesn't care he doesn't care about that anymore he's been doing that for general for decades he does uh rare consulting for equity arrangements you can find most of his stuff free on his website if you sign up for it but he's not doing that anymore he's done it he's shared a ton of his insight now he wants to work with selective clients did he tell you any good stories about uh icy hot or one of the brands that he helped i see hot was one of one of my favorites it's in this book and he's told me all about it he told me about gold and how he um helped this gold business that was sort of struggling and they repositioned the way they sold gold and it exploded their business he's got tons of great stories in his book my favorite one it has a terrible title but it's a great book getting everything you can out of all you've got is really good one page in that book helped me build a multi-million dollar product i was sitting on a wednesday wednesday i have strategy days and i just read and i think and i read one of his pages and i it all clicked for me and i launched a multi-million dollar program of ours uh called ramit's brain trust and it was all because of that book so speaking of uh speaking of terrible titles uh we have a podcast title that is both kind of catchy but also kind of cringey i would say you also have a title that is kind of catchy and kind of cringey so we've talked about kind of our feelings on it give us your take on both your name as as well as doing names like this so give us the kind of like what's your what's your mindset is it all pros are there no cons are there a mix how do you think about it now there's a lot of cons i'll tell you i'll tell you the the blunt truth so i created i will teach you to be rich while i was a student at stanford and i was helping my friends in the dining halls with their personal finance and i had learned and i built my own system because i took some of my scholarship money and put in the stock market and uh here i am trying to help my friends and they were like oh that sounds awesome because i got an overdraft fee and they would never show up to my free classes so i was like okay i gotta name this to make it more catchy and then event and that didn't work so eventually i started the blog looking back i want to first say i was sober when i picked the name okay so and it was catchy but i will say um it's come with its downsides for example you know i've been sitting on panels there's like the ceo of a fortune 500 company another ceo or senior vp and then there's ramit sethi ceo of i will teach you to be rich and the first reaction at some of these places is not good okay but even though many of my really smart friends including some venture capitalists and others they were like you got to change your name you got to change your name early on i was like you might be right and then i started going well there's some costs i've already invested all this time and then it just became too difficult and so i finally have really owned it um i will say that i know very well when people hear this name of this book or the site they go that sounds like a scam so the conversations are seriously it's not what it sounds like check it out and then i kind of have come to love that i love the push pull they go it sounds like a scam they come here it's hyper tactical it has the exact accounts to use they go oh this sounds like every other money person wait a minute this guy graduated from stanford oh wow he's in the you know times square new york times bestseller so i love that push-pull i don't mind a little skepticism because i trust our material is so good that if they are ready they will receive it and if you were going to rebrand had you ever come up with a backup what would you go to yeah we we've played around with some ideas i do think there's room in our future business for an extension for different names but but with all that said you know what i love clear names some of our best programs are find your dream job we've helped people get 50 000 raises that's like right on the money earn 1k help you earn 1k on the side and for many people turns into earn 100k on the side so i do love clear names and in our copywriting program we say be clear not clever clear not clever it's really hard to be crystal clear it's super easy to create marketees and be clever but in the grand scheme we believe clarity wins and you've been doing this since what like oh nine or something when it when i started this site in four oh four and do you think that this could last another so you're at it that's what 10 11 12 uh 16 years 17 years can it last like what's it gonna what what would a brand like this a course business and your brand what would it look like in 20 or 30 years and are you going to continue doing it for that long you think oh yeah i mean i love what i do so first of all it's not a course business sorry we just happen to have courses but we also have a paul then a blog a brand so it's it's an education business um we have a book with over a million copies sold right you could just as well say it's a book business because we sell more books we sell courses um but i don't love the concept of quote a course business um you will find that many of the successful course creators they go wait a minute there's lots of different ways to reach people i'm going to do events i'm going to do a podcast so courses simply become a nice which which part of the empire so right so i'm pretty fascinated i've been studying this kind of what i call solopreneurs basically people who try to build like a personal monopoly around some domain whether it's a guy who there's a guy who's like i'm the best dog trainer i will just teach you everything you don't know about training your dog i'm just like i train dogs for the stars but then i'm going to give you the information for free over here i love that i think these are there is an infinite number of these like personal monopolies that you could create even within one right so let's say your personal finance there's personal finance for guys who want to be billionaires there's people who want to be lean fire there's people who want to um do it where it's like you know you're only gonna you're you're gonna maximize your time right so it's like the kind of four hour work week style there's there's a number of these personal monopolies and i've been interested to look under the hood of these and see two things one is what's uh what does that business really look like because you only see ramit sethi you write you don't know like how many people you got on your team yeah we have about 20 20 to 25 at a given right so like even though it looks like an individual brand obviously there's a there's a full talented team of people helping out help me make it happen and then you have like many different plates that you're spinning at once you've got the blog plate you've got the podcast plate you've got the books plate the courses plate there's gonna be you know there's probably four more that i mean job board who knows what else you got um which plate is the so i would say the usually what i found and you tell me if it's true for you i found that there's the audience core one which might be like the blog like the blog is our core thing for growing the audience the free audience and then there's like and then there's this other thing which is monetizes kind of like the one to five percent of the audience the best and this is what this is where the money comes in to pay for these 25 people that work at my company so what is it for you is it a newsletter or a blog what's the main thing on the audience side and what's the main thing on the business side is it courses that's a great question i think in general your model is correct i think that there are places that are better for audiences and typically this will be things like social media it's easier to grow that than to grow the number of customers that's just sort of a given of the internet for us audience wise i think um social media for us for sure so we have people on twitter instagram to some extent youtube and now the podcast i think that will end up being a pretty substantial part of the business audience-wise um the program those are all about each generation that's like the leader well uh instagram is the best it's the best be in my twitter um because i am i love it it's like i'll get up and i'll start instagramming and tweeting and stuff and now we've got a little iwt support in there so we've got you know a regular posting schedule those are great and actually we've learned how to monetize things like instagram um you know instagram is a nice part of our business as well you also reply to trolls on twitter which is awesome and instagram i reply to all trolls yeah i love it i'm waiting in my life for one smart troll you know i have i've helped over 10 million people i have uh over a million books sold 50 000 customers our team is amazing i'm still praying one day can there be an intelligent troll out there it's so far no it's um it's very difficult you know i get anti-vaxxers who write me you know i tell them you know you have trouble deciphering a menu at olive garden and you're over here giving me medical advice i don't think so so you know these guys they they're and they're all guys they uh they really feel that they need some meaning in life and i'm happy to give it to them and show others how to respond to trolls why do you why why do you spend the interview there by the way isn't that a big energy suck why because it's fun for a while it is fun to slap down trolls for a bit but it i've for me it gets exhausting but you seem to thrive on it you seem like even right now i can see a little pep in your step just thinking about it well i remember listening to a navy seal who said when others do push-ups they get tired when i do push-ups i get strong and i found the same because dealing with trolls keeps me sharp um and i'll tell you why it's not just you know for kicks and to make fun of them it's that in my life you know i'm hanging out with guys like you smart guys who are dissecting business models and and healthy whatever i don't get the chance to talk to someone who comes up to me and says you know vaccines are fake or um these sort of crackpot you're you're only doing this so you can make money if i wanted to be rich i would create a book on being rich you know i've candidly never had somebody come up to me in real life and say that and in part that's because when people come up in real life they're actually very positive pleasant they usually have very nice things to say what typically happens with these trolls now i've um had conversations with thousands of them and i save and cross um catalog all these conversations so it's fascinating right over time you can build a corpus of what's going on remember i studied psychology at technology and psychology at stanford so i'm fascinated with human behavior so i want to know what's going on in your life that you would reach out out of nowhere to somebody who doesn't know you and go [ __ ] you so when they say that to me i go hey what's going on man you having a bad hair day and we start talking and so now i have metrics 50 of them will never reply of those who reply 50 will go oh oh my god i didn't know anyone would actually read this oh i'm sorry hey man big fan which kind of leads to the question if you didn't know anyone's going to reply why on earth would you send that that's kind of sad and then the remaining 50 which is 25 of the original they will kind of double down and that actually is a very interesting conversation to have like what's going on with someone that they would say that and so i don't always get to a resolution but it hones my conversational skills and i get to understand and peek into the psyche of someone like that i love that you have the like intellectual answer when it's probably just really fun to just clap back at people no no explanation we've all felt it um so uh sam i think you were gonna ask something before i jumped in on the troll thing well i i i'm still curious about the course business and and i'll tell you why i'm curious about it i'm curious about it because like i bet you you've been in this since 2004. there's i i have a bunch of friends neville noah you who are just i think you're maybe i think you're maybe eight years older than me um who are old enough older than me and that they've seen like the beginning of like the web 1.0 course businesses and there are some people that just crushed it so we talked about ebbing ebb and pagan uh what was his name david d'angelo was his uh what's his name and that stuff i love hearing stories about that it's so fascinating about all these guys just killing it on the internet and it's just fascinating it's like learning about like a drug cartel or something like it's just like intrinsically exciting to hear about like these like it's like cowboy feeling type of business and also on here you mentioned the company agora and you're saying that i asked you can one can some of these course businesses reach 100 million in revenue and you said you sometimes they can but it's incredibly hard but the ones who do they're really just uh they're like huge newsletters that sell courses so yeah that's what i wanted to ask you okay so let me take you back and i'm gonna share a couple stories from the history because we have um created over 30 programs and we have served you know tons and tons of people so um a few things i've learned first of all i remember our first major course we launched was called earn 1k and the reason we created it was that i went on book tour and i went around to 13 different cities and i was like hey what should i create this is way back in the day uh 2009 in the depths of the recession and they go love your stuff on finances and automation but i really want to know how to make more money okay that was fairly unusual back at that time so came home and we identified all these different uh areas of making money we created a program on freelancing because we know it and we could teach it we recorded that in the back of the automatic office so we got hooked up with matt he was like okay you can record it in the back we didn't have any fancy camera equipment but the content was good and we launched it and it was 497 dollars at the time and the thing converted way better than we thought it converted too well it was around two percent if i recall correctly and i told people in the last email i was like guys this is actually converting way better than i thought i'm going to raise the price and a lot of people were like haha marketing gimmick haha that's so crazy and then at the end it made 600 000 on our first launch and we raised the price and never lowered it again ever so it was hilarious because a couple weeks later people like hey can i get in at the original price we're like no and so that was the first thing where we realized oh my gosh packaging matters topic matters conversion rate and pricing are profoundly meaningful in your business so that taught us a lot moving along you know we had other programs we launched another business program i think it did like five million or six million in one week and we wrote about that on the tim ferriss blog um you can see kind of the entire flow of how we did that that's a great one by the way i i've when we launched trends i read that and reread it a ton of times i think it's like uh a five million dollar launch or something yeah is that yeah i figured yeah we took people behind the scenes because there's a you have to understand it's like think of all the movement behind launching a movie okay we're not doing a movie but we're doing a launch we write an entire book per launch and much of that gets discarded and we still end up with a book that's how much we write and create so we wanted to show people what goes into it because it's not just luck at certain levels it's very strategic and there's an element of luck too but then moving you know moving along you see a lot of other models that came and went for a question like can you make it to 100 million bucks you can but a couple things change one you become an acquisition machine you cannot make it to 100 million dollars without a true massive acquisition machine and that means that most of your business will be focused on acquisition and in the self-development world or money world if that's what you choose to pursue if you want to play that game you have to become very very uh mercenary so for example you will see facebook ads they're basically like uh make a million bucks in a week i'm being hyperbolic but you get it why it's that that is what people respond to when you are doing a true acquisition machine if you want to build a boutique business with high integrity that is antithetical to that so it's very important to know for example in software you're you don't necessarily have to build a very hyperbolic business right look at hubspot they're not over there saying fix all your crm in 10 hours that's not what they're saying at all but in self-development or in the course business it becomes more and more aggressive the bigger and bigger you want to get and that's kind of like one of the one of the downsides of the business which is it's kind of like you know the hustle we we had a conference hustle con and a bunch of other conferences and it kind of sucked when that was our main stream of revenue because the more money it made the more people we had and the more people it had the worse it got and that that sucked i hated that i hated that i hated that i hated that and that was a huge challenge for us well it didn't end up being a challenge because we were like all right it just can't be the main revenue driver but yeah well let's do a quick switch i want to do um some of your uh both business ideas because this is a idea podcast and secondly i want to ask you about some money hacks but let's start with ideas so what we like to ask everybody is cool it's it's always fascinating to figure out how do you do what you do how long you've been doing it great like that's kind of pass facing but what i found is that anybody who's talented enough to build their own business like you have and is out there operating in the field they see tons of other opportunities that you just you have more ideas than you have time to go do them and so or maybe you're not the right person to go do that idea but you think somebody should somebody who loves so and so should go do that um what are some ideas business ideas that you've seen that you you think are genuinely interesting or worth we're chatting about and then we can toss them out to the audience okay i always focus on where's the demand where is their insatiable demand you know as we talk about in our earnable program go where the fish are and um the first one i would create would be a business around pets okay first of all i don't have pets and i don't want pets my wife is constantly telling me let's get a dog i'm like we're never getting a dog ever and i want to tell you why because when i was a kid my sisters wanted a dog and we couldn't because my dad was allergic sixteen years later we found out he wasn't allergic i love it to this day i love that my dad just point blank just lied to us for almost 20 years i said god bless dad and so now i will do the same thing um if my wife is listening i'm allergic as well it's tragic it's genetic so um but but um for the people who have pets it's hilarious they will literally spend anything so one of my good friends she said oh yeah like you know i find it difficult to spend stuff on myself but this new puppy like i don't care what it costs and they're getting this imported swiss meat or something like that for the dog i'm like you could feed can't you just feed a dog like what you know from costco or something and she's like no i said this is a great business so there are a variety of different models i've seen the box business which is amazing um there's decorative items for dogs which i love because the more unnecessary they are oftentimes the more profitable it can be right i don't you're not buying a luxury sweater because you need it you're buying it because you want it and price is largely irrelevant so if i knew anything about pets and had any interest whatsoever in pets i would definitely start a pet business i have a friend who sells dog vitamins and i asked him i go does it work he's like i don't know yeah yeah i'm like that's the greatest this is the greatest thing ever you have no i don't knows i should say that that idea and the next idea i'm gonna share with you uh the other thing i would have to have would be no ethics whatsoever because half these pet businesses are complete horseshit um but you know again i don't want to start it because i don't know anything and i also do have some morals around this but the pet vitamins i mean come on what is the dog giving you a report card oh i really feel my uh scoliosis went away thanks to this vitamin no all right what's next um cosmetics insatiable demand uh heavy rotation of using different types of face clean do you guys know you may not know as guys but do you know that there's different lotions for your hands feet forehead are you aware of this sam no i i i know we have different uh lotions for different skin color that's what we have at our house so i know that but i didn't know dude i haven't put lotion on in at least 16 years like it's been it has been 16 years since the last promotion see this is revelatory for the audience they're like what's lotion yeah there's and by the way there's more to cosmetics and skincare than lotion wait sean you don't wear lotion i thought that dark guys like you had to wear lotion never wear lotion don't choke your legs right now i want to see if they have little cracks on them i'm ashy and i'm proud of it look there's no there's no workshop bro you gotta lotion up come on dude do you do sunscreen white guys use sunscreen i don't use sunscreen typically uh it'll also uh you know this whole like the whole like nighttime skincare routine like you know i'm a toothbrush and out of there it's it's over oh i gotta tell you okay i gotta tell you my favorite part about nighttime skin routines this is my favorite thing on all of social media so you'll be following someone and someone will post a question to them uh oh my gosh your skin looks so good what's your what's your skin care routine and the person gets so excited they go oh i'm so glad you asked me well you know i like to really keep it simple i'm just i'm all into simplicity so here's what i do and then the 14 part process yeah they go well i start with a serum then i give it a 15 minute break i put on a lotion but then i put a cream on top you know then i take a little break and let it breathe then i use the brush and then i ice it out and then and then by lunch time you know i need to reapply and then they have 13 other parts for and i'm like do you understand that none of that is simple most most of the people i know are using like one proctor and gamble product if that on their body yeah three in one baby body shampoo conditioner yeah they're taking dove and putting it on every part of their body and they're like wow i really nailed it today so um i would do a cosmetics or skin care so these both people thought you said pets and cosmetics those are i'm with you insatiable demand like pricing sensitivity but obviously competitive so how do you think about going into a space that's like you're not the first person to think of cosmetics or pets so would you be looking for if you were going to approach this would you be looking for some unique angle that you feel is underserved or would you just say no [ __ ] i go i go swim it doesn't matter how many other people are fishing there there's enough fish where i just want to make it i just want to get my share i want a small slice of a big pie what how would you approach it packaging pricing and celebrities packaging is a huge tremendous part of it and i think there's some opportunities there pricing what do you mean what opportunities so i spoke to a guy who did a hair care product and and i was like how did you develop it he goes we basically went to a factory and we were like uh whatever it needs to fit this cost uh framework he didn't care so this is again why i say i would not get into this business if i had any morals which i do that's why i'm not doing it but i'm just telling you what he told me he goes yeah i don't we don't care what it is it needs to smell good but we spend 90 of the time on the packaging i go what let me get this straight you're basically selling like [ __ ] whatever yeah and but the packaging looks lush she goes yeah that's what the entire business is i go this is crazy then this so in terms of price well how big was that business or that entrepreneur like how big was their empire i i imagine they had a bunch of them yeah that's a good question i would say in the that's a good question if i had to guess in the 30 to 50 million dollar range by the last time i checked that was several years ago but you know i didn't ask so price price is you know you see people doing um boxes regular delivery upsells there's lots of innovative opportunities that i think digital um entrepreneurs are very very smart at in the old days it was put it on the shelf at cvs and hope somebody buys it and then comes back nowadays you can do some really clever stuff so i think that's an opportunity and then celebrity tie-ins who's known for having amazing skin and if you think back to those acne commercials remember proactive they had top tier celebrities so i got really curious how do they get these a level celebrities i started looking into it the answer is they just write them a humongous check so there's opportunities with celebrity tie-ins that for skin care again i am not trying to do this business myself i've just been fascinated with it and i would love to see how someone would come in here and disrupt what people are normally doing okay i like it and then did you have a third one kids anything on kids i mean it's uh wow talk about price insensitivity um again i don't want to do this business because i believe in less stuff for kids i think there's more meaningful ways um to parent but just imagine the kind of toys learning opportunities he's like etcetera for children could also talk he's like that's what a kid is [Laughter] yeah uh yeah so you know there's some really smart stuff around these areas but the key denominator on all these is insatiable demand that's the first place i look which is a little ironic because when i started i will teach you to be rich there's actually not that much demand for learning about money especially when i started it i focused on young people um so i but i didn't it wasn't a business when i started it was just like for fun over time i found that there is demand but you have to be very clever in how you reach people and what about uh money hacks so i i put down a thing on the notes i said i want to know you have all this like corpus of content you know just tons of tons of material philosophies frameworks tactics exercises blah blah blah what would be the three sort of money hacks that you think most people just don't do but if you could get them to do it you'd feel good about it so what are your kind of like what are your three finance related or money related um hacks that people should be doing that gets you a big app big outcome with not a huge input well i'm glad you asked because most of my founder friends don't even invest in the market i would say over fifty percent of that what what did you understand no what does that even mean that's so cra i that's so crazy to me i don't understand it well i'm about to tell you because these guys make me want to ring their neck so these are founders who have done very well in their business either they have a high profit business generating considerable amounts every year or um to some extent they've had an exit and now they're doing their next thing i go hey what are you doing with your money they go oh you know i'm putting it into my business i go cool like what about investing they go no no no i can make more money in the in my own business this is where my voice starts to tighten up and i bring out my hand as if i'm about to ring their neck i go how many businesses do you know that are still around 50 years later and they go well not many i go do you think it would be good to maybe take a little off the table and put some in the market where you can get really good returns and it just boggles their mind because they've never thought about they see themselves as an entrepreneur not a boring mom and pop investor that is a very very costly belief that they hold so i always tell them like hey take a little bit put in the market boring vanguard funds do the stuff of course they haven't read my book do the stuff in the book and when you do that you will be wealthier than you can possibly imagine and you your risk will be decreased dramatically um sean what do you think so i follow a lot of what you say i've read your book sarah my wife has read your book you're going to talk about like talking to your partner once a month things like that i do that all but i want to ask you sean investing in the market so sean and i are almost complete opposites when it comes to money not complete opposites for everything regarding money but our risk profiles are very different sean do you invest just in normal index funds at all yeah i have some in index funds uh i basically have a basket of technology companies that a few years ago i said okay what companies do i think over a 10 to 20 year period just have they have an advantage today that's just going to compound for 10 to 20 years and i'm happy if i'm wrong with that okay i'm wrong with that but i'm going to have this basket of basically six companies that i think um that i think are positioned to do that and that was like amazon it was google it wasn't like some i didn't take a genius right it was just like i think these companies essentially are monopolies that uh that are riding this wave of like the internet and mobile phones they'll do well and uh so i hold that so i'd say about 30 of my money is in that that selection of stocks i have probably one percent you can't import a camera or the import tax on a camera that can record above 60 minutes is taxed at a video camera versus a picture camera therefore you can't record for more than 60 minutes on a point-and-shoot camera are you kidding me this is crazy well sam much respect that was very now i just need you to tell me what to do about it but we can do that often yeah that was impressive yeah so basically what happened to listeners so it ramit's camera went off and this is like a weird fact but uh point and shoot cameras cannot record above 60 minutes because they would be taxed differently it went down even better he goes i know what happened uh we just hit 60 minutes didn't we yeah and you have a uh a point shoot camera don't you yeah it's from asia isn't it yeah and it's like oh [ __ ] sam i'm saying what are you doing how do you do all this sam was like mike wallace right there a lot of respect for you bro yeah well all right we went through this so sean you were saying that you have 30 percent in index funds where's the no not even index in a handful of tech stocks uh about six tech stocks and then i have about 40-ish percent in crypto i have a small amount maybe one percent two percent still left in a vanguard fund and then uh what's left uh then i have well i'm not counting just like investments in private businesses like startups and stuff that that would be different but yeah the rest is like cash and miscellaneous random other bets is that crazy do you remember that that's crazy to me i'm not disrespecting you sean because whatever floats your boat float your boat that's so different from how i how i do stuff it's like a guy going to a buffet okay and you both go to a buffet and then you go hey let's just let's meet up at the table so you get here you get some rice you get some chicken some vegetables and the other guy comes back with three different plates 90 of all the plates have chocolate cake on them and then he has two pieces of white fish and uh you know one piece of lobster that he cut in half and he threw the threw it on the floor you go what are you eating bro he goes that's what i like that's what why because it's not vanguard it out it's not indexed out is that why it's not even remotely of diversification now again if if you want to be entertained that's awesome it's very entertaining no i i don't uh i think diversification there's a great great diversification is for losers uh that's how i feel about diversification that's how most tech uh founders feel and the cost of their belief is vast it costs them typically millions and millions of dollars they don't care though this is my point sam it's it's not they don't care and i can angel invest i mean for me some of the greatest investors the greatest investors in the world do take concentrated positions not diversified positions so yeah are you one of the greatest investors in the world i know what i know in my sphere i'm an expert in my field and so i feel confident and comfortable investing in my field i'm not saying i'm one of the greatest investors in the world but i know that within the technology sector i would bet on myself and that's what i'm choosing to do right within the technology sector i don't i feel like i have an edge compared to uh what i can get sort of in the passively diversified index fund world yeah right now your last 10 years i've compounded way faster than you know the vanguard etf or s sp500 generically has your strategy for me i am the exact same as you i'm looking at my portfolio now it's basically 90 index funds or it includes hubspot stock which is not indexed but it's it's 90 publicly traded stock most of which is is is is index funds but what bothers me or me not bothers me it just shocks boggles my mind about you how can you not see that there is another way to do it which are the crazy people like sean when you and i both have tons of friends that are these crazy people that have made these ridiculous bets where they only have 100 grand they put 90 grand into crypto and it turns into 100 million dollars like you and i know many of these people have done these stupid things or they appear stupid and they totally work out um well there's definitely lots of different ways to achieve it so you know when i talk about my book there's there's lean fire there's fat fire there's buying real estate there's passive investing and on and on so um if you are optimizing for entertainment great if you're optimizing for concentrated risk great then that portfolio makes a lot of sense if you are optimizing for a diversified low-cost predictable return and mitigating risk then of course that allocation makes exactly zero sense so we want to know the game that we are playing and sean you you articulated it very well what i think the next question that a savvy investor would ask is what are the risks that i am incurring and this is typically where you get people especially a lot of crypto bros who go oh like what do i care i'm swinging for the fences and you go okay that's cool what if it goes wrong now if you're 21 uh you know your risk profile is low right worst case you know you get a job et cetera et cetera if you're older if you have kids if you have a mortgage or if you simply do not want to go back to living on ramen noodles then suddenly you start to think about risk differently now here's the catch most people doesn't matter if they're 35 or 50 they don't truly understand risk until something bad happens and when that happens they do not take a look in the mirror and go oh [ __ ] my allocation that i chose 15 years ago was poor they go [ __ ] the government or they ripped me off i need regulation even though i called for no regulation for the last 15 years so unfortunately this is one of those things that cannot be taught until it is experienced and the market will go down tech will not always go up this is a predictable cycle the last 10 years have been extraordinary there's no doubt about that even an index investor made over 15 annualized returns which is insane but the music doesn't keep playing i agree with you i i strongly disagree with people uh look like hold on hold on it's there's no right answer without saying what are you trying to do right what is your goal because if my goal is to make x and your goal is to make y then we're going to have totally different strategies like a different strategy would work for a different person what is your question i say i'm comfortable with this much risk or i have it i have knowledge about this industry maybe my answer would be different or maybe my strategy would be different um do you think our goals are different yeah i think our goals are different for sure what's your goal not just not just the absolute money goal right clearly our goals are different because you you intentionally avoid risk right like you know the appeal of a lot of these investments so you don't want to lose right you your risk tolerance is lower and you are you are you would feel worse if you lost then you would feel good if you win and i'm the opposite i would feel worse if i didn't follow my convictions than if i but what's your goal like is there a point where you'll say i'm gonna i'm gonna i don't want to take more risk yeah of course over time it'll shift right as the as the principal gets large enough then you don't need to have so much concentration because you can have more you can play play it safer and you can take a smaller a lower return will still yield it will still let you live a lifestyle that you want but if the principal's small and you're trying to live off four percent gains or five percent gains or seven percent annual gains um you're gonna have to sit there for 40 years and like i'm just not interested in doing that and i think another thing is like what's your other situation is like how much income do you bring out i bring in a lot of income so i'm not really worried about okay what happens if the market goes down either temporarily or even permanently it's like if i'm bringing in a healthy income and i'm young i don't really have to worry too much about protecting this investment asset first i can play riskier than my dad who no longer can generate significant income and he needs to play it safer i think yeah we have different we have different we have different goals yeah i think um if you if you look at bodybuilders for example who are competitive eventually all roads lead to chicken and rice all roads lead to chicken and rice why because when you look at macronutrients and when you look at where you're getting the highest bang for your buck all professional bodybuilders essentially eat the same okay i'm being a little general here but that's the case when you look at investing if you look at the research and yes you clarify your goals but um remember that in investing a lot of people go personal finance is personal actually most people are mostly the same let me say that again most people are mostly the same they mostly want to make good money be able to travel a little bit etc so unless you are a wild outlier then all roads lead to low-cost long-term investing again there are outliers sean it sounds like you've thought that through but the principles of chicken and rice and low-cost investing are the same now what are those principles i talked about that in chapter six you know there's a lot of people tossing around these things about well you know i chose this because like the market went down a little bit so i put my money in here and like over time all those timing the market things have been blown out there are the rare exceptions who win uh sam you were referring to that you know we know some people who have won yeah you know we also know a lot of people who lost a lot of money and they disappear they don't brag about their russian fund that they picked anymore that's called survivorship bias so it's important that we know the entire game of play and then we choose otherwise it's very emotionally tempting to be like i'm a genius i have an edge etc but we have to all remember we are individual investors and even the pros who do this for a living with a bunch of other smart people and expensive technology they fail to beat the market 80 plus percent of the time what are your money rules you talk about you need to have money rules what are yours uh i have 10 money rules i'll share some of them so the easy ones are things like always have a year of emergency uh fund cash okay that's sort of a simple one invest 20 of gross income minimum that's an easy one if you can't do twenty percent do start with five percent right but the the important thing is pick a number and automate it that's critical then the lar the the different ones for me my money rules are things like um never question spending on books appetizers health or a friend's charity fundraiser so that's unlimited i have unlimited spend on that and why like why am i talking about appetizers it's meaningful to me when i was a kid we couldn't afford to eat appetizers now when i go out and eat with a friend i'm like whatever looks good just order it right we can we can get everything here and then it gets a little bigger you know business class on flights over four hours that's a rule i don't have to debate it or think about it it's just boom it's done and be able to pay in full for large expenses like a wedding a honeymoon even a house doesn't mean i have to pay in full i could finance it if the interest is low or whatever but for the largest most important purchases in my life i don't want cost to be a factor now if you're listening to this some of these sound totally bewildering maybe even ridiculous okay uh that's the point my money rules are mine they are not applicable to most people most people don't care about appetizers and most people can't buy a house all cash that's okay what i want to encourage you to do is to really write down your money rules instead of having to make a thousand decisions every month about money boil it up roll it up to the things that are meaningful and you'll notice on my money rules which you can just google ramit's money rules that the classic mistake people make i say hey what are your money rules and they're all restrictive never spend on premium this never do that never done enough i go okay okay it's okay to have a couple restrictive rules you know you want to save you want to invest but let's also make some rules that are fun money is supposed to be fun it's not about cutting back on lattes it's about living a rich life sam do you have those yeah i have those written down or just kind of like intuited like you know i kind of live by these or have you like actually sat down and said these are mine well so when i um was 25 i made a list maybe i was 22. i made a list i said here's how much money i want to have by the age of 30. here's how much i want to spend each month here's what i want to purchase like the spending that i the budget that i made each month was based off of what i wanted to own and what i wanted to do and so i had this i had similar rules written down where it was basically uh anything health related i in book and books um i don't look at the i don't look at the price i just buy whatever i want um i did not have any rules towards charity although that's changing i do i need to get into that um but yeah i had like i worked backwards i had like a target number based off of one i wanted to spend each month and i wanted to be able to um hit that tar i wanted to be able to make that just off of uh my gains like my my passive income from index fund investing uh and i wanted to be able to withdraw only three percent of that per year in order to pay for my monthly expenses and i and i made that all up when i was like 22 23 24. i forget the exact number but by the way when people say that oh i want to withdraw four percent do they actually withdraw do you actually like me do you actually sell down four percent of your uh whatever your your index funds are or whatever to pay for your lifestyle or do is that just a theoretical thing like i can i could fund this off just the gains you know just a portion of the of the of the annual gains well i don't use a drawdown i'm not in the de-accumulation phase so i have an income but eventually one day yeah and in fact do people do that yeah every retiree does that de-accumulation is done by tens of millions of people they sell off a little bit every single year if they've got it and that's how they fund themselves that's why it's called a fixed income and there's but but there's other there's there's other ways you could do it so for example i just invested into this real estate fund um what's the it's a big it's a big one called oak tree or something uh and then blackrock or what's it blackstone what's the big the big the big you know the big guy it's like the it's like the trillion dollar real estate thing everyone has access to it and anyway it pays i think a six and a half to seven percent dividend quarterly and you can live off that um if you put you know a fair bit yeah sean's a good question there are other ways too so dividends are one another thing that really wealthy investors will do is they'll simply take loans against their yes that's that's kind of what i was talking about was like talk about that for a minute because you're not paying tax on the like you sell your [ __ ] or you take a dividend you're gonna pay tax so you're six percent is not six percent but correct if you you know if you live off your loans you keep your assets compounding that seems smarter to me the the blown thing is the craziest thing that i've i've just recently learned about this it is it's taken me so long to grasp this because it goes against everything that i thought was true so basically it's illegal it feels illegal so basically when you get to like i don't know what the number is there's some number where you can start borrowing money from big banks right now i think what's the rate like my rate is one point one percent one percent yeah it's crazy okay and so the the bankers was like yeah look like and i like built a widget so i could like look at it so let's just i'm just going to use a bunch of made up numbers so let's just say that you have uh 10 million dollars in a equity fund okay you could borrow i believe if you have index fund up to 70 of that so you can borrow seven million dollars and there's the the way the math works and it's different for each person based off of the stocks that you own but basically you can withdraw let's say 30 percent in the uh 30 of your 7 million and the market would have to drop by like 68 70 percent in order for you to even have to pay back anything otherwise you could basically have that outstanding forever and it's only extruding interest at a one percent rate and you could use that money to live off of or you can use that money to invest in other stuff it's astounding to me am i am i remember you have a smirk on your face am i am i getting this wrong well i have a i was born with a smirk on my face so let's just i'm smiling inside but i just look like this so you in general you are right in general you are right it is almost unbelievable the average investor does not have um the ability to do this they have access to it they just don't have enough money for it but i do want to point one thing out a lot of these seemingly too good to be true things have sprung up and become popularized in the last 10 years is there anything else that might have been going on in the financial markets for the last decade maybe that would have enabled these things to become popular such as a record-breaking bull market and historical low interest rates yes so you we need to put this in context of history yeah you can borrow at one percent rate but if go talk to your parents ask them what their mortgage rate was when they bought a house in the 80s yeah but these but these rates are based what's it called the london what's it called the libor i forget what libor stands for but dude i believe i went and i think the i think libor has only been around since the 50s but since the 50s i think the highest has ever been is three and a half percent i that's interesting i have to look at that i'm not sure about that is it fixed or variable it's variable so that's why it's dangerous yeah yes that's my point sam let's talk about the danger so again i don't know if it has to drop by 68 the banks can call in their loan once it breaks a threshold so all of this is amazing until it's not and so you i don't mean to be the sort of luddite here or the the boring voice and this is unfortunately what sensible investors get thrust into when there's an insane bull market you have guys like me coming and saying hey it's cool you want to put 5-10 percent of your money in some alternative investment awesome but remember this doesn't always last forever i've seen it myself three times in my life and i'm not even 40 years old i've seen in the 2000 crash 2008 and yeah you could say march 2020 that was temporary but people are real tough until things go wrong and suddenly you see people lose fortunes when i went to omaha to see warren buffett at his conference one of the things that he and charlie munger said was we set up berkshire so we can never run out of money and to me that is way more inspirational than i eked out an extra 1.5 return at a much higher risk rate so i want everybody to know the game they're playing do you want to get uh 10 or 14 compounded annualized uh return rates you can it's possible you'll take on a massive amount of risk and when you you think about it it reminds me of what my trainer said right we were starting to lift heavier and heavier and i was like oh so like how heavy should we go and he goes you know at a certain point you really want to ask yourself do you need to put on that extra plate if you're competing maybe but there's a risk that you're suddenly taking and we need to not just think about returns 14 we need to think about what can go wrong as well and for a lot of people they have never done what you did sam they never sat out and plotted out how much money they don't even know what they want to do with their money and so i want people to think a little more deeply this is one of the most important things in your life and for most people you will find that if they get a nice simple eight percent annualized return rate over time and they continue contributing they actually have more money than they know what to do with it takes time yes but i i want to challenge people to really think about this sensible yeah i think one of the good things about what you do but also one of the disconnects between what we talk about is um your message to help a mass number of people as you have is a most people message what i call a most real message you're trying to find the advice that you can give that if most people took it would actually help them out and they may not have an outlier in either direction negative or extreme positive and so you have most people advice our podcast our broadcast is the exact opposite our target audience is for people who are trying to escape most people results they are trying to have a sort of out how do you have a disproportionately outsized positive result whether it's because you built a schedule i think that's a good clarification i will say i think you earn the right to have an outlier result it is you hear stories about oh let's do this startup and we'll make 10 million dollars or 50 million great those are extremely rare and um instead my approach is layer it so as i talk about and i will teach bridge it's not just about personal finance about a rich life start off get your diversified portfolio never worry about that again right i spend less than one hour per month on my finances then you want more start a business right make a huge profitable business or if you want to do a venture back business great but you earn the right to be an outlier it is extremely rare and very unlikely that someone's just like oh i have this cool idea for a dog business i'm gonna make 50 million bucks that's my personal philosophy right and i think the the bodybuilder analogy you said earlier is correct but it's actually a different point of what you're making which is most people don't want to be bodybuilders bodybuilder diet is actually chicken rice and hgh right and and there's going to be a lot of a lot of downsides to the amount of you know stuff they're shooting into their body but they need to do it because that is that game that is a specific game same thing with venture back startups venture back startups is not just even business it's the olympics of business right it's basically saying billion dollars a bus that's what you're signing up for that's why it's really easy to to [ __ ] on it or call out fairly that hey don't get caught up in the hype there are many other ways to win that are often like easier more pleasurable and whatnot but like that is the olympics and that's why it gets celebrated right we celebrate michael phelps even though it took immense sacrifice for him to go earn those eight medals like you know he swam you know six hours a day and eight twenty thousand calories a day because that's what it took to compete at that level and so i think it's important for people to figure out what is the what is the advice they want to take like um i always say this thing i say i don't most people don't have good results uh which is basically you know most marriages and divorce most people are are overweight most if you just follow what most people do you will get the results that most people are getting right now which is not very not really lined up with what people want which is to be you know fit happy and successful and um and so you have to kind of figure that out and i would say we're pretty aligned on that i think what you what you offer is a path that will work for almost anybody and what we sometimes talk about is a path that won't work for most people but for the few people who it will work for it'll work in a big way and so it's like two kind of different two different ends of the same thing yeah i think that's an interesting approach uh a different interesting distinction to make between the two approaches sam what do you think you've been in both worlds yeah i so i kind of do this thing where i put i like to have i like to have i don't even know what i call it but basically if everything goes to [ __ ] i'm okay so i i like to have this base of security this this this fortress of [ __ ] you and uh i like to have that and then anything above that i go incredibly balls to the wall totally risky with sam we're the same i have what i call the tripod of stability right where i where i work or sorry where i live uh these sort of basic fundamentals health relationships that's all dialed in it's relatively conservative but then it allows me to be risk seeking on certain things like oh let me try this random podcast with no business model whatsoever or let me try this experimental program uh et cetera et cetera so i like that but again we need to know who what game we're playing and who we are right all things you know what does mike tyson say everybody's got to play until they get punched in the face everyone's an investment champ until the market goes down and in order to see evidence of this all you need to do is go to any investment forum including fat fire lean fire any fire even the boba heads for them and cycle back to what happened in 2008 cycle back to what happened in march 2020 and you will or my favorite is go to the crypto subreddits and you'll see people all the bravado fades away and they go oh my god i just lost my kids college fund you do not want to be in that position ever on the other hand you can make a lot of money if you have a sensible investment or even a risk seeking investment so but i think i think wow i think what you and i slightly differ go different paths for me is well i don't know if it's entirely true but basically i see i have i've got so many friends that like if i told you what they do well you you're in the world so you know but if i told my parents what they do they'd be like this is [ __ ] nuts and and and they would be like what are you talking about like sean is like that a lot of me and sean's friends the guy sean used to work for michael birch was like that like you are [ __ ] crazy this is nutty this is not gonna work i have so many friends who they have made it work and i and i understand that in order to have outsized results you have to do some wacky ass [ __ ] sometimes and i accept that you have to you have to be weird i accept also that i'm not like that the other thing i'll point out is it is not always true that to get more reward you take more risk there are moments in time and a wise good investor eventually identifies these and it takes time to develop this judgment there are times where you can take low risk bets that have disproportionate rewards and they're not often and it's easy to talk yourself into thinking that everything is like that but uh but you know sometimes there's this myth that oh if you want rewards you have to take massive proportional risk and it's not always proportional and uh and those are actually the best opportunities those are the those are the ones that you should be like pouncing on and maybe to others it looks like you're doing something crazy but if you have accurately assessed it you may find that it was actually not as high risk but still high reward the way you do stuff sean i think it's just like the way that i view it it's like i think it's crazy and but i accept that your returns might be massive yeah that's a good way to put it i mean everybody's playing their game right but you but to assess it you need to assess it over the correct period of time and with the correct goals in mind sam you might be like ah you know let's fast forward maybe two kids not gonna do that sean might say i don't care or i put some money in the bank etc there's a whole bunch of ways to evaluate it but i i appreciate that sean there definitely different perspectives and i appreciate hearing you know what game you are optimizing for i think that that makes sense yeah and what i would encourage anyone to do is i would actually start with your stuff and learn learn the fundamentals it's like okay i yeah i sometimes do some street [ __ ] but like you know you can only do that once you first understand the fundamentals you do them for a while and then you start to identify okay where do i want to if i am going to stray from the pack right if i am going to not play by the book i better have a really strong reason to do so i'm going to have some like some real conviction a real knowledge a real point of view that i am willing and i'm i'm i actually understand what the heck i'm doing and i understand that the the the risks that i am taking with when i take those risks right so you want to start there not start with oh i saw this dude on reddit did this thing and uh so i'm gonna go yolo that same trade and i don't even know what the hell i'm actually doing yeah whatever you see on reddit you should immediately close that window and never listen to any financial advice on that [ __ ] site listen you need to be able to answer some basic questions if you want to do all this risk seeking stuff you know um what is diversification mean what is the typical asset allocation for a 40 year old and why where does this 8 return per year come from where's what is that what's the rule of 72 when is my debt going to be paid off um what do i actually want to do with my money if i have 500k a million 5 million if you can't answer these questions you are not ready to begin taking all this uh astronomical risk again none of this matters because none of these people are listening to me right now they shut this off two hours ago they're like [ __ ] this old guy risk see i'm a risk seeker he's so whole no you will time will tell but i would strongly encourage you to be able to answer some of these basic questions before you choose your own path and many times what i find is people start off they're really gung-ho they get into this they're like oh [ __ ] this is actually really easy i spend less than an hour a month my money's growing like crazy i don't have to worry about it ever again we're going to be multi-millionaires let me go live my life that's way more exciting than optimizing some [ __ ] 0.5 return sam you know i've been telling you about this too that's why i told you stop talking about your 3 drawdowns like that's all great when you're 21 and it's cool now let's talk about where are you going on vacation that is way more interesting you told me where to go i booked my tickets i had my european trip planned it got canceled because of delta but i do what you say by the way let me share your side of the story on the engagement ring you gave sam some advice on the engagement ring okay so you know sam uh sam is a very good listener sam i have to say i appreciate you you you ask for advice which is rare and you listen so i'm always like yeah let's talk so he comes he he's telling you about you know he's gonna propose and you know i i got married three years ago so i went through the whole process and i got very deep into um the whole wedding thing and all that stuff and people like oh was was your wife like a um bridezilla i was like if anyone was going to be a zilla it was going to be this groom zilla right here because i knew like all that i was loving so just a couple contexts part of my philosophy is save for the big things before you need them because you know that they're going to happen most people are going to be married so i started saving putting money away from my wedding uh and my honeymoon like in my 20s before i even met my wife why because i knew it was going to happen one day and i wanted to have an awesome wedding a awesome ring awesome honeymoon again my own philosophy for you important things in life i don't want to have to look at the price okay so a lot of people like that's crazy why would i start saving when i'm not even in a relationship that's weird i go what's weird is to get to your wedding planning and not have enough money or um you know basically just have to make all these short-term decisions some people go into debt for their wedding i don't believe in it i want you to have an amazing extravagant wedding if that's what you want or a beautiful honeymoon or whatever i i want you to be start planning early so sam comes to me he goes hey i'm thinking of getting this uh thing i said oh cool you know how are you thinking about it and he tells me yeah i have this like budget in mind so i said yeah thank you i was like you i was like no you're gonna spend more than that now why did i say that to him because i know how much money he has okay and i know that there are certain benchmarks and certain numbers that if he had if he was a school teacher and he told me five grand i would say oh my god that's amazing like she's gonna love it and then i went a little deeper because sam got very quiet sam knew he was being cheap but he didn't know how to articulate he had a lot of emotions running through his body i said sam let me ask you a couple questions because he started off with this utilitarian silicon valley he goes oh you know what all you guys already know the argument oh i don't believe in diamonds it's all made up it's so fake well why don't we just get this [ __ ] you know and i'm like okay sam let me ask you a question um does your fiance care about rings no no no no she's not that kind of person i said oh okay okay hey out of curiosity does she have a pinterest board he goes oh yeah i go what's on that pinterest board relating to rings oh she's been like tracking rings for like the last 15 years and goes damn have you talked to her about this he goes well she did mention that she kind of wants like and then he breaks down like the entire thing of what kind of ring she wants you can afford it this is important to her this is not about you and your dumb vision as a 21 year old utilitarian it's about what your future wife for the rest of your life wants this one thing and sam was awesome sam you listened you were like oh like he never thought about it like that because it's all tech bros into someone who actually you know is like let's talk about the softer side and it was awesome sam take it from there what happened when you went to get that ring i'll yeah i'll say i i i i was going to spend five grand i was like i i i can't do this anymore and i ended up i think i spent a lot 28 29 30 000 but it's not about the money sam it's not about the money what why don't you matter bro do you want the details of the story people want to know you're right right they want the details of the story i've given the details of the story and looking back the money it didn't matter at all and she was incredibly happy and i felt so proud dude my man so i'm i'm happy for you i'm happy for your wife i i actually i'm glad you mentioned the numbers and you guys are awesome on this podcast you're always mentioning numbers which is very rare so i love it but what i want to emphasize is that at a certain point it's actually not about the dollar value and people particularly entrepreneurs and particularly tech guys are obsessed with monetization they're always talking about numbers yeah you should know your numbers yes but their a rich life is so much more than your numbers just think about this when you went home to visit your parents and you hugged your mom or your dad did you think about oh how much is this costing me in my hourly rate oh how much did my mom pay for that chicken because we could get it cheaper at costco no the most important thing in life are actually not quantifiable so what i want to emphasize is that we are we're taught from day one and i started a silicon valley tech company we raised money i've done all this stuff so i know what i'm talking about we are taught that quantifying is the most important thing you do what are your metrics what's your attribution what's your conversion rate that's all we talk about and yet in the most important things in life sitting outside on a picnic with our kids going being able to extend your lunch on a weekday with your friend from college who just happens to be in money is irrelevant the number is irrelevant being able to do it is rich and so for sam sam i [ __ ] love it you did it the money part irrelevant you had the money you could do it more important was recognizing my wife wants this it's important to her and i'm gonna rewrite my old story from when i was 21 into a new man and a new partner and i'm going to use some of my resources to do it and that that is connective and amazing well thank you and and we'll have to end with that beautiful uh that beautiful little monologue there you're the man what's the name of the podcast again i will teach you to be rich with ramit sethi and uh i'm looking it up now we're gonna link to it um thanks dude this is awesome but you have a a link that you go to too right yeah you can go to iwt.com podcast or it's on apple or spotify well thanks man this is awesome what do you say sean yeah thanks for coming on sam i think you and sarah should go on his pod and be one of the couples i'm down i'm down that would make me uncomfortable but i would do it [Music] let's travel never looking back

if you can't make the economics of an ad channel exciting can you at least a not burn money while b building a huge lead database that that likes you because your free thing or your cheap thing i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back i'm actually uh i'm surprised you haven't been on this before i feel like i feel like you're made for this in a way maybe i mean i was doing pods for a while like i was trying like purposely to get on podcasts for like indie hackers yeah for like getting the word out about demand curve then at some point i'm like this is cringe man like i don't like listening back to myself and so it took the process of actually starting a podcast uh you know in part thanks to also watching you do your your magic to be like you know what i can just totally be myself not to worry about it as much and then it stopped being cringed so now i'm all for it and how how has it been since you launched the pod so you launched uh what's called brains right brains with the s or without the s yeah brains with the s it's been good it's been i guess it is rare to have reasons in your life to be very seriously self-reflective about whether or not you're boring the [ __ ] out of people it's like i have to be so deliberate about can i be charismatic can i be interesting and i'm not saying i'm there yet but i'm saying i'm at least thinking about it you know in in the context of trying to not bore people on a podcast so it's been a really good forcing function okay i like that and uh has it been so you launched this podcast you did it very methodically you recorded like eight episodes with badass people ahead of time and uh so i feel like you were pretty thorough about how you went about it or more so than me at least um did it go the way you wanted to or where did you learn yeah i was thorough because i felt that i kind of had no choice because i listened to a bunch of podcasts and found most of them to be like unlistenable right and then when i heard my first million i'm like there's something special here but i don't actually know what it is and so my co-host on the podcast cortland from indie hackers he's like what's going on here that special is they're not asking boring interview questions they're literally just riffing on ideas collaboratively and making charged statements and letting other people respond to them and the net effect is it feels way more like rapport like a dinner conversation you're overhearing so we really rolled with that and then we try to be deliberate about well how do we choose guests that can actually play into that can they speak spontaneously are they willing to play ball and bad ideas around right so i feel like it's probably a lot of the stuff that you're thinking about as well and yeah it's been it's been great so we're basically you know in a way we're my first million but for everything outside of business like writing a book being a storyteller you know what i mean yeah the episode i was on had uh uh alexandra botez i don't know how you say her name actually how do you say it properly that's right example because she got it chess champion uh twitch streamer so she's like content creator really interesting person her content is about chess because she's really damn good at chess um and so i found it pretty interesting like that was not what like i've been on a bunch of podcasts that's not usually what i get to to talk about or talk to and uh so i immediately was pretty bought in just as i kind of guessed on it but anyways i wanted to have you on here because uh this is you know the pod for ideas and i feel like you have a lot of interesting ideas and also see a lot of interesting ideas and for people who don't know we're in a group chat together and being in a group chat is like the closest thing to being in a dorm together i feel you get to know people over time you get to see them walking around in their boxers you know you you just you're going to the shared bathroom together there's no place to run you're going to be yourself over in enough time in the right group chat so i feel like i've gotten to know you even though we have never met in person uh but you are an ideal person do you consider yourself an ideal person um i see i think of myself as someone who just loves to brainstorm but i'm not as fixated on ideas i think as you are like i know you and sam love the treasure hunt you love the chase like who's making money how i'm more like all right give me a problem i want to solve the problem and so what i did for this show actually is i went through the community of my startup we have about 40 000 marketers and and founders and so i picked out the three most interesting growth trends i could find and i came with some examples of each of those trends so there were like three things that were popping out that felt almost like cheat codes like ways that startups were printing cash and reaching unicorn status much quicker than one would think they should okay so that's something we can jam on i got a few three categories there we can jam on if you like yeah let's do that right now don't even say anything else besides that i'm i'm completely i'm completely hooked let's do that all right all right so okay let's kick it off with this first category so i'm going to give these funny names because i don't have good names for them so category one is give customers an absolute no-brainer so there's two ways to give them a no-brainer that i've seen in the community no-brainer number one is you literally give them away money in a way that's economically sustainable which we'll get into right another no-brainer way is make the friction so crazy low that people are like ah [ __ ] it i'll just click the button one time and get this installed so let's walk through examples of what i mean by that so starting with giving away money there was this product a long time ago called service and what they did is they would give you money back any time that your flight was delayed if a few conditions were true because there was this lesser-known loophole in the contracts of airlines where for loyalty reasons they wanted to have a policy to give flyers some money back if their site was delayed you just have to do the paperwork and request it and nobody ever did it exactly right no one wanted the friction so service is like hey we'll automate we'll create like a va army we'll file the paperwork for you you just give us your itinerary we're literally giving you cash almost literally because it's like credit so the reason this was so clever is for a very simple reason it wound up creating some of the world's best performing ads because when you made ads on facebook that were something like hey did you know the airlines will pay you up to a hundred bucks whenever you're delayed the click-through rates on those ads were astronomical the cost per click were super low and they were able to yeah to just skyrocket to millions and ad spend monthly very quickly and let me give you a couple more examples because this is actually something more than just service could do so another interesting example is a recent yc company and they're called yada so yada does is they'll take your money just go to normal bank they'll take your money you know they'll manage savings but because they're so low overhead they they redistribute all of that extra potential margin into lottery winnings for their bank customers so just by having more money in yada they are going to give you tickets to this vert to this real lottery that they run every single week they give away millions and you just you're automatically entered just due to some income no no loss so imagine no loss lotteries called right yeah exactly and just imagine their ads like just think about how compelling it is to position that to a lot of people who either love the lottery or just really want a way to make extra cash so a couple more examples if it's helpful for me to run through here we got main street that's when you said it that's the one that came to mind as soon as you said give you know basically giving away money i thought of main street as a company that's growing fast doing this it's brilliant right and so so explain explain what it is if people don't know so they're basically running ads i'll come at it from the perspective of what is the ad because that's the whole perspective of this chat it's like what's the growth right so the ad main street can run to people is did you know that you're not taking advantage of an extra say ten thousand dollars in tax credits every year for your business it's like whoa if i'm a small business making it month to month that's huge and so again they found a business model that can act as a means to at least optically without being a scam either give you like free money in a sense or credit back and it functions as the ultimate acquisition wedge in a sense which then becomes how they grow so darn quickly and so the question is how do these companies make money and this brings us to this idea of like having a wedge in the growth world we talk about wedges or even investing and if you can just use one of these products as a means to collect emails and happy customers very quickly then it's a wedge into building a customer base that you can monetize through other revenue streams if not that one revenue stream itself right yeah i like that a lot and there was another one that was doing this um or do not pay is another one that does this right they uh i think i don't remember how they started if it was them or somebody else there was another one that was like the flight flight cancellation payback there was one that was hey did you get a parking ticket in san francisco we'll fight it for you so just send us a picture of the ticket we will fight it for you did you know that you know 4 out of 10 tickets are filled out incorrectly and are therefore invalid even if you were in the wrong the cop filled it out wrong and therefore you don't have to pay a dime we we will find these opportunities for you and you only pay us out of the savings of whatever money we save you we'll take 20 of whatever money we give back to you um and i thought wow that's actually like a great idea and it got so popular that san francisco banned them um you know pretty quickly after a few months because it was like being used so much same with service by the way service the airlines were like what what the hell is going on here and they just shut it they like close they started tightening up the policy and so sometimes that actual wedge can be a very flimsy one yeah but if you if you ran away with happy customers who now trust you for other products then maybe it was still an okay one so i wouldn't necessarily recommend these flimsy unsustainable channels but but main street does not seem flimsy to me right on paper another great example i'll give you one last one because it's my favorite because it's under everybody's noses which is if you look at the top of buildings when you're driving around you have those clear view you know these billboard ads and so imagine being a business owner and someone comes to you and says hey i'm going to pay you let's say 50 grand a year all you got to do is put this billboard on your roof right i'm sure it's much more complicated than that but the idea is that sometimes when you get pitched with a revenue stream that's super low friction for you that you did not realize is possible it just becomes a crazy growth wedge yeah that's yeah and there's you could basically create value out of thin air just by just just by knowing the rules of connecting the dots i feel this way about there's some bigger businesses that do this principle um one for student loan refinancing it's just like hey you're paying too much just tell us what you pay today and we will find you a cheaper student loan you just click a button and and boom you change to this monthly payment instead of this one i think uh common bond or something like that is one of those and house refinancing is another but these require it's not as they can't do the whole thing on your behalf unfortunately but i'm i feel like somebody could get closer to doing the whole thing on your behalf um and that seems like a pretty big opportunity to me absolutely and what this actually speaks to is this larger trend of can you think of your product roadmap if you're starting a business in unison with your growth roadmap because everything we've just been discussing is basically a product feature it's not like you're just running ads in a silo you're running ads because you have this way of giving away money or at least the optically giving way money so i tell founders sometimes can you think of the feature list on your product roadmap can you reprioritize it such that it facilitates growth strategies like these and that can guide you for growing a lot quicker as opposed to just you know living in a local maximum running in circles and so because we're ultimately talking about the idea like a trojan horse here for acquiring customers in a non-scammy and authentic way where you're really offering value so the other half of this by the way is this idea is mentioning of super low friction so this we're still under this category of giving customers an absolute no winner no brains exactly how do you become a no-brainer where it's like i don't have to think about this so second sub-category so first was giving away money second is super low friction so let me give you an example chrome extensions are maybe my favorite example because if we think of honey right which gives you it's a chrome extension that as you browse the web it surfaces discounts on whatever you're browsing right right you're looking at a chair it'll say you didn't know this but you can get 20 off so that's brilliant because the chrome extension is like a two-click process from being part of your internet browsing experience for until the rest of time until you delete the extension right it's so low friction you don't have to sign up you don't have to add a credit card you don't have to give any of your data verified via two-factor authentication verify your email address none of it you don't even have to remember to open the app right that's most apps you just person just forgets to open you ever again but with chrome extension they're opening chrome they already have that habit you just get to tag along like a little you know like the flea on an elephant's back exactly that's right and so if you can find a way to make something so painless where it's like two clicks i didn't forget it the idea is that now you're around now you have a bunch of exposure opportunities you keep popping up when relevant on web pages that the user is browsing and eventually when the time is right and you can deliver real value like contextually because like this is going to be a monster coupon i could give the customer we're going to save them a thousand bucks right that's when you finally ask hey can you make an account real quick before we give you this monster coupon and now they're completely bought in and they've come to trust you yeah that's smart what other chrome extension ideas uh have you have you seen that you like or you have like what else is like honey does anything come to mind i know it's a hard question but what else is like honey yeah it is a tough question but one good example is extensions in the seo space that give you data about web pages yeah the competitive analysis as you're browsing so that if you are a marketer you can get this like x-ray vision into how are they growing right what are they what keyword terms and all this stuff right so it winds up educating you to better grow your business and becomes very sticky if that date is valuable um what which which chrome extensions which chrome extensions do you have installed i have similar web which is what you're talking about basically gives me traffic information about different websites so i can see how popular they are and where the traffic comes from i have meta mask which is a you know an ethereum wallet uh or a crypto wallet and then i have adblock those are the three chrome extensions i have and i'm very particular about chrome extensions because when you install a chrome extension it says this extension can read everything you type into any website i'm like wow that's so insecure that's crazy what do you have installed yeah so nothing exciting i got my ad block i got the thing that tells me if i'm on a website that had their passwords sort of broken into so it'll tell me if i should switch my password you know um and then i have um uh oh this awesome twitter extension that when i'm looking at someone's twitter profile it'll show me all their historical best performing tweets so i get like a snapshot view of who they are and what they're known for it's called t-w-e-m-e-x like twee max i like that that's pretty cool i was thinking there could be a couple others like uh while you were saying that i was thinking what other x-ray you said extra vision i like that so i was like what x-ray vision would i want as i browse the web so one is just taking uh like the twitter thing but sort of like anytime someone's name is on a web page if i just hover can i just pop out a thing that basically tells me about that person it's like here's you know here's the twitter profile you can click follow here are some things about them here's the wiki or whatever so it's like you know the quick who is this on any name on any website that's one the other is um facebook ads so i i'm constantly going to the facebook ad library to find what ads a company is running i actually just want that done automatically so i just want to go to any products website any any company's website and be able to click this and see what ads they're running without having to go open up the ad library yeah i love that the um the way i think about this this type of a question is like what type of chrome extension or like what's the framework for thinking about which category of chrome extension would be the stickiest and would people love to download the most and i think about how to appeal device like how do i appeal to people's desire to make money and so where my brain goes right away is what about some sort of x-ray vision where you're on like bloomberg or you're on twitter anytime the chrome extension picks up a keyword for a public stock or like some crypto token right cryptocurrency then it just suggests um like it gives you an x-ray into like how it's performing who else talks about it a lot who should you fall to learn more about this right and that then it kind of triggers more so like this greedy like okay well i can make money off this so i'm gonna pay a bit more attention because when you do the educational route really with any tool okay let's give x-ray vision let people know like amazon's x-ray vision when you're watching a movie it'll tell you like what music is playing in the background who are these actors like do people really care i mean maybe some but it's probably nerds yeah yeah the the the one more on this is uh that i was just thinking of while you're browsing websites if it basically could you create robinhood in a chrome browser a chrome extension i think you could so you could basically have it be like acorns where it sort of rounds up on anything you buy and then it buys either a fraction of that stock or it adds up until you it tells you hey you've been shopping a lot on apple why don't you buy a hundred dollars of apple stock click here to do it and maybe there's a way to kind of like use that roundup model to get you to own instead of just being a customer and not owning any of the underlying company in which case you could so i think this is one interesting idea is just look at every app on your phone and say could this be a chrome extension how would you do robinhood as a chrome extension how would you do blah blah that's super clever so to recap that you're basically saying as i'm browsing like literally as i'm on robinhood.com right can there be an acorns it can be some acorns like extension that's like hey why don't you spend a little bit more and actually invest directly in this company exactly and get a sense of ownership and incentive alignment or even better like hey we like it it pops up right as it sees you're about to do a trade it's like hey we see about the trade for like 97 bucks you want to roll this up get the extra three bucks in robin hood itself yes that's that's super clever i love that all right so that was that was theme one uh let's go to theme two sure so let's see here okay so this next category is does encouraging people to use your product naturally encourage other people they know to use the product also this is commonly called product led growth but we can break it down into more interesting ways let me start by giving you some examples okay so slat connect dropbox paypal calendly so what these companies have in common is when i use any of those products my use of that product is better if i invite other people onto it or share it with other people like when i join slack it's a ghost town if it's just me right right so i'm naturally encouraged to to invite my co-workers and then slack did something super brilliant called slack connect where now i can invite non-co-workers so people who exist like at different people who work at different companies and i'm using slack as the glue but because i'm using slack as the glue i need to go invite those people to start using slack so we can communicate on our you know whatever service contract we got going on so the idea behind product led growth the first half of the idea is that you use the product in a way that benefits you when you invite more people so you're going to do it without them having to bribe you with five bucks to invite your friends because you're gonna do it anyway right and then the back half of product that growth is when your friends receive your invite or when you share that product with your friends they have to feel that signing up for the product is also beneficial for them so let me give you an example like if i dropbox someone a file they could just take the file as it is but if they signed up for dropbox well now they're going to get version history now they're not going to have to store it on their hard drive or in the email it's going to be like this thing that they can more easily manipulate to the dropbox software or let's say i'm sending someone a paypal payment well guess what if you want my money you got to sign up for paypal like you literally have to sign up in order to get the money right um and for calendly same thing like when i'm sharing my calendar link you know the software for calendar booking the person who's receiving the link has a much better experience if they themselves sign up for calendly because it'll show them when they have over overlapping time windows right that are free so that's the trick behind product let growth both parties have to benefit and if you look at the fastest growing companies of the last few years a lot of them grew in exactly this way where you don't have to rely on seo which can be super flimsy when google makes algorithm updates you don't have to rely on like paid acquisition meaning ads so facebook if the cpm's rise at the cost rise and is so healthy and robust and retentive and so that's the obvious part though so the less obvious part is this idea that i call billboarding and billboarding is a subtype of product-led growth that is my favorite because anyone can do it you don't have to be a software company and i'll give you the og example of billboarding if i sign up for hotmail and i send an email and you know where i'm going with this which is there's that hotmail signature in the email right or if i send with my iphone there's that sent from my phone in the email signature right right and like how many millions of people every day get beaten over the head was sent from my iphone and it's just a phenomenal way to stay top of mind so we also have the clear view example the billboards from earlier like we were saying it was such a brilliant business because it was giving people money but it's also brilliant because guess what they do whenever they put a billboard up they throw their logo on the billboard right so that's billboarding literally in the truest like definition and then i'll give you one last example which is my favorite because it's like blowing up right now i can't stop just like i'm i'm subject to it i can't stop seeing this and it's mercury oh actually actually that is that's better than my example because they're they're they're making it they're like people make it their profile right so crypto punks are an nft and if you go buy it cool you bought this digital file it sits in your digital wallet privately and there's no you know it's even worse display than art because you're not putting it in a frame in your house but what people started doing was they put it in the most visible frame they have their profile photo so they're swapping their twitter profile photo with a crypto punk and one person started doing it in two three four and then more started doing it and so now i can't use twitter without seeing [ __ ] crypto punks and reminding myself how i missed out on crypto punks and so i feel like that's like a version of billboarding uh it's like wearing your favorite company's t-shirt but wearing it every day and in front of thousands of people a day exactly it's like the twitter equivalent of having like airpods or nikes on like everyone's going to see it and it's also identity building like if you if you break apart what makes your brand loyalty like why would you want to put a crypto punk as your twitter avatar right or why would you want to wear nike shoes it's because you actually feel a sense of procedure there's either social signaling you're in the club or you're thinking you have good taste right uh you want to be the girl or the the guy who wears nike shoes every day or the girl or the guy who has slack stickers all over his laptop every day like it becomes this identity-based affinity for a brand and when you have that it becomes very hard to compete with because now it's almost approaching tribal for better for worse and just because there's another crypto punk competitor it doesn't necessarily mean that they can just take over through better marketing because better marketing has a heart will hit a hard wall against tribalism and building identity around something that people i think the way it plays out is with one it's good but it's not great as soon as you get two tribes now they have somebody to fight and feud with and so you'll get republicans and democrats you'll get you know yankees and red sox on twitter right now you'll get crypto punks or board apes right board api club it's the other nft project that is rivaling them and so people are switching to those two now you're probably not going to get like 20 of these and so there's like room for two to three tr like main tribes and then everything else will be very very fringe and there'll be some people who want that but okay so you were gonna say mercury is one of these where do you see mercury billboard yeah mercury's interesting because well let me just back up here and wrap my head around okay yeah yeah okay so yeah mercury is a great example of billboarding because it's a modern and hyper growth example and it's all digital i feel like anyone can find an equivalent way to do the following so mercury first of all is a bank uh for startups but not necessarily just startups and it's become the de facto startup that yc companies use so what happens is when yc companies go to demo day where they fundraise with investors they have to then they send a link bingo bingo so here's the interesting thing all these investors are now getting these like pdf wire details with the label mercury on them yeah and they're very nice very well formatted looks beautiful looks better than a normal bank but you're right it's a silent signal that i use mercury bingo and it's also it has this interesting phenomenon of over sampling which i might be using a term wrong but you'll get the gist which is these vcs are seeing such a high percentage of startups using mercury that they're now under the assumption that everyone's using mercury right or at least it risks that impression right and so as a result these vcs when they're asked by their own portfolio companies hey should we use mercury they're like oh yeah everyone uses it it's like the de facto but is it really probably not it's how i feel about max right you go to silicon valley you just see max everywhere and then you you're in the filter bubble of everybody uses max and then you look at the stats and it's like wait 90 market share for windows like how is this possible and it's like yeah because you know the world is not silicon valley that's right yeah that's exactly right you can create this optical impression and if you're making the impression on a persona that is itself a distribution like lightning rod like investors or like very high social signal like influencers if they get the impression of just them narrowly think that you're everything right well then they'll act like you're everything and then finally it trickles down to the mainstream yes it's like what it's like high school but for uh you know 50 year olds um okay so that's that's growth trend two so we got trend one no-brainer no no brainer no loss offers cool uh trend two is the uh the billboard effect you know either you intentionally create kind of a status symbol that people choose to flag or just in the act of doing business you're attaching your logo into their world uh and so everybody that they use the product with sees you sees you sees you until it becomes uh sort of like you know a self it's a free ad basically that you're getting through your own customers um what's number three yeah you got it so number three is self-liquidating funnels which i know sort of silly sounding term um it's actually been around for a long time this is not really a new thing but very few founders appear to have heard about it so let's break down this idea of self-locating funnels so the idea here is that let's say you can't make your facebook ads work profitably or you can't get them to pay you back in a reasonable amount of time like it takes eight months before someone buys from you after you pay 30 bucks to get their email right right so self-liquidating basically means you're offering some type of product that is secondary to your main product so let's say you're selling a 30 ebook or let's say you're an seo tool and you're selling a complimentary seo tool like a content planning tool that's only five bucks a month as opposed to 200 bucks a month okay and the idea here is if you decrease the cost of whatever you're offering but still make it related to your primary product people will buy much more reflexively like they're in the chocolate aisle of the grocery store and it's cheaper so lesser consideration purchase and um because more will i hopefully it'll be a higher rate of purchase and a much quicker turnaround to purchase it could make the economics of your facebook ads for example suddenly totally viable right so imagine you're doing this just to break even you're not trying to make money off it the question is what is the point of this and this is where it becomes so clever is this a giant excuse to print email addresses because if i can now capture emails using a self-liquidating funnel and i'm paying effectively nothing for these emails they're just it's like literally self-liquidating hence the name then i can now scale this up to the extent possible capture let's say a thousand a hundred thousand emails and now i'm playing the long game i've just come up with a fantastic source of lead gen so that i can nurture those emails those people over time and eventually sell them the real product and make the real margins right so that's the sort of brilliance of like going back to my point earlier about if you think of your product roadmap in unison with your growth roadmap what are the product features that can actually facilitate much easier growth and i'm not saying every company has to do this it's just that if you're having a hard time making certain channels work these strategies we're chatting about um are like potentially available to you cheat codes albeit potentially very distracting ones so there's a lot of concerns to consider but i'm just giving you guys ideas to pick from from what i've seen work in the community so to wrap up this particular idea sean it basically comes down to this if you can't make the economics of an ad channel exciting can you at least a not burn money while b building a huge lead database that likes you because your free thing or your cheap thing rather it's really high quality right yeah so you see this in content a lot i think you do this pretty well i think you have these like uh handbooks i think you call them on your website and it's like way more high quality than a blog post um and so you send them that thing for free grab their email address they're happy because wow i got he over delivered on value for this free thing and you're getting emails for free during that now i don't know if you do paid ads to run those but many people do uh you know run paid ads to a free ebook and then grab the lead there or a five dollar you know just pay shipping so i think i think they call this in marketing the free plus shipping offer which is you're giving the thing away for free and you just charge shipping so they do this with books or like if you're a clothing brand you can give away like a little hat and they just pay the shipping cost the shipping cost kind of bakes in your cost of goods also because it's like you know seven dollars since like shipping is five the cost of goods is two and you think you're getting the item for free what do you have to lose all you gotta do is pay the shipping that seems fair and they're they're using that to get your um to get your information and then they say great now i'm gonna go back to this list now they've had a sample of my stuff and can i go get 25 of people to become a real customer after doing that yeah absolutely well the way i think about it is and this is a strong opinion of mine that i'm not saying is the right way is i actually don't sell anything on my website so julian.com is what you're referring to where i write these handbooks like i break down like how to write well how to grow your startup there's nothing being sold like there's some ads for not ads per se but some references to demandcurve.com where we teach people growth but by and large if i'm making money from demand curve then i don't want to have to make money from the things i'm doing for pure enjoyment and that i'm using to build an audience like i want to build this association that you can trust me that i'm never trying to sell you anything and i think that's not critically required but so healthy for the long term and like you think of paul graham like this you know the writer guru y.c founder that everyone looks up to you know in a million years you would never expect him to have like a banner ad at the bottom of a blog post he writes because it'd be so out of character and it would really compromise i think or or a 199 course yeah exactly exactly so yeah so i just try to keep them totally separate and um anyway so yeah that's but not i'm not saying people have to monetize they have to make a living but if you make a living through other things you don't have to make a living to the thing you're passionate about like when i see very rich people start podcasts and still run ads on their podcast like unless you're doing it to pay employees you're awesome but if you're doing because you're trying to make an extra buck it seems like it's totally defeats the purpose of why you're let's call let's call them out reid hoffman you are a billionaire you created linkedin you sold it for 20 billion dollars why does your podcast have ads uh and i know they're i know the answer to it actually but uh no excuses as far as i'm concerned now people can say the same thing about me i do i think there's ads on this podcast there are i do courses and the way i thought about it was was pretty simple which was i'm going to spend my time doing something and i value my time and i also want to scoreboard for if the thing i'm doing is valuable and one scoreboard is likes and the other the i think a more powerful scoreboard is money and i do a lot of things for likes the podcast is free all that's good stuff but if i do something like a course or i'm actually going to sit down spend time with you and teach you something then i want to charge for that most of the time i give away a bunch of like free spots um and the last thing is i uh i do this to get myself more excited about it so i'll set a um a reason a goal for the money so i'll be like okay like this right now with this course i'm doing right now i was like all right i want to do two things um i want to be able to i made a list of 10 people who've been just awesome to me in life and they've like mentored me or helped me in some form or fashion i was like i want to buy them all like a fat gift like a gift that's like you know way more than what uh what they would be expecting in this case the second thing is i want to i'm really trying to get in shape and i was like i want to have a personal chef i was like how much does that cost i used to have an investor he had a he had a personal chef a private chef and the chef would come cook for us at lunch at the office every day and it was amazing and i always just thought that was a one day one day dream i kind of looked up the cost and i was like oh i think i could pay for that that's basically like you know six to eight grand a month um okay cool so if i sell you know if i do a hundred thousand dollars profit in this course that pays for a year of a chef and now i got excited about it so it made me more excited to actually do the thing than just my benevolence and maybe it's because i'm kind of a greedy or selfish person that could be the reason why but all i know is once i have a target and that target could be anything silly it could be uh i'm gonna go buy you know uh you know go buy a bunch of crypto pucks or i'm gonna put it all in on this penny stock and then i'm gonna turn that into content of riding the wave of this penny stock it doesn't really matter what it is is but when i have a target then i'm a financial target it makes me try to do a way better job at the thing i'm doing yeah that definitely resonates and i think it's healthy and i think that's awesome i see it a bit differently and my different way is not a better way and my different way is i like i see what i spend my time on outside of like earning a salary through demand curve.com in the context of a craftsperson and so i don't want to do anything even if it's for like some extrinsic goal like getting a chef um unless i i would be happy doing it if i got nothing else from it like the process itself is the reward um and i feel like it took a really long time for me to figure out what those things are in my life where the process alone is really rewarding and to me so yeah yeah it's just like it's such a beautiful thing if you can find it um and and like i was going through this binge on youtube where i was watching videos of creators uh and like artists and musicians in the process of making their music uh like if you google uh if you search youtube for ariana grande i forget the name of the song but she's like ariana grande in studio dude i've gone down so many rabbit holes of this uh there's an ed sheeran documentary if anybody wants to watch on apple plus of him making his uh on apple tv plus or whatever of uh him making his album and it's like he invites a bunch of people to his house and you literally see him like in a car ride just messing around on the guitar and he's like you can see you can hear him figuring out this one guitar lick that became you know uh you know love yourself or whatever becomes one of these like hits today and you can see him just like humming and being like oh what if i said you know blah blah and then he's like figuring it out live god that that stuff is like you know that's my business porn that's my creativity porn yeah it's a dopamine hit and a great one is if you guys search john mayer beats live radio on youtube you'll see him like literally make up a song in real time it's such a isn't it such a dopamine hit to watch people but the thing i take away from all those videos is if they've made no money from that i know i think deep in my bones i know not all of these musicians that are successful but some of them like john mayer they're just obsessed with doing this and the reward is can they come up with something awesome so um yeah the the the flip side of that is the flip side of that is you don't want john mayer to have to build demand curve as a business in order to fund his musical pursuits and so if if if this is the thing you love the most and you want to spend all your time doing it and you didn't have some major major exit beforehand which is a big criteria for most people then this is how it becomes sustainable right like i want to create more content i want to teach so that i need teaching to be sustainable so i could spend all my time on it i could hire the best people for it all those things right so i think that's the caveat do you have any kind of like yeah other backup stuff as far as opportunities or ideas or things that caught your eye i have one maybe we'll keep it quick because i don't know if it's what you're going to find interesting so maybe we do this one super quick and you can pull me along if you like it how's that okay sounds good cool so um okay well actually have i told you my thoughts on like what goes into making awesome content like this podcast no break it down okay yeah yeah i feel like i feel like i don't remember who i was telling this to so the short of it is i think there's this curse of overcoming frequency and when i was going through like all the content creators that i see the most loved profess for like weight but y or paul graham who i mentioned earlier everyday astronaut right what they all have in common is they don't publish content on a set frequency like literally the slogan for waypoint.com this great blog that people love is new posts every sometimes at the end of the everyday astronaut videos they'll be like the next video will be out when it's ready and like paul graham will post at a very erratic schedule and what they all have in common is they're publishing when they truly have something to say they're not publishing try hit a deadline which i think is a trap because you're then forced to try to be a creative genius on account on a schedule which is like near impossible now what do you make of the like casey neistat uh mr beast or whoever these guys that basically they made their their bones and their following by doing a daily vlog and they got they chose to get on that they chose to handcuff themselves that treadmill and the fans kind of loved that and their premise was different it wasn't this is great it's this is everything yeah i think it's a great question so it's a good counter example i think this general idea i'm getting to is almost domain specific like it depends what you're trying to sell if you're just offering people like cheap awesome entertainment like money giveaways the threshold is not that high to be creatively like fulfilling to hit that but if you're trying to sit down like paul graham or wait but why or james clear or morgan housel like these authors and you're trying to come up with something original and novel to say that is really where i'm getting at and it's also not unlike podcasts like can you actually hit a podcast at a really high frequency maybe but at some point you run out of awesome guests or ideas you get burned out and so the reason this is on my mind is because what i realized is there's this weird myth that in order for you to succeed as a podcaster or vlogger or content creator or whatever is you have to have a very consistent and high frequency of output but that's not true this is like some 1950s mad men era like our billboard impression crap yeah it's like it doesn't exist with the internet it's not the same thing matter-of-factly like if you look at like my twitter account i think i got to like 200 000 twitter followers and i tweet once every 14 days like twice a month i literally i literally send two tweets a month um people aren't forgetting who i am but if the quality is high the staying power so much better you don't have to be pumping out all the time right like wait but why i think he didn't post anything for like eight months you know what i mean so i just want to sort of encourage people on this on this momentary platform of my first million that um really beautiful things happen you can rise above this content overload that we live in if you focus more so on quality the quantity is useful for yourself like if you're trying to get good at something due to high frequency but that doesn't mean you have to publish everything um you can keep some back and do it for yourself so anyway that's my little rant on quality events quantity and the reason i'm bringing this up is because your podcast is consistently good and i think the brilliance of it the reason it's possible is because you found a format which the threshold like i was you know referring to the youtube examples is achievable like you haven't you haven't backed yourself into a corner like how i built this where they have to spend so long doing something awesome you can just grab people riff on ideas and it's a lower threshold but still incredibly hard to do don't get me wrong and so i just yeah i just i just find this whole topic so interesting because so many people are pumping out content with like the wrong framework yeah yeah and i think there's many ways to win like i think you typically want to be on either end of the spectrum either light touch high frequency so um you might i'm comfort i'm like friends there's a million episodes you can go through and they're all all right um or your game of thrones and there's like no there's eight episodes that you can go go to for this season but they're all epic and you know i think i find that if you're going to choose one strategy polarize to either end of that and focus on quality um or focus on uh frequency and um and in the middle is tough because if you try to be high frequency high quality you lose right if you try to be low frequency low quality you lose if you try to be right so it's like there's you have to hit one of those in order to make it work um as far as i've seen in terms of in terms of how content goes by the way tell me uh share with people your thoughts on bios so i hit you up and i was like hey i want to redo my twitter bio and i feel like you've probably put some thought into this and you were like funny enough i have here's some thoughts and you gave me this audio note this two-minute imessage audio note that was fire and i was like this is such a julian thing so so share share with people kind of your what you've seen or how you break that down the whole idea of bio which sounds really light-hearted but in reality how you talk about yourself matters to yourself like your own self-concept but how you talk about yourself to others how you present yourself to others it's like it seems frivolous until you gotta go write one and then you sit down you're like [ __ ] i have so much to say that i have nothing to say at the same time it all sounds bad then it sounds too braggy then it sounds too unimpressive how do i do this and so give me give me your thoughts on bios sure so this isn't a hard and fast rule it's just what i think makes the most sense and i'd love to hear a better idea which is write your bio to justify why people should follow you by the way let's let's just just stick with twitter for now that's what we're talking about here so write your twitter bio that justifies why you're differentiated and worth following what do people get from following you so for example mine is something like i deconstruct i'm literally reading my bi right now so it goes like this i deconstruct how things work like storytelling and critical thinking and i share my learnings along the way okay so you know what you're getting now and the reason this distinction is important well actually let's compare and contrast so the typical bio is something like forbes 30 under 30 2x founder 3x father 5x christian like all these all these stats you know and it's like and it's like this doesn't tell me anything it's just virtue signaling in to some respect and i don't know why i should care so the second part of this is it's not just why they should follow but also what is the minimal amount of social proof to justify why you talking about the topics you're saying you'll talk about you actually are qualified to do so so so you're kind of saying what are you gonna get from me what's in it for you and why you can trust this source just enough to get you to trust not everything bingo and it's what's interesting about this question actually sean is that you're fundamentally asking me a growth marketing question which is hey if i look at my twitter account my twitter profile and if we think of it as like a landing page for my startup what would you do to modify either one to increase conversions so in conversions with the startup we're talking about clicking and signing up but on twitter we're talking about clicking and following and so you could if you actually dive into the weeds there's more you could do to your twitter profile and maybe it's a fun exercise we can walk through because it just shows how to apply the lens of growth marketing to twitter or to youtube or to your podcast right right so i'll give you one quick example like if you just think ask yourself this question if i'm presenting the public with a page of any sort what are all of the elements that surface on that page that factor into their decision as to whether they're going to convert so if i'm looking at my twitter account right now i'm seeing my bio i'm seeing my head shot i'm seeing my pinned tweets so let's just talk about that let's use that one example pin tweet so your pin tweet can reinforce what your bio said to further qualify why you talk about that why you should talk about it rather and it gives an example of it so they get the quick dopamine hit off the bat that your pin tweet is delivering on like for me i said i talk about storytelling and critical thinking so my pin tweet is exactly it's just a tiny little blog post little essay yeah exactly exactly so that's your surface area um and the same thing goes for youtube like every little thing is surface area when added together can increase conversion you know yeah so you uh and then you have like the follower account which is like your social proof that you can't really fake i guess you can buy fake followers but that's the other signal that they're looking for is do other people trust this person do other people follow this person um or the blue check mark right that's that's another signal that that you can you can have or not have not fully in your control but that's what counts towards conversion all right i like that um wait sean tell me about your blue checkmark journey didn't you where do you say something an imessage your blue check uh no what do you mean i don't have one i tried to get one they said they just didn't reply because that's twitter uh i don't remember was something else okay so i remember you had a story about trying to get it never mind we'll skip it you know if you remember it say it i i don't remember it maybe maybe you're mixing me up with somebody no that that actually might have been this it might even be the world's worst story that might have been it's never mind fair enough fair enough um okay i think we can we can uh leave it with kind of like one last little piece and then we'll we'll wrap it up to go but the last thing i wanted to say is if you weren't doing what you were doing now right so you're not doing demand curve you're not writing i can't i can't let you go back through those doors those doors are now locked where does julian go how does he spend his time what what would excite you if i gave you all your time back where would you go spend it if you couldn't spend it how you're spending it now so the answer i actually know reflexively is movies like the thing i actually came to the us to do from canada was to try to make movies and so that remains the thing that i find so interesting because it's i don't have a good it's gonna be hard for me to explain this but the brief version is it's so freaking hard sean like it's so hard to break in it's so hard to write a good screenplay it's so hard to turn that into a good film it's so hard to get people to watch it and and the the requirements for actually pulling it off are how resourceful how creative and how sort of um uh well really those are the two key things resourceful and creative you can be and that do you have a good sense of taste right right and i love that forcing i love that burden on my shoulders try to crack what i see is one of the hardest problems the intersection like creative and business so i've always wanted to do it plus i just love the idea of being able to tell people stories that moves them it's such a beautiful thing so what kind of movies are we talking like comedy action drama indie artistic you know documentaries what are you talking about well i'll tell you i'll give you four movies i absolutely love and i think it'll answer the question so whiplash incredible fiction film um the prestige uh christopher nolan's film about magicians uh and then a documentary on netflix which i'm so stoked i get to tell people this because some will actually go well enough people will listen that it'll get some views searching for sugar man on netflix is the best documentary i've ever seen and then the last one i'll recommend is who's that one about who's who's the sugarman okay so this is really tricky sean because the entire movie is a spoiler so i'll just say i'll just say this i'll say it's about a musician that disappeared often like the face of the earth um and where he went to and how he came back and uh [ __ ] you should cut that i'm getting spoilers i should believe that we gotta believe the enemy came back uh but the last thing i'll say is a counterpart which is um this amazing show on amazon is my favorite tv show maybe ever counterpart's amazing it's it's like a james bond type saying it's brilliant okay i've never even heard of that uh i'm not pitching anything well sean i suck at this you're great at things until they become very personal like when it's like what do you really want to do in your heart of hearts you're like i don't know how to say it but like you can say everything else or it's like these movies that you love that you really want other people to love the pressure in your head goes so high how do i sell this right without ruining the the first time magic of experiencing it um you almost create a a pressure cooker for yourself here so um okay so what you want to do is you want to make you want to make a movie about uh you know searching for bobby fischer style right about you know kobayashi the uh the competitive eater it's like greatness slash enigmas slash prodigies um and like you know within it with a dash of sort of drama and mystery dude well i see i knew i knew i could rely on you yes well pitched um yeah i just love this stuff i just i love making it i love watching i love people i love seeing people watch it how about you i'm here i want to flip this around on you what would you do if i could do anything right now um yeah i would basically take like little three to five year arcs of my life that's what i think i would do i'd take three to five year arcs of my life and i would go try to do a really fun thing that i don't do so i would one would be um stand-up comedy so i would try to create a set that actually is good and i would figure out how you do that i would learn the learn the trade i would go to shows i would do all that i would um i would coach a basketball team and i would try to like be a high school basketball coach and uh and just give it my all you know dude doing that i would um you know like one is i don't actually want to make a show but i do want to write a script i'm actually trying to do that right now trying to write a script for a mock episode of the office uh which is a lot of fun and uh i would try to make a song like a hit song how do you make a catchy hit song that pops off uh i don't care if it pops off as a tic toc meme or what but but that would be another one and so i would just do these little like i'll try to write a book i would try to create a um a brand of a drink or a chips bag or something like that i would just take these like little mini mini challenges that are three to five year sprints i would go really deep in them try to win and then i would come out the other side i would basically switch careers uh each time i do them i love that so you want to you want to break up your life into chapters and you want each to be a very creatively fulfilling thing where you're like maximally using uh actually not necessarily because the high school basketball coach is a really cool one it's a nice counter balance to the creative screenwriting thing yeah because it's not all about making a song and making a stand-up set it's like things that i just think would be really fun if you did them um and which typically is creative but sometimes it's not right like sports is its own thing competition is really fun leading is fun strategy is fun all that good stuff what's stopping you from being a comedian in the next 15 years because what stop you from making the time to do it uh nothing i'm just occupied right now like i'm doing things i got a business i'm running and uh this content arm so i don't have the clear schedule at the moment to to clear everything off to go go chase that and i can just dabble kind of like for fun in very small ways but i think there's something really fun about the immersion so i've set myself this challenge to try to write an episode of the office by the end of this month and um i don't know how to do it but i hit up my friend who writes for a tv show and i said hey can we jam next thursday and tell me how you write an episode of tv like that's what i'm trying to do so i'm i'm doing little like you know tiptoe in the water but uh to do it for real the way i want i would um like i'm gonna clear my schedule for for like a two to two year period you won't hear about me and then i come out the other side uh you know with some some story to tell you you know fun would be for all of us to watch you go do a set i would 100 show up live i would be the loudest laugher even if it was artificial i would 100 support you um dude that would be i kind of want to live through you sean it's something i really want you to do almost selfishly but also i think you'll just have a blast yeah i i i do and i will so so the other thing right now is i just had a kid uh two kids actually two babies and so i kind of feel like right now the main project is actually i'm trying to get the best shape of my life and i'm also learning how to be a dad like a new dad and so i kind of want to like not skip that part because uh like i already already made the baby so i already did the hard part now i just have to like stay there don't don't busy myself doing something else just stay here and actually do a dad bit well what i will say is if i've learned anything from comedians endlessly talking about their process it's that this is exactly the fuel in your life that turns into the comedy right like the struggles of being a dad right the struggles of losing weight yeah exactly so it almost seems like if you don't act on it now it almost seems like this is the time capsule where you write down your experiences and your thoughts and it can become future material i'll give you two so i was in the shower of the day and i wrote down two pieces uh two pieces of content and i texted it to some guy who is a comedian that is pretty famous comedian i don't know him very well but we kind of we text her dm a little bit and i said hey i got two little nuggets for you two little truths about life that i think you could turn into jokes here they are and uh it's just they'd come to me while i was in the shower and one was um receipts like i don't care how old i get i got no [ __ ] strategy when it comes to if i'm at the cashier they say do you want the receipt i say yes i say no there is no consistency there is no logic there is no strategy and like nothing is a more panic moment than whatever the [ __ ] i do when they ask me do you want the receipt or not and why like why do we do that why why does nobody have like any kind of consistency with that the second one uh what was the second one i sent him it was uh oh racism it's like people think america is really racist um and there's racism is a big problem and when you think of racist like if i say racism you know think of a racist what image pops into your head um the ku klux klan member right so you know you think of the the kkk like a white guy in a white hood or you think of like you know a white person in a maga hat or something like that that's what people think of when they're thinking of racist like who are all these racists in america right and uh and it just occurred to me like in reality nobody is white people are the least racist nobody is more racist than like you know an indian parent or a chinese grandmother like they'll just straight up tell you like you know some pretty like hey can i marry you know a person of this race and it's like uh no and here's why and and so i just it sort of occurred to me that nobody's more racist than a chinese grandma and uh and so i was like you know that's a truth about the world that i believe that i was like okay these are nuggets i want to write down i don't know how you craft those into jokes like what i'm telling you isn't a joke it's just sort of like an observation of the world the way i see it and then like okay cool how do i write these down so that i learn how to actually like turn these into jokes and weave them together and make a set out of it and that's exactly what i think is the most interesting part is like what's the scaffolding what's the narrative structure for taking that observation and making it laugh out loud funny is it post like just a smirk on my face right and this is where it gets so fun to sit down and reverse engineer like dave chappelle um and this is actually one of the podcast episodes we did uh storytelling is you're trying to reverse engineer what makes such a great storyteller and it's like setting up the stakes the hero's perspective all these cool ingredients the climax the twist right um and that to me is the joy that's got to be the most fun part i think is you figuring how to craft it and then the people who totally buck the trend like mitch hedberg i actually you know he has a joke that's sort of like your receipt joke but my point though first is he's like not really doing the normal joke structure i don't think i'm not an expert right but it's still so funny because he has an extra layer the extra layer is phenomenally unique and like like like tickling delivery right and so there's an extra layer beyond the structure of the narrative like if you just wrote his jokes on paper it might not be as funny but he has this joke going back to your receipts thing where he's like uh people who hand out flyers on the street as you pass by for like whatever you know organization they're running they're basically saying hey you throw this in the garbage and i remember that always stuck in my head and like i can't do that i can't deliver it like he can right that's pretty good he got me to laugh actually there's a thing you there's a thing you would put out in your uh storytelling thing by the way you you said oh here's all these elements but the one that stood out that i actually was telling ben uh my right-hand man i was like hey uh julian had this thing that i think is spot-on and we should like i think i i do this to an extent i think you should do it more but like we could we can all do this more you were saying something like the best storytellers when they tell a story it's almost like they're blowing their own mind again live they are they are surprising themselves again they're they're or in a comedian's case they're making themselves laugh they're cracking themselves up and um the extent to which you can genuinely blow your own mind repeatedly or crack yourself up repeatedly is pretty much the extent to which you can deliver a story or a joke and um if once you realize that you can't unsee it and it gives you a blueprint to just be more charismatic and entertaining when you talk that's spot on so the way i can the way i realize that is there's this person we interviewed on the pod called jason silva who for my money is the most charismatic person on youtube jason silva and i was sitting there trying to reverse engineer what made him so damn good then i eventually got him on my podcast and i asked them like what's going on here and he said julian before i even turn on the camera i first make sure i'm in a mental space where i'm experiencing the idea i'm about to talk about like i was for the very first time because all of his videos are like interesting philosophical concepts and so he sits there and he's like oh yeah that's what was so [ __ ] mind-blowing about it he like chews on it lets it sink in turns on the camera light goes red and now he relives that initial impression and then it's it's it's infectious he is the person he's the proxy that we now live through and it's just it's such a beautiful thing to see someone fully interact in their own excitement without any concern for like no self-consciousness like what are my hands doing am i stuttering where am i looking it's like all these things fade away when you can get absorbed by your own enthusiasm and then people people just love seeing that it's so authentic yeah exactly it was totally spot on and if you're going to like try one thing try that get yourself into the state where you remember what it felt like so that you re you re you tell it with that same emotion that you felt when it happened if you were mind blown then you'll feel mind blown now if it cracked you up the first time you realized it it'll crack you up now and uh i love that i thought that was a great great little hack great little deconstruction uh on your part um all right where should people so twitter is at julian julian.com your branding is kind of amazing amazing um where else should people follow you yeah sure so really it's uh julian.com and then demandcurve.com is where uh all these ideas we chatted about that's where they come from we teach people how to do growth marketing and that's basically it and then if you want to see sean himself on my pod uh there's brainzpodcast.com yeah that's right i think i'm on two episodes of it so yes dude so we call you an honorary brain because cory and i love you so much for like all right even though it's kind of weird to have one person twice in the first six episodes there's no one more lovable and charismatic and just fun and interesting and juicy mental models and like a bag of cool ideas in the back of his brain and we're like we just we love you i love you and so thank you for coming on it's awesome i appreciate you thank you so much uh all right sweet we're out of here all right [Music] i feel peace i could rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road let's travel never looking back

the dominant way to advertise is not super high production value finely produced uh content it's what we call selfie content right i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right let's do it we're here what's going on what's up man um okay you want to jump in a little bit of chit chat how you ought to do it i want to tell you a quick story so our friend um can we the the guy who emailed hotels and asked for discounts can we name him or not no okay um well he he's our friend he emailed hotels for a european trip and he got some crazy good deals he got like a three thousand dollar room for like 350 so i'm in new york i need a place to stay from september first is september 25th i made a list of 20 hotels and i emailed them and these hotels probably would cost me maybe 15 to 20 000 for that period so like a thousand dollars a night i'm getting some at like 350 bucks four hundred dollars a night it's working that's what's the what's the gist of the email i have something that's unfair so i say hey my name is sam parr um i am in town for three months but i need a place to stay from september first september 21st i need a relatively big room because i record this podcast called my first million and we have about uh i say like a million listeners a month and we record it with video so i need it to look really nice i also write this daily email that goes out to two million people and so like i need a comfortable place to work for my home right uh my budget is 350 tonight can you help me and uh and that works so uh why aren't they giving to you for free bro that's big influence or [ __ ] you should be getting it for free i don't know i i i'm happy to pay for i don't want to be a total mooch i just want a discount it's not mooching you're you're going to give them a shout right whoever you catch no i won't i wouldn't give them a shout out just because they get me a place to stay i would only give me do you shout people out because they get i mean i get given stuff all the time and when people give me stuff and they and then they ask for a shout out i i say you know f off yeah actually the other day um there's a company that i'm using their product so i reached out to him i was like hey uh i can name it i can i think i can name i think this should be fine so so basically i use this thing called passport uh it's like international shipping company so you'll say you have a brand you want to ship products to france or uk or australia or whatever each country has its own little problems with shipping with customs with uh tax with uh you know finding the right carrier to get a low low shipping cost there all that so these guys take care of it so i'm like oh this is a great product great idea so i emailed um the ceo alex and i was like hey man like uh this is great we're gonna use it but how do i invest also uh he's like oh like you know we're not really raising around right now and i was like please and he was like is it you know what like um i think you've already been pretty helpful because you made some intros i think you can do some more i think you can do more uh he's like i don't want to fuss with paperwork like honestly it's just a big headache how about i just give you some free shares and i was like i was like ah perfect like that's amazing because it's like a legit company it's not like oh here's advisor shares in my no name no revenue no user company like this is a real company and it's a very small amount but i was like he's so smart because he you sent me an email he goes hey dude excited to have you on board just signed us to return it he goes here's kind of my expectations like what would make this a win for me is a b and c and um they're all like totally reasonable requests but he just made it clear what he wants and i was like dude you couldn't have paid me to do these things but just by giving me something free i feel the need to reciprocate by like over delivering on this for you i would rather in retrospect i would rather just buy my shares and not have any obligations but uh cool i'm glad we did it this way this is gonna be more fun and ultimately smart move by you so that's called the law or reciprocity so um there's been a lot of studies on this and if you read the book influenced by robert ciaodini it's a uh it's basically been proven through a lot of different stuff studies so a great example is if we're next door neighbors and i say hey uh uh sean here you know i i had i ordered pizza and they gave me two here's an extra one if you'd like right uh okay so i did something for you i gave you something the next day i go hey mike i don't have a car can i borrow your car for an hour you are actually incredibly likely to let me borrow the car even though those two favors are not at all equal right in order to make like this rule works regardless of if they're equal or not it just if someone owes you one you want to pay them back in some capacity and you'll do it in the first possible chance you have so it's actually a great rule and when i used to buy stuff so when i would buy cars i would always come with two i wrote a blog post i would come with two cans of coke and i would have one like hey uh i you know they had a sale and they had a sale do you you want you thirsty was them a drink and uh i would get discounts like that through buying stuff dude that's great that's like the coke can hack is awesome uh yeah i actually now i'm so like aware of it that i have to fight my inner tendency to want free [ __ ] so like if somebody wants to send me something i'm like not only do i not want to give out my address anymore i'm just like i don't want to feel like i need to reciprocate anything to you so like it's it's actually not worth it for me to take these things uh like this is different because i think this company is going to be really big and i really respect the the founder but uh but now i'm like somebody hands me that diet coke no no thank you sir uh right like i i it's not like it's not like i think they're trying anything it's just i don't wanna have any uh on my inner balance sheet i don't wanna have any debts i only want assets on that in my internal boundaries i completely agree i do the exact same thing if someone offered or if they offered me something and i do want it for example someone sent me something for my dog because his hips were hurting and i was like just you know i'm not going to give you a shout out if i if i think things like life-changing i'll talk about it just casually but like in no way are you you're just doing me you're getting this is a gift not a a payment exactly um all right so let's uh let's jump into some ideas or some topics what do you want to talk about i want to talk to you about a couple things um i want you to teach me about something that did do you want to talk about this two things friends with benefits are you prepared to discuss that yeah yeah we could talk about it because this is your realm but this is it's totally your world but it's the first time i've seen something in this space that actually interests me um and i think exactly it's like well okay so first explain what it is and then i'll tell you but basically and i'll tell you why i'm interested but basically it's like uh uh the first time i've seen this technology used in a useful way that isn't just gimmicky right yeah yeah okay i know what you mean and ironically this is the one that i think i'm interested but i'm like i don't really get it and then i like move on so so it's cool we're on the other end of this okay so what is this friends with benefits is a it's basically a community it's a membership club that was created by this guy in la that um you know he was he was the co-founder of a company called brood and they they make little michaela that instagram influencer who's just like a digital avatar it's like looks like a kind of looks like a real girl but like clearly it's kind of digital and so they're using like disney pixar style technology to make influencers on instagram that's the company so he creates friends with benefits he's basically like all right this is like a digital soho house basically we're gonna invite only cool people uh in and you basically buy the friends with benefit token in order to enter so you buy this token called fwb and uh so there's a million fwb out there and you buy in in order to get access to the to the met to the club which is basically just a discord group right it's not like there's nothing there's no physical place to go there's no like perks or discounts or whatever it's basically it's literally like you get to go into our discord and talk to other members here and um and so they were selling this thing it was like 75 tokens or something to join at the beginning yeah which was like i don't know exactly what it was but i think it was more like a hundred dollars when it started and now that thing is that's like a four thousand dollar membership to join that same because the token has appreciated like crazy so the the token even just since we were going to talk about this last podcast and i was like hang on i'm going to talk to somebody um who knows about the stuff let's do it in the next episode wow it's up 46 since this last week's and when we talked about this so that that means it's 68 uh 685 uh yeah so the membership is roughly seven grand now and uh to join and um you know like equinox which is like you know a high-end gym in in la new york sf uh where you get to go to this like fancy gym where it has spa steam room members whatever equinox eco equinox is 2 400 i think three 2 400 maybe 3 000 so this is double that now um to get into the discord so obviously you can tell i'm a little bit skeptical uh just to put some more numbers around it just to give you a sense of how big this is so basically this is now a 90 million dollar market cap community i think the founders tokens are like i don't know exactly how much he holds but roughly i think the guy has like 40 or 50 million dollars of his token uh now the fun the thing that's that's which is you know exciting but you can't sell that's the real problem you can technically go sell on the market but on uniswap you can go you can go sell this thing but you practically speaking if the founder started to sell because he's like sweet i want to bank 10 million from this i think it would a crash the price and b send a negative signal or as they call in the crypto world like it's a it's a rug pull uh you pull the rug out from under the people who believed in you and bought into this thing and you basically screw them all over and so this is like when i bought your big clout and then you sold all your big clout and it's like oh [ __ ] i'm holding this empty bag that sam cashed out of i bought his token i believed in him sorry i didn't know you did that so that would be well i don't even know if i i don't know if i actually did buy it but uh but plenty of people did and you know right now on big cloud let's say i have i think my token i have like fifty thousand dollars of my own token cool my current usage of bitcoin big cloud's pretty low my my belief in like it becoming the next big thing is you know it started off like a long shot and now i'd say it's a longer shot so i would love to go sell that but doing so would basically screw over the people who invested in my token so i'm not going to do it uh like i'm in it for the long haul so i think that's the challenge with this model is on paper you get this big gain but in reality i don't know how much they're gonna how much value they can reap out of this so that's a high level tell me tell me some things yeah so i'm gonna tell you why i think this is actually incredibly interesting friends with benefits itself it's not that's not interesting to me um basically if you look at it it's just like really good looking dudes and and ladies who are like going like and hanging out like it's like a hip uh young la new york type of thing i don't really have too much faith in those types of businesses that are they're more jokes to me than they are actual real businesses um would you say that's accurate uh why is it a joke because i don't know if this is run like a like when i when i see it i'm like oh you're just gonna run this like a like an art project um not necessarily like are you a party promoter uh is this a nightclub so either it's a fad right because the problem with cool exclusive things is when you try to grow them they become less cool and less exclusive because you're more people in um who you know so it comes becomes less less tight-knit the other thing is um are you doing this because you want to be a cool guy or are you doing this because it's actually like a really solid business underneath i think that's kind of the other thing you're talking about which is like my point what are your sort of intentions with this thing do i take it seriously or no but and here's the butt so the thing about communities communities are great companies um the problem with them though is that they're challenging to scale the more people who join oftentimes the worst it gets that's like that's yeah that's the law of communities but why are you saying that communities are great businesses i would say communities are not great businesses what communities do you think are great business well let's define these are all generalizations let's define how we mean great when i say great i don't mean it's really hard to be huge huge like north of 100 north of a billion dollars but like they could make someone 10 to 20 million in sales a year at a pretty good profit margin and you can use that profit to build more stuff so for example trends i didn't realize it at the time but had i still owned it or the hustle we could have turned that into trends as a paid community we could have turned it into an investment vehicle to invest in cool startups things like that and so that's why it would it would have been great for me to own even though it may not be huge in itself it would have led to opportunities and it could have been quite profitable you know i could have paid myself millions of dollars a year because of it so that's my definition of great now what's interesting about friends with benefits is they use this software called collab lan have you looked at collab lan yeah well actually they used to use a different platform they used to use uh roll i think uh so roll was their old platform then it got roll got hacked and so all the all the tokens that were built on all the social tokens that were built on roll crashed uh when that happened is i guess they switched over to collab land so collab lantern is cool because the thing about communities is the more people who join the uh sometimes the worse it gets and so why this is interesting to me is that people are incentivized to stay and make the community valuable because their value goes up even if they don't necessarily want to sell it um well i actually do think that like one or two people could sell their their thing their their token and if they want to bail but they're incentivized to make the community better and i think that's a great model i really actually think this model is amazing so so i thought about this uh two two different ways so let's first do let's first do uh let's break it into three parts there's what is this and why is this interesting there's how big could this be and then there's what other [ __ ] could you do like this what do you think the future looks like so let's do what is this and how big is it so so i would say we we kind of explained friends benefits it's a social token it's used to create a membership club the membership cost now seven thousand dollars it's really appreciated like crazy you know if you're friends with benefits if you hold that token like ben ben is a member so ben got in at like probably 100 or a couple hundred bucks membership he never uses it so he's like god the discord is super noisy like i'd have to like really go spend time in there to like make friends and do all the stuff i'm too busy for all that so like i never i basically never go in there um but he's like it's cool because i hold this token it's going up so i have this like seat in the club and uh i could sell that if i wanted to or i could use it if i wanted to so he's like it's kind of cool he bought it kind of like just to just play with the technology just to play with like this new experiment so these are called social tokens the idea is that you know any creator any set of creators could create one of these so you know the paul brothers i think have had like the maverick club i think the milk boys have their own club and these are just like you know traditional you pay us a monthly subscription and you get access to insider content so this is basically owning instead of renting so instead of renting your spot in the club through a monthly fee you own your spot in the club and there's a limited number of spots and then that's an asset that you could then flip later to somebody else if you want to get out of the club and you want somebody else to take your spot and i think that everyone's a lot awesome and everyone's in line everyone is aligned and it becomes instead of a expense it becomes an investment so i think that is a switch that gets flipped right instead of a nine nine dollars a month okay cool i paid 900 but i own this thing and if i was correct in betting that like let's say we made one for my first million right if we if they were correct and betting that this like let's say nine months ago they're like oh i think this podcast is gonna get bigger well guess what it did and if there was only whatever a thousand spots in our in our private club in our private group where we're sharing either insights deals making introductions between people that sort of thing it's a cute community of people that could be pretty valuable right like there's a pretty strong case why we should create one of these for the like kind of fans of the show that are like hardcore members right um and then they own it and then they say all right cool the more popular sean and sam get the more people are gonna want to get into this club in my thousand dollar seat i'm gonna get value from it today and then i might flip it for three grand or ten grand two years from now or a year from now that's like the promise yeah and and i think that's a great idea now let me put something in perspective so did you know that soho house went public recently i saw you put this here so i started doing some research on it pretty pretty fascinating go break it down yeah so soho house it doesn't have to be a bad business but it is so soho house is basically a members only club it's basically a country club but instead of a golf course you get access to like a library feeling building like a with a bar and a restaurant and maybe a pool maybe sometimes they have a gym and it's basically in new york la probably paris london it's in where all like rich cool young people live it costs about two thousand or three thousand dollars a joint depending on how old you are and they have a hundred thousand members and they recently went public at a three billion dollar market cap and the reason why their business isn't great is they took on a lot of debt covid really hurt them and uh i think maybe it's slightly mismanaged but it's not a bad people putting some numbers around that i think they had like 900 million dollars of debt um from because they're buying real estate in the most prime locations right there they have real estate or if the leases were owned i don't know which one uh in like you know manhattan la uh not san francisco around london um so they had 870 million i think of debt and then during covid they furloughed ninety percent of their workforce i think so uh they furloughed ninety percent of the workforce but they only churned ten percent of members because hey the members are kind of wealthy and whatever and b they like offered other perks like kind of like digital perks to try to come up with other ideas because you couldn't go into the building and and do your soho house like you know you know mingling or whatever whatever people do at these places and so the reason why forensic benefit interests me is i don't care about this i don't care about that company like i said i don't think that they're gonna run it like a proper company but if you were going to i think i would do the soho house model where i try to have buildings that are really nice and you really want to come and it's ran like a proper company i would 100 do it this way that takes a lot of risk you know like i got to make sure that these members this the membership stays valuable but it incentivizes me to make my make it great for my members and i could use some of that money to buy buildings and i think so i think that i would use this model for a soho style membership yeah so so what do you think about us doing it why why would you or why wouldn't you do it um i think that it makes a ton of sense there's really only one reason why you wouldn't do it which is do you want to more work yeah that's pretty much the only thing and it's like the thing we were talking about the very beginning like reciprocity if somebody gives you a diet coke you feel like you kind of yeah all right cool i'll kind of hook you up there's a as soon as somebody becomes a member of your club you feel obligated to make a really [ __ ] awesome club you're like i will not sleep until this club is until you feel like you're you're getting the edge on this deal by 10x unfortunately that's the way my personality is wired and i think you're the same and so it's like oh good do i want to over deliver on something right now i don't know i gotta i gotta think before i commit to that because yeah before that's the only reason why you wouldn't do it but if you wanted to run this like a company and you wanted to create a co-working space and you wanted to do it with this model i think that's a that's a i wouldn't say easy but it's a very interesting path to build something quite big yeah and i don't know if i agree with you that he has to have a physical space i don't really think it's that it's more like um you have to have value so okay so soho house is valuable because it's a place you can go it's kind of like a third place um you can see you know you know that everybody who else who's there is cool so i think for this like the idea of having a digital community a discord slack facebook group whatever where everybody's cool like you've seen this with trends that's pretty valuable people people dig that they think about that like with trends you produce research reports right so you're going to get access to intel intelligence about the market that's interesting to you cool that that works too there's also other stuff like for example i think that being able to access deals and deal flow is like pretty important to people um or at least a certain set of people who have more more sort of money than good investments and good investment opportunities around them and then the last piece is you could also do this with you could sort of like auction off time in a way so like there's a world where we basically would say all right we create a friends with benefit token and with that token comes you're going to get access to me and sam uh like right now that token gets you one hour with me and sam and so we create basically a thousand booked out bookable hours when we mint these tokens but you also know that our time is going to become more valuable and you want to use it when you when it's really important to you and so that's going to appreciate in value over time as our you know elon musk in 2000 his time was easier to book than it is today today it's basically priceless you basically cannot pay any amount of money there might be some huge amount of money that you would have to pay to get an hour of his time uh with him not getting anything else in return and so um something that's the other thing you could offer a value is basically time with people of value and that time could be like an investment you're basically betting today that i want to i want to hold a block of sam's kind of like advice or coaching or you know just hangout time because i think that's going to go up in value over time yeah so anyway it interests me um and i agree i think we're aligned there can i tell you about one more interesting thing that is related to rich people i yes so have you ever heard of this company called wealthx no what is it okay so every year wealthx is wealthx is a company it's a database company and what they do is they basically use publicly available uh records so property records and and sometimes you can get people's tax returns things like that and they look for people who are ultra high net worth ultra high net worth is defined as 30 million dollars in assets and they create this massive database i believe there's 800 to 700 000 people in the world that are considered ultra high net worth and all they do is they comb through loads of different data and then they have independent researchers who work their hardest to verify that this is true and the reason why i discovered this is for years wealth x is famous every year they put together a study that says here's how the wealthy are investing their assets and they create this end-of-year asset allocation and they say wealthy people have this much in gold this much in real estate whatever um and i think that this is an interesting business and it was actually recently acquired by a publicly traded company so i was able to look back at their at their numbers and i actually think that a company like this is shockingly easy to start and i think this company undersold so they sold for 20 million dollars in cash they were doing about 12 million in revenue with 800 000 in profit if i was the founder of this company i never would have sold they sell this to people for 15 000 or to other companies for 15 000 a year for subscription access and they basically are selling it to people who manage um people's money so um right well financial advisors things like this but the interesting thing to me and the takeaway to this if you're listening i think this model of business this data business we've called this um i think we said that that messy data wants to be free is that or sorry data wants to be free data wants to be free yeah data wants to be free and and and and and um doesn't mean free price wise it wants to be it's like trapped and it wants to be let free basically correct and the founder of cb insights that does kind of like this for publicly or for privately held companies he told me the same thing he goes our whole motto model motto is uh there's a bunch of dirty muddy data out there and we're going to go and find it and just make it really easy to consume that's what wealthex did i'm just pretty certain i've read the glasstop reviews i'm pretty certain that this business is amazingly easy to copy and to figure out so the ways that they get data is they'll they'll tell you they'll look at who owns a jet they'll figure out who's donating money so if you donate money to a non-profit oftentimes that's made public if you're buying personal property if you have certain hobbies if you donate get on the list they don't know how much you have but they're like oh sam park big donation must have money all right put them on the list yeah they look at per um they look at what so if you're part of tiger glo uh what's it called tiger 21 if you um if you have certain interests certain hobbies donate money that's how they get their information it's just not that hard to build this type of business now right it is hard to sell but everything's hard to sell if you're going to get in the phones and you got to call people you you sell some 15 grand that's always hard but by creating the data out of your blogs i think this is such a straightforward business if you wanted to make some money um so so so they didn't make a ton of money and why is that so this seems like like cb insights is a big business i don't know i don't know what cba says what was it worth 200 million uh worth that or making that revenue revenue yeah exactly it's worth probably closer to a billion dollars then yeah really more by the way founder listens to the pod shout out to anand i think you think he's uh he's a pretty avid listener so that that business worked in a much bigger way but same principle like you're saying right data is there it's muddy we go dig it up we wash it off we rinse it we polish it we package it we say here you go here's that data you've been looking for it was here like yeah you could have gone and got it yourself but man you don't want to go scrub through that mud well let us do that for you let us organize this whole thing so you just type in the name you want to know about type in the industry you want to know about and bam here's the info and so um that business worked why is it is it because financial advisors there weren't enough of them no there's a lot of them they weren't willing to pay for this info why do you think this business didn't work and what would you do differently it probably didn't work because they probably just hired a ton of people to make this stuff so whenever if you go to the website you can kind of tell some of their technology is janky what i would do is i would use something like import.io or another third-party service like that and i wouldn't build too much technology i would only have uh my only technology that i would build was a pretty interface that pulls it all together but i think you can build most of the stuff using zapier import.io airtable things like that i think that you could build like a pretty robust mvp that you could charge money for using things like this and so i probably didn't make money because they probably their staff was just a bloated staff the company was founded in 2010 so when they launched a lot of this technology that third party technology wasn't available and so i think they just have a bloated staff that was mostly doing manual work to go and find these types of people um yeah okay i can see that uh this cool service i've never actually heard of wealth x so uh i'm gonna go read the report i think that's that's pretty dope uh by the way i wanna say one other thing on the community side that we were talking about going back um i don't think communities are great big businesses that's what i mean community of communities of communities can be great big businesses discord is a community of communities reddit is a community of communities and both of those are like 10 billion ish sized companies and so if you can build and so that's why i actually think collab land like if i was going to put money somewhere and go put it in collab land not in france with benefits same page the platform you're using to launch all these different communities that has the potential to be much bigger than any one of these random tokens i don't know who the [ __ ] is buying friends benefits this might be a thing that they could just manipulate themselves by the way i have no idea i think these thinly traded things could be uh potentially i'm saying they did i'm just saying who the heck is bidding up the price like this it doesn't make a ton of sense to me um but but yeah my main point is that community of communities are better businesses than an individual one once a community one's a technology company so my point of bringing it up was collab land i would rather invest in but i wouldn't i think that you can own a community that does 10 or 20 in sales and is profitable but yeah you're not gonna you're not going to knock it out the park with that business all right what do you got uh all right let's do another one um let's do uh okay i have a little like hot girl side hustle so we've done blue collar side hustle we've done teenage you know the puberty side side hustle and now this is my hot girl side hustle so i'm just trying to identify simple things that anybody who's in a certain demographic can do that will generate you know 10 to 50 000 a month of profit without big upfront costs or like specific hard skills that you need to have and i'm not going to say only fans although that is definitely a hot girl side hustle so this hot girl side hustle is a little bit different there are uh i don't know if you you kind of follow this too much actually you do because i think you guys run ads like this the dominant way to advertise for products now because you're advertising on social networks the dominant way to advertise is not super high production value uh finely produced uh content it's what we call yeah it's selfie content right ugc is what they call i call it selfie because it's ugc who the [ __ ] knows what that means so user generated content basically and they're not doing companies aren't just doing this on social at this point if you look at a commercial on tv for chime it's the same thing well yeah the digital first companies when they go to tv like chime right first spent 100 million dollars on digital and now they go to their first tv spot and their whole company has been trained of like hey you know what works when it just looks like a normal person talking because an ad people just get sort of blind to an ad that just blaze right over it and so what works really well like i see this with with you guys with morning brew which basically like it's a tick tock ad and the person's like you know my secret to getting my boss to think i'm super smart and then it's like i [ __ ] i subscribe to the hustle and it's like that gives me the news every morning and i look really smart that that that ad crashes that tag line like so morning brew does it the skim does it the hustle does it um all of everyone who's in the the email space does that you know who invented that or who who first used that line no i wrote that i wrote that i wrote that i stole it from an old ad book i wrote that in 2016 i think i stole it from an old ad book of like um something about a guy being a piano player uh there was like a piano lesson ad from the 1960s about being a great piano player he goes uh he thinks i'm naturally a great piano player i'm not i really just use this this lesson or this way of learning music and i took that and i applied it here now everyone uses it well that's kind of genius because that's not even like a word for word right that's actually like quite a different thing but you got inspired by it yeah it's called swipe files so i keep swipe files so um i keep uh uh digital files of all my favorite favorite old ads so for for example there's this one great ad about the wall from the wall street journal and they it's made them like 50 million dollars in recurring revenue and it was launched in like the 70s and it was called like the tale of two young men and it was like both of these young men went to the same college they had similar jobs um one did this and one did that one earned this one earned that what where the difference one bought the wall street journal subscription their freshman year of college and uh that's like the whole the story of the ad and like the headline is like the why did these two young men do the almost the exact same thing but and so so we should run that same ad for the podcast and we should be like basically that one listened to one listen to my first million one didn't uh one became a millionaire by 30 and the other one you know is still still like hoping that retirement kicks in you know at 65. uh we should run that same ad and then we should when you click it we should tell the backstory of the ad basically and it's a great story it's a great work so i keep a file full of these types of things so anyway go ahead by the way if people want to see uh go to swipefile.com our friend neville owns swipefile.com which is a great little domain to have and he's built like a pretty [ __ ] awesome wordpress digital swipe file i wish mine was like that my mine is like in my notes app and i have a slack channel that's where i keep my swipes but like if i could i would i would have one like that but he's got tons of great stuff there um okay going back to actually this marketing thing by the way that uh i kind of want to give you more props that's kind of a genius way to market the hustle right so how would a normal person a purchase they would say hustle to daily newsletter so i'm going to say sign up for our daily newsletter get the news delivered to you every morning right like that they would focus on the product and you focused on basically the happy ending and even the happy ending you didn't just say and now you're informed because that doesn't like get people emotionally to like register at all right uh what you're basically saying is what's the outcome you want you want to look smart in front of your boss you want to look smart at work we help you look smart at work you know read the hustle if you want to look smart at work you like drew this line is that how you think about it that's how i think about it how do you think about or exactly what's your framework basically um one user told me one time that they were in a job interview for lyft and they brought up a certain line like a certain story at the end of an interview that wasn't going well and that created a relationship with this person interviewing her and there's like okay great i'm in this person's head we were able to have chit chat thank you also you made me look smart and so the idea here is um i wanted a story but i i only wanted to be able to tell that story in like 200 characters and so i believe the original ad was like my boss thinks i'm a smart parenthesis i'm not um the hustle is my secret weapon to trick them though it's working wonderfully try it or something like that and yeah that was the whole idea behind behind the ad that's amazing that ad has reached 300 million people i think at this point [Laughter] yeah and then everybody copied it but you know whatever you do what you gotta do so uh okay what was i talking about before this i was talking about um oh take time okay so so uh you know what i was trying to get to was basically that my hot girl side hustle the one i was trying to get to is almost all digital advertisers have realized that this selfie style content that looks like native content if you're on tic tac it's going to look like it's going to be a funny or cute or interesting or amazing video or if it's on instagram it's gotta look like an instagram post on facebook it'll look like a facebook post those perform better than your professional commercials your professional ads that look highly polished people just skip past the polish stuff because they're looking for entertainment so you have to look like the type of entertainment that looks like that's native on the platform so this has created a shortage of people who can create great on script on brand selfie content and so i know this for our brand but many many brands everybody is trying to farm this out to either influencers or agencies the agencies are like look we we can run your ads but like making this creative takes a lot of time and energy and thought and like we don't have actors and like a place a nice house to do this in so the hot girl side hustle is this there's this girl on twitter her name social savannah if you go look her up she's like a kind of like a i'll help your brand grow through facebook ads through tick-tock ads and she's what she's not doing or what she does some of but it's not the important part is like i do brand strategy i do advertising strategy well guess what a lot of a lot of agencies pitch that same thing we will we will manage you we'll run your ads we'll be your ad agency what she does that's different is she basically is it's her and i think she has like a couple of other like girls with her that do this they're like send us the product and then we'll take a bunch of these selfie videos and we will be the actor in your content and because i know what ads work i know what to say on here and i just look like an average person and that's why this ad is going to work because i just look like an average person i'm not like um i like i have i can make i can get somebody's attention when they're scrolling but i don't look like an actor in a set with a perfe professional camera and a professional background i look like a girl in our house so this is my if you're a college student if you're a college girl specifically there are a huge number of brands that will pay you don't try to become instagram famous become instagram ad famous and what that means is be the person who can take any product and just do a demo a sales pitch and a testimonial and create branded ad content and you can charge thousands of dollars a month and you can charge even a percentage of the ad spend uh for this which is kind of insane if you're good how much do you think flow from the progressive commercial gets paid a year oh my god i i don't even know if this depends how good her agent is but you know they're spending tens of millions easily on that campaign she's like a branded part of it like if you swi if you switched out flow it'd be like hey wait that's not flow who the heck is that it's like uh you don't know this but there's this children's cartoon that's like the second most video watch video on youtube it's called blippi have you ever heard of blip it's like baby shark but like blippi is this guy and what he does is he goes into like toy stores after they're closed and he films a video of himself playing with all the toys and it's like mesmerizing for like my daughter she can't look away when like blippi can play for an hour it's like you're playing with the toys you're just watching him and then like halfway through like the youtube channel they just switched the guy and all the parents are like who the hell is this guy like this guy's you could just switch blippi and like i could see this it's not like there's a new barney under the hood it's like so kids can't tell or at least like at the age of my daughter she's too like she can't tell maybe like a four-year-old can tell or something like that but but the parents always have to sit there with it and so like there's tons of online forums where people are like uh did you see that they tried to just switch blippi on us like that like whatever so basically yeah i don't know if they can switch flow at this point maybe they can maybe they can't like the old spice guy the dos equis guy these become like part of the actual like to become like non-fungible you know parts of the of the ad i think this is great for this woman how much money thinks she should make in this this uh what's her name social savannah i have no idea i mean if you told me she's making fifty to a hundred thousand dollars a month i would say yeah that sounds about right if you told me she's making a little bit less i'd say she's probably going to be at 50 to 100 000 a month soon why because brands need this content i don't want to have to arrange photo shoots or put myself in front of the camera i just want to send you know product to this person once a month and they sit there in their bedroom and they record a new ad every day and then i have 30 pieces of creative at the end of the month by the end of the month that i'm testing on facebook and i'm saying this one works this one doesn't do more like this um and that's what i want this woman is perfect she is perfect this is so here's why here's why she's perfect uh she's perfect because so i've run uh my team had we've run eight figures in ads a lot of ads i personally have probably ran five million maybe eight million so like a fair amount of um when we first started i i ran a lot of them and my our podcast we've gotten accused of being bros i'm just going to say what i'm going to say but don't like hate me this is just the truth okay this is just the truth okay so we would have three different types of ads well actually four a hot guy like a good-looking but not like hot like an everyday next door type of guy right from the office yeah the the equivalent for a woman so like a a pretty girl next door woman and then like a smoking hot like traditional yeah yeah or at least like the stereotype of like this like you know whatever you like what you think a model looks like if you're gonna make a have a model for your brand yes for both men and women the pretty next door girl worked significantly better significantly it always works and so that shocked me it worked amongst both men and women and when i look at this woman i'm thinking in my head this is she's like kind of exactly the the ads that that we run they look like this woman the ones that won at least exactly uh that's exactly it so even though i called it my hot girl side hustle it's really not a hot girl study it's actually should be called more like the reason actually the way i was thinking about this was approachable yeah girl next door side hustle basically and if you if you are like cute basically that's the bar um because you have to get somebody's attention when they're scrolling and the way the social media works whether people like this or not if this is a controversial statement like get over yourself the way social media works is people um react to or they stop or they pause when they see somebody attractive in their feed right we're like monkeys just scrolling through our feed and so uh so so that's why i think you have to be certain level of attractiveness but really the most important part is the thing has to look like somebody just like posting something from their their account not a branded thing and that works the best so anyways i think this is an easy way to get to five to ten thousand dollars a month easily and i think the upside can be a hundred thousand dollars if you're gonna manage a group of people like there's some people who are on college campuses that are smart they know how to put other people on campus to work for them you could easily get this to six figures a month of income and it's almost all profit i i don't know this woman but we run in the same circle so this woman i'm looking it up now so there's a guy named taylor holiday and i forget the other person's name but they're listeners of the podcast they follow both of us on twitter and they used to run this company called common thread collective and i think it's just an agency right it's just an agency they seem like great guys and i looked up social savannah on linkedin so her name's savannah sanchez this woman and she used to work at that company as a paid manager and yep uh and i imagine what happened when she was there was they were like hey we got to create these ads and then somehow it came to like oh savannah you're like you're you're like good looking and you're charismatic and you're creative like let's just use you and she was like okay fine and then she actually kind of learned how the business worked a little bit while she was there and this is how she started this agency this is amazing i'm totally on board with this yeah it basically unbundles the ad agency so the ad agency does they do creative but then when they use when they do creative they usually farm it out to a photographer videographer or another another creative ad agency whatever uh they'll do media like strategy like what's your buying strategy how much you're gonna how are you gonna structure your campaigns what's your budgets et cetera uh they do like reporting client reports all that [ __ ] then they're like oh you need to be on google facebook snapchat we'll we'll manage all those we'll put it all in one place for you we'll keep it all organized and the smart thing is that somebody just unbundled and said man the most important part of this whole thing is the ad creative that's also the part where you don't have to do almost any of the like client services and that undifferentiated stuff and um and the good part about this is that if you are good at it um it's like sandwich video where basically you get known as the the group to go to that's who the d2c companies go to so i think there's like an opportunity in that to become like the sandwich video for for d2c and look at the link i just sent to you in zencaster of the people who worked there all right let's take a look uh employees three employees yeah okay yeah they all look they all fit the profile yes yeah i love this company yeah exactly like if i could invest in this company i'd be like hey great just i don't want to not long term like give me a monthly dividend out of this company and i'll be very very happy i think i'll make my money back in six months god this is great all right you want to do one more thing yeah let's do one more all right all right let's do i'll do a more high tech one okay so we did the bro bro science one i'll give you kind of like a a cool um technology one so cool technology one is more blue-collar actually there's a whole bunch of blue-collar jobs around construction sites like forklifts um whatever the big i don't even know what they're called like tractors like the things that dig up dirt cement trucks whatever dude dolly parton was did anyone email you and say like what the [ __ ] your problem no they nobody emailed me because nobody else knows about dolly parton either unless unless you come from a certain part of america no i'm just joking i think a lot of people do know and they were just like rolling their eyes like how does this guy not know this um so the the thing i was going to bring up is on construction sites you have a lot of these uh heavy machinery drivers basically so drivers of forklift drivers have cranes things like that and these are really expensive labor and it takes skill and it's also dangerous right and so i think what's going to happen is if you just fast forward 10 20 years from now i think all of this gets replaced with this technology that's it's not self-driving it's more like self-operating um which is basically like remote uh or what they call tele-operated so have you ever seen a tele-operated thing have you ever seen a demo of this yeah so um i forget what they're called but basically i remember about in 2015 i went to my friend's office aj and it was called i cracked and he had an office in new york and an office in san luis obispo or sorry san francisco in new york or something like that and he had this like thing you know remember like a hoverboard like the two wheels yeah and he had like a stick coming up from it and then an ipad and basically what you could do is you could use your iphone and you could be remote and you could have this like screen hover around the office and you could be looking at it from your phone and talk to people so you can go into like different rooms things like that and they also have them at stores now so some stores are fully operated by those things yeah there's a there's a i we used to have one at our office it was kind of like a j nobody really used it but yeah that was like it was like a segway but it's like an ipad on top of it and anybody who's not there could like roll around the office in theory so it's a similar sort of idea but basically there's a set of technologies that say hey look self-driving like full ai that's hard and far away but what we can do is we can basically have a we can do kind of like a labor arbitrage so you can have like a driver city you know instead of being in los angeles where labor might be expensive you have a driver in santa fe or a driver in the philippines doesn't matter and basically the driver can basically drive and you could drive a full car so there's like eight cameras the driver is basically looking at it like it's a video game like they have three monitors the front monitor is the front windshield the left monitors if you looked at the left window and looked at your rear view mirror and the right one is the right one and basically they just drive and like the they've gotten this down low latency where you can have a i can go sit in a car i've done this i sat in a car that was being driven by somebody at a computer somewhere else that i had never met that i never knew and he drove me around the parking lot no problem parked the car and i got out and i was like oh that's cool that's uber but the driver's not here the driver is a video game player somewhere else and um and then that gets even better because okay that's that takes advantage of geography right maybe i make 25 an hour here and i can pay 12 an hour in another city but still that's like kind of a lot of technology and risk for just saving you know 12 an hour so then they go next level they say well you know we really only need the driver when they're at a an intersection trying to make a left turn or trying to park so but like on a highway or you know in a straight road very simple stuff the computer can just do it fascinating super accurately so what they do is it's like the deep sentinels like the security company that you invest in where one security guard monitors a hundred different doors because for a security guard they only need to look when there's a when there's a person at the door if there's no person at the door the screen's off and so what deep sentinel did was smart was they made it where like you have like a super a super agent who instead of just a bodyguard monitoring or security officer monitoring one location they can monitor 100 at a time similarly with this technology you have things driving and then only when the computer is confused or gets into a defined situation that's like uh hey this is a left turn we only trust humans to do left turns right now then it pops up on the driver's screen the driver says great i will take over from here they do the left turn and then they say back to autopilot and then the thing drives off again and so that's called human in the loop technology where there's it's mostly ai but then there's a human in the loop of doing the process so human in the loop is super interesting most people view it as like a just a band-aid like a bridge until we get to full ai but i think there's going to be big companies that just do human of the loop stuff and one of the human of the loop things that i think is going to happen is remote operated heavy machinery on construction sites because if you take the people away you reduce a lot of the danger you reduce the skill requirement and then maybe you you only need an operator to do certain high skill tasks and they just like basically load in like a video game they do the task and then they leave and then they go do it again so one driver can be like working on 10 construction sites every day i think that's going to be pretty cool because that person will make they'll make three times more what's that somebody down there so there's a couple different companies that are doing this there's some that are doing this with uh construction i don't know their names then there's a company that's just doing teletelly operation as a service so basically it says hey you want to you want to create a company doing tele-operated forklifts cool um or cranes great put our kit on your on your crane and it'll work put our software kit wow this is this is what your driver sitting somewhere else is going to use is our our camera kit basically um and that's a company called i want to say it's like shadow or something let me see that's pretty great as a service um phantom phantom dot auto is a is one of the companies now i don't i've heard some you know mixed things i don't know if it's a great company this is a former yc partner left to go start this they raised a bunch of money who uh they're trying to do it for self-driving cars um what do you say who who uh i gotta look him up phantom auto founder and what were the mixed things uh well some people are just like you know anybody who's gonna do this they end up building this in-house they don't actually like self-driving is you have so many engineers you're working on this so hard and your your use case might be different and so uh they're skeptical that a third party can provide the software that every one of these companies going to use because it's not like there's going to be millions of companies that need this it's more like dozens of companies today that need this and all dozens of those companies are probably going to do this in-house um want to say phantom was done by the ycga maybe it's something else but maybe i'm thinking maybe i'm mixing up two of these no i think i think i'm mixing up two of these there was a different yc founder doing this so really quick there's this company called winner winner so winner winner dot com have you ever been there yep uh i've checked it out but explain it because it's pretty cool it's pretty cool so joe spicer you know our friend he's uh maybe a co-founder or helped get it going but basically what they do is they have a warehouse in las vegas well so how cheap is a las vegas warehouse you would know more than i do do you know i mean it's dirt cheap so like you could have like i think ramon had a massive like many tens of thousands of square feet for like 20 grand a month and then these guys so these guys rented this massive warehouse and then they filled it with claw machines and you could play a claw machine like you see the camera there's a camera on it and you could play this claw machine uh virtually from your phone and then when you pull a gift i actually don't know you've done it what happens when you win a gift they'll mail it to you so like you basically you buy credits and then you like play the thing and then if you win the toy you can uh you can basically like pay i think you i think you have to be at a certain level to get the free shipping but otherwise you like pay to have the the toy shipped to you and so it's it's a it's an arcade you can play from far away and it's a tele-operated little claw that goes down and picks up the items it sounds silly but these are actually really popular games uh both in the u.s but also in japan i think this is like a pretty big market for this either in korea or japan and then winner winner their numbers were pretty like decent as well like they're doing they're doing very well i think you guys invested right no we haven't but they're thinking about we don't know if there's going to be a a um conflict of interest we're trying to figure it out but they're investible you know like it's getting to that size yeah it's it's a really cool concept uh it's definitely worth like playing with once just to see it kind of like makes you think more is possible than you thought of right like it's kind of a crazy idea to be like hey you know that little like two dollar thing where you can like maybe win an iphone or like a stuffed animal like yeah what if you could just play that from your phone i don't think this was that hard to set up either like no i don't think it's either they say like because little things do matter like latency or like if i push right and it doesn't go right until like it lags but by then i push right three more times now it goes right three times and i'm like you can easily just get frustrated throw your phone and be like this is stupid so there's definitely some tech you have to do to smoothen that out but that's getting better and better every day and um you know any any group of smart people can solve that that's a lot easier than you know self-driving cars or whatever but i think this whole space to watch is tele operation remote operation remote drivers remote arcade games remote you know construction remote cleaning there's a whole bunch of things where the machine can do 80 of the stuff the machine can't do the last 20 so instead of just waiting until the machine is perfect you say cool we're going to put a human in the loop the human will take over when that 20 needs to be done when a decision needs to be made when an adjustment needs to be done or whatever and then the machine goes back to doing it and now you have humans that are working remotely they make more money than they would if they were just working on one site and the cost of the thing goes down too because you don't need so many humans working on stuff to make it work so i think it's like a win-win-win that's going to be more popular but people don't really talk about that today do you follow do you know how much on it sold for you know on it yeah joe rogan's like thing uh you had told me something they sold for a couple hundred million right dude someone told me like 200 million dollars right is that crazy so on its own by this guy named aubry marcus do you follow him on instagram no should i this guy is nuts i've heard some crazy stories about this guy like i don't meta when i say nuts i don't i think he's a fine guy um but he's just like an oddball i've heard some stories about him that basically one time he went to uh this uh rural area and went into an isolation area but it wasn't like an isolation tank it was like a um a room with no sound or no uh light and he stayed there for like four or five days i've heard other stories about how he goes to this area it does massive amounts of lsd i've heard stories about how he had an open relationship with his wife and it didn't work out and she was like i believe her name's whitney i think she's like a former miss america something like that and they had an open relationship this guy is wild if you follow him on on instagram and he's like he's like a hunk like he's like looks really good looking like he's good-looking and he like heard the word hunk in a long time dude he's like a hunk he's like ripped he's huge he's good-looking he's got like cool tattoos this guy you got to follow this guy i did script it's wild this is like some weird [ __ ] i'm watching him i'm watching him work out with a steel mace yeah that's what they said warriors used to use and there's like videos of him with like war paint on and then um this guy he this is the most this guy's so fascinating to me i love the founders of all these companies so like if you want to see interesting founders look at the founders of supplement companies um you know like energy drink companies like go look at the guy from bang energy dude tell me that's not a good time tell me that's not a good time on instagram go look at the guys who do supplements uh the energy guy is like legit weird yeah all these guys are legit weird dude and that doesn't mean like it's not a bad thing but they're not you know they're not like you know some corporate they run big corporations but they're not corporate they are not buttoned up they are uh they're a little wild yeah man this is a good follow you got to follow aubrey marcus he like he does all this spiritual stuff like there's here's a video of him um he's getting um like blessed by a spiritual shaman or something i don't even understand like some of this terminology um and all right i have a good follow for you too on instagram of a tech founder do you follow the founder of telegram powell no is he is he a nutty okay so we just type in p-a-v-e-l he's the ceo of telegram yeah telegram if you don't know it telegram is basically whatsapp but it's made by this kind of like guy who's he won't sell the company so he's like you know this guy's actually kind of like a genius i think he started vk which is the the russian facebook it's the only country d-u-r-o-v uh and his handle is just d-u-r-o-v yeah i got him so so this guy's story is pretty nuts uh so he starts vk naomi vk is the uh the russian facebook facebook the facebook basically has taken over every other like oh i'm facebook for brazil it was like orc no facebook comes wins it's like oh i'm facebook for like bibo bibo was facebook and ireland in the uk and in australia boom facebook won and then in russia they just could never beat vk for like a combination of like slightly political reasons but also i've seen interviews with zuckerberg where he's like dude they're engineers these are like the most brilliant mathematicians ever and they've just made it their mission in life as soon as we release anything they haven't copied in 24 hours like it's and it's like pixel for pixel copy so vk is facebook but instead of blue it's red it's like a pixel for pixel copy of facebook but it's red and it it has withstood facebook facebook has not been able to win in russia even after like all this time but then you know putin or whoever the government there they basically took over vk they just like took over the company and like demanded certain things he refused and so this guy had to flee the country so this guy flees and he creates telegram which is this like ideal this is like encrypted messaging app and it's like whatsapp but it's uh not owned by facebook so a lot of people like it i love it it's great product um and he basically self-funded it for a long time like he's put like 50 million of his own money into like doing he's like there's no ads there's no whatever and then he made a bunch of money when they did an ico a token sale but they never actually went through with it but they got free money for a while from that uh but this dude's instagram following is hilarious you'll never see anyone else in his instagram feed no friend no girlfriend boyfriend wife kid nothing it's only him it's usually him with no shirt on and he's pretty ripped and he's he's very ripped i mean he looks like first he is always doing like model-esque photo shoots dude he's like vito he's like sitting on a sand dune or he's like riding a horse into the sunset like he's in a speedo under a waterfall and uh this guy is just hilarious to follow i just find this guy to be like an actual character no he's 36 years old worth 20 billion dollars and he's got like pictures of him like with this mega yeah this guy's fascinating i'm gonna i'm gonna successfully this is the billy of the week pavel pavel you are the billy of the week so where's he live just for he floats around he doesn't tell anyone where he lives he's in dubai a lot but he travels around and he doesn't he can't go back to russia and he can't go he can't go back to the state he can't come to the states doesn't want to come to the states and so he just goes to like you know beautiful places that are you know uh i don't know if he lives in one place he's just like always traveling it's him sometimes in the u.s sometimes in dubai finland brazil wherever paris and then uh he runs the company sort of like remotely so wikipedia says i don't know this word um aesthetic like what's that mean aesthetic i guess that means you don't know own much and he won't give up your possessions he promotes freedom of property so i guess he doesn't own uh that much stuff yeah wow yeah he ran some nice [ __ ] i'll tell you that much so he's renting like a like a mega yeah probably a 100 million dollar yacht this guy's fascinating and his kind of like mission in life is just sort of to be like the anti-facebook anti-vk um and so i find him to be cool because he's like an idealist like if you use telegram he writes the update and he'll be like we have you know 10 million more members uh telegram remains 100 free 100 encrypted 100 uh you know like um uh what's it called like you know independent and he's like you know we release these new features and he's just like he definitely has like an idealistic streak around privacy yeah around freedom at least that's what he promotes and this company is like a 20 billion dollar company right or like a multi-billion dollar startup telegram would be a multi-billion dollar startup but again there's no there's no outside investors and there's no uh he'll never sell so you know it's nobody knows the real value this might be one of the most valuable companies per employee i'm looking at their jobs page they only have like five jobs up a content moderator a translator a translator a junior accountant an assistant to the ceo dude that's a sick job if you can become an assistant if paul's a ceo that's a sick job that's crazy right yeah what's that interesting company does it make money uh no it doesn't make any money he doesn't care about it making money he doesn't want it to make money they did they were like pretty pure until they did this ico thing they basically did yeah yeah they were like we're going to beat ethereum we're going to like build a better version of ethereum uh with all this crazy [ __ ] they released this white paper that was like we are solving all these impossible computer science things and people who were smart technically they were like all right well like if anyone's gonna do it it's gonna be these guys but i don't think i don't think anybody can do this and definitely nobody can do this in this timeline that they're talking about um like the crazy sharding schemes or whatever and basically they um so so so they did this ico i think they raised like four billion dollars or three billion dollars i have some of the details wrong i never i didn't prepare for this one but they raised a few billion dollars and then the u.s basically said you yeah you can't that's a security offering you can't do that unless you follow these regulations and so they just pulled the plug on the ico but for a year they held everyone's money saying it's going to get listed at the end of the year or two years maybe even they helped everybody so they had like a free float of a multi-billion dollar float for multiple years and then they gave back the money but for the deal was so hard to get into that all these middlemen who had allocation i think you had to buy 20 million dollar slots uh that was like the minimum purchase at the time i think people would buy the 20 million and then they would sell chunks of it to individual retail investors like me for 30 million a 40 million total and so people got back the 20 million but if they sold it for more than that initial strike price you were screwed so a lot of people put in you know a hundred thousand dollars into this thing and got back 70 two years later um you know but that's the risk you take i'm gonna be researching this all day um yeah that's the episode i gotta run cool all right see you later i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

and a lion is the exact opposite a lion sits rests it watches it observes it waits for an opportunity and then when opportunity comes like the you know the gazelles running across the field the lion looks up sprints after the gazelle i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back okay we're here all right let me tell you something all right you ready yeah i saw a great tweet that got me thinking a lot and i've been reading a lot on this topic so it's very a good coincidence so it's this guy named dan vasalo he said i'm convinced that working 40 hours a week 50 weeks per year for 30 to 40 straight years is against our nature yet the most skilled educated and highly paid people i know tend to be unable to consider any other path that doesn't involve enduring this artificial lifestyle do you sean agree or disagree uh well actually let me phrase it differently do you do you think that that 40 hours 50 hours a week for 50 years is outlandish like where do you fall on that i totally agree with this i think that the work week concept is um sub-optimal somewhere between bogus and sub-optimal all right so why do i think that so first there's like this uh assumption that's like we have linear output that uh you come in eight hours a day all eight hours are going to be roughly equal nobody says this but it's just implied in the way that we work um you're expected to sort of be there for these hours and then on top of that there's like well cool then monday through friday should be the same and then you're working 50 out 50 weeks out of the year that should be they should all be roughly equal like we know anybody who does non like factory work non-like industrial work if you're working with your brain uh you're doing knowledge work that work week doesn't make any sense and i think you were you kind of like nerd out about the history of like the history of things the history of the work week the history of you know the industrial revolution and [ __ ] like that and it seems to me and maybe i could be wrong here but it seems to me like this idea of the way we work where you go to a central place and then you work eight hour shifts and you do that five days out of the week and then you do that 50 weeks out of the year and you do that for 30 years out of your career that is like the industrial age and it makes sense if you're actually working in a factory because you can sort of uh pick pack you know you can sort of like do all the these like these physical tasks with a certain set of output and uh it can be measured and like just the more hours you're there the more output you're gonna get whereas if you're a programmer or you're a designer or you're a you know a product person or you're a marketer you might have one hour where you just get this burst of creativity of insight and that hour was like the whole day's work and it might take you a whole day to get to that point but that hour was like the most valuable bit so i think that the way people work today is we still work the schedule of a factory but we don't work in factories anymore for the most part so yeah i totally disagree with i totally agree with the tweet which disagrees with the work week so i'm reading a few things the first thing that i that i've read recently is this great book called the science of fear and in it he talks about the history of humans a little bit and how we look at fear and what we're afraid of isn't always logical for example when september 11th happened in 2001 in the year 2002 flights went down as uh sorry i should rephrase that actually the less people traveled on an airplane right because they were fearful they were afraid to fly yet car wrecks that next year 2002 went up significantly so much so that had there been a terrorist attack and a plane went down every single week uh for a whole year it actually would have been safer than driving and we are incredibly fearful and that's just one example another example i'm paraphrasing here i'm going to get some numbers wrong how many people do you think die a year from shark bites probably tiny right uh i don't know let's call it die every year i think it's like sub 1 000 that's my guess so since the history of us recording this the stat which i believe was like 1880 or something like that it's around 200 people ever so a minuscule lifetime like lifetime it's so sharp bites happen each year but something like one to four every year are you you die and yet we're incredibly fearful of that and and the reason i'm bringing this topic up is when i was reading this book he has this great line and again i'm paraphrasing but he says something like if you look back uh of like the homo sapiens so like the the kind of modern human and if that if it's a history book of what that is of the life of that of the history of the homo sapien that book will be like 500 pages and of the hunter gatherer stage that will be something like a paragraph and this since the uh industrial age should you know whatever we just call modern so let's just say like the last thousand years or so that's gonna be like one or two or three sentences a paragraph let's say sort of put and and the reason why this is important is the way that our our emotions the way that we live our life it we look at like well you know for the last hundred years we've been doing this it's like well actually for the last tens of thousands the last millions of years whatever we've done something else and to to bridge that to this other book sapiens have you read sapiens no but i feel like i have because everybody references everyone so i almost feel like i know it but go ahead yeah it's like the tech bro tech bro book so i'm paraphrasing again we should explain it's the tech bro book because it's like it's the book that's not about tech that all the tech bros like because it makes you look like you're more worldly because you know about humanity and like you know oh yeah it's not just about tech so it's not all about it so before you know cities emerge and things like um uh you know capitalism as we know it kind of came into play um a lot of times like hunter-gatherers and then when the agricultural revolution came about we were working like something like 20 hours a week so we would work to get our food we would work to um take care of our family a little bit but it was a lot of leisure time and i find it to be kind of interesting that when i look at like guys like an elon musk but for the record i agree with what that per that tweet said but i do agree that if you are going to build like these outlandish things like an elon musk type of thing it does give you a competitive advantage to work really really really hard and regardless if you start anything you got to work really hard but i don't think that you need to do that for that actually that long and i would actually say i this is a guess i i don't have insight there's a world where you could be an elon musk and actually work 40 hours a week right now but um i was thinking i've been thinking a lot and i'm gonna come a little bit more prepared next time but the history of the work week and i do think it's crazy to dedicate 60 70 hours a week or whatever it is to work that's considered like hard work for like 40 years 20 years i think that's wild i think it's crazy let me give you my uh my a couple of frameworks that i picked up along the way first one from tim ferriss so here we go read four hour work week and everybody who reads the four hour work week gets what i call the four hour fever which is right after you finish the book actually even even before you finish the book when you're about halfway through you're it's like you're in a fever dream you're reassessing every part of your life you're like oh yes i've seen the light i need to be doing things this way now when i'm i can't i can't see the world the same way again which is why it's such a great book and why it got so so popular was because it had that sort of red pill moment where where you couldn't really go back to living in the same sort of fog you were living in before and the thing about the four hour work week one thing he says is he points out that you know true wealth is has not has very little to do with money money is an accounting scheme that we use to keep track of wealth and um and you know true wealth comes it comes into play of like you have to take into account other factors so who is wealthier a person in new york city making 500 000 a year or a person in bali making 150 000 a year well the person in new york by traditional measures would be doing you know four times better but um but of course you know if you if you go live that life that's not the case right because in new york you have to pay your cost of living is three or four x your schools you have to pay for private schools or whatever um basically your your effective uh your effective wealth which is basically a combination of how much free time you have and how much like buying power you have um is lower than the person in bali who's working you know half the time making four times less but also living in a place where the cost of living is ten times less or whatever it is and so he called that the new rich tim ferriss called this the new rich he basically is like the new rich are people who have time and the new rich are people who um you know they can they're they don't they're not tied to any location they're not tied to any schedule and um they have they're working in a way where they're earning just enough to hit their target and their target is some amount of money that covers your life life costs and so they um where basically you're you have a freedom number that you come up with where it's like okay once i'm earning this much and then the the effective kind of like compounding of interest that i make off that money is going to cover my life burn then i'm financially free and he talked about how like the way that people work today which is like you work your ass off for you know from age 20 to 65 right so for this like 45 year period you work like crazy you sacrifice time you sacrifice travel you sacrifice health because you're working so hard and then basically once you turn 65 all of a sudden okay now it's time to retire and go do all the fun things go travel now as a 65 year old and he points out like it's way more fun to travel like now than it is when you're 65 right like it's more fun to do things in your 20s and your 30s and not put off the fun until you're 65 and also um you know why do we do this where we basically trade the first half of our life you know trading you know time for money and then the second half of our life trying to give back money to get our time back and uh that doesn't really make too much sense so once i first heard that i thought about oh yeah there is this lifestyle where you can be remote right like you're in i don't know where you're in brooklyn right now something like that you're in new york manhattan you're in manhattan now uh it doesn't matter where you are you can do your job and so you have more freedom than the average person it also is that you can work three hours a day instead of eight hours a day all that matters is what you get done so it's not like a factory we have to come in to work so i think this is the new rich and the last part of the new rich that he talks about is mini vacation many retirements so instead of having one big fat retirement when you're 65 how do you have like little one you know six month one year 18-month sabbaticals that you take in your 20s your 30s your 40s your 50s rather than just putting it all off till the very end so what do you think about that lifestyle first so that lifestyle is great and it's not actually anything new um and but we don't really assume that it's new so i was out i was at dinner with this i think did i tell you about this uh the guy who had a company in china yes you did so basically as a recap there was a guy who i went with out to dinner with and he had 5 000 ish employees in china and there was this debate at the dinner table of how china's gonna kick america's ass and this guy this isn't me saying this so don't get me flak this guy was saying i think that that's totally false a lot of americans think that but the truth is is that americans probably work harder um you know we actually work really really hard americans do you know it's it's at our company we would give three weeks uh time off most people did not take that entire three week time off um most people would take like 10 days and that was just like that's just my little uh example but i actually think that americans work incredibly hard compared to our peers throughout the world maybe not the hardest but top tier but in a lot of the guys who i like to read about so for example joseph kennedy's an example prior to him even making all of his wealth joe kennedy was jfk's father he um was worth he was like the 10th richest person in america at the time so he was incredibly wealthy and what he would do even prior to that is he would work really hard for nine months and then chill for three months uh in palm beach in florida and this he wasn't incredibly wealthy when he did it and this is actually incredibly common so you'd read about andrew carnegie taking a trip to europe now when you take a trip to europe without a plane that's a six-month thing and so that i this this idea of taking time off it's not like i mean i'm exciting so i don't think it's new but i don't think it's common either right so there's something i don't think it's combination and it's not common now and that's why it's i think interesting now and from my point of view by the way i think so i lived in china for two years i lived in indonesia for a year i lived in a bunch of different places that are like kind of like more third worldly and considered to be like like right now i would say the popular popular uh opinion uh amongst like you know our peers is that china and china people work a lot harder and they're more like sort of like they're advancing faster they're you know us is all tangled up in its own mess and this is also the soft generation and everybody gets a trophy there's all these complaints about the us and uh i hope what your friend is saying is true um that america's not america does work hard and is not going to be not going to get its ass kicked by china but i don't know what i saw when i lived there was the average person there works far harder and is much tougher and the like the expectations of your rights and your leisure um and your like the coddledness of employees is like night and day like uh the average employee here lives like a king compared to the average employee in china or indonesia from what i saw which was two things there were a lot of people in china they live in the rural areas and then they come work in cities because that's what jobs are and so extremely common practices you literally leave your family you have a kid you leave your family you go work in the city your gran you're a parent so the grandparent raises the kid you send money back every week you live in the city you don't see your family and then you go travel on occasional holidays or weekends back to the countryside to see your family like in the u.s that would be considered sort of like you know slave labor almost like that's not a common pattern in indonesia and china that was such a common pattern amongst the kind of like blue collar class and then in the white collar class they had this sort of like i forgot what they call it 996 it's like 9 a.m to 9 00 p.m six days a week um you know like i worked at a tech company the average engineer came in at probably 10 a.m uh you know took a nice hour for lunch uh you know two hours later at noon and then you know by five they were going to their you know going to the gym or going wherever they were gonna go and they were gone and uh oh by the way in between you know they got to sit with their triple monitor set up with their bose headphones provided by the office eating you know having cheetos fed to them so it's like i do think that the american worker from what i've seen is a lot more coddled but what i would say is that the average american has a much higher career focus than the average person in other countries i lived in in australia i lived there and this quality of life was high and people might have worked about the same hours as the us a little bit less but it just wasn't as big of a part of their life was their career in the us i feel like career is like such a big thing in people's lives work is such a big part of your life it's such a big part of your identity your value in society your value as a dating partner you like care about you're always trying to like move up and in australia people were just way more chill about it and i felt the same in indonesia and in china so even though somebody might work 14 15 hours a day in pretty harsh conditions they weren't like striving to like climb the ladder and that like climbing the ladder is a big thing in the u.s i didn't see that in china even for people that worked harder now i think though to wrap up this part when we talk about work we're talking about basically um for most the listeners we're talking about people who sit at a computer for eight hours a day and that's what we're defining as work now i'm not saying but when i say so we're defining work as like doing something you don't necessarily want to do in exchange for money now i actually think that you should work incredibly hard if i define work as like you should work out super hard you should like run errands you know you should like handle family business you should also it's hard yeah well yeah you know you got to like i i think that you should have like i i believe a lot of times you should have like structure around what you're doing and you should put a lot of effort and live you should live hard kind of as is the way that i think about it you should do things like with intention but i don't i think that working 50 hours a week for 30 whatever years when i think about it now i'm like that is crazy if you only live once um and i'm starting to read this book um i just ordered it i don't remember the name but uh it's about a guy who goes and interviews elderly people people in the and people in the hospice who are about to die and they talk about what they regret and things like that and uh just reading the reviews of it has like already changed my perspective slightly that's that's cool i like that uh naval has a great one where he basically talks about this like idea of you know most people work like cows when we should really work like lions so i don't know if you've heard this framework but it's a good one which is a cow if you watch a cow all day a cow just stands in the grass slowly wagging its tail just eating grazing on the grass neck down slowly munching on grass which is kind of like not the highest sort of like you know like it's not the most dense nutritious you know food and the cow just sits there does that it has four stomachs to just sit there and digest grass and so cows graze all day 10 hours a day and uh and a lion is the exact opposite a lion sits rests it watches it observes it waits for an opportunity and then when opportunity comes like the gazelles running across the field the lion looks up sprints after the gazelle like not not walking not not jogging sprints catches the gazelle feasts on the gazelle which is like more dense nutrient more more value there then celebrate relax rest and get ready for the next sprint and basically neval's point is work like a lion like if you're if you're a creative person or you want to be sort of wealthy which is freedom and time working on stuff you love and creating a lot of value in the world um work like a lion not like a cow but if you look at the way the work week is scheduled it's a cow it's a cow's work week the cows work week is go sit on this chair neck down monday through friday eight hours a day leave for the weekend come back do it again do that 50 times in a row that's the year you know congratulations and if you have a bad week that's that's a negative we don't count the number of amazing weeks we just count the number of not bad weeks and um and so people work like cows and so i think that that's a very useful frame of reference is to say okay because because a lot of people who are high achievers they're down to sprint what they're not down to do is feast celebrate relax rest and wait for the next big opportunity because they have nervous energy they're always just trying to do some do more do more more more and when you do more more more you actually are working like a cow not like a lion can we talk about naval so do i want to hear do you have any intel or insights on him that first of all let's explain who this guy is but i would like to hear some stories about him because i just read his uh listened to his book what was it called the naval's almanac the valmanak yeah it was awesome but i've never met the guy i don't really know that many people that know him really have do you have any insights on i don't know i i don't i never met him uh i've chatted with him once or twice just briefly very very very very briefly like a twitter dm and once on a clubhouse so so for all intents and purposes i don't i don't know the guy he doesn't know put it better he doesn't know me i feel like i know him pretty well he doesn't know me okay um but i do know some people who know him i've asked him to tell the background tell the background of who this guy is uh basically i i'll go back a little bit further so so he uh immigrated he's a he's an indian guy he grows up in in somewhere in new york uh not wealthy i think single mother um you know wasn't really like you know him and his brother there wasn't really like a sort of glamorous lifestyle whatever growing up uh grows up thinks he wants to be a scientist sort of decides okay actually i'm more interested in the business side of things or i have more of a knack for business and ends up early on in the dot com boom creates a site called epinions which is like a website for i think it was reviews and opinions on on products i believe it was sort of like yelpish um but more for i think products than for for you know locations so crazy opinions opinions actually works but some [ __ ] goes down i don't know the full backstory but like you know the the important parts is opinions kind of kind of was working and then you know it's still it's not around today so it didn't fully work but uh he got kind of screwed by his vcs so he gets screwed by his vcs gets screwed out of what he was owed uh you know that puts a ship chip on his shoulder basically i think what happened is that he left the company or disagreed with his co-founder the vcs took the side of his co-founder and they bought back some of his shares or they told them they were worthless so we sold them for very little but then eventually i believe they either went public or they were bought by a company that goes public and it becomes a financial success for a little while at least right and he didn't get what he didn't get the win that he would have otherwise been owed out of that he felt like he was screwed over by his vcs and then he said well why was i screwed you know i think the good partiers took some accountability for it said okay they may have acted poorly but i put myself in a position where they could act poorly where they could legally act poorly towards me and so he that that got him very interested in this idea of term sheets and contracts and the the deal documents that go into when an investor invest in a company cause he was the founder and as most founders like investor wants you okay great they know they do this this is their day job is doing deals investing in companies they hand you a piece of paper that says hey and they tell you oh it's all standard and you say okay [ __ ] if it's standard it's standard i don't know this some of this stuff looks kind of scary but like i don't know i don't know how to push back i don't know if they say this is standard okay whatever you sign the document and uh you don't really fully understand until you know uh until things go sideways and as they say with all deals you know deals are written you know contracts are written for the worst case scenario not the best case scenario and uh and the worst case scenario is like you know you found a breakup or or whatever you get kicked out of the company what are you owed and so he creates venture hacks venture hacks is basically a you know sort of like demystified version of term sheets so he basically starts writing down hey founders here's what you need to know about raising money here's how the process here's what the yeah here's what the terms are you should know here's the [ __ ] up terms you should avoid here's the good vcs you know that sort of thing so you just put out a blog with no clear like it's not like a business he started necessarily but he puts out a blog i think it became a book at some point and he keeps investing in the kind of like he's in the game still he's playing he's playing the startup game still next thing he does is he creates angel list which starts off as very simple oh hey founders i helped you figure out the dynamics of raising money the deal terms but that doesn't actually help you go get investors so why don't we do this i know 100 angel investors if you want to raise money this is a list of angels angel list uh here's a list of angel investors and i'll just send out three or four good startups every week to this list and then that'll help you get funded and so it starts off as an email first product ends up becoming full like platform and network basically linkedin for the startup community and now it's a multi-billion dollar two or three billion dollar at least company that is you know the best place to go you know list your startup get raise money if you're an investor that's like i use it for my rolling fund so i use it as the back office to launch a fund if you're an engineer you can use it to go get a job it's like all all the all the um different transactions that need to happen in the startup world whether it's hiring whether it's raising money or it's it's investing money angelus does it so that's the that's the long story short on him along the way invests as an angel investor in twitter in uber in postmates does extremely well as an angel investor uh during that time probably a billionaire at this point yeah i don't think a billionaire i would i would say no but uh but you know stupid money for sure right like uh uh you know hundreds of millionaire for sure and i think the reason why a lot of people like him there's a lot of guys in silicon valley that have that story right i created a company it sounds it's definitely exceptional to create a billion dollar company or to angel invest in uber and twitter and postmates and multiple billion dollar companies at the earliest rounds that's clearly impressive but naval stands apart not for that he stands apart because he has an extreme uh clarity of thought and wisdom that he shares on both twitter his podcast this is the naval podcast and uh and he's kind of like a philosopher about both life as well as business and and that's why he's built this cult following and when he started this philosophy schtick um he got mocked so basically naval builds angelus it starts becoming quite successful it actually took a while i think now it's going to be just the biggest thing ever i mean when i see how it works now i'm a customer it's going to be huge and he starts this twitter stick where he tweets one line tweets that at the time was not very popular now everyone does it but it's like he'll just do a one sentence tweet we call them fortune cookie tweets yes and you know they're silly but like they're useful and people would kind of mock him at first now he went on joe rogan and people start looking at him as this like tony robbins s like guru and he blows up and regardless i think it's the other way around i think he got on joe rogan because people already started to feel that way about him that's what i mean the stuff you put out one thread particularly that that just went nuts which was called how to get rich without getting lucky if you're gonna go read one twitter thread today go go read that one um and that was a bit more i mean that's that's like original wisdom or you know there's original content the internet already lacks original content forget original content original wisdom is very hard to come by anytime i think i think of something wise i'll tweet it out and then somebody will say yeah you know that's what uh you know that's what yogi berra said back in 1940 or something like that i'm like okay great i wasn't trying to rip him off like i this is a independent realization i've had by making mistakes in my life um but it's i found it so hard to really have original wisdom he genuinely has original wisdom and of course many things he says are packaged and repackaged from philosophers that he follows and stuff he tried but uh at the end of the day you know he's putting together sort of like an original uh set of philosophy a set of ideas that come together as a philosophy and he has this fund now that you can join but in order to join it so he charges crazy fees um uh you can go on more i think more if you go to uh he's got it's a syndicate and a rolling fund and you could actually see what they are you could read them but they're significantly higher than normal and he recently had a meeting for his syndicate members i had a friend who went and he said something like i'm no longer going to do b2b software because even though it's like a surefire way to make money it's just boring to me and now i'm only going to invest in things like space and things that are these moonshot crazy ideas what do you see where these are uh i'm looking now i don't see the fees i think maybe i have to like find the docs but i'd be surprised if it was that crazy i think i would bet he takes a higher carry than fee but that's what it is all right sorry when i say fee uh i wasn't meaning management fee so let me tell you two things uh one is have you heard his theory on the like kind of back to the work week thing like let's connect these two ideas so he's got this theory on like the future of work have you have you heard what he says about this no so basically he says like okay um two things he's like one the size of the firm is shrinking so we've seen like you know companies the big companies today are all like tens of thousands of employees and then you start to see like these outliers where it's like oh instagram when it sold for a billion dollars was at 13 people right like that was kind of amazing for 13 people and really they hired five of them like in the last few months so it really was like eight people created a billion dollar company and there was a prediction that like soon if not already a one-person company will create a billion dollar uh one person can create a billion dollars of enterprise value and we're all kind of like looking around waiting for that exact scenario um and i think bitcoin is one of the closest where satoshi basically created a multi-hundred billion dollar thing and it's like not only one person well it's most likely one person but we don't even know who the person is kind of amazing no company there's no no ceo no no chief marketing officer whatever so he started observing that like the size of the firm is shrinking in general and that people work their best in these like small rag tag um and so what he what he thinks is the future is what i'll call like the ocean's 11 way of working so ocean's 11 what is it one person george clooney identifies we're robbing this bank right we're robbing this casino this is this is the next target uh what person one basically sends out the bat signal they text out the trusted group people who all have a unique set of skills and says hey we have our next target they say cool they read the brief the brief basically says here's this casino it has all this money uh they have these jewels we're gonna go rob the bank here's how we're gonna do it and you're gonna you're gonna be hey you know like asian gymnast guy you're gonna be responsible for going through the laser wires and hey pickpocket guy matt damon you're going to go pickpocket the the the the boss you know and get the key and basically this is how work is going to work so what he thinks is going to happen is you're going to have either independent or small teams of people let's say you and let's say the four key people who built the hustle that you could basically get a text message on your phone that gives you the next mission and either you or as the leader are coming up with that mission or somebody else puts out the mission out to the universe says hey we want somebody to build you know the hustle for bitcoin right and you could basically say boom accept i accept the job and then that fans out to the four people you trust you guys get together and you do this sprint for like nine weeks building the foundation there you collect your jackpot of money you split the you split the winnings you get the most and then you know steph gets the next most and trung gets the next most or whatever and then uh and then you all go your way again until the next mission hits and he basically feels that this is how things are going to work more like you know mission impossible or ocean's 11 field agents that basically take missions when they want the mission has a set bounty the bounty gets you know you get completed you get you rate and review each other right i review the task giver the brief giver they review me as the as the agent and then we go on our way and we see this with like uber drivers today but it hasn't shifted into like creative knowledge work but that's his that's i'm paraphrasing or i'm kind of extrapolating for what he said but i think that's what he thinks the future looks like what do you think of that i think that that applies to a lot of things but not everything i think that for the people listening to those podcasts it will apply to a lot of their work but at the end of the day i need someone to come pick up my trash every single day or every once a week you know what i mean i need some type of consistency and i think that naval and well the robots will be doing that maybe but sometimes already in my street dude the driver there is a driver in the thing but the guy drives up to the house this huge claw arm comes grabs my trash can like it's a toy and in one of those claw games at the thing dumps the trash on into the thing puts it back down and he just keeps driving guy doesn't get out soon that guy's not gonna need to be there it's just gonna be computer driving that that whole thing so there's this fruit stand on the corner of where i'm staying right now and it's two guys who run it they work 12 out they it's 12 hours so one one person does the one 12 hours the next and it's open 24 hours a day seven days a week it's crazy and so you can go and buy a pair at 3am on this corner it's wild and i think a lot of new york is like that you know in san francisco everything closes at like one it never sleeps yeah yeah yeah and i think that for a lot of uh stuff that unfortunately is going to be necessary although i don't know if it's necessary but people are going to continue doing it that way but what you're talking about for intellectual work or for work that requires um you know coding or blogging or something where you can build it once and sell many times i think that is a great way to do it not only do i think it's a great way and effective way to do it i think it's significantly more fun well i've had this realization which is um like okay my grandfather my grandfather worked essentially i think he worked in like an explosive factory basically like a bomb factory and so you know hey animation guys start here okay grandfather works in a in a explosion explosives factor bomb factory and he goes to work he basically wears a hard hat he wears his glasses his goggles and um and he's operating like machinery heavy machinery that's like his day-to-day then his son which is only like you know 30 years younger than him does a job that to my grandfather would seem like what do you mean this is work where's your where's your hard hat where's the factory where's the danger where's the what you're not standing 12 hours a day if you're 14 hours a day on the line like what are you doing because my dad carried a briefcase into an office went to a cubicle sat down at a desktop computer and essentially wrote roughly like you know emails memos and then you know flew on a plane to go meet a customer shook their hand cut a deal signed a piece of paper and then carried that piece of paper back with them and then my dad looks at me and he's like you call this work what are you doing here like you know this is now again 30 years later and work is now again an unrecognizable shift he looks at me and he says you just sit in front of your laptop on your couch or you'll go you'll go travel it doesn't matter you can just sit with your little phone and do your whole job and so i you know i sit with my laptop basically and i just talk to other people through video chat i don't even need to get on a phone or i'll create content you know as my thing or i'm a programmer and then if i think about my daughter right my daughter blush she's two years old right now when she works i'm sure it's going to look like something completely unrecognizable and basically looks like leisure to her like to from my point of view because i'm like dude back in my day i had to sit at my laptop and type type type type and she's going to be like oh yeah we just use our voice assistants and i'm just like i have a drone that follows me around and it's creating content for my channel and i have a thousand subscribers and that's my payment that's my income is my thousand subscribers watching me on my drone vlog or whatever the hell like the future is going to look like it's hard to predict my grandfather never could have predicted that his son would do what he does my dad would have never thought that i do what i do that means i'm unlikely to be able to predict what my kids are going to do 30 years from now that gets me both excited but also makes me think oh i need to plan for something a little more radical than what just feels like a bit further progression from where we are today so i'll give you this is a little tangent but uh and robert robert green's uh is one of my favorite authors and he's a historian a little bit and he wrote about how you know how this idea of like how our parents always complain about young people they don't understand this or that hard work yeah yeah and we'll say the same thing about people younger than us so some of the earliest writings that we've discovered of language of the written language not just pictures but uh words uh on walls or whatever it was people complaining about how the kids don't i swear to god this is what he was like this wonderful example he's like in fact this is like so common that some of the earliest works we've ever been able to read it's about complaining about how they're nervous about the future because the young people don't understand something dude that's so funny uh first of all first of all someone's lying because i've heard the bitcoin people are all like oh you know the earliest writings on cave walls were just accounting systems people keeping a ledger a balance of who owes what and then i've heard people who are like if your stick is like storytelling it's like you know the earliest things in cave walls or stories passed down from genera they're telling stories bedtime stories essentially we're written on the walls and now this guy's like saying something else i actually believe yours yours seems like to be honestly the most beautiful i am talking about the written line like words you're could be talking about numbers and the other person could be talking about pictures i'm talking about like words but hey i'm i'm just paraphrasing robert i'm just gonna use that because no one [ __ ] knows and so i'm just gonna whatever it might like i'm teaching a writing course right now it's like did you know that the first writing ever actually happened before people ate it's like what that can't be right that doesn't make sense yeah and the first writing was about writing it's like by my course i i'm just saying that's what i wrote about what do you think that like i i wouldn't be surprised if basically my daughter when she worked she never went into an office she's using something that's even more lightweight than a phone it's a watch or it's a contact lens to see her her information that she works with people who she doesn't know their identity and she they don't know hers it's more like a game it's like she's you know like bb433 and she has like a five-star rating and her out her rate is you know x coins uh you know that's how she earns her money and basically she works whenever she wants and she like basically every every morning can wake up and see a list of available missions to go contribute to like i can see that being the future even though that sounds like a video game today i think that the jobs of the future feel like probably will look more like games than than what what we do today so there's this uh i forget who said it but someone once said um like what what i i'll look at what rich silicon valley people do in their free time and that's what a lot of the world will do in 10 years and i think this slightly different chris dickson said what the nerds in silicon valley do on the weekends is what everybody will be doing on their weekdays eventually yeah and i think if i remember correctly he might have been referring to like lsd or psychedelic drug use i i think it was like many hobbies it's like oh 3d printing cryptocurrency like whatever the whatever the whatever like your engineer friends are doing for fun on friday saturday like outside of their job that's the thing to bet on those are the things that become things and i think you could say the same for people who are incredibly wealthy and let me give you an example so we have this guy in the podcast named mark uh why do you say his last name laurie mark laurie founded this company called jet.com um he bought a basketball team definitely a billionaire and when we were doing the podcast it looked a little funny like the way he was moving his hands i couldn't exactly tell what was going on and then afterwards he told us that he wasn't using his computer and he basically was standing up and he had his iphone on a big old tripod and he sent us a picture of it and i tweeted out about how i actually don't think that a lot of people are going to be using laptops i think that um i've talked to a bunch of people i think gary vaynerchuk's one of them uh jack dorsey's another one mark lory is another one and they run these huge companies and they've created massive amounts of wealth and mark lori said i haven't touched a computer in years and of course that is something that you pretty much you kind of have to be pretty wealthy in order to do that or like a social media like influencer or something like a jake paul type of person um but i do think that in 10 20 30 40 years this idea of having a laptop and a computer i think is gonna be we're not gonna do that we're going to do it all from some type of much very small handheld device i i totally agree uh can i tell you a fear story a random thing that happened to me i uh i was in my backyard yesterday or two days ago and i um i was my we have this little like so we have a pool and then there's like this little hill that's kind of like um it's like there's a bunch of greenery or whatever and so it's like a little path in the backyard you can just walk in a circle and my daughter loves to do it so i'm walking with her and we're walking and i'm kind of on my phone and she's walking like two steps ahead of me and every three steps she just reaches down to pick something up a flower a rock a pebble it doesn't matter it's dirt like she just likes to pick stuff up so she reaches down to pick up something and i just hear this like this hiss i just hear like and i'm like and i'm like uh i don't really and then i hear like a rattle i just hear like like and i'm like i grab her i pull her towards me and i look and right like six inches in front of her is a enormous four-foot rattlesnake and it is staring at her hissing at her his little black tongue is like flickering at my daughter and i'm like i'm like oh holy [ __ ] and i'm like i'm like oh [ __ ] and then she goes oh [ __ ] and then i'm like oh no then i like i take her like six feet away and i'm looking at it and he stays still and i'm like you know a different part of me wakes up i think a part of me that you try intentionally to wake up a lot which is like kind of like your your like survival instinct you're like primal instinct you're like hillary clinton this is real [ __ ] like i know you like to tap into that this is real [ __ ] like whether you're like all right i'm gonna go box somebody and get hit and feel see what that feels like i'm gonna do this endurance race to see what it feels like to almost die on this mountain i don't do all that [ __ ] right i look for like you know where's the where's the where's the couch and and so seeing this tapped into that part of me and so i'm like oh [ __ ] and so um and so i'm looking at him he's looking at me and i'm like okay so i get my daughter out of there but i'm also like i need to get rid of the snake what am i gonna do and so i call whoever i call the i call the animal control server and pest control or whatever animal control and they're like oh no we don't do snakes anymore we stopped at like you know six months ago or something we only do domestic animals i'm like okay [ __ ] who do i call i call the pest control guy they're all booked up and they're like oh we can get down to you on wednesday i'm like dude this snake is gonna move around between now and wednesday and if we can't find him that just means like i can't go in my backyard at this point this is like a four foot rattlesnake uh that is kissing at me right now and um did you know anyone with a gun uh even if i knew someone with a gun i wouldn't be like hey come shoot this snake in the head like it just seems like no that seems like that's about the way you give it to snakes you you aim at their little tiny you know head and you shoot it yeah that's insane it's not that hard i mean i've got friends that they uh yeah when you find a snake you shoot it so okay so that didn't come to mind for me but uh i also live in a neighborhood where like it's all just like old white rich people and so like my neighbors are all like 80. so i'm like okay this is not gonna this is not gonna go over super well they're not gonna help me out so then i call um so i call this little museum i'm like hey you guys are a museum uh nearby i'm like you like wildlife museums they have like real animals there i'm like you guys want a snake i got a snake for you come pick this up right um and they're like actually there's a guy this guy jim who will do this for you and all the other guys are quoting me like 800 thousand dollars to come remove this snake and i'm like dude you could charge any amount of money to remove a rattlesnake and it's gonna basically get accepted um and so i'm like all right whatever and they're like this guy jim can do it i'm gonna call him right now they three-way him into the call he's like hey oh you got a rattlesnake he gets excited he's like i can get there in 30 minutes i'm driving out of the city and i'm like okay like how much does this cost he's like oh this is free i love doing this and so this guy comes over i just i don't even know what the point of the story is an amazing thing that happened so this guy comes over he's got this long beard looks like dumbledore basically and he's like uh oh yeah he's like excited to see the snake he tells first he tells me watch the snake don't lose the snake so for 30 minutes i sit there 10 feet away from the snake just in the heat it's 100 degrees outside i'm just sitting there facing off with the snake i don't have my phone i don't have anything and i'm just staring at this thing the whole time that if you want to learn to meditate find a rattlesnake and stare at it for 30 minutes unbelievable meditative state so guy shows up he's got a tiny stick with him basically like a little tiny claw it's like and he goes up to the snake no fear just starts like moving stuff out of the way near the snake he's like trying to get a good look at it and um he grabs the snake with his thing almost loses it twice then he grabs he finally gets it and he's like you got a bucket and i'm like bro you should have said this ahead of time like no i don't have a bucket let me go find i go get an amazon box he's holding the snake in midair it's like winding around like crazy hissing like crazy we put in this box we tape it up he's like can you just hold this tape down i'm like bro you don't understand how big of a [ __ ] i am like this you i know it's safe it's in the box but like i don't want to touch the box rattles i mean and that will kill you right it'll ki it can kill you i i was asking i was like dude you just went up to no fear and he's like not the fastest guy i was like you're kind of slow like you're the snake was moving way faster than you like you weren't afraid he's like no i've done this for years i love snakes he's like i'm only afraid of like you know mountain lions or something and he's like um he's i was like but they do attack he's like no he's like they rattle as a defense mechanism they're trying to get you to go away right like a predator would not rattle at its prey to scare it away it's more of a defensive thing i'm like okay that makes sense and um anyway so he takes it away he puts it in his car literally his sister's in the car she's just been in the car the whole time and i'm like dude you're out here like he's like yeah i was at her house i was staying at her house when you called so i just brought my sister over and the sister's like oh god does the snake have to come with us and he's like yeah of course and he takes it to some mountain and he lets it go and i'm like i'm like you just do this for funny i love animals and i go i go oh yeah i'm trying to find small talk with this guy i don't have anything in common with this person i'm like my wife's a vegan that's the best i can come up with and he goes because oh i've been a vegan since 1956 or something like that what i was like was it even a term then he goes no there was no no term for vegan but i just lived that way and i was like wow i just i don't know why i'm telling the story i was just blown away by this guy's like authenticity and also just the like quality of this person's like beliefs and uh actions how congruent they were and how selfless they were like we this is like kind of like a money-minded podcast it's all about opportunities and like taking advantage of the situation and coming up with the scheme and this guy was like on the polar opposite this guy was like i love this thing i'm passionate about this i do this for fun um i live this lifestyle and i live it not for the money or not for because it's cool not because it's in vogue like i was just kind of blown away by this guy and i just needed to share that story have you seen the documentary shout out to you jim hale have you seen the documentary of burt's bees no there's a documentary about it it's awesome i it's on netflix uh i don't know if it is anymore but basically you know burt's bees you know the the chapstick shampoo i think the baby oh yeah of course you know how there's an old guy on it that's bert right no i didn't know that i thought it might be like a kentucky fried chicken situation well i was a real guy too um you didn't know that the colonel's a real guy i knew he's real but they they made a character right it's like oh yeah yeah so bert was like the character but he's a real guy he's alive still i think if he died he must have been recently but he's he's still around and he uh would be he had a he had bees so he was a beekeeper and he was kind of this like mountain man type of guy who lived uh maybe in new hampshire rhode island somewhere up east where he lived in in the woods kind of and he tended bees and this entrepreneurial woman met him and i was like hey i'm going to turn your bees into or your honey into or your hive i'm going to use this beeswax to turn it into chapstick and it turned into one thing and eventually she sold it for like 200 million dollars and he made like close to nothing he made very little money but the company uh would who bought it maybe nabisco one of these huge conglomerates they ship them around to japan to uh europe as like the spokesperson because people just want to see who byrd is and he's a real guy and they were asking him in the documentary who uh like are you upset he goes no i don't want that money i just want to go to bed when the sun goes down and i want to wake up when the sun comes up and i just want to do whatever i want in between and not talk to anyone i'm happy and he's a real character are you are you looking them up now yeah i'm looking it up okay i have some info here so company starts 1991. bert owned a third of the company quimby owned the other two thirds um [Music] he didn't get paid though yeah so so bert's bees is now worth over one billion um but he only got four million when she sold it off for 173 million she gave him 4 million when he when she sold it for 173 million uh this the company still pays him an undisclosed amount for his likeness and name um but you know he he sort of missed out on on he would have been owed you know much more um as far as as far as this deal goes i don't know why it says he owned one third and then only got four million out of the 173 but whatever also two things unfortunately bert has bert passed away at 80. um like recently then yeah so that was 2015. so that that's pretty recently and um and also this guy looks identical almost to the guy i was describing so yeah i'm glad you came up with this guy when i was telling my story because they look very very similar it's great and uh anyway i don't know where we're going with this but there is something to be said for these people that are just happy without much there's also this other show i've been watching on hulu about these guys who live on the land like there's this guy who wears like rawhide like jacket and pants and i've been watching on hulu and he just lives he just he's like he lives like a native american like in your in your head like the like cowboys and indians types where they just like follow the food and they follow the seasons and it does seem quite pleasant so maybe this uh less than 40 hour work week thing we're onto something here well there's this like um quote which is basically uh i don't know who said this or i don't know if anyone said this but basically a lot of people want to learn from podcasts like us like they want success and success is getting what you want and then happiness is wanting what you get and practice both like don't just practice the getting what you want because that's a never-ending you know you're on the mountain of more and you'll never you'll never get to the top of that mountain and uh getting what you want or wanting what you get is is you know that's gratitude right and so you want to be you want to master both of those and if you could really only pick one it would be wanting what you get more so than getting what you want or as naval says uh i believe he says desire is torture or something like that desires buddhist philosophy that uh when you want something you're you're making a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get it which i don't know if i actually believe that i actually i actually don't believe that i would say but it is a kind of a buddhist principle desire suffering well maybe we should end there huh leave them suffering for more all right we're out of here [Music] travel never looking back

once you've been in the market for 21 years and you look at that account and you get to see it going up you're going to like realize the value of investing and that that's you know like the true path to wealth i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want [Music] all right we're live what's going on how was steph nice fancy pants background yeah i'm in um a mechanism it's a fancy uh it's a fancy pants office it's do you know what mechanism is i've heard of it that's the agency guy who's a friend of yours i kind of know him a little bit now yeah they have uh an agency maybe a 200 person agency and they've got as you do with agencies you've got very fancy offices in soho and new york and no one is here and i'm in the fancy office here right now all right good stuff yeah you missed steph she was great as always so she uh had a bunch of ideas it's like i know um it's funny like we've had brayu be kind of like our version of jamie like joe rogan has jamie we've got to bray you we now have dan and you get a sense because at the end of every episode we go oh dan how was it hey i brought you how'd we do and um and i feel like that they they both like really keyed in on the same thing which i don't know if listeners care in the same way but like the more random tangents we will go on they kind of like they kind of love it but they kind of hate it at the same time whereas when steph comes on it's like here are five ideas we're gonna do idea one then two then three then four then five what a jam-packed episode of ideas and it's like you know me and her don't have the same chemistry i mean you have of like just being able to go on random tangents or just kind of [ __ ] a little bit and so it's more packed with info but it's less packed with detours and uh i don't know if that's good or bad but it's packed with info so i think i think definitely dan liked it i think a lot of people will like it but it's interesting to me how that goes yeah and i've also noticed that a lot of the things that i like the things that i if i think it's going to be good i think it tends not to be good and if i think it's going to be bad that's what i've noticed with the content but the reason i wasn't here is so let me tell you this funny story about twitter so four months ago three months ago i tweeted out that i wanted to go drive race cars so one of my 2021's resolution was i wanted to do more adventurous stuff so i want to take a sniper class lesson i want to go hunting yeah i wanted to go hunting and kill what i've eaten which i've never done before i wanted to do a cross-country trip i did it and i wanted to go learn how to do a race cars and so i tweeted out i wanted to go to a driving class this professional nascar driver named parker hollered at me on twitter and so me and jack butcher who's a buddy of ours and a buddy of mine we drove up here out to the country two hours outside of new york to connecticut and we took this class it was twenty five hundred dollars it was at this place called skip barber skip barber driving driving class we met the owner of the class this is a business that uh that's a driving school it does like 15 million in revenue crazy interesting kind of cool it it it was an ex-cop owns it like a like a new york cop like in this like his was he's like i'll just try it because i don't work as a cop anymore it turns into a thriving business he told me his goal is to hit 200 million in revenue in the next five years off this one track or like he has many of these so here's what they do so it's called skip barber racing it's like a famous brand it's from the 60s he bought it out of bankruptcy i imagine he paid like low hundreds of thousands of dollars and you bought the brand name it's basically a website where they get leads so skip barber if you're into cars it's like a famous racing school he owns the website and so people go and submit leads at where they want to go and they go and find like tracks throughout the country and they rent like 20 days at the track and they show up with their tractor trailer with like 20 mustangs that you can that they drive and then it's like a traveling circus they go from place to place to place to place it was pretty interesting so what'd you drive it's by the way i know nothing about cars so you're gonna say something and i'll be like oh cool no no no no no no it looks like a mustang but it's like it's a race car so there's no seats you're locked in you wear a helmet you're locked in what about like seats there's only a driving seat like the inside it's like a it is a it's a race car there's a roll bar there's no like ac or radio or anything like that but it looks like a mustang from the outside anyway that's what it was crazy fascinating business that's pretty cool um while you were saying that you said something about he used to be a cop and we had talked about the retired the mafia tours in new york business i'm going on it a great idea so if you don't if you didn't hear that episode it's basically retired cop in new york takes you on a walking tour of new york city to the different like areas where the mafia families lived it kind of tells you stories it's like we all like crime tv shows or whatever and uh and this is like basically crime tv walking tour um and so you get to hear all these stories i guess you're going on it that's cool and we had said he he had done over a million dollars in sales on his airbnb experience uh of doing this which is pretty freaking awesome so um this thing you're talking about though uh i think there could be a really cool version of that that somebody makes which is basically a cops and robbers like a cop chase a car chase basically so they could just have a a driver who knows what they're doing as the kind of like main driver and you get to be in a cop car like they just take some junk cop car and you get to drive that thing you get to like be talking on the little radio try to get their license plate and it's basically like a you know controlled simulation of a car a cop chase like a actual cop chase you go you get them you spin them out then you get out of the car and you get like you arrest them as the end of it and i feel like that would just be a super fun and be a lot of people would pay for that and the video of it i uh yeah so we p i paid twenty five hundred dollars for this i think i paid an additional three hundred dollars for a video for the video of course yeah uh man it was awesome it's fun it's fun to do this stuff to get out of our comfort zone and do exciting stuff uh so that's where i was nice uh okay i love that all right let's do uh let's do some ideas i have an idea that's kind of related to this so i was watching uh dana white who's the president of the ufc and uh he was doing this like youtube video and he's like boys uh no not that one there was this one who just goes check out how sick my hotel room is right now in houston did you see this yep and he had a go go ahead describe it and i'll tell you the part if i remember correctly he had a movie theater in his hotel room i think he had a full or no half-size basketball court yep that was painted like the rockets basketball court with the official scoreboard on the on this on the wall and stuff and what else did he have he had a bunch of stuff so he had that he had like a full gym like so you know like hotels have a gym his hotel room had a gym which is kind of amazing and then he's got like whatever cool bed bathroom full steam room but the thing i thought was interesting he goes check this out and he grabs this huge rifle off the wall there's like a rifle a shotgun sitting next to each other and he was like this is cool it's like a virtual shooting range yeah and then he like and he pan they kind of pan over they went over real quick so i couldn't even really see what it was but in my head i just immediately thought of you've seen these like golf driving ranges that are basically it's a green screen and then you swing a real club and you hit a real ball into the green screen and it like simulates where it would have landed if you were on a real golf course and um those are like semi-popular so he's got this rifle off the wall and i started thinking oh that's kind of cool basically if you've ever held a real gun it feels totally different than like you know the duck hunt gun or like an arcade gun like a real gun has like weight to it it has like a recoil if you fire the thing so i was thinking somebody could probably build a high-end version of this niche business which is basically virtual shooting ranges so you have a either a screen like a green screen or like a plasma like a big flat train tv and then you give them like what feels like a real gun but it's like a digitally enabled thing so you don't have to have bullets and go outside do all that stuff and i feel like somebody could build a pretty unique business doing that providing that either to bars or even for at home stuff or corporate events that's a fantastic idea have you ever been to an indoor shooting range indoor shooting oh like where the target's there and you have the earmuffs on or whatever yeah i got it okay it's miserable so i've only got outdoors so i the outdoor shooting ranges are fun indoor shooting rains miserable it has lights like a hospital and it is so loud have you ever been next to like an ar-15 or something like you know like a huge gun when it shoots it rattles your neighbor so you're standing right next to someone and it's not just loud but it shakes me and it's a miserable unsafe horrible experience i would way rather do something fun like this over that yeah so and i feel like because it's digital you can do fun stuff right so when i went to go shoot a gun for the first time i'm not into that my brother my brother-in-law is he um you know we went and it's like you're outside it was kind of cold you're shooting these like paper targets they don't move uh you have to stand still every five minutes have to stop reload the [ __ ] gun takes time like just take a lot of breaks in between the action the action is fun but like there's a lot of other stuff going on it was it was uncomfortable and uh and i get that like you know real man [ __ ] not supposed to be comfortable but guess what people like comfort so um so i think what you can do instead is you basically make a souped-up version of the deer hunter game where you get the digital gun but it feels like the weight of a real rifle or a real shotgun and then you have like a digital scenario right you wanted to do a sniper class or i don't know what you said like a psychopath but like you probably want to like simulate actually like sniping someone at a like situation in some situation like you can only see part of their head they're really far away or whatever so you could do that instead of just a paper target so i think this could be a good idea i'm sure something like this exists but it's all about turning it into a business in a box or a traveling circus like you said and like coming up with a model that that productizes this better i think it's a great idea and i would love to i would love to attend all right let's do another one you uh can you pick either one or one for mine this is a little bit less of an idea but more of an experience that i had so last week i went down to nashville i had an issue a few weeks ago where i had a car problem i had to leave my car at the dealer in nashville i went to go pick it up and i started shooting the [ __ ] with the salesperson they sold he told me this is this is a mercedes-benz music city dealership that's what it's called they told me that they sold 200 cars in june is that does that boggle your mind i never really thought about how many cars that is that's 20 million dollars in car sales right in one month that's crazy to me and so i went and looked at what the figures were for uh what how many cars are sold june to january because i would think january or february would be a slow month it's mostly pretty steady it's like 1.6 million on a high month and 1.2 million on a low low month it's not crazy different so if you assume that the average sale price was a hundred thousand dollars and then you assume that they did 20 million dollars for six of the months and 15 million dollars for the other six of uh six months that's 210 million dollars in one location and then i was talking with the guys who ran the the company who ran the dealership they told me that they can expect to make 10 to 15 profit on that does that kind of boggle your mind that one location can do that much in sales and was this like did you feel like it was like an outlier location like killer killer real estate or something like that it's a mercedes dealer in nashville and there's three in the city so did i think that that's an outlier in one sense yes because they're selling you know expensive cars so like it's not like a hyundai where you're selling 20 000 cars but it's and it's also in nashville there's probably 10 to 20 cities in america that are of equal booming as nashville so outlier in one sense yes but not crazy outlier and so i got interested in this and so there's this amazing website called open secrets have you heard of that i've i've heard of it but i've never gone to it why do you you actually go to it it's like wikileaks or something i go to it all the time and here's why so if you go to it you can go it's called open secrets maybe opensecrets.org and so i don't know if it's legal or if it's customary but if you are a senator if you're in the house of representatives if you're in a certain type of office in america they typically disclose their income taxes and also what their net worth is and you could browse through and you could see how much money they have in different bank accounts you can see how much money they have in different stocks you can see how much money they value their privately held business it's incredibly fascinating so for example if you google open secrets net worth senators you'll see a list of the richest senators and it will tell you where their money is and you can click it and in some cases if it's from the 90s for example if you go and look at george bush's net worth you could actually see it's it's still a handwritten w-2 so it's incredibly fascinating and i browse through there uh a fair bit because i think it's really fun who cares what if they're politicians or not but what's interesting is that they're incredibly wealthy and you can see how do people allocate money where does their income come from how does that work and i noticed that there was a fair bit of people who made money through car dealerships in congress and i actually made a list of them so the first one vernon buchanan he's out he's a congressman out of florida 157 million dollar net worth where does his money come from buchanan automotive group where they sell new and used cars in florida and he assigned 50 million i just go through this list i did not realize these senators there's this many senators that are this wealthy so first the funny funny thing is there's the richest and poorest so okay on the top side you have mark warner richest senator uh he's in virginia i think and at 214 million poorest senator poor alcy hastings in florida negative 7.5 million dollar net worth this guy is in a hall of debt this guy is just and you know the the the lowest one that is non-negative let's see probably like a hundred grand or something like a pete dude or something i'm exporting all these csvs this is gonna be great uh go go on sorry so i went and looked at some of the congress folks that were that were rich and it was vernon buchanan he owns an automotive group he has signed uh around 35 million of his net worth sorry uh almost 100 million dollars of his net worth to car dealerships ron williams from texas net worth 67 million dollars he had close to 10 million dollars because he uh is part owner of a chrysler dodge and jeep business john campbell net worth of 23 million dollars he owns franchises for nissan mazda ford saturn and saab and mike kelly net worth 20 million dollars he assigned at least five million dollars for his car dealers it was incredibly fascinating so i dug even deeper this nashville dealer do you want to know who's the co-owner who nick saban the uh coach from university of alabama and he owns a bunch of them he owns three four or five crazy fascinating to me about the car dealers and i i was just so curious as to how the rest of them do and so i did a little bit more research and i read different interviews with car dealers and typically they make about five ten percent in profit but the secret is that hey they have to make most of their money from service and parts because that's where the big margin is and b there's actually there's actually a lot of ways that you can test this so you can do loads of test advertising and they kind of do this like mvp style advertising where they'll advertise in different places see which cars sell and then become an importer or sorry a dealer of that particular car uh i just thought it was so fascinating about how these car car dealerships work have you ever uh like do you know anything about this first of all you're on fire right now so i just got to give you a little bit of credit you're on fire right now i don't know if this is jake the researcher i don't know if this is sam the the deal hunter i don't know what's going on but good job i love this i love open secrets i love the senator thing and i love the car dealership thing all right so let me just put that on the table have i thought about this no but it's been hidden in plain sight i grew up in colorado and john elloway always had dealerships it was like everywhere and i just i never really thought about it but like clearly the guy was making bank on these dealerships otherwise he wouldn't be spending so much time and energy doing all these little kind of marketing meet and greets at his dealerships and that combo of like local hero car dealership i think has just worked for a long time like in the movie little giants i think the guy that's how the guy had his money too is like local football star you know car dealer is like just like a formula that works and um i know that like there's like the guy who's who gets a lot of press during um whenever the toronto raptors do well they have this super fan uh this sikh indian guy who who uh shows up at court side of every game nav back to you i actually have him listed here so he started as a hyundai sales person and he eventually started owning a car dealership and he claims his net worth is 50 million dollars exactly and he spends all of his money traveling with the team and buying courtside tickets to every single game this guy's like a maniac um he goes to every single game and he has for like 20 years courtside and he's like cheering like crazy and yeah he started as a salesman you're right um okay so this is kind of interesting i want to share with you a couple things that i can add to this have you ever heard it and by the way if you scroll down you can see all the examples i have of people who have made at least a billion dollars to car dealers you see that this is pretty impressive so the benson family they on the saints uh penske wayne hazard you love that guy he started with autonation yeah and he owns uh he owns the miami dolphins yeah that guy's a baller we should we should feature him you know a lot about him um well mark wahlberg has one michael jordan has one all right that's pretty interesting so that's cool i didn't really realize that this is like one of those franchises that you kind of want to own um i wonder if that's changing so in my head i'm like car dealer isn't this dead like aren't car sales just moving online and then you have platforms like carvana that's like become like a seven billion dollar company of like buying cars online so definitely some some of buying cars moving online um but i but not all and so i actually ran into this company called modal have you ever heard of modal tell me about it the url is just modalup.com and uh a buddy of mine is uh samir uh this great guy samir bala he basically he was gonna do a startup and then i checked his linkedin and he's like oh i'm ceo of modal now i was like what the heck you took a job and i was like if this guy took a job this must be an interesting business because he would not go join a company unless he thought this company had like really good prospects and i trust his judgment and so i i should have invested i asked them to invest i even made room and then i got cold feet at the last minute for some stupid reason but basically i think this is a great business what they do is they basically made it so that any dealer it's like shopify for car dealers in a way so it basically lets you sell cars digitally and online so it creates like a website a checkout button a buy button that you can just send customers to that that that want to buy from you it also just like automates all the workflows so like with buying a car when you go buy a car you're gonna end up sitting in the dealership for like an hour because there's like the paperwork if you're if you're doing a loan or a lease you have to do even more paperwork and then um you know you just have to like collect all these signatures and get all this stuff to get the title in your name and these guys basically turned all that into software and they were growing uh really really well basically going to car dealerships and getting them to adopt this software so that they could keep up and compete with the kind of like online only platforms it's like hey don't don't stay stuck in the brick and mortar only ways yes you're a car dealership but you should allow some digitalization digital digitalize your workflow and let your customers go check out online and just buy products and what they do is they actually claim that they can you know boost sales by like you know 30 35 or something like that and it shortens the cycle time because usually people take quite a while to look through stuff and they um they speed up the the purchase price the purchase time as well so i think this is a pretty cool business that's going to be quite big i i'm on board with all the digital stuff i was just fascinating at just the brick and mortar and it's i it's still growing like crazy in fact there's loads of data on this because i didn't realize how impactful cars are i mean of course i you know we all have them but i didn't realize how they kind of in in a sense are minor maybe major players in the country in our country and how we even develop laws things like that and and so there's all this data that you can go and learn about this so the average car dealership like the physical dealer the average one in last year 2021 did 36 million or sorry year-to-date so the first six months 36 million dollars in sales in uh just the average car dealer and we sell something like um yeah but that's like gmv that's like car sales so you know they don't you said 10 10 to 15 maybe is their margin on that so that's correct million you know take for the for the whole dealership it's still astounding and then if you can also go and look at uh another website you can go to it's pro republica and you can see which lobbies give money to the government for different laws car dealer or the car lobby which there's like eight of them they give substantial amounts of money and anyway that's my that's my segment on car dealers and cars pretty astounding i was shocked by it we can move on you know what's cool by the way tesla no no dealership model so bold move by them to not have any dealers and in doing so basically kept a lot of the profit for themselves and went direct to consumer they were the sort of first direct to consumer car company uh that exists so so good job bye bye elon yeah and i could see that taking off but the market is massive not everyone's going to do the same thing um and so there's room for everyone for a lot of always holding it down for for blue collar america i love it you know in my mind it's just two coasts squished together with some stuff in the middle and you're like no no the middle is there's a lot of beautiful stuff in the middle and it's not all just going away and becoming like fancy tech right away not yet at least all right uh let's do some more so look at my topics here and tell me which one's interesting spoon flowers one of the most interesting things i've seen lately had you heard of this before spoonflower no no check it out i don't even know the url i think this is they saw they sold for 225 million dollars so i i got familiar with this because uh for a clothing company that we were working on uh we needed to look at patterns and i was like where do you find patterns online and you can find patterns in many places but one place was spoonflower so this is basically a marketplace where you have on one side designers who come up with like let's say a nice floral pattern or sunflower pattern and then you can take those so like i think your mother-in-law is doing like a pillow business and so she can go on spoonflower and say oh i really like this fabric swatch pattern um i want to basically buy this pattern and turn it into pillows i want to buy this pattern and turn it into wallpaper and so you can use it for all the things that patterns go on wallpaper you know like mats pillowcases whatever different stuff like that blankets curtains [ __ ] like that so it's this like niche marketplace you most people haven't even heard of and then you go there and you see it and you're like oh this makes total sense and so they sold for 225 million to shutterfly um i thought it was really cool and just like kind of this niche product that's been around for a while that's sold and then i wanted to share also a growth hack but what's your kind of like first reaction to this i think this is brilliant i'm looking at it right now there's a few reasons why i like this company the first is that i believe it's based in north carolina i like things that are not in silicon valley not in the heart i think they're not in the heart of uh technology uh hubs i think that's amazing there's so many wonderful things about this business it's just i mean it's a win-win-win type of company where where you help people make money you help people get what they want the company spoonflower makes a little bit of cash i'm into it right and it was started in 2008 so it's been around for a while and it's one of these that like like most marketplaces marketplaces are extremely valuable when you get them to work but they can take time to work because you have to get that to keep cranking the wheel of supply and demand to get it to work you need enough designs and enough designers and enough buyers and then you have to keep like do a lot of manual stuff to make that work so one thing i liked um this guy who listens to the pod adam adam keisling i think is how you say his name uh he was talking about um this deal and he was pointing out this like uh this method that they used to grow and he's like i'll just share with you a couple things he pointed out so spoonflower uh 3.3 million unique artists uh 4 000 new designs uploaded on average every day so that's a pretty crazy scale and what they did was they would do design challenges and so um spoonflower would host a design challenge and then the top 50 voted popular voted designs would get featured as the winner's circle and it would get to the top of the website and then if you go to the website you click like you know oh let me see the best halloween designs uh that would drive like 95 of the sales to a lot of the creators so it was kind of feast or famine you would you take your shot to get noticed but if you got noticed you would get a ton of inbound sales um for for those uh for those contests right and there might just be like a thousand or two thousand people participating in each one and so i thought this is a pretty smart model of how they bootstrap the marketplace so they're like all right we need uh buyers want content for halloween how do i get a bunch of designers to make the right halloween content and make it all make a bunch of new ideas that are unique you can only find them on spoonflower i'll host this contest and the haunted contest winners get like i don't know hundreds of dollars thousands of dollars doesn't have to be too much money um and they get exposure through that through that process and then he was adam was sharing that like uh you know food 52 that they used to do the same thing when they were seeding their marketplace of recipes right they had chefs uploading recipes and then people coming to download them um they would they created a contest called your best recipe using fresh mozzarella right so give me your best mozzarella recipe and then you know they would get whole foods to sponsor it and get a gift card and then they're like the grand prize is a thousand dollars right and so they would keep doing these contests around things that people were searching for in order to see the marketplace with the right content so i thought that was a cool learning as well from this this is amazing and what's even more interesting or as interesting is that shutterfly bought them i i forgot about shutterfly i just looked them up shutterfly i think they got did they did they get de-listed they were public they had a two billion dollar market cap and like close to two billion dollars in revenue right and so one uh that's a complicated that's a that's a crazy space the show that where shutterfly is so you know good luck good luck to them spoon flowers badass can we um can i tell you something that surprised me uh so so the other day rihanna was named a billionaire that's pretty amazing right yeah i think that's amazing and so i i got curious i started working with jake i was like what other celebrities have gotten rich in ways that i wouldn't really have known right away and it kind of got i kind of got this youtube this is going to be a youtube segment right here 10 celebrities that got rich not from their fame well it's it is a little bit extended from the fame but i'm gonna give you six of them so the first you know who jimmy buffett is you're not you're not white so you may not be in a jimmy buffett i've heard the name but if you said point here's five old white guys point out jimmy buffett i would just point to the far right i have no idea so jimmy buffett i don't even know how to just explain them white 60 year olds who wear tommy bahama do you even know what that is yes i know that one uh okay white 60 year olds who wear tommy bahama love him he's the guy who created a cheeseburger in paradise that song so he also had this album called margaritaville it's all about the caribbean and being on a boat and like living this like parrot style life i think that's parrotheads is what he's called so he's got margaritaville it's a subsidiary of cheeseburger holding company which is pretty funny he's got 30 restaurants and he has vacation clubs hotels uh a retirement village and tequila collectively the holdings do something like two billion dollars a year in sales is that crazy then you also probably don't know about this one this isn't in your wheelhouse but dolly parton do you know dolly parton is that his girlfriend who is this you don't know who dolly parton is again i've heard the name if you showed me five old white ladies i couldn't point out dolly parton so dolly parton was a famous country singer but she did more than just country have you uh heard the song i will always love you by whitney houston yes she wrote that she wrote working nine to five which has been covered many times she's just a hit maker but she was famous you probably remember photos of her she's in her probably close to 80s now 70s but she's famous for having blonde hair and huge boobs uh you definitely like remember her she has famous phrases like you wouldn't you wouldn't be you'd be amazed at how much money it cost to look this cheap she's got phrases like that but she's actually a great person and she uh has an empire person well she's like you know well she's like she's known for her philanthropy and for doing good she she gives back to the community she seems like a wonderful person and it's kind of a joke that she looks cheap that's like her joke um right but it's estimated that she has a net worth of like 600 million dollars and i was driving through the smokies recently just two weeks ago and i drove through gatlinburg tennessee which is a small town in the mountains of tennessee and right outside of that she has a [ __ ] theme park it's called dollywood her name is dolly parton he has dollywood there's rides it's a huge deal it's amazing they've got uh just imagine six flags but it's all about dolly parton and it's called dollywood it's amazing you know we're like 15 years away from like paul world in in la and it's the paul brothers uh you know version of disney world that's what's gonna happen here they are our dolly partons of our generation it could be so i'm shocked you've never heard of dollyworth dollywort dollyworld you've never heard of that dollywood no no it's a huge thing it's very big like it's like a mini six flags it's not even a mini six flags it's almost as big as six flags and people in the south i'm from missouri i lived in tennessee so i'm kind of southern people in the south are obsessed with it that's where you go on vacation you go to dollywood and you actually go to a lot of different casinos in the south you'll see dolly parton themed uh casinos casinos it's crazy all right another one sammy hagar that doesn't ring a bell either to you does it nah this is just a humiliation session god that's so funny van halen do you know what van halen is i heard dude you are god that's so funny okay so sammy hagar uh from van halen he sold a tequila company for around 80 million dollars and it was a tequila brand and i'll just tell you two quick ones you don't know any of these people it's all just like white basic people kate hudson you know i know kate hudson but i see her athletics written here she what does she have to do with fabletics she helped start it she was one of the co-founders okay i didn't know that crazy right uh your wife probably wears it i mean it's like a uh they they sell fancy tights right right 2020 revenue 500 million dollars wild and then finally she owns 20 of it yeah i know jessica alba yeah so 20 meaningful um and finally jessica alba started or helped start the honest company it just ipo'd it's got a market cap north of a billion dollars i believe and her stake around 130 million dollars it's pretty amazing right i like it um yeah so what do what do you think is like the best model so what do we see here we saw like entertainment so hotels uh casinos you know like kind of like amusement parks then we saw basically like makeup company skincare company you know fragrance company and alcohol brand um which one do you like or do you think there's another one that they're celebrities are sort of leaving on the table uh alcohol seems like the best conor mcgregor recently did it he sold um proper 12. i believe his steak was worth around 100 million dollars i think alcohol is the the best one because you can charge 50 for a bottle of a certain type of alcohol and there's a chance that someone will want to buy that many times a month so i think alcohol is interesting makeup's okay i don't obviously don't know anything about that rihanna crushed it her brand is killing it it's called uh what's it called fenty and she's got she's got she's got a couple brands they kill it but i think alcohol is number one although i do think that there's a world if i was a lance armstrong and i've told him he should have done this when he was on the podcast if i was a lance armstrong a michael phelps something like that i would 100 partner with a hotel brand and do fitness focused hotels and try to have branded a branded pool or a branded pool instruction that you could do in that pool like a workout or do a cycling branded hotel i think that would crush and i think you could make money for every year for 50 years doing that right yeah i think doing something that's on brand is kind of the key like sam harris doing this with a um sam harris did this with a uh a meditation app right because that's what's on brand for him if sam harris came out with alcohol or like you know like a skincare line no thank you but sam harris with the meditation app that could work and i think that thing prints money it does and so i've heard um all right you want to do a few more yeah dan has one on here by the way uh george clooney making a billion dollars with casa amigos uh tequila um somebody told me this story i i didn't plan to say this i don't know if it's true or not i might be making it up uh george have you heard this george clooney giving his friends a million dollars each no so so george clooney uh this is the story so so george clooney um at one point in time he was like you know when i i think he was thinking like when um when i retire when i die like i want to basically give some of my wealth to my friends because these friends are like some of the best people in my life i used to sleep on their couch when i was like trying to make it and they really like helped me in one way or another all these friends have helped me and then he decided like okay why am i gonna wait till i die like that doesn't make any sense and so he invited them all to like a dinner or like a dinner at his like whatever cabin or something like that i'm making up a lot of these details but what i was told was he invites them all to a dinner and he brings 14 briefcases or like suitcases a tumi suitcase actually each one was filled with a million dollars in cash and he invited them over for dinner and he gave each of them the suitcase and they each just got a million dollars from him and he was like um you know i've been through some hard times and you know i want you to not have to worry about your kids your mortgage or school whatever it is um you know here you go enjoy and i was like that is a baller move i love that why haven't i heard this story before i think that's kind of amazing and that actually is uh comes to a point i've actually been reading about this lately so there's this great book and this concept called die with zero have you heard of this no but i get the idea just off the title so it's a good title yeah so it's called die with zero and the idea that we all have is i wanna try to earn money and when i die i've got something to give away to my family if you don't have family i can give away to causes that i care about and this whole concept behind die with zero is why would you do that and regardless if you believe in heaven or not i i don't what i think when i i was like well when i die it's gonna feel like just how it felt like before i was born right nothing and how did it feel like before i was born nothing so do i really care about a legacy like do i care about what people are saying about like tim about me when i'm you know pre-born feeling right of course no i don't care so if i'm gonna and that's not he actually doesn't say that in the book that's my that's me but the point of the book is all right why would you care so much about what what you're gonna do when you're dead just give it to people or your friends like do that plan before you die and enjoy it with your your friends and family create a giving plan now if giving matters to you create a google plan now and do execute on it now and not when you're dead right two scenarios scenario one you wait till you're 88 years old 92 years old you pass away then there's a will reading and you know a couple of your friends are there they're also in their 88 88 to 92 year old range uh and your kids are there and their kids are there whatever and you pass you know you pass along some money to them and your 88 year old friend is like oh thanks for the thanks for the million dollars george appreciate it like it'll go straight to my like you know yeah you know like what do i need this for uh and your kids are also like cool could use that when i was paying off student debt for years or like wanted to start a business uh but now that i'm 42 i'm glad that uh i'm 45 years i'm glad i got this this inheritance from you thank you um and so so that's scenario one scenario two you invite your friends over for dinner you bring us to me suitcase with a million dollars in it and you say when i eat we all eat let's go and uh and basically you you hook up the people who have helped you and it mattered to you and you helped their lives today because why wait 40 years and let them have more discomfort or suffering along the way when you could if you're trying to give to make an impact impact today is worth a lot more than impact 45 years from now and um and so i'm a big believer in this i hadn't really thought about it until i heard this george clooney story but when i heard it i was like oh and you know my friends if i invite you to a dinner in a cabin and i show up with 14 suitcases like you know what's happening and i'm about to join cleaning your ass because that's what's going on and i really have taken this mindset of of when i eat we all eat um i i really think it's a lot more fun to to live that way um the other the other this little story i'll share uh i was talking to my trainer and i was like i was like so uh i called him jay i was like yo jay so you like you know about my goals my dreams you're helping me get there because you're my coach like and you talk about like you want to spin up your business you're starting this fashion line great like uh what's your like what is your dream though like we do this imagination exercise you know what i'm imagining for myself and we we love that feeling and we use that what's yours and and he has this thing which is you don't imagine the outcome so like let's say you wanted to be rich you don't imagine selling your company to hubspot and looking in your bank account seeing x dollars you imagine like the congratulatory conversation like once it happens you won't be so fixated on it happening your life will just be different because it happened right so you might imagine you know um your call you know you might imagine your friend calling you congratulating you on the deal or you might imagine booking a trip because you have all this free time now and so you don't imagine the money you imagine what happens after you had it and you you know there's the sort of implied state so anyways his was oh i imagine getting a text from my mom saying you know son thank you for the six thousand dollars this month like that's huge for me like uh you know i'm so grateful to have a son like you thank you so much and then so he he was talking about that i was like oh that's cool so instead of saying i want to be a millionaire so that i can forgive my mom something he imagines the text from his mom and then that got him thinking so the next day he goes and he sends her six hundred dollars he's like like i can't send her six thousand every month right now but i can send her 600 today and then he showed me the text he got the next morning and it was literally like almost word for word what he had told me in the garage he was like she had she texted him she's like son i don't know what what i did to deserve such a blessing of a son like you the money you sent me you don't even know i needed that uh like it's gonna go to exactly what i need thank you so much like you know i love you so much son i hope you're you know i hope you're doing well and i was like damn that was kind of cool to see it come together and i love that he didn't wait until it was all done to start the giving plan all right so since you were talking about giving money away i saw that you wrote something pretty funny in our document called the jewish hacked to wealth markets fuzz i totally agree with you i have so many by the way i don't even have more to say that's just kind of it i have i've i my my wife is from a jewish family i've got a lot of my jewish friends i am so envious of how the comm and at my wedding when we all of our jewish guests they gave us significant checks i also think it's a new york thing or i don't know if it's a new york thing or a jewish thing but my missouri friends would give a hundred dollars our jewish new yorker friends would give a thousand dollars right and it was amazing and i think that there's something in the in in that particular community where you give a significant amount of money for gifts so you can help one another out and and money kind of flows a little bit more freely getting eight or five thousand dollars or something when you're 16 years old or 15 years old i've talked to some kids that's like how a lot of like interesting businesses have been started they said the user bart mitzvah money i completely agree [Laughter] yeah i uh i don't know how many jews there are in the world i think there's like 10 million jews something like that like like 20 i think 14 yeah something like that 14 20 million not a lot but jewish people have they punch above their weight they have a lot of impact they have a lot of power they have a lot of success and i don't think it's genetic i think it's cultural i think basically there's a strong foundation of basically like helping each other out so everything from birthright right like a free basically all expense paid trip to your home country at one point in your life that's kind of an amazing program and that keeps the instead of the brain drain and people just sort of like leaving and not having this like emotional tie to the culture no that one transformed experience keeps people tied in um there's you know bar mitzvah right so like i have i don't know how many times i've heard yeah i just took all my bar mitzvah money and uh i used that to like start the business or i used that to like start investing in the stock market and like like my buddy he had i think i don't feel like 12 grand or something like 10 grand from his bar mitzvah uh like money something like that like when he was whatever i don't know how old you are 13 or something when it happens and by the time we were in college he was like he's like got a [ __ ] portfolio of a quarter million dollars and i'm like what how do you have all this money he's like oh yeah it's just been compounding for for you know for for 10 years basically and he's like yeah one of the guys you know our family friend who gave us the thing he didn't even give me cash he gave me straight stock of this one biotech company uh that he really believed and the biotech company has like 10xed in the seven year period and uh yeah so like i have you know what do we want to do i got 200 000 if we wanted to start a business and i was like man what a hack and so two things i think it's amazing i think more culture should do this i also had heard a pretty interesting idea of like you know universal basic income so it's like this idea of like every year you give people some amount of money ten thousand dollars a year or whatever i don't know what the proposed numbers are but some amount of money is your universal basic income like social security for all people um and it's like pretty expensive and so some people think it's great some people think it's bad i don't really know i don't really care but i do think this other idea i heard was better which was um what if you got a birth dividend so let's say every u.s citizen when you're born um the government or whoever puts 2 500 in your account could be 2500 or 5 000 something like that so from age zero to and you can't touch it until you're 21. um so age zero to 21 you uh you have this thing compounding and if something's compounding over 21 years it's going to you know double probably at least i think three times so three to four times and so you know everybody walking out at 21 years old would have 15 to 20 20 000 um ready for them to to do whatever they want as a as a cushion for life as a way to start something as a way to fund a creative pursuit if they want to be an artist or whatever and i thought that was a pretty powerful idea and like a great sort of one-time bonus for every citizen and then it's invested so it's actually fueling the economy um so it's not like universal basic income where you get it you might save it you might spend it you don't know what you'll do but it's going to be invested in like an index for for 21 years and then in doing that everyone is uh bought into a particular type of thing and so that way even if you have um different opinions so i think that we should do this i think we should do that that's cool but at least we all have a little bit even just a tiny bit of skin of the game and so we're incentivized in a similar way and everybody would learn about investing and compounding and like the the benefit of of time in market uh right time and market is the most important thing right there's the buffett phrase time in market is over but i i take that over timing the market and so if you once you've been in the market for 21 years and you look at that account and you get to see it going up you're gonna like realize the value of investing and that that's you know like the true path to to wealth if you just do more of that whereas if you never get started then you never really feel it real and so i think that's a big benefit i think we should have the american but mitzvah fund that's actually a great idea that's that's that's that's incredibly interesting um all right maybe we want to do one last one um tell me about aubrey de grey because uh i i've known a little bit about this i've known a little bit about him i've listened to podcasts with this guy i believe he's an he's an anti-aging doctor and professor yes so this is a funny story i find it funny other people are gonna be like how could you say that's funny the funny it's ironic i went on twitter last night as i do and i see this tweet that says aubry de gray is a sexual predator i don't know who aubrey de gray is so i'm like but that's a bold tweet okay what are you talking about so you know my my my gossip the gossip part of me starts starts getting excited so i click it i start trying to see what's going on and basically two things happened i found out that this person audrey de grey has you know kind of like i don't know exactly what they've done but made people feel uncomfortable at the least and maybe sexually harass people at the most i'm not 100 sure but basically two women who were who are in that field laura denning and i forgot the other person's name they came out yesterday or recently this week something like that and they published stories saying aubrey to gray you know made me feel uncomfortable maybe you know said things to me that were totally inappropriate abusive power and the organization that funds him knew about this covered it up because he was so important for fundraising and for the science of this because he's been basically like a lifelong uh leader of this movement of of anti-aging so i see that then i'm like all right who's this i just want to see what he looks like what was his zombie degree guy he's got this huge beard have you seen him yes he looks like um a little bit like uh there was a what's the famous uh philosopher from the soviet union no uh not nostradamus rasputin yeah yeah yeah yeah he looks like you know gandalf or dumbledore or something like that you know he looks like you know of that lineage you know he you wouldn't be surprised if he's dumbledore's cousin so he uh i i see him and i'm like oh that's interesting what's this guy like all about uh what is he a big deal and i i click and i so two things one i click and i listen to this ted talk and ironically the funniest thing in the ted talk was at the end somebody asked a question uh and they go if you're so into anti-aging why do you try to look like an old man that was hilarious um the second the thing is this guy is pretty fascinating very charismatic very weird and very interesting and the whole topic of anti-aging is fascinating and so i know yesterday was like he's getting canceled and like you know he probably did some [ __ ] up things i don't really know the guy's character maybe he's a bad guy i have no idea but this topic of anti-aging and that was ironic that that was my entry point into it but i was blown away by what's going on in this field so i wanted to kind of share this with you i basically wanted to like summarize this guy's ted talk uh for you in like two minutes um so he gives his ted talk back in 2005 and he's talking a million miles a minute i talk fast he talks ten times faster than me and he's got these slides that are the white with black text and then like red font callouts of like his opinion uh so he took like you know 12 minutes to make these slides but they're actually very effective at communicating and so he he basically gives us talk he goes um aging and illness and death are you know uh people think today that these are um inevitable and that they are okay and that they're good um i don't think any of those things are true i do not think it's inevitable i think we will defeat aging i think we'll we'll be able to live thousands of years i do not think they're good and i do not um i think we should just sit by and just let let you know 150 000 people die every day that was like how he starts right so you're like okay tell me more he's like first i'm going to tell you about the bad arguments against what i'm trying to say right by the end of this i'm going to convince you that it's not only possible it is probable that we're going to do this um and i'll tell you how but before that i'll convince you i'll let me get rid of some of these really bad arguments he's like bad argument number one um oh we'd be so bored if we didn't die right uh bad argument number two is oh the population will get too big uh and humans are bad for the earth or whatever right he goes through these arguments he kind of like debunks each one of them very quickly he's basically like look what we want to do is we want to be healthy for a long time right we're not just trying to be old and like dependent and feeble for a long time we want to be healthy for a long time and he's like here's what's going on in this field and so this was kind of just for me i didn't know any of this so he's like there's two schools he's like first why do we die and he's like why do we die we die for two reasons he's like to live our body does all these metabolic processes basically like heating your body cooling your body immune system digesting food like you know learning growing building muscle uh all these are metabolic processes we do them to live and just like any machinery like a car or a factory the more you use the machinery the more like the as the physics of the thing moving happens damage happens over time it accumulates and eventually the thing breaks and stops working so he goes living creates damage damage is happening all the time and then eventually the damage kills your cells and then you die and he's like all right so there's two schools of thought school thought number one is that let's stop the damage prevent damage right prevention is better than the cure and he's like bad idea we barely even know how metabolism works and it's highly unlikely that you're going to be able to keep the high function of the machine running and like stop damage from happening damage seems kind of like inevitable um if the machine's gonna run and he's like that's called whatever one school of thought doesn't matter what this call what the name is he's like there's another called geriatrics a geriatrics basically is like cool damage happens but how do we like either repair damage or uh or like limit the damage so that it doesn't kill your cells and he's like that's where i think this is gonna work so here's like this guy's case on how this is going to work he goes we are going to reach a point where we have a therapy called human rejuvenation rejuvenation therapy hjr i think rhr hrt or something like that i don't know what he calls it human rejuvenation therapy let's just call it that for sure he's like basically you're gonna he's like what we know is that you're living by the way is this boring or should i keep going no i'm looking at uh i'm looking at what he's saying now as you go keep going okay so so basically he's saying like he's like one thing we notice is that the damage is happening from the day we're born right your cell's function you damage but you don't really feel the effects until you're like middle-aged or getting older so 40 50 60 that's when you start to the damage starts to accumulate the cells start to die and that's when brain function slows down muscle function slows down reaction time slows down he's like so it there's this like point where there's too much damage so we need to give you a therapy before then he's like we can't just like modify your dna so there's no damage happening what we need to do is by the time you're 30 or 40 we need to be able to give you something that's gonna like repair the damage that's happening uh faster than the damage is happening and he's like that's how we're gonna solve this number two we're gonna solve it first in mice before we solve it in humans he goes mouse lives two years the test is gonna be can you get the mouse to live five years but here's the trick you can't breed the mouse differently you have to let the mouse live normally for 18 months and then you have to give them something at 18 months that extends life by two years that's going to be the test and he's actually put up like a million and a half dollar prize or whatever like there's a multi-million dollar prize for anybody that can do that you have to do a test where it's like an x prize it's like let a mouse live for 18 months give him a therapy and now his life needs to be extended and in the control where you don't give the mouse the thing he needs to die six months later as planned and um so that's like the that's the breaking point he's like once we figure out how to do that then like 10 15 20 years later or something like that we'll be able to translate that into humans but we don't know how to do it in mice yet um he's like right now we can extend their life a few months but not years he goes the second thing people think that this is really far away like oh yeah maybe people will live forever but not in my lifetime he goes what the way that science works is he has this curve he shows like if you were 80 years old and we discover this [ __ ] it's too late for you you're dying if you're 60 years old and we discover this [ __ ] it's kind of too late for you you're dying if you're 50 and we discover it we might extend you by a good 30 years but you're probably gonna die at that point he's like but if you're 40 or 30 and we discover this and like when at the time when we discover this you like have escape velocity as i call it meaning i'm going to give you the therapy before enough damage has happened and you're going to live like the guy who's 10 years older than you is going to live till he's 150 and you're going to live till you're a thousand he's like that blows people's minds but it's true it's just the way that this works which is once we have the therapy the difference between somebody living an extra 40 or 50 years and an extra thousand years will just be like a 10-year age gap because you'll be just below that threshold damage how far away are we and so he's like the part he's then he just discusses the science of breakthroughs he goes in every field there are breakthroughs breakthroughs are extremely hard to predict when they happen he's like flight even you know from prehistoric ages we've had this idea of being able to fly and nobody knew how to fly until like 1903. 1903 the wright brothers figure out how to fly and then from there it's like every 25 years there's like a pretty big jump from two dudes in a plane that's basically gonna kill you to like a plane that's reliable to a plane that can go really far to supersonic planes to like now we get on a plane it's super safe you go to sleep you watch a movie and you fly right like every 25 years incremental progress happens after the breakthrough but you so you can predict incremental progress so he knows after we get the breakthrough of figuring out mice we're going to have like 15 20 years before we get it to to be a therapy in humans that extends life 20 or 30 years a healthy life um but uh you know we don't know when that breakthrough's gonna happen he's like the bad part is it's been like 100 years and basically nothing's happened uh for this breakthrough and so uh so yeah so that's where that's kind of like where it's at right now but i was pretty fascinated i was like i want to go this is just like a like i'm at the ted talk level so like you know that's the surface of the surface but i'm very interested in going deeper and learning more so there's this book on longevity i believe it's called lifespan i'm i'm thinking about reading it i'm very fascinated by this too it it something that i've been thinking about and we're going to wrap up here it's all like when i was thinking about dying it seems like we mostly like all just die from like some type of cancer or alzheimer's or something like that like we like if the timeline's long enough like we're all gonna get cancer or like some type of alzheimer's or something like that and die and i've always been wondering to myself isn't it weird to you that with everything that we have that someone could still die from one of these illnesses that you could have you could have had for six 12 24 months like i've always thought like you should know right away you should know like once that cell forms or you know i don't know anything about medicine but you understand and so anyway this is i've also been obsessing with that maybe it's because like i'm getting in my my 30s now and i'm like well i kind of i'm very slowly but i kind of just felt like a little bit of like soreness i don't want to like get older and i'm flipping out a little bit so i'm on board with this i'm going to start reading this yeah there's um there's uh uh what's it called there's this chart that's great and the chart basically shows why do people die it's like it's like a visual chart so it's like uh blue if it's um you know it's it just happens in yourself it's non-transmissible red is if one person passes it to another like the flu or covet or whatever and then there's like a the size of the bubble is basically how many people die of that every year it's like number one is cardiovascular disease and then number two is cancer and that's like you know that's bulk of the deaths right and then like number five is influenza and then you kind of you know whatever you go on from there so you're right it is these sort of same causes stuff that people are trying to fix but uh no no breakthrough yet that like just radically eliminates that like remember when people used to die of cancer that will happen it's just a matter of when uh which is pretty sweet honestly yeah it's interesting to me um all right i think that uh that episode was a nine out of ten what do you think i liked it what do you think dan i give you a nine as well all right i think that was good um dan's got a little bit of a ned flanders in him i could see dan being the ned flanders of a neighborhood i don't think that's a compliment great neighbor what's wrong with dead flanders all right i'll take it like a very positive guy yes that i thought that was a comment all right thank you that's the episode i feel like i can rule the world travel never looking back

what's super awesome is like when you're putting the wins on the board nobody even gives nobody wants to touch it then keep going keep going nobody wants to talk to me i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put that was pretty uh that was intense 45 minutes dude sometimes you have high hopes for a guest and i in on this podcast i've been disappointed today was not that day my friend i loved that i had a great time honestly we didn't even get to a we got to like 20 of the stuff i wanted to ask him about so we had gary vaynerchuk on the pod today it was phenomenal whenever i leave so i've i've hung out with gary maybe three or four times maybe three times whenever i leave his presence i do feel better and a lot of people and i'll admit i was one of those people years ago i would be like oh this guy's just some loud guy who's selling nonsense she's totally the real deal and i went to we talked about it but i went to a dinner with him one time and he talked the entire time and most people would be like dude what the hell that was so rude and when i left i was like i just want to continue listening to him i want him to continue telling stories i love his point of view he's entertaining that guy is intense i love it he does what we try to do he's been doing it for a long time which is business entertainment it's the entertainment side of business where he you know he'll go to a garage he'll make content that's like going to a garage sale buying things for a quarter and flipping them for 28 on ebay and how that stacks up and how you can go from like you know 42 dollars to 14 000 in a year if you just did this and like obviously he doesn't need to do that anymore he's got this agency with you know hundreds of employees he's got uh you know he's got a bunch of stuff going on as far as his own business goes but i like that he's been able to do what what i think the world needs more of it needs more business entertainment because like why do i why did i grow up wanted to be a basketball player because the nba was so goddamn entertaining right and and so when you have entertainment it's that creates inspiration and aspiration so it ends up creating more founders in the world yeah he was amazing man um whenever i talk about whenever i'm off with it whenever i'm with him off the air by the way he's exactly the same so there's not a there's no show here so all right we started off we got right into it in the first 30 seconds i asked him so i had been tracking this for a long time when i was managing my business i was trying to manage cash flow and i was trying to understand how hard to push it and i made a document from gary vaynerchuk about vaynermedia they grew to 1200 employees i tracked the revenue revenue per head over hundreds of interviews i basically found where he said a clip like oh we have this many employees and i asked him about it so i asked him how he managed cash flow then we got into a really interesting discussion about nfts nfts a lot of people talk about him i'm not like an nft guy sean you are this was the one time i've ever had a conversation where it interested me beyond just like academic right yeah he does a good job with making it i don't know like uh tangible and like not making the big mistake which is nfts let me tell you what it stands for and how it works under the hood it's like no no i don't care how the engine works i want to get in the car and go somewhere so where does this let me go and i think he did a pretty good job of that so we talked about nfts uh we talked about um you know just somebody kind of like the lessons learned you know going from like what he saw in the dot-com boom because he was kind of like early in the game right in 2000 and then he was there for like twitter facebook uber and he got in he invested in twitter but he missed out on uber even though garrett was one of his best friends and then what he so how did he take that learning what's he doing now with it today how does he take those learnings and apply them now so we talked about that for a bit but good episode he he you know he was i don't know super nice guy uh wants to come back on i think we should have him on again for sure i take a lot it makes me feel happy that sometimes a lot of times people tweet at us and they say i want to run through a wall after that episode or i want to go and accomplish something i feel that way right now uh after listening to that episode i felt like i was a part of it more so uh as a fan more so as a participant i thought it was wonderful yeah you know it's when people say uh you know i'm always late to work because when i'm driving listen to mfm i gotta pull over and write [ __ ] down right like i can't let this idea go i gotta write this down that's uh that's when we do it well and sometimes we don't always hit that but i think we did it well on this one so all right that's the episode garyvee enjoy like all right are you weird or are you normal and they're like we're a little bit of both and then they came out and did it and it it uh it worked out well i'm just using an iphone get the [ __ ] out of here well we're traveling now sam you looking are you really i'm in new york this is just an iphone oh blurred out why does it look so good so he got this app that basically uses your iphone as like a dslr which is really cool awesome it's nice to see you guys i hope you're well it's called camo i'll give them a shout out it's called camo i think i paid 49 for it it's awesome man hope everyone's well um so we have uh a lot to get into um i'm pumped you're here um can i it's something that i've and we're recording now something i've always wondered about how many people work at vaynermedia right now somewhere between probably 10 50 and 1300. i'm sorry vaynerx so vaynermedia is the biggest company yeah vayner right because we have gallery we have yep so i was looking uh i did some research based off a ton of interviews and i was like going through the head count of how how fast you grew and i believe between around years number um number three and four did you grow from like 30 people to 125 people yes because in 2011 september of 2011 i kind of made the decision to go full-time vayner no longer what i would call full-time wine library secondary veiner i made that switch and then the lighter fluid kind of went on dude how the hell do you manage that cash flow for a company like that because i i did i did research and it was tell me if i i just guesstimated off some interviews around i'm gonna start at year one around five people 20 people 30 people 125 people 300 550 600 800. yeah is that a ballpark right yeah like if i if you were asking me and i was spitballing because who the [ __ ] you know the first year was like we started in may of 2009 so that that first half year i think it was like six or seven then it might have been like 20 and through all of 2010 and then until 11 it probably got to like 30 and then that's september 2011. look what you'll appreciate this and you've got this in you there's certain people who i think are really really good at top line revenue driving initiatives what i think has been the balance of my life and it's very similar to what happened at wine library right is because i'm able to create so much top line rev and because i'm playing forever right wine library my dad's family business and vayner for me is really for in a forever business um i'm just able to hire a lot right and then you just gotta you know with retail it was really easy right i was like i knew how to sell wine so like i was with with b2b it took me a little while to calibrate like oh [ __ ] they didn't pay us wait a minute why the bills do like why didn't you pay but like overall um it's just staying in your [ __ ] right i think when you stay in your business and you know what you've got coming in and what is going out you know i'm not a cfo like oriented ceo but i'm also not a schlemiel i always have a good sense of like is this are we gonna be dead i'm always playing to like will this hurt me like will i be in trouble you know i try to stay within those confines that's it's just crazy i mean did you have a line of credit from the bank no we didn't have a line it's a [ __ ] wine live this is where my dad's a [ __ ] psycho i was so undereducated because i was such a poor student and i was such a sorry for this background noise i'll go away in a second um it was i my dad ran his [ __ ] business with no line of credit which i love right it's old school immigrant you know pay with what you have but it trained me because that business is even crazier that business went from four million to [ __ ] 25 in like 30 months like so fast and inventory and payroll like but i got so trained in playing within myself we didn't have a line of credit for a long time we definitely got a line of credit probably 2011 maybe in 2013 so but the first four or five years and then in the pocket you're talking about which is very much more um will resonate a lot more with people on the call who've got it who are going to go through the 7 to 17 to 77 to 277 it was more about um just not spending what you don't have right like like it was just as simple as basic being a businessman like hey we just landed this account they're paying us 480 a year it's [ __ ] you know mondelez or pepsi you feel like they're gonna pay you you feel good it's not gonna you know and it's like okay now i got 480. i'm gonna hire these six people at 40k a piece i feel good with you know it was like very like back of the napkin what's funny about it is and you know this and i think this is where you know as when you're on the podcast we hung out at outdoor dinner like every time i come there's something about just like street business versus like i find myself laughing that like mine can be like intuitive and back of napkin and yet people that are like all about learning and excel sheets and doing it proper and [ __ ] sap and cloud you know they have all the software like get [ __ ] up it's because they don't have a good pulse of their actual business so they get ahead of themselves and lack patience yeah it's just like when you're growing that fast it it seems like like you're kind of playing it maybe month by month maybe quarter by quarter where i would be i mean just i would go to bed at night wondering like i hope this client doesn't bail otherwise i gotta lay off yeah 20 people i think i think what was happening was we were selling so this and i think i you know it's so funny i was very long-winded i think i had the answer when you are selling at a level that people are not accustomed to like when you're outpacing normality it just [ __ ] selling hides everything you know when i'm landing [ __ ] client week after week like you know you start getting into a place where you're just outpacing vulnerability that's always a question i had sean do you want to give them um an update on i mean i jumped right into that because i've always had that question about man sam's been like sitting on that question for two years or something he didn't say hello he didn't say what the podcast is [ __ ] about he's like you know what hey when you scaled how did you manage cash yeah you know what's funny i've gotten to know sam through my podcast in a little couple hangouts uh it makes sense to me because i think sam's really good at what he does and he's and he lived that life and he knows he did it super well and he knows what the anxiety and like the challenges are like it you could you know i always say you can only my favorite people to talk to are the people that know like i love talking to people that know because they've lived it not because they read it it just makes it so much more fun it's the same way i feel like when i talk like i love sports but i fully know when i'm talking to an athlete i don't know right i don't know what you know yeah i did this uh this thread that went viral on twitter it was about clubhouse and i was like you know this is when clubhouse is sort of peaking and i said this thing i was like it's kind of unpopular because you know why [ __ ] on a startup you know it was it wasn't my intention but i said everybody thinks clubhouse is the next big thing and i think it's going to fail but here's how i think it's going to go play it out and i kind of wrote it like an episode of silicon valley like i wrote it like a like you're the ceo first you know chris sack is texting you this is happening and i wrote this thing and it went viral ended up getting on cnbc it has like i don't know tens of millions of impressions and people were like oh man you're a good writer and i was like i'm not a good writer i [ __ ] i built this thing called blab that was very similar to clubhouse and i went through this run and i was getting all this [ __ ] it wasn't anywhere near clubhouse but i yeah you know their home was higher i remember yeah and so i was like you know i i went through this exact pain and so i'm just literally telling a story i know of myself and i'm exaggerating a little bit to make it funny it has nothing to do with writing you know what's so crazy about that i don't know if you can see this do you see the goosebumps it's kind of how i think why i'm a good content producer i literally stay in my [ __ ] lane i may say the same [ __ ] 8 700 different ways and that's a little bit of my talent i'm good in incorporating contemporary pop culture slang nuances of the day but the reason i think it works for me is similar to you like like i have so much conviction in my [ __ ] because i'm not guessing out here right yeah you know i was watching your uh trash talk video on the way here so if you people haven't seen it go to his youtube fun series actually i was watching i was like i bet this hits i couldn't see because i was driving so i'm listening to it and i'm like god this is good content i was like i bet this video hits and of course the views were pretty high on it for me and you two i'm starting to interrupt it's by far my best show it's my best content immediately i was like i'm hooked and do you know why i made it because i listen to my audience i read my comments i read my [ __ ] so what was super awesome was i started getting a lot of emails from people saying yo you're awesome i love you but like this whole like yeah you put a twenty five thousand dollar check into twitter they're like that doesn't work for me i don't have twenty five thousand i'm like you know cool let me go even further back in my origin story what did i do when i dig [ __ ] i [ __ ] fl went garage sailing on saturday and sold that [ __ ] at baseball card shows or other flea markets on um on sunday right wait like by the way it's more fun so i i just sold 3 500 worth of old computers and i got more joy having that 35 hundred dollars in my venmo than i did 20 million dollars in my face this brother is everything that i believe i believe the reason i like stuff it's easier is i'm in it for the game i'm just like you i could there's no comparison to how i feel when i uh in my last episode and if that's what you're watching i found a bunch of magna that's challenging right so for 270 i bought what ends up being about 6 400 in ebay post fees sales right it's crazy because it's like the thrill of the hunt like it was fun even before that right so i watched my drive home from the bank to get to home i didn't get to that part yet but i saw that was the title so the the you know some people are like oh that's cool you buy something for 270 you sell it for six grand the part that i was blown away by was the part i was watching you went to 20 [ __ ] garage sales in a day and i was just thinking to myself two things i was like he made the most kind of like this this channel this show is basically the most approachable version of entrepreneurship like yes we we do these segments on the show that people love that's called uh we'll do the billy of the week which is like a billionaire that we profile but sometimes we'll do the hillbilly of the week which is someone who owns 22 vending machines and we break down how much money they make that's [ __ ] so smart another one we do is called the blue collar side hustle it's like here's something you don't need to be a genius for because sometimes i go off on my crypto [ __ ] and i'll be like oh yeah this is the future but then sometimes it's like hey you know what you should do like go door-to-door pest control leads you know i love billy that's so [ __ ] smart by the way that's what i'm living right now i'm like can't function because i literally like looked at my calendar today and i saw we i had this podcast and obviously you guys have done a great job and i'm like fired up about it but like literally in the back of my brain i'm like man i hope they got caught up or something because if i get back that 45 minutes i can go more on openc and do a little more research i'm so enthralled right now in nft life that i'm like every meeting i'm like cutting five minutes short to like like i'm just but meanwhile equally the only other thing that's got me juiced is garage sale education because i know it can help people and i love it it's the same game do you know um do you know american pickers i know that show yes so i used to work on that show i used to work for mike wolfe the main guy in that show who is that the taller guy or the chubby tall guy the tall guy and the way it worked is he would go from garage sale to garage sale not garage sale barnes and he would buy stuff and we would buy like some cheap stuff like something we could sell in the store for 50 bucks then we would buy some like an old motorcycle that doesn't work but it's our we could sell for 20 grand and all these people would come in from all over the country to the store that i helped to run and we would probably sell five thousand dollars worth of items but we would sell probably 30 grand a day of t-shirts and this freaking business crushed it but um sean you want to talk about some nft stuff because so i know that excites both you it excites me too are you trying to get into it sam are you like digging in a little no i i am i'm into it sean told me what it was like a year ago and he bought like some really cool kobe stuff and i went and got a i thought it was badass and so but sean's like really into it i think he's got a ticker behind him that you could see yeah no this is this is just you know my own little i motivate myself with my motivational quote every day or whatever but i do have this programmed up where it can tell me the price of whatever you know ethereum or you know uh whether it's some altcoin or in this case i start i met the founder of nifty gateway and i was like dude uh first this story is hilarious i don't know if you've met them but it's two twins um tyler no so they got there it's two twins that built nifty gateways they got a fireball that's [ __ ] amazing and so this was like pretty early in the wave of like nft started getting hotter and hotter and what they did which was smart was they said look nfts have value because they're scarce but the problem is anyone can make a print an nft tomorrow which is like the fun but also there's like an abundance of scarce objects now right supply and demand like there's such an incredibly fascinating supply and demand game going on what nifty started doing was they were kind of like look what we'll do is we'll be like christie's we'll curate so we'll find the best artists on instagram and we'll bring them on and they've been building up this you know people did their thing i think through through nifty early on they've been building up a following for 10 years just doing free art for the love of the game on instagram and now that there's a way to monetize that audience monetize that art they can bring it over here and so i bought this like kobe you know the forever mamba i don't know if you've ever seen it but basically i was telling sam on the pod i was like yeah i just bought this thing for 800 and you know he goes through the cycle everybody goes through which is you bought a file like why are you buying jpegs like what's that gonna do you spent eight hundred dollars on this and i was like yeah actually i bought five he's like you bought five copies of the same [ __ ] thing and you know those sell for 10 10 to 25 okay now and so um that was my first flip basically my version of the and the digital garage sale right that's why i'm so addicted i think like i'm gonna get i'm addicted to the digital garage sale and so give us like your simplified version of the thesis because some people kind of like some people love this [ __ ] they're in the weeds some people just sit there and eye roll and then the truth is that there's something really exciting going on and then there's also a bunch of [ __ ] that's going to go away in a few years like it'll all get swept around so i mean give us your take yeah i've been you know i'll just well i'll give you the micro thing on that i think 98 of the current projects go to zero right like i think it's very it's it to me it's this most similar thing to uh web internet stocks 99 2000 that i remember i remember being there i really like i was me young so i wasn't as experienced and didn't have as many pattern recognitions and reps but i had a lot of the good ingredients right and i remember sitting there and saying man a lot of these businesses make no sense like just no sense of like how could they be worth this much money they're losing so much money and i and i didn't understand wall street so i wasn't sure but when the affirmation of march and april 2000 came along and most things got smoked out it kind of was a monumental moment for me because the only stock that i bought was amazon and and and because i really thought it was like a real business even though he was losing money was losing money in a different way than other things it had an actual business like back to wow and i started like revenue mattered like the other ones didn't have [ __ ] revenue right you know like no customer gave a [ __ ] and i'm always like does the customer care so what do i think overall i think people are grossly underestimating nfts i think right now people think of them as collectible in art and flip game and for a lot of us that have that american picker garage sale sports cards for me like and there's a ton of people that love that like that's that's why half of wall street that's where they go like there's a lot of those people and that's amazing and that's big that's a big industry like over the next 15 years big collecting flipping you know you've got an entire generation of kids that go on fortnite and madden and 2k and buy digital assets to flex so that's going to [ __ ] play out but i think that's just a nuance of nfts i think people misunderstand the utility nature of smart contracts i believe in the next 15 years that that nobody writes a book with a publisher they do it through an nft infrastructure i believe that in 15 years nobody launches a record label by having a a record record by having a record label give them the bag they're going to get it from crowd funding by selling nfts and giving a percentage of royalties i believe that there's not a single sporting event or concert in 10 years that the ticket is not an nft because there's no incentive for that organization and that artist or people to launch it as anything but an nft because a qr code or a piece of paper means nothing but the nft if lukadonic drops 100 points in that game that becomes a forever collectible there's a trillion [ __ ] dollars worth of of ticket stubs that have sold over the last 25 years on ebay you know that all goes to royalties to the person so what's really fascinating to me uh i'll give you a weird one if you own a home that is wildly unique and is a 25 million home on a beach or something wild right you nft that [ __ ] home right now put into the smart contract that you get one percent of every transaction of this home in perpetuity and the first person that's gonna buy it from you is gonna be fine with that they don't give a [ __ ] because these things are long leads right you buy it you sit on it for 13 15 years so like there's so much that nft blockchain realities are going to bring that i think people are underestimating it you want to you want to yeah yeah hedge fund i'll tell them this idea we have great minds two months ago a few months ago we're shooting [ __ ] before an episode and we don't tell each other what we're going to talk about it's like yo i'm bringing three awesome i'm bringing three pieces of heat you're going to react to it i got to know my [ __ ] you have to be able to react and that people like that people like the reaction the worst part of a podcast is hey do you know this yes okay well let me explain it because i'm not actually asking you [ __ ] investing in the audience right i'm trying to present this here so one of the ideas that i brought on was that i noticed that michael jordan's house had been sitting on the market has sat on the market at his house in chicago that's got the 23 emblem on the gate it's got like a basketball court inside got everything and uh it's been sitting on the market for years and the price has been dropping i think i don't know what it started at i think something like 20 million and then it went down to 15 14 and it's like so i came on the pot i was like dude i think we could buy michael jordan's house for 10 million dollars wow and i was like you know so we could kind of like do the you know the way that no but normally somebody would do this is all right do i have that kind of fu money to go buy michael jordan's house my wife doesn't kill me or do i go you know like raise a fund amongst you know a few back alley conversations at dinners with some folks who are rich i said or we could just get this podcast we could crowdfund 10 million dollars yep assume and we could basically fractional we could do fractions either through an nft or on rally road or whatever i was like let's buy michael jordan's house and we started and this went viral a little bit in our world like in my head you listen to every episode religiously it's your phone you say cancel you know clear my calendar i need to go listen to this i know you probably didn't but that was an idea we had a few months ago so how would that play out in the nft world so walk us through that you guys and now it sounds like it went viral and you're like that's exactly what should happen like i think that's you can't imagine and i'm a man who tends to like i don't love that many ideas right really i mean that i love execution i think a lot of people can execute a b and c idea and do great but to say i love an idea is rare and that's why i think i've done really well like i really bet when i love something and it's worked for me and i've lost sometimes because the executor couldn't do it yo bongo was my favorite investment it was a precursor to tinder in a lot of ways caleb and the team there just couldn't get it there they didn't execute which is okay but but when i tell you i love the idea of buying michael jordan's house so much because i know that you can literally arbitrage it in perpetuity like i you guys are people that can garner attention and promote so it's worth so much more to you than somebody else i could see the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem renting out the basketball court game like like you can run a real business now now back to my big point about unique property i think this is going to change the real estate industry the fact that you could put you guys are young dudes you put a two percent royalty in perpetuity on that home you sell it to the next person for nine million let alone 12 million right let's just play you guys are locked your great-grandchildren great-great-great-grandchildren are like our [ __ ] great-great-great-great-grandfathers were [ __ ] geniuses we just got a [ __ ] eight hundred thousand dollar check in the mail or eighty thousand whatever it ends up being i do think in the next five years there will be a aha to what nft blockchain smart contracts mean and i think it will trickle into real estate people will buy unique properties and i think they're gonna make incredible in perpetuity monies that maybe they themselves won't get the crazy because you know how often their houses turn per se but man listen if you're listening to this right now listen i've got a real good sense to who listens to this because you guys got a lot of fans you are either there or you are spying to be there from a professional standpoint right for the people that are listening right now who've been fortunate and we're sitting in this weird moment right now because of crypto and nft where there's some people that have really come into some real money in like on making a very smart play if you're sitting with some money you know these are the things you're thinking about like what can i do that like is fun for me but also leaves for my generational wealth i want to do [ __ ] that still is good like the house is perfect right because it'll be fun for you 16 or 2 or 9 weeks a year but you're also creating something that's an asset let me say it one more time in perpetuity right like once it goes on there and gets nft it's nft right it is a contract like there's the aba team do you know the story about the aba team from saint louis yeah yeah yeah no this sam this is epic they merged the leagues the st louis team is out and the [ __ ] like [ __ ] you we're not signing the deal and so what they did was they it was like i don't know what the finite details were but they needed them to sign off to make the merger happen and they tell them that your franchise doesn't advance because we're folding some they they they fight they fight they fight because they really love basketball they're like new york like shemata guys who bought like tv right at the end they go okay well if that's the case you have to we have to be treated financially as the at the time the 26th or the 22nd or the 24th nba franchise and in perpetuity we get the economic split for that so we're out of the league but economy that we get it and so as the league i mean i think they made like a billion dollars or something it was just youtube i think two brothers right that's right that's exactly what's going on it was two brothers i think they like made like hundreds of millions hundreds of millions when that was like a different number over those 70s 80s and 90s i do think they got bought out like the grandkids got bought out by the nba like in before the last big deal but like wow unbelievable do you um go ahead sean i was just going to say well you were talking about nfd another i think another nft use case that why i like when talking about it with you versus like we've had a bunch of crypto heads on here you know uh super geniuses like biology and others and you know one challenge is if our audience is a guy who owns his own marketing agency in st louis he's sort of like okay what does this mean yeah like i don't want the how i want the what what does this mean what does it mean for me exactly and to me when i talk about nfts i think about the fashion industry i think about why somebody owns a rolex i think about social media like like how about this you know how everyone's like social media is full of [ __ ] like everyone takes photos and fakes it you know what's gonna be a much better social identity what tokens do you have in your wallet publicly yes dude i was thinking about this yesterday read on both of you if i looked at your time just look at my ear yeah like my public wallet is going to represent me because it's not only going to be like what i believe in crypto punks you know my v friends collection like but it's also gonna be like all my jets tickets right and i'll give you a good one i haven't mentioned dave matthews publicly in my entire life but if somebody went in my if this was going on for 30 years like like every day on twitter i'd probably get a gary you went to dave matthews new year's 99 madison square garden i'm like oh yeah my friend tokyo joe love like you know it's a truth indicator and by the way one last point this is what really confuses people every i'm going to give you such a clear picture that i think will help people every one of you has an aunt uncle niece nephew friend grandma when you go into their house they collect marbles they collect little miniature elephants they collect magnets every state they go to they pick up a match box humans humans are in hem inherently hoarding assets and we use them for ourselves because we like it we get caught up in the nostalgia and the story and we use it to flex flexing a painting or your winnie the pooh collection that's epic in your house is kind of hard except for the people that come through the blockchain is gonna accelerate accelerate at a scale right the way i thought that it would accelerate communication with social and that's why i think people are underestimating the first internet collected the information the second internet created the framework for communication right this third thing this web 3 nft thing it's going to capture the consumerization of assets and the stakes are [ __ ] high and with your deal the the new um the the gary what was it called be friends be friends you do you um you offer uh a conference a year are you gonna do that forever or is there a timeline on that what i wanted to so my this is pretty interesting because i've i've done it in a couple shows but with you guys it's people like this so i do you want to host it at michael jordan's house because we'll let you do it my friend we can help you host it at michael jordan's house my guy listen so for the hardest core consumers of my content be friends made so much sense why the amount of times i referenced walt disney and vince mcmahon character creation i'm building vaynerx to buy nostalgic ip i'm going to refurbish storytelling saturday morning cartoons all the [ __ ] behind me in my office right like wrestling and thundercats and transformers so i'm just so affected by pop culture and all that my whole life and like i wanted to buy like animal crackers from mondelez and i was going to turn into madagascar like i've been like in this place forever right as a matter of fact you know what b friends is two years ago i was gonna launch a toy line called workplace warriors were literal desk toys right with what basically became these characters so for me i see nfts i have my i've been like kind of like flirting in the winter i have my crazy eureka like no no this is the [ __ ] it it right moment i bought eth a long time ago aaron battalion shout out former cto of living social got me on in 2015 16. i've been watching but i wait to the consumer the normal [ __ ] the marketing agency st louis moment not the [ __ ] hardcore infrastructure nerd [ __ ] that's just not my jam right so i go [ __ ] man i'm gonna build the next pokemon harry potter transformers but 99.9 percent of the world's not going to believe me so let me launch this program and show people that you can do a lot more than just have pictures on it right so to your point sam like i'm like uh so the answer is it's a three-year contract the friends series one says you get a conference ticket to vcon 2022 2023 2024 right i'll figure [ __ ] out after the fact but i knew that that would have such inherent value that people would lock in for that but basically what i was trying to do was trick this is the word i would use trick my hardest core advocates by giving them an asset imuv friends the original thing i just launched as kind of like the original disney sells you know those things that sell for like a drillion that were like they hand drew snow white in the 40s like if i pull off what i think i can pull off stuffed animals toys trading cards movies video games over the next 40 years this original nft has real potential and i wanted to create a thing that wouldn't make my biggest earliest supporters trade it you look at board ape you look at me base you look at these epic projects that are killing right now people are trading i wanted i wanted people to be locked in so that by the time the three years are over they're like wait a minute i'm never selling this because i wanted them to benefit the most and the data backs this up so right now if i go on crypto slam uh if you guys don't know there's cryptoslam.io easy little aggregator of nft projects i think you guys are like number eight okay so you're number eight in the last 24 hours last 24 yeah sorry it's a 24 hour rolling scoreboard but you can you you can do up top it's got all this stuff yeah so we can do like let's say 30 days all right so 30 days you're number 12 last 30 days about 12 million of sales volume of transaction volume and the funny thing is if you go through all the other ones crypto punks me bits all these they have somewhere between thousands or tens of thousands or you know the top one x infinity is quarter million buyers that are doing these numbers doing these transactions v friends is like an outlier it's like 300 people with 580 transactions what that tells me is that there is a small group of hardcore people who are not looking to flip this rapidly for a quick buck because they believe in you they believe in the utility value of the conference so i like that because it's different and you're pushing it at this point i think i've been very aggressive with this i'm like do not bet against me i'm gonna [ __ ] build transformers like you know like and i think a lot of people are holding now be more you know the conference is gonna be epic and i'm gonna come through but i think i think i think they're betting on my propaganda right now and i'm gonna come through it's like bitcoin uh the thing that gets it like early days bitcoin the people who bought in were because they were anarchist crypto nerds yes it's like they needed you need the first people to buy in for one reason and then the second people are you know the speculators you got it and then it's like once everybody's got the damn things we all speculated on it now we can just use it as a medium of exchange so similarly what's interesting about nfts more so than bitcoin today and obviously things will evolve it's just functional yeah like v v v con makes it function like they're about to get very functional right like the functionality is going to be extraordinary right and so uh so i like v friends i think v friends is cool i told my guy before this pod i was like oh i'm gonna talk to gary today um you know let's pick up a v friend like go go get me one off the floor there i appreciate it and he's like cool the floor price is like getting a 17 grand now i was like oh okay well all right all right let's see i don't like gary that much i thought i was like i was like i'm gonna do it but that is not what i expected i was like that's interesting that really kind of like opened my eyes in fact the last few days you've been seeing so i want to bring back one thing you talked about which is your wallet is gonna be a new type of profile it's going to be a new place to flex it's going to be a place to learn about somebody in a real way like like the only reason i'm in is that right and then i think youtube is going the other way you can filter your face you can do many things to get non-verifiable there you know it's really interesting the argument of like us controlling our narrative because everyone's become the pr agent of themselves versus the black and white public data of what we buy now don't forget for everyone who's scared and loves privacy you don't have to share your wallet right it's just that my my argument is i was there for myspace 2004 when everyone's like people are gonna get raped at the mall and kidnapped and you know i was like nah i think it's gonna go this way and now it is right everyone's in i think that's what's gonna happen with nfts like you've got the hardcore people that i get on zoom with like just chopping and they've got literally like voice d activators and like screen scenes i don't know who they are every the masses are coming and they're in the public wallet the rainbow wallet the dot eth world and i think that's where it's going you um so you you've been talking about buying brands and putting them through vayner for i mean in like year three four of the company i mean you've been saying that whole spiel for a long time i first of all you haven't done it yet when are you gonna do it and second of all i think that this putting him through the the nft thing is significantly better than the old model that i bet you were planning on doing of like well you know we could put them through the the vaynermedia machine yep machine you you've got it like i mean i would much rather buy an old like a 90s brand and do this because i'm looking at who the biggest uh brands are on crypto slate i mean it's sports sports companies yeah i mean i think you can do brands they're going to be better when are you finally going to execute on that and and pull the trigger because you've been talking about it for a long time i'm excited to see it happen come on jerry well it's like it's like dude why do you need 1500 employees still like uh you built that machine it's badass do the other thing now yeah you'll appreciate it i think that's an incredibly strong observation from the outside i just know how you know you know what like it's a version of golden handcuffs like instead of like selling your company you have to be stuck or or like you have a big salary i just know i'm so [ __ ] close for actually being a death star versus like yeah it's a better badass machine than anybody else has got like i feel that like truly i do i'm like i got a better machine than the other [ __ ] 500 people i admire that i think have this down but it's like but it's so it's like so close to being two times better and four times better and the way i scratched my itch was rezzy the restaurant app which i had a major exit with empathy wines which like i was creating and now v friends and like the v friends thing is really [ __ ] with me because i'm like you know oh by the way said you'll appreciate this i had one executed four years ago signed and they pulled out late and kind of had like a clause in there that allowed them to and i feel good about this publicly i had animal crackers bought i mentioned it slightly quickly when i was talking i had it and i [ __ ] had the master [ __ ] plan it was a cook cookie brand i was gonna make it healthier to be on trend but what i was really gonna do was turn it into an animated film and build up like make the lion like [ __ ] larry the lion like i was it was kind of v friendly now listen ultimately i think i'm going to play some micro i'm young enough at 45 have the leverage have the infrastructure that i think i'm going to do a whole bunch of everything right i think i can build a studio like pixar with be friends at the forefront and do other [ __ ] and i think i can buy champion when it gets cold again and refurbished in 13 years because i like both of those things and i'm going to try both how much could you have bought animal crackers for 48 i think the deal was at the time no [ __ ] yeah what was the revenue i hate making up [ __ ] i genuinely don't remember i remember the number pretty pretty remember around the multiple it was like nothing it was like no you're valuing the ip not the core business of that no they were like just [ __ ] it was dead they were like like they didn't give they and like and we were going to use it as a proxy to teach them how to do it with their like it was [ __ ] set up well you did it with uh nilla wafers i mean from a marketing standpoint we crushed it there and you know i i really scratched my itch with k swiss k-swiss was [ __ ] finished dead done what happened to him something happened recently yeah right the reason i sold it to a chinese apparel company k-swiss was at the forefront of that leverage we [ __ ] exploded not only did we sell a [ __ ] load of garyvee sneakers the residual effect on the brand was very real that was that's the closest i've come to like testing my machine only difference was it was a fake test because i was so involved with it in the face my plan is not to be that as a matter of fact the best part of be friends for me is gary vee has been the catalyst for all the [ __ ] i'm passionate about like work ethic patient i'm so pumped that i'm gonna be over the next three years be able to go a little bit more in the backdrop and let these and let these characters take over for me as i build that ip so i'm looking forward to that well that's what i was going to ask you when i was watching this garage sale video i was like this is great content but man he actually had to go to 20 garage sales and i'm sure there's some fun to it but also there's you graduated past that stage in your life and that's the biggest thing that pisses me off of my bougie [ __ ] friends like gary the [ __ ] are you doing i'm like [ __ ] you you you you go play golf and go on a yacht i'm in a [ __ ] garage so i'm not telling you what to do like you know like even besides that like i know you know i've done this podcast now for only i don't know 18 months right so so we're we're new to the game something like that and there's a lot of benefits of building up this personal brand it's like boom i want to raise a fund i raise a fund i launch a course i sell out you know like you can make a lot of money when you build a personal brand you build trust with an audience by giving them giving them giving them like yeah like you say and then you you sort of have your ass later so the the part i thought was interesting is man he's been on this what you know quote unquote treadmill of creating content you know you're in your call you're in your uber going somewhere you know you gotta for talk you've got a cameraman with you and you gotta put out a sound bite for instagram reels cause that's the new hot [ __ ] or whatever and so like does are you i guess like this is more of a personal question like sam wanted to know that how the hell did you manage the cash flow question this is mine as like i see myself doing this content thing for a long time but i don't want to work as hard as you as far as creating that much content do you do it because like it's fun do you do it you know are you do you feel like you're on a treadmill when you're creating this much content this much garyvee the answer is i only do what i like as a matter of fact like i'm not hitting all my my team and my quotas right now with my content these last two weeks because i can't stop being on crypto slam open c discord like you you'd be stunned how how much i could shut it down or triple down i understand the benefits of it and the leverage and i always did i always thought the community and brand was very underestimated in the last 10 years i just feel like people are just getting around to like oh [ __ ] this is like the actual game but i don't i don't really i i enjoy it i really do it and i also did it a little bit different i slowly i did it by myself for seven years but then i really built out an infrastructure of a team right like to your point like i'm i'm just living and everyone's recording and then we're post-producing at scale how many uh folks are on the team right now i think there's 22. and is um are you the majority owner of vaynermedia or vaynerx yes so then you're able to kind of um it's not like a vc thing where you're able to like use the same resources across all your [ __ ] you don't have to worry about you don't have to worry about pleasing everyone that's right or like your fiduciary i mean your food your serious your to yourself but like yeah exactly so like and so i'm i'm in heavy control it's a long-term play i have no board there's no i'm not publicly traded to your exact point i can like it's very much just a very large family business yeah you don't have to justify to anyone but you and your bro and what's cool about that is i don't have to my bro cause i've been super rel by him and more importantly you know i'm delivering like you know you know this right like what's super awesome is like when you're putting the wins on the board nobody even gives nobody wants to touch it then keep going keep going nobody wants to talk to me you know did you do you pay yourself from the the company or do you just take all your side wins and it reinvests most your your what would be your salary or income from the the brand back into the agency originally i paid myself very very very little it just is so much of the percentage of my time so i've started paying myself probably over the last four years um but i'm still like wildly undercompensated in comparison to what i would feel like the god of merit would come down and she or he would say yeah you are like way on because it's kind of all cycling in the same game to your point sure and do you um like do you look back because i i think you're excited about web3 yes and you look back at web too i know you can quickly tell the story of missing uber you know your buddies with the guy you miss uber that's a big one big one what was uh you tell that story but also just in general what'd you learn from the web two wave that you're like okay web three i'm better prepared because i've been in a long time i love you for that question because the only thing i've been thinking about for the last nine months is like damn this is the first time i felt like this since 06. right the thing i learned there was i was going to meet a lot of people that were technically stronger than me teach me new things have incredibly fun young [ __ ] on fire thinkers different [ __ ] the world is rescheduling recalibrating and that i knew that i understood the consumer and the humans so well that i would figure out my path within it i think like you know the thing i learned with i've told the uber story at nausea travis is the only person i thank in crush it my first book besides my family we were incredibly close um what i learned there was defense always loses i bought my first like apartment in manhattan i played so conservative up until like 35 like i had no money first of all because i was building a family business i just didn't have a lot of liquid i had enough to make the uber investment i passed twice and there's two things i learned from it one the full story is that when i was asked to invest in uber garrett and travis were just the inventors of it and ryan graves was the ceo was going to run it and i had just failed in putting up a wine social network called corked and it was because it was a distraction to my core and so i was affected by thinking that if this is their side hustle it's not really them reasonable by the way totally reasonable and you'll be right nine out of ten times the second one hurts because travis came back to me on this there's this grassy knoll i have no idea where it is in san francisco like a little park i drove by it like seven years ago and got like the worst feelings i'm like i have to go back here every year once a year for humbleness i'll tell you i wanna you i know we're gonna be wrapping up so let me give you the real this is something i really hope helps a lot of people i have completely gone the other way let me tell you what i mean by that i am now completely infatuated with investing only based on the person i have to hate that would be the word i use and i don't like that word i would have to hate the person's idea to not go if i think that the jockey is a gangster and it's worked out for me there's a company called mcmac where i just saw rachel had one meeting with her and i said she's one of us right that's it she's one of us and she's pivoted four times but the company is a monster now and is well on its way and between the uber thing and the rachel thing like it's kind of how i'm navigating web 3 right now i'm really trying to pay attention to is this person one of us because i think there's something about a human's ability to will their way to the success even if they have to completely change the business model halfway through i love it well we uh you were supposed to bounce uh three minutes ago we don't want to go over your time i it sounds like it looks like you're in the hamptons and it sounds like someone's preparing dinner right now is that right this is that do you have someone who is vacuuming and cooking dinner right now we're setting up infrastructure for the weekend but listen i i uh let me say this it's super fun for me to see this show pop from afar like they're not you know it's a very funny time in society where like work ethic and the grind like i i'm incredibly excited that we have a balanced conversation but the energy of entrepreneurship is just such an important variable and so i i appreciate what you guys are doing this space and i'm not gonna i'll have to ask him if it's if he's cool if i blow up his spot a little bit but me and gary had dinner with like eight or ten other people like two months ago and i went back to this guy's house uh about a month ago again for another dinner we're gonna have to tell the story about this guy's house it was it was like the craziest house i've ever been to and uh pretty we're gonna we're gonna tell them listen i'd love to come back if whatever you guys feel is a appropriate time for recycling a guest hit me up i wish you nothing but good and and thank you for having me on i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

that's exactly how it works is people think oh if i practice stoicism i'll become that person who is calm mind and able to just operate and doesn't have these sort of like massive swings and it's like no it's the other way around when once you learn to tame the mind once you learn to master the mind you'll naturally become a stoic person i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back what up all right what's going on um i'm in nashville wait it's uh is it eight or seven where you are seven oh it's seven wow it's really so i woke up a little bit late and i texted you and i go you just want to record something right now and he said yeah i'm thankful you said yes yeah let's give it a shot you're at a podcasting conference which sounds like not a ton of fun is it a ton of fun though so it's educational and i'm happy and i'm learning but it's just like nerdy stuff and uh you know there's not like i don't want to i can't absorb it for that long but i'm happy that i i would love yeah it's worth it it's cool people uh people like know us and that's crazy like it's crazy just to walk around it's it's at a hotel and like so everyone's staying and it's kind of funny to be walking around and just people come up to you and say that they like listen so that's kind of neat because it's all podcast nerds yeah okay i like that uh you learn anything cool any hacks any any growth hacks for us or what i think youtube is just the way to go so and that's what we'll be doing with this show is going hard podcasting is for nerds we're going to youtube no i mean well um that's the way to go some of these people spend so for the listeners shawn and i spit it's not our money anymore but when we were doing this like we were like so cheap and i actually think too cheap about starting this podcast i mean i think it was right how we did it with like really uh bad at first and then it got a little bit better and a little bit better but people spend so much money on recording their stuff and i actually don't think that's important but when you have something like we have which is like you kind of hit this lick it's important to invest and i think we've under invested which is crazy yeah maybe i don't know i was renting a studio the first 10 10 20 episodes 100 an hour so that was a that was like a professional setup i went i thought i was going i thought i was over investing at that time because i had zero listeners when i recorded those yeah no but that's my point is that uh my perspective has changed when i'm seeing like some of the budgets that people have um but for this episode i like i called you because i saw like three amazing things that i wanted to bring up to you and you have one two three four five uh interesting things and i just wanted to talk to you about them all right let's do them what do you where you want to start give me give me your first one okay the first one that i we didn't get to last time but i wanted to fill you in about it uh and it's uh about the oh i'm just writing notes it's about the elevator business so i told you a little bit about this so i like there's this was one of these moments and i've had them with you a ton where you explained something and you're like i didn't even know that this was a problem i didn't even know this was an industry but now i'm totally bought in and i think it's amazing and this particular comp and well in this particular company i'm not sure i don't it's not because i think that they're bad i just don't know them well enough to actually believe that they're gonna win but like it was pretty amazing so let me set the stage so i believe there's something like i might be off by a little bit but i believe there's something like two million elevators in america and only four companies basically control the whole elevator business have have you ever been on an elevator and looked at your feet where the doors opened and seen the names yeah you there's this little like plaque there but i don't remember any of their names i don't i don't i i can't recall i once threw my key in the crack and had to call one of the companies to be like hey how do how do i get under your elevator wow so it's otis you probably recognize that's the big one yeah yeah otis schindler cone and uh mishibi is that uh yeah miss mushibi mitsubishi um are the big ones i know of otis because i've already i've looked into them a bunch they're not technically these four aren't technically a monopoly because there's more than one but basically they control just about everything and what that means is um when you buy an elevator i'm not actually sure how how much an elevator costs but something like like target might have six or seven thousand elevators and when you buy an elevator from them it's a like 10-year or 20-year contract it's a really long contract and it's almost like buying a car so when you buy a car you get a 50 000 mile warranty and except imagine buying 5 000 cars and it's incredibly challenging to know when each car needs to be serviced what type of service the the car company is actually going to pay for and what they're not going to pay for what falls under it is kind of a pain in the butt and so what happens is oftentimes a company like target they employ a whole team to manage their elevators and escalators and they don't know like you know what they have to do and instead of fighting with otis and deciding they just go ah [ __ ] it we're just gonna call service people and we're gonna we're gonna get figure out on our own and there's two new companies one is called audit mate that's who i talk to but there's one in britain called we maintain that's raised 40 million dollars and basically what they do is they manage your elevator and escalator um like it's like fleet management you know what i mean right they determine what and i thought that this was so fascinating and very interesting and when i heard about this company uh i was like well i don't necessarily want i'm not sure if i ever want to like invest in anything like this but i would love to own it and so the way it works is they charge 50 to 60 a month per elevator and the name of the game is you just go out and find all the elevators and you say look we're gonna be your your agent which means we sign on to speak on your behalf and we're gonna negotiate with otis and we're gonna make sure that your shit's maintained it doesn't break down and we're gonna handle all of it and i thought that that was amazing and it's one of these business models where it's kind of like the way that they charge you right now or a lot of these companies charge is a subscription fee which is fine but this is one of those business models that we've talked about like uh turbo tax where they take a percentage of all savings so this is like the easiest [ __ ] ever to sell right and so anyway they're basically saying hey you have no no risk no loss because we're gonna save you money you know you sign up to pay you sign up with us we're gonna save you money and we'll take we'll take out of it in the same way that um you know like main street does this with tax savings basically for you they'll be like all right uh we'll take a percentage of whatever we save you it's like oh okay sounds like i have no downside and even if that percentage is large it's like found money so they feel good about it i thought and i thought this was cool i've never have you ever even heard of anything like this no dude so you so i'm just looking at some of your notes otis 12.5 billion in revenue schindler 11.6 billion cone basically the same 10 billion in revenue uh huge those are huge revenues for for these companies now i don't know how profitable the elevator business is but well they're like family owned otis is like a family-owned business i'm almost positive otis has been around since the 1800s i mean these are like huge huge family-owned businesses so they definitely are i believe they they have to be profitable um here otis oh otis says 12 but the otis is publicly traded so what do you think their uh market cap is uh for 12 billion in revenue okay i'm gonna guess they are a 22 billion dollar company might be less i think it could be less you think less i think less oh it's about 40. 40. okay so i was 22 i was off uh i was so okay pretty crazy right like who would have thought and so this is just software that lets you negotiate twitter twitter is like 50 75 or something like that so is it really what is the elevator company yeah twitter had been hovering below that and then now it says 5560 or something like that because the stock went up recently but um basically otis the elevator company is worth almost as much as twitter which is insane and not only that i believe let's see it's been around since 1853. yeah amazing so it's the funny thing is this is named after like a guy's first name it sounds like not even it's like it's just it was it was the the company was uh invented in yonkers new york in 1853 and they've been around since then [ __ ] elevators and so this fascinates me when i like learned about this because you know i like old [ __ ] when i think about you and i and a bunch of friends were talking what is yonkers is jonker's a place you never see yonkers is somebody born in yonkers because that's amazing i want to say i'm from yonkers melon yeah it's in uh it's in the i believe it's in the bronx in new york it's like a it's like i don't know it's in new york yeah i'm from yonkers in the bronx all right well uh so so this company but you're what you're saying is that this company is a sas company on top of those right yeah it's a sas company that lives on top of it and here's why this fascinates me i love old [ __ ] things that last a long time and we were talking about like the creator economy sub stack i don't remember what we were talking about something like involving like uh one of these newsletter like one-off creators and it's like yeah i think you can make a lot of money but can you do that for 20 or 30 years it's really really challenging i think right basically sam's type on companies did you start in the 1800s in some way did you um did you have a physical product that you could feel that you could touch and feel did where you started in the midwest or some some part of america you know are you named after a family like rockefeller or schindler or otis or or something like that uh let's see what else what else is it you know are you absurdly profitable uh what those are your those are your type essentially yeah look i think it's cool that's something that to build something that can last a really long time yeah that interests me because that that that like you you optimized for excitement i think or uh interest i optimize for what's the least amount of work i can do in order to like have freedom and you're bothering yourself more like durability and and i feel like durability is like number one it's like yeah you just if you have this you win and i'm like if you have this you might win for an hour and then you might lose the next hour like i'm cool with that so both work but they're both work they're just different what um what what do you what do you have what do you what are you doing let me give you one all right so uh what i want to do let's do let's do the zoo um okay let's do this unbundling etsy one so i'm really interested in the second tier or like what i'll call b-class uh marketplaces i don't mean that as an insult i mean it more like if you're in real estate you're like oh do i buy an a you know a class property which is like it's a modern building fully leased uh blah blah or do you go for like an older thing that has upside right do you go for something that has some hair on the deal that you might be able to do and so you go you know this is not new york right like that marketplace might be amazon um etsy or poshmark are these like second-tier marketplaces but i see a lot of opportunity in them we talked about i think we talked about this about building sas tools for sellers uh on those market places so you you you brought that up and i and i thought that was a pretty revolutionary thing that that was a big idea and so these exist but they're not great and there's not a lot of competition and so like i think we talked about jungle scout which sold for some large amount of money that you knew um jungle scout is a tool for sellers on amazon and i was thinking okay who's building stuff like this on these second-tier marketplaces like etsy or poshmark uh so that was the first idea then i started thinking okay wait that can are you gonna elaborate on that because that's pretty amazing well i think didn't we talk about it maybe we talked about i thought we talked about it no if not no that's not i think i don't know if you phrased it that way i think the your the story telling here that you just said is actually wonderful so i think that's actually brilliant we had so at hustle con we had poshmark thread up and one more of these companies speak and yeah i think they were some of the biggest murkari mercari's a big one yeah they're huge secondhand sales the real real you know there's all these like other marketplaces basically there's all these other other places so ben's wife uh tiffany she is a poshmark like super seller or something like that and so she like she sold so much that like when they ipo they invited her and like whatever the top other thousand sellers be like do you want to buy the ipo you can buy the reserve price basically we're reserving some shares for you because you've helped build this thing for which company for poshmark and like airbnb did the same i think i think for they they offered super host ability to buy some share some some small amount of shares and so um an airbnb by the way another another marketplace where could you build a jungle scout type of tool on top of it there is that i'm a subscriber to it's called air dna it's amazing and what does that do it tells you like what to price it at or yeah so it's called air dna and when i was so i rent out my house when i'm not there and i buy property to rent out and i use it as a research tool and i guess it just crawls airbnb and it determines what the average occupancy rate is what you should charge what the earning potential is it's just it's tons of signals for buying properties to make into an airbnb and there might be other things like reporting you know uh tax you know some tax savings you can get or whatever if you if you're an airbnb host it plugs into your airbnb and it generates your your report um so anyways i was thinking okay you could build a jungle scout type of tool and for those who don't know what jungle scout is basically you go on amazon if you have jungle scout installed it's a chrome extension and basically when you are looking for products you can just click jungle scout and it'll tell you hey here's how much search volume this has how much monthly revenue this product makes it's an estimate but it's pretty good uh here's how fast it's growing and here's how strong the competition is and so what you want to find is something that there's a lot of search uh and low competition and if you find some if you find a combination like that you're like oh nobody's searching for you know wooden spoons that are like wooden oversized spoons uh you don't want to build that because nobody's searching for it but if you have like you know wooden oversized baby spoons it's high search low low competition you could go go to china get that product made and become like the top result on amazon which is basically free traffic for you so that's the idea so i think you could do that for poshmark i think you could do that for etsy one thing that i was thinking about for etsy is i think you could spin off a whole new marketplace just unbundling etsy etsy is now big enough it's a public company been around for a decade plus and um has all these different categories right so it's like you can go and you can go to home you can go to you know custom gifts you can go to all these different categories on etsy and you can ask yourself huh could i make a marketplace of or or a service that just does this one thing better than etsy's doing market it as that and actually like unbundle a piece of etsy in the same way that people have had a lot of success unbundling reddit unbundling craigslist if you haven't seen this google google unbundling craigslist and look at the diagram it's like it takes every part of craigslist and then it just shows how oh look this housing part of craigslist became airbnb and this became etsy and this became this other thing and so the same thing i think can be done here so here's that's the that's the core idea is unbuttle one of the verticals of etsy what i would do i was looking at the categories i would do custom gifs so custom gifs is one of the top categories on etsy and people go there because they want to send a thoughtful kind of like what looks like a homemade handmade gift to somebody or they're getting it made for like their wedding and they want all their wedding coasters to have their names on them or their bachelor party and they want everybody to have matching shirts that say the bat the the bachelorette's name on it or whatever um and so i think custom gifs could be spun out into a marketplace that's like fiverr where it's basically just uh here's a bunch of custom gifs push a button and you get these for you know 10 bucks or some some flat rate basically so i think you could do a fiverr or or even like a cameo style thing for custom gifts and that's the that's the category i would go after but i think generally i think you could study their marketplace and find it find a we'll find one that works because you can also see the shop sales you can go into any shop on etsy and you can see how many sales it's at which is like you can do that an entrepreneur is now right yeah this is part of etsy it's like you know here this shop has had six thousand orders and you can look at the price price of the store be like oh you know average thanks 35 dollars that'd be like 6 000 times 35 that's how much revenue this stop the shop has made in two years those are both two big ideas um so you're talking about building like the the the software that analyzes the sales and then the um the marketplace that sells the stuff both actually pretty amazing i go to etsy sometimes and i do so if you scroll all the way to the bottom you'll see how many sales they have ebay does it too um but not as good but that's actually a great idea i and and by the way i looked up air dna so the thing about these software companies uh you're you're talking about two different things we'll call it one software one marketplace the software companies so if i told you or if you told me about jungle scout a few years ago i would say like oh that's a nice little that's a nice little hacker business yeah yeah well it it probably does like 80 or i mean if it's worth a billion i wouldn't be surprised but it's definitely worth nine figures i know that for a fact because it sold part of their company so i told you just about air dna i thought that was just a small thing how big do you think air dna is by the way jungle scout raised over 110 million dollars which is that gives you a sense of how big it is if it was yeah i think it was some of it was private equity so i don't know how big the valuation was but it's definitely huge right okay air dna i don't even know what it does i've never been to a website so i'm just gonna take i'm just gonna say a random number out of the air i'm gonna say 35 million what is there worth well so the air dna so they charge i think i pay a hundred dollars a month for it in 2018 they did 4.9 million in revenue in 2019 they did 8.4 million dollars in revenue they said they were going 100 so you could probably assume that i would i would actually bet that in 2020 they probably did 16 and then 21 i i wouldn't be surprised because uh there's a lot going on with investing in airbnbs i wouldn't be surprised if they're in the 30 million recurring revenue annual recurring revenue range and they raised eight million dollars in order to uh build up they bootstrapped to nine million in revenue and then raised eight million dollars so these are like these things that you would think are small insignificant stuff that could actually be quite big so that's a that's a 50 to 100 million dollar your value business uh at that roughly those numbers you just told me yeah it's a huge thing and who would have thought i never would have thought that if you just told me you're gonna build this thing that analyzes airbnb i'd be like no i would have been like side hustles are cool yeah yeah you should be able to bring in the 45k a month you know with your little airbnb dna tracker whatever the hell you're talking about and and i would say i i i would have if you had to guess what's bigger etsy sellers or airbnb i would think there'd be more etsy sellers than airbnb hosts well the thing with etsy sellers is that um so airbnb is very much it's a lot more set it and forget it and there's less levers to pull and there's less like um there's less like categories and things like that whereas like etsy has like multiple different categories each one has its own little nuances uh and then there's like such a wide variety of sellers where yes there's many people have houses but it's all they're all doing the same they're offering the same service etsy's offering like a million different services to people um and so i think that's why it has probably a little more opportunity what would you do why did you call it cameo well i was just thinking custom gifts if custom gifts is this big of a market i would just start with that i'd say custom gifts i wouldn't maybe the end product wouldn't be a physical gift like etsy maybe it would be something like a cameo where it's a video or just making a jingle for somebody or it could be with celebrities or non-celebrities but basically some way to send a custom gift to somebody if that's such a big uh such a big part of etsy maybe you could rank for it in search or run google ads and hijack some of that traffic of people looking for custom you know handmade whatever custom name blah blah blah and be like yeah we do that we'll put your name on a shirt yeah it's not as nice as etsy it's you know we just took the generic etsy look and we just mass produce it basically um that that that'd be one way i'm on board with that um you want to move on to another one yeah yeah all right so i'm gonna weave two one of mine in one of yours i i'm a big ufc fan so are you so dc daniel cormier he is uh he's retired now but he's a big fighter and he he posted this thing and i'd seen ads for it but he posted that he's now gonna endorse this thing called fit to warrior and i went and looked at it so fit to warrior it's incredibly interesting and so what they do is you spend twenty two hundred dollars and in six months they take you is it six months maybe three months i think six months they take you from being a complete noob so you're just a guy off the street to warrior oh sorry i spelled it yeah it's whip my bad that fit to warrior wouldn't make sense it's called wimp to warrior uh wimp two warrior they take just you off the street you give them twenty two hundred dollars and i think you get like a hundred classes or fifty classes what did i write fif so uh so it's a 20 week program how many months is 20 weeks five so five months in okay so you have five months and what they do is you sign up and you have a fight you have a fight scheduled five months from the day you sign up and it's like and it's like cohort based you pay like twenty five hundred dollars or something like that of course yeah yeah it's a cohort based thing and they say in the next five months we're gonna take a guy off the street and you're gonna have an mma fight now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that the goal of this is not necessarily to get you fit or to like get in a fight the goal of this is to have like a pivotal change in your life to be more confident to say like look i've i've said i'm gonna lose weight forever now i like i have a fight in five months if i don't get my act together like i'm really it's not a good it's not going to be good so this is like a pivotal life-changing thing and i love this business they just raised 8 million from a bunch of pe people it was launched in australia and basically what they're doing is they came up with this name went to warrior they come up with this program and they work with loads of different mma and i guess boxing gyms and they license out their program and now they are paying conor mcgregor's coach john cavanaugh's on board dc all these coaches to like promote it and they give them some type of fee i thought this was amazing and i think this is amazing for a couple reasons one it's a business that i actually think this would change your life if i told you you had to if i told you you had a fight in five months would that be the one thing that finally like said like i gotta take this am i wrong that you think basically this should be mandatory part of the education system well so look here's the thing everybody to do this here's what here's here's why this has always fascinated me so women have this because they have like a biological like you are now officially a woman but men we've lost like a rite of passage we've never had this like all right now i'm officially a man like i guess if you're jewish and you have a bar mitzvah maybe that's like the like the crossing of the cast of like all right you are no longer a boy now you are a man and like we had this like i i love uh the sparks the spartans because they do this thing where they like you'd go they'd say all right you're 14 or whatever now you got to go out in the wild for five days and you gotta survive and just come back when you're done men american we don't really have this like this this modern day yeah yeah and so i love these type of transformational like all right it is official you have there's a start beginning and then like an end type of thing so i love that and you up here you want to talk about mental fitness i've also done like yoga or not yoga um meditation i love head space i love calm i i try to i do buy into mental fitness stuff but it's a little bit tough because it's not like intense and so i love these intense programs and i think that they can be great businesses and incredibly fun and fulfilling to run yeah so i think there's a couple things first i i had seen this i thought uh mcgregor's coach john cavanaugh i thought he invented this because he was the first one always talking about oh we're doing wimp to warrior it's so good we have 200 people doing it this season and he just kept doing it and it was like they take average joes you come in and you basically say cool i'm gonna turn into a fighter i'm gonna train like a fighter for x amount of weeks and then i it ended kind of the graduation the culmination the rite of passage at the end is you do the likes the the amateur exhibition fight or whatever with somebody else from the program i think so it's not like you're not in a ton of danger i think it's really cool i didn't realize that there was like a business underneath this and so just to do the math so basically what they're doing is they're licensing this out to gyms and they're saying hey this is a great um customer recruitment like mechanism right so you you run a wimp to warrior program we'll give you the branding we'll give you the business in a box kit and what you get and we'll send you the customers and we'll send you customers because we have star athletes and coaches promoting this because it's a feel-good thing for them too and and so we'll send you a bunch of interest people they'll find a wimp to warrior program near them and you be my operator so it's asset light you do all the work we will just do the marketing and create the brand on top of this i think this is actually really really smart i would invest in this company um even though it seems like so crazy fringe uh i i i there's a there's a very nice model um it's better than tough mudder better than spartan race better than all those because they take on a ton of operational overhead they're a traveling circus and so i i like this model a lot better so okay i think whimp to warrior's cool i think that your rite of passages write a passage thing is interesting and especially we talked early on about boy scouts and like the downfall of the boy scouts program and what you would do if you were gonna buy it or reinvent it or make a new boy scouts and i think we were onto something with this and we should keep looking for the opportunities that are here um i'm i'll tie this into the mental fitness thing we we did a segment on simone biles in a podcast two two episodes ago one episode ago yeah and we ended up cutting it so it's only it's it's in the lost archive lost files along with me and sam sparring footage from when i went to his house in austin and the reason we cut it is because i had a strong take i was pretty like so but we didn't i didn't have i didn't have all the details of the story i didn't realize that there i thought this was when she said i had like a mental breakdown i was like oh that's like crazy like that's nuts but then yeah yeah and then there's like these like the twisties things i'm like all right well that's like that that's like an injury that's like your leg's broken type of thing so my opinion changed and i was like ah i didn't actually have all the facts when i was when i was kind of explaining my opinion yeah uh yeah that's that's true and so we we basically were like we sent it to sam's wife and we were like hey what do you think too much it was like yeah a little too much that's how we cut it but i i thought there was one part of it that was interesting right like so yeah nobody really cares about sean and sam's opinion on simon biles even though kind of that's whatever it can be interesting the more crazy your reaction the more interesting it gets i thought the more interest i thought the real part in it was there's going to be a trend i'm calling it now over the next five to seven years people are going to start to really give a [ __ ] about mental fitness and it's a very different thing than mental health just like for your physical body you have health like do you have a disease are you ill like no i i'm not i'm not sick but you can be not sick but you can be not fit at the same time and um right so so you could be healthy but not fit and in the same way you could have mental health meaning you don't uh you're not suffering from you know depression uh severe anxiety bipolar anything like that but you can also not be mentally fit and you know so what's a fit person right sam's a really fit person uh you're really physically fit if you work out with sam you go for a run with sam you'll be like god damn this guy can run he's you know he can go long distances he's he's fit and so similarly there's mental fitness which is basically just like in physical fitness it's about overcoming some adversity so a mentally fit person is somebody who can overcome a high degree of and variety of of adversity and intensity of diverse of adversity and so um you know [ __ ] not going your way getting in sticky situations being out of your comfort zone these are all areas where mental fitness matters relationships uh different different challenges that come your way is where mental fitness matters and i think right now this is something that is very poorly understood it's rarely talked about it's almost never taught but i would say mental fitness is in my opinion the most important skill one can have right the most important thing is the little voice in your head that's talking all day non-stop this chatter box we have in our head and what is it telling yourself is it telling yourself that you suck that you can't do it is it telling yourself that you should give up this is too hard is it telling yourself that uh you know don't do it things might go wrong or is it saying the opposite is it saying uh you know what you could figure this out hey um even if it doesn't work out no problem you know you'll still everything will still be okay hey even though this this person just cut you off on the road look at look around the sky is blue the air is crisp your family is happy and healthy you have a lot to be grateful for right like the voice in your head dictates the quality of your life and the voice in your head is your mental fitness it is it is the the manifestation of your mental fitness and so i think we're going to be seeing a lot around this i think we're going to be seeing growth in services content thought leaders whatever around mental fitness what do you think am i overblowing this or is that are you a believer i'm a believer i think that what you're doing with this title mental fitness is i think you're just re-branding something that's been around for a long time you know this is like a tony robbins book so i i i totally buy into what you're saying and i and i 100 agree with it i think there's a few opportunities here the first is so i'm reading this amazing book called human nature i've been reading it for a long time for like six months and it's it's very dense but i've i'll read it and read it over and over and over again and i take notes and i'm trying to like master it because to me it's like a handbook on how to like handle my emotions and how to handle other people now what i would do with this is what i would want to do is almost have like a wimp to warrior type of program where i can spend a fair bit of money and have a very intense program and i think that a mental fitness type thing i think that's a lifetime of learning and a lot that's like a lifetime journey but i do think that there is like transformational moments and series of your life that could actually level you up significantly and i think that there's an opportunity to build something like that in this weird kind of [ __ ] up way i've always been a little bit jealous of people who went to the military or at least people who um went to military school because like there's this like classic like i was undisciplined i was fat i was unhealthy i wouldn't wake up early now i make my bed i know how to like show respect to each other to people i have self-confidence i know i have a a a new level of discipline and i'm like oh my god i know what i'm made of i went through hell week and i made it so i i have been to my breaking point beyond my breaking point where there was just no way and and i did it and you know they don't brag about it but you could tell there's a certain level of confidence that people have by discovering your bottom right what is your actual rock bottom not not not in terms of your money but in terms of like your mental your mental game where you break you break physically yeah sure but when you break mentally it's over and uh and so they've been there because you know that's what the military does they challenge you in that way and i've always been jealous of that i'm like man i wish that like i make a i like i say in a joke away but i'm not actually joking when i'm with my wife i'm like i i wish i would have went to military school because like there's some like discipline stuff that i don't have that i wish i would i would have had and it's almost like i've searched for like what type of program's going to go to where it's like uh it's like basically like the like the the the soft version of that it's like a like a fat camp version of that where i can just like spend money and they just like insult me for a week but uh anyway i think that's like i think there's something there with that and i also think that there's something there with mastering some of these books and some of these things um and doing this mental fitness type of type of stuff and so i'm on board with this i actually think this is quite amazing yeah and i think the the word is amazing and this concept this concept of look you're healthy you're not like ruined but you're not fit i think that's amazing i love um you know who could like crush us if they wanted to but i don't think they they do have you bit paid attention to what ryan holiday has done with his stoic brand no like i'm from before but i don't know anything specific i've seen his books but tell me what's interesting so ryan holiday is an author his first book was called how to get famous or what was it called how to it's like news jacking or whatever yeah i forget what it was called the obstacle is the way ego is the enemy or something like that he's got a buddy yeah so he's got obstacles wait you go and this whole idea is based on stoicism which is this uh what are they greek i don't know marcus aurelius these philosophies of basically like you're gonna face hardship in your life and it's not about avoiding them but it's about embracing them and finding meaning in them and it's great and these and it's probably predominantly male young males who listen to his stuff i'm one of them and he's built this brand called the daily stoic so i believe it's called dailystoic.com and he sells 25 stoicism coins which i own one he sells um like a 19 email course where every 14 days he teaches you like a new stoicism like thing on how to read more like and it's it's pretty amazing and like if i don't think he would ever want to do this because he he seems like he's got a good life and he doesn't want to work much harder but i i i would imagine that if ryan holliday had like a stowaway stoiism boot camp for like a month and he charged like 10 grand and like it was around this mental fitness idea i think loads of loads of people including me would would pay to go yeah by the way i heard something that i thought was great they go a lot of people get it backwards i forgot who said this uh they were talking about stoicism and i was like yeah you know stoicism you know i get it you're supposed to be stoic and then that that brings you sort of this calm and this peace and this like sort of like really stable mental mental game and uh he goes no it's the other way around when you calm the mind you become stoic you don't become stoic to calm the mind and uh i thought oh that's so true which is that you um that's exactly how it works is people think oh if i practice stoicism i'll become that person who is calm mind and able to just operate and doesn't have these sort of like massive swings and it's like no it's the other way around when once you learn to tame the mind once you learn to master the mind you'll naturally become a stoic person um you have to get that get the order back get the order right and uh so that was like a big breakthrough for me because i know i know a lot of people that have tried to get into stoicis they have this anxiety they have this like sort of mental like lack of clarity and calmness they get into stoicism thinking it's the answer and they get sort of disillusioned very quickly they're like oh yeah it wasn't for me and it's like well that's true because stoicism is almost a state you get to after you learn how to calm the mind it's not the method you use you know so i've read a lot of stoicism books and i like it from just a history perspective and i like it from a practical life philosophy perspective i think it's one of the very few like philosophical things that you could apply to your daily life you know whose book changed my it kind of changed my life on it and it was shocking it was naval that naval almanac what's it called right the navalminec it's so good it's so good so the first half is all about making money and the second half is all about being happy and the first half is like that's just normal whatever who cares the second half i felt was was pretty game changing and he talks a lot about stoicism and a lot about mental fitness and i and he was basically like uh the the the summary is basically happiness is a choice that i made and here's some of the strategies that i use and it's very sto it is stoicism and i thought it was very useful all right let's uh let's jump to a different topic uh real quick can i wait let me quick tell you really quick about one of the greatest hacks that i've seen so a financial hack so when starting a company so the first one that i always tell people and this is something that's new to me that a lot of people or was new to me a lot of people don't know about it's called qsbs so it's probably the greatest american uh tax adv basically when you sell your company if you have qsbs which basically is like the it basically means qualified small business tax so if you sell a business and you've owned the business stock for five years and it's a c corp if you sell your company the first 10 million dollars in sales are in uh and profit that you make for your company you don't pay taxes on so it's amazing but i think i found something that's even better um moving to canada so i talked to this company the other day and they they were building this like amazing thing and i was like huh how many people work there you're like a really new company and they're like well we have about 18 people who work here and we only spend about a million dollars a year uh in total cost and that's kind of cool so basically when you're starting a company i started my company in san francisco if you're starting your company i i would imagine that you would when i started it i it was ten thousand dollars ahead but i and i was hiring like um young people who didn't pay much but i imagine you'd wanna you'd wanna bake in fifteen thousand dollars ahead right easily engineers yeah so maybe more so but let's just say fifteen thousand so fifteen thousand times twelve is let's say fifteen thousand times twelve is um so that's a hundred and eighty grand ahead oh i think it's even more than that it's probably it's it's so that number you're talking about is basically seven years ago and non-engineers and now you fast forward seven years double it and then engineers basically double it again and so you know what what was maybe let's say 10 grand is actually you should be buck you should be budgeting almost 30 grand 30 grand per per head is probably closer to reality now 30 grand you think okay so 30 grand engineers yeah so 30 grand times 12 is 360. so 360 thousand dollars a an employee so 360 times uh 15 if you have 15 employees that's gonna be around five million dollars and by the way so that's not um that's not to adjust their salary so let's say their salary is 200 to something k then you have to pay all the like you know kind of additional overhead on salaries which is about 20 that's your fica that's your social security all that good stuff you have your rent you have your free catered lunches you have your your snacks in the office you have all the other [ __ ] that you gotta do if you're gonna hire in this like extremely competitive hiring environment signing bonuses recruiter fees it all rolls up uh so if that number sounds high uh if that number sounds high you'd be surprised if that number sounds low you're probably right and so let's just say like three to five million dollars is a huge range to have a team of 15 engineer heavy uh highly competitive startup uh to get going it's a lot of money i talked to this guy the other day and he had 15 people and i was and he told me he was spending a million dollars a year and i was like wait what he goes yeah so here's how it works in canada we have these things called the research and development credits and basically what that means is if you're an engineer they're called them shred credits even though it's s-r-e-d but i think they just when people talk about it they call them shred yeah i i heard people mention it but i didn't actually look at the mechanics of it and i'm not an expert on it but he was reading it to me and i was amazed and basically what happens is he pays their full salary so he pays some engineer 150 grand a year and at the end of the year i think he literally gets like deposited money back 50 of the cost that he's allocated or he's paid them he gets that money back at the end of the year so 160 000 salary is actually only 80k to him and also in order to manage cash flow there's these loans there's loans that you can so he has to pay the 160 000 so 160 000 bi-weekly so he pays that out so you have to have cash up front but he was able to get a loan against that and so he gets a loan up front and then at the end of the year after paying taxes and things like that he gets the salary money back this was amazing and he was telling me all about it and this guy was based in toronto and i've never been to toronto but it's it sounds like an amazing place there's a company that you should check out for this uh that's kind of cool so so most companies aren't going to make the drastic move to go move to canada so there's a company it's part of atomic if you've ever seen it and while you're talking pulling that up i think um i think the best arbitrage to do this in or one of the easiest is service-based businesses so okay so but i think you can't do it unless they're engineering i feel like it's only engineering roles it's i believe it's for anything that's uh research and development right which usually i think is uh no no no because the at the hustle we got a uh we got a tax credit for some type of research and development stuff and i had to go through each employee and like kind of guesstimate what percentage of the time is on like research and development and and you can do this for agencies um you can get a fair bit of money back so agencies that do a certain type of thing and i was at my friend's office uh who has a new york agency and their office was like lavish because and and they spent they i think they sent half a million dollars uh decorating it and uh i was i was like well why'd you guys do it he's like well this is just what you got to do to like keep up with everyone and i was like well [ __ ] i don't want to play this game i'd rather keep up with other people in other places and i think that we have a friend who has an agency and he sells silicon valley and new york companies but he does this arbitrage thing and he makes way more profit than most huge agencies the um the company i was talking about was terminal terminal dot io i think they basically their their their startup is a smart idea they basically were like hey we will spin up a canadian engineering office for you so you want these credits you want these cheaper engineers but you don't want to relocate yourself and your whole business and figure out shred credits and figure out where to go find engineers and figure out you know the best coffee shop in toronto cool we will do the engineering office for you and you just pay our bill and like basically they're kind of like a recruiting spin-up agency for for talent in in this region which i think is pretty smart a smart arbitrage now they're doing it in kind of a fancy way i think anybody could really do this i think it's a smart idea yeah and uh so anyway this guy like made this it like i had this whole conversation and then he like kind of he like made this off-hated comment and i'm like wait wait wait wait wait what and that like it totally was like there was a big shift there um and i was like i'm sorry i know we're not supposed to like this isn't like the main point of this conversation but can you tell me everything about this right and that was pretty that was pretty amazing you wanna do one more yeah let's do one quick one um all right what's fun uh did you see that reese witherspoon sold her production company for 900 million dollars yeah and a lot of people cause to fuss about that and i don't entirely understand the business but i don't think i think people cause the fuss because they don't understand what the buyers were getting but what they're getting why is this worth 900 million dollars they get three tv shows and her her team well so this is like kind of bro science so i want to preface like i haven't done like entirely a bunch of research on this but reece witherspoon has had this production company i think since like the early-ish 2000s so for a long time what that means is i believe that she owns the rights you know do you realize that reese witherspoon is like like she's gross like over a billion dollars i mean she's like one of those people that she's like the killers like the killers is a band that like maybe not everyone says that they're it's their favorite brand but like everyone knows like mr brightside and they like you know they they're quietly in the background just always the best in the most popular but even though they're no one's favorite that's kind of what reese witherspoon is it's like everyone that at least kind of likes her and will go to her movies and so with uh with the deal i believe what they're buying is like a lot of ip from years and years of production work so uh okay so so i'm looking up i'm looking up right now so it says that she started hello sunshine the company that got bought in 2016. before that she had another one it's called pacific standard in 2012 and that's a subsidiary of it so she kind of rolled that in so 2012 so that's only a decade and uh i guess in 2000 she had another production company called type a films and they made i don't know some oscar gone girl they made you know not nothing too big big little lies was their hit recently and then they had the morning show which is on apple tv but uh this is wild this is like so she has a book club and the book club has over 500 000 followers on instagram that's pretty amazing um she also owns a dude good for her she's a filmmaking lab that teaches 20 year old 20 girls that are 13 to 18 the art of filmmaking like this is great dude be like she also has a she also has a clothing brand i think it's called draper james and they have brick and mortar stores all over the country what about what a powerhouse reese is kind of like an oprah thing where she's just got kind of got a web of like a variety of different things she's uh she's a baller she's also a kind of a baller because a few years ago her husband her and her husband were at a party and they drove home and her husband was got pulled over and i think he got a dui and she got out of the car and like uh confronted the cop and and she's like i'm going with him so and she got arrested with her husband so she she's kind of um she's kind of a boss no it's amazing i think if i remember correctly i believe her company was bought by kevin mayer who recently was the ceo of tic toc america but got fired because of all the stuff and before that was he's a ceo he was a ceo of disney or he wasn't the ceo but he was president and he he like was the president i think of disney plus uh before like when they launched or whatever yeah so he's a big swinging dick and he yeah and he basically they bought this company to build a conglomerate of like some type of media company i don't entirely understand the structure these deals to me always seem very complicated and they seem very like deal makey the numbers right because like i'm looking at the so i'm looking at the assets so they have gone girl which which made 360 million uh gross in the box office and then the next highest one was 50 billion so they have four films uh of which you know nothing nothing huge um and then they have on tv they got big little lies the morning show little fires everywhere those are the three shows you know and then there's six that have been bought or sold to either apple tv plus amazon abc netflix whoever i just don't get how you get to that number because i feel like to do that you you basically need to uh like like the office was getting 100 million dollars a year of like streaming royalties that's like you know the top of friends you know those are getting 100 million a year i feel like there's a pretty deep drop-off after that so i think this is like this is like a beats by dre acquisition is kind of what i see it as which is basically somebody being like cool we get rhys we get recent and then some stuff great i think that's basically like when apple bought beats and they're like great we get you know we get dr dre and we get whatever his name is jimmy iveen or or whatever um plus we get some headphones all right three billion yeah we'll we'll pay three billion for but i think it's like the most expensive the company that bought it was blackstone they're the funding and they i i would imagine they don't they're pretty savvy i don't know if they overpay for a lot of stuff blackstone is funding that guy kevin mayer kevin mayer's company is the one who bought this so i think it's more like kevin i think it's more like a quibby thing where kevin mayer in this case uh quibby was started by what's the name jeffrey capps katzenberg katzenberg you know the dreamwork the guy who started dreamworks so he was able to go raise two billion dollars because he's like i'm jeffrey katzenberg i started dreamworks and then he used it to go buy a bunch of content and it all evaporated into zero dollars um i think that's that's you know more like what this is like versus some some like real asset that you can analyze and say yeah it's worth that um dude congratulations congratulations to reese for getting that bag we i would i that she is actually amazing reese witherspoon's pretty amazing have you seen have you seen what she you know she's like i think she's in her mid-50s isn't she i don't know but she's killing it and uh she's exactly the same well she looks exactly the same they get like you know shot up all over their face and you know they look the same or or or it goes the other way and they just look super weird and they're like yeah it's just gone wrong um you know we'll end on this one one last thing you know the new coven strain uh is called like whatever delta the delta variance delta plus is the new one um i was thinking about this this morning first delta how shitty for delta airlines just for for the new covets train to get named after you god that's a that's a tough that's a tough loss to just wake up to it's like yo which scientist just decided to name this delta like that's not cool and then i was like it's a scary name it's a scary name i was thinking what would that be worth to them if you were delta delta's if you were delta what would you pay some lobbyist some some bribery to some scientist how much money would you shove in the briefcase for this to not be called the delta variant it's like yo we call this the united variant call this the the the southwest variant don't call this the delta variant so i'm staying at this hotel it's called the i don't know what's called gaylord opryland or i don't know what it's called but i i think it's called gaylord i mean gaylord opryland that wasn't like a joke that's what it's called and i'm in this like wing of the hotel called the delta wing and it i it it has like a bright red sign that says delta wing and i'm just like what i'm seeing is i'm like oh man this is just like not good but yeah i don't did you associate delta airlines with the variant i didn't i didn't i didn't it's gonna happen i mean corona like corona beer with the coronavirus like you know that can't have been good for them um i didn't associate corona beer too much with that did you i mean yeah people did it's like that it became the word of the year and it's associated with like the deadliest virus in a hundred years is the coronavirus and who owns corona you know nothing good comes from that except for you know the like college bro who's like bro i've had i've had the coronavirus for you know five years been loving corona you know but ever since it's like that joke that's the only upside you get uh everything else is downside and so i don't know i feel like delta should pay you know they're worth i think like 25 30 billion or something like that how do you pay i though you can't you can't pay anybody but i'm saying what would they pay if they could push a button and make this go away i feel like this is worth a billion dollars to delta like easily this is worth 125th of their of their market cap this is worth a four percent swing and like brand value perception you know who's going to want to fly on delta with the delta variant going around uh i i just feel like that's a there's some weird association here on delta that's my understanding of the delta wing so i think you're and i'm selling you're just helping health and delta all right uh yeah anyways i i feel like if i could if i could secretly present the ceo with a button that said pay a billion dollars and this goes away this doesn't this isn't called delta i think he pushes that button yeah i would agree um all right i think that i think we had an action-packed episode we'll see what people think um i think we gave like eight good things good all right and uh our early morning episode in the books enjoy the podcast conference uh all right i'll see you see ya i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what travel never looking back

if you could get into a top 20 university and you have to get go into a ton of debt it is 100 worth it and that if that's the case it ain't broken i think it's doing great i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be you know when you're listening to this it's all going to sound smooth but we've just recorded this like three times because remote work still sucks a little bit um but we have brie here bree bree kimmel is an investor in mostly i think work work-related products so maybe you could tell us why it's so hard uh all right let me just read three things off your little bio thing here that i think are interesting so um solo capitalist so you raised your own fund by yourself after never having worked in vc before that is that correct that's correct okay great uh another one according to this you have invested in seven unicorns already which is kind of nutty what are the seven yeah so started work life about a year and a half ago invested in hoppin web flow which was an angel investment from when i was at zendesk um pipe public uh a bunch of interesting companies and sort of future workspace okay wow that's pretty impressive um okay and then another one that's on here that i think is kind of interesting that i think we should just jump in on i don't know sam where do you want to start you want to start with this i want to start with this bourdain story but that's mine i want to start with this that's mine do you know what this podcast is about i do know what this podcast is about i've actually listened to many episodes i'm a big fan great so we don't need to explain much to you um so brie um you and go ahead and plug your new podcast you have uh coming out what's it called oh we're coming in hot we're plugging the podcast already i thought that was going to come in later no no we do it now oh and then people are yes i'm not going to crazy and they'll do it yeah so we're um the first podcast after um this one to be part of the hubspot podcast network um so myself and my best friend alexis gay she's a stand-up comedian she makes a lot of tech parody videos um we decided to start a business podcast with the fine folks over at hubspot who have been awesome they've given us a team we've interviewed interesting people it's it's been cool for me because you know as you mentioned i mostly do software investing and we're actually interviewing a lot of direct consumer founders and people that i've never met before and so we have this new podcast coming out called the shake up where we interview business leaders about very specific decisions that they've made that have changed the trajectory of their company so hang on is that uh like is the vibe like comedy because she's a comedian like is this called her daddy or is this like uh you know how i built this or what is this it actually that's a really great that's a really great point uh we're somewhere between the two um we wanted to make it interesting and educational and it is more of a business audience i think in this new era of working from home unless it's interesting and entertaining people don't want to listen and so it's not corporate it's not boring um one of the most challenging parts of the podcast for me is that it's very hard to get business people off script they've all gone through comms training they all have you know their executive coach to get them to really open up and share vulnerable moments or to be really open and authentic has been surprisingly really hard sam is really good at it he uh i don't know how he does it but he he breaks through that every single time um but i gotta wait sean i mean i i think you're good at you're you're pretty good at that too i think we both are you're good at getting them you're good at like getting people off the script really good at getting people off the script um because sam will do something like he'll like he'll see you and he'll be like he'd be like like yeah he's like you're good looking i mean like not traditionally but like you're you're good looking so what and then they're like what are you talking about and it's like kind of a compliment kind of an insult and then they're just trying to figure out like where do i take this and so then like something natural comes out or he'll be like you know ask them about i don't know something weird that's it that's behind them in the room or something like that and uh that usually gets people off so i'm so so bad at this that i had to bring a stand-up comedian to really like warm up the guests i i like as an investor it's a little bit robotic and you tend to ask the same five to ten questions and so that's alexis's job she's world class at getting people you know maybe flattering them a little bit maybe flattering herself maybe complimenting the show but then finding ways to get people to open up and to be a little bit less scripted is it hard to be on a podcast with somebody who's a professional comedian like i know sam struggles just dealing with my level of my prowess are you intimidated by your comedian uh co-host you know it has been fun um you know now that we have a producer as well you know the producer is very clear at uh helping us define our roles and so like i know that i'm not funny it's not my role to be funny on the show it's my role to like bring in data and research and i get to be the nerdy one which is great um i don't attempt to be funny at all yeah that's my strategy by the way sean they have like producers and [ __ ] and like hey like they got like resources the lady who runs the podcast network at hubspot i'm like wait brian these folks are getting like producers and head shots like i've been using like eric on fiverr like have to like rig this stuff together honestly it's i don't even show up to the meeting so they're probably like yeah of course you don't get anything you don't show up to the [ __ ] meeting why would we give you any resources so you've listened to you've listened to a couple podcasts i to just so what we're going to do is we're going to brainstorm a little bit i know that you who you've got a couple ideas here that i definitely want to talk about i want to talk about your calendar because like when i see that i just want to kill myself i can't believe that that's your calendar i'm embarrassed that you saw it actually i'm a little bit embarrassed oh my god so well i want to talk about a bunch of stuff but before we um get into that can i tell you guys something that's i've been obsessed with over the past week so there's this new anthony bourdain documentary um i actually don't remember what it's called um do you guys know what i'm talking about a roadrunner it's called roadrunner okay so it came out last week and it's basically about his last maybe uh three or four weeks of life or something like that and it talks about like details his last four weeks of life and talks about the his whole journey and whatever that's not the point the point is is at the end they have this amazing sound bite so basically right before he died he wrote an email to someone and it wasn't like a suicide note but it was like like i'm sad type of thing and you hear him read that email well it's not actually him uh it's ai he never actually said that but he died you know he wrote the email and then he died and this company used this technology to to read out the email and it sounds just like him if i wasn't like a nerd and researched it i would have thought that it was him and i started i started thinking about this i started thinking about a few things and um the reason i kind of putting all this together is i read the story about this guy last week named josh and basically what happened was his girlfriend died and he used gpt3 or gpt3 and he loaded up a ton of social media messages like you know facebook messages and tweets and twitter stuff or and and text stuff that she had said and he put it to gb3 and he made a girlfriend who knew she died and he could talk to her uh and and and and like feel like he's still connected hey do you think this is wrong and creepy b that anthony bourdain thing that's obviously that's gonna happen that should that's gonna happen in the future how movies are gonna are gonna come about but three when are we gonna start talking to our dead moms came in hot at the end there is this crazy like like it like the fact that anthony bourdain did this isn't it wild that we're gonna be having these conversations i don't hang around with the smart enough people to be to be who built your stuff yeah did you ever see that episode of black mirror where they did this basically so do you watch any black mirror sam no it's all right it's a little bit depressing but it's like too accurate also at the same time so the in in black mirror they take this to the extreme and basically this girl's living with her boyfriend and then by the you know middle or end of the episode you realize that this boyfriend is not like real he's basically like an ai robot that is just like kind of like he's not perfect like so it gives her companionship because like it's like he's still here he's doing all the things it sounds like him and it looks like him but he's not actually human so it's kind of like you know the uncanny valley it doesn't seem it's not actually the real thing and so it's kind of depressing for her uh to be with this kind of like shadow of her boyfriend or whatever and so there's been a bunch of people trying to do this with gpd3 and um somebody did it with our podcast i don't know if you saw that uh somebody uploaded my a bunch of stories i told or something like that i put it in i saw that yeah and he's like look you can ask john a question and then like it gives a pretty real like it's like me when i just [ __ ] some answer it's like it bullshits it just as good as i can i'm like wow this is kind of amazing so i think we're getting we're getting closer to where that's that's like um it's like the anthony bourdain thing where of course it's not gonna be fully accurate but damn it's like it feels like magic it was that this wasn't really a thing five ten years ago bri what have you seen in that space yeah i mean one point i'm at with the bourdain piece i mean what's interesting there is you know he the question is are you building a legacy and are you carrying someone's story forward i think that's really cool i think if there are sound bites or old songs or if you can take a book that was written a decade ago and then put it in the voice of someone who's already passed away that can be really cool i mean that's really like a strong storytelling angle and a way to really continue their legacy the kind of the gray area for me is you know for the guy that's created a fake girlfriend that's uh using previous text conversations like i'm a little bit concerned for him in in the long the long term you know i think he's maybe staying in the past as opposed to like you know going through therapy or you know spending time with family and friends and then like getting back out there again and so it probably depends on the use case and some of the scenarios for these technologies but i agree i love black mirror i've watched them all binge watch them all and uh it's really creepy to see that a lot of these things are actually proving to be true so then i was i was looking around at what other stuff is like this there's just this one called airwriter.app and what you can do is you can look at the variety of different dead authors and dead famous people that they have and they've uploaded all their personalities and you can ask ben franklin a question it's pretty amazing anyway i just wanted to tell you all about that i've been obsessing about this so there's one that i'm going to tell you guys about but you uh i almost don't want to tell you until i lock in my full investment but i want to invest in this company i saw it i haven't even had a chance to talk to them yet but what they're doing is um they basically made a a version of deep fake that you can do for yourself so you can thank customers personally for um for a purchase or for anything that they did so basically you record yourself once sitting in a room like i'm here right and i say oh you know thanks for leaving that review on itunes for the podcast yeah or thanks for tweeting out the podcast and then what what it does is it basically takes me in that scenario and it starts it off with hey sam uh you know saw your review just want to say blah blah but i don't have to record the hey sam part the hey sam part the personal touch gets basically deep faked in the video and then they can insert any of the variables so like let's say it's ecommerce i could say hey blank name right so i'll be like hey sam thank you know thanks for uh thanks for shopping with us i hope you love the casper mattress that you just bought right and it'll make the whole thing sound pretty seamless and just input variables from uh from a database essentially and just turn it into your voice so i think that's kind of amazing to add a quote-unquote personal touch that's going to be you know automated it scales sometimes scalable uh my uh scout zach found it and he sent it to me i'm really excited for that use case i'm also really excited to see some of the bloopers like i can't wait to see a person's face say hey first name last name right yeah like how's your day going thanks for being a customer right hey [ __ ] thanks [Laughter] i find sometimes the automated stuff i've tried at some of these automated gifting services before and if the database isn't in a perfect form and first name last name isn't spelled right you end up looking like an [ __ ] but it can be pretty funny so bree i have to ask you a question it this is going to sound like an insult which we just told you i'm apparently known for it he's about to do the thing this is not an insult this is not an [ __ ] um all right so i'm looking at work-life ventures so this is this uh firm you started in 2019 before that you worked at uh uh i was looking at your linkedin what was it it starts with the z that's the big software um you had a normal a good job there so like you are a relatively normal person but you are investing in like the most baller companies at the earliest times how are like the the left-handed compliment is like you're not really like a somebody and yet somehow you already are somebody how on earth did you pull this off how did you go from nobody to somebody i think we could go even even before zendus before zendesk you know i worked at a big tech company i was at expedia went to a state school grew up in ohio i mean we can we can cut the data anyway i'm a very normal person i live a very normal life like i'm not your like venture capitalist that's flying in private jets and you know doing all these crazy things you might be now yeah you might be now i you said it sounds like you're about to make a killing uh well going back to your point thank you that wasn't insulting that's like very clearly uh something you can see from linkedin is like you know i i started out as a marketer um started meeting startups on evenings and weekends started hosting dinners um the interesting thing that i don't think a lot of people truly realize until you're on the ground in silicon valley is you just end up meeting a lot of people just by proximity like you walk into a dinner you make one or two connections you keep checking in with them you stay in touch um and that's how you build your network and you know everyone there is going somewhere like you don't move to the valley pay crazy insane rent prices uh to not be like in the mix and so i found that you know a lot of the things that i did early on as an angel i was really intentional about like the angel investment and web flow um i had organized a go to market workshop invited webflow so i had like you know a whole day with the team which was great i hosted a couple of no-code dinners just spent as much time with them as possible i try to find interesting ways to really build close relationships with a handful of companies i know we talked about you you mentioned my calendar and how insane it is i actually don't take that many meetings and i i rarely do one-on-one coffees with people which is really interesting and kind of a different strategy from other vcs but i try to find interesting touch points that will give me enough of an angle to invest in a company that's starting to work so webflow can i just read your schedule by the way because nobody's looking at this so let me just take let's just take a wednesday okay here's wednesday just for for people you you wake up seven a.m morning block what happens in morning block are you uh i'm doing that usually i go to the gym usually i go to the gym during combat i rode my peloton but i'm now back to going to the gym right okay exactly so we're going up until uh about 8 30 so from 7 to 8 30 that's like getting ready to go to the gym go to the gym it says peloton 45 all right great now we have morning block two what's happening morning block two morning block two i send emails to portfolio companies and ask them for ways to help or sometimes there's proj specific tangible projects i have to work on for a specific company cool so 30 minutes there then uh okay where are we at so team check-ins we have a one-on-one with neil great email processing i love that you're like an actual machine i'm a little bit embarrassed right now this is like you're reading my diary it's like you put it on the internet yeah i know just hearing it out loud makes me sound insane so thank you okay prep pitch number one that's 12 15 to 1 then we have pitch number one so you you do the research before the pitch then you take the pitch oh yeah that's interesting usually i start the call and then they see my eyes frantically going around the screen well i'm looking for like a [ __ ] did i get who is this what is the deck what is the name of this company and i'll just be like let's just before we talk about your company just tell me about yourself while i go look at what company you are uh all right so you're doing your research you do your pitch uh next step so you do immediate follow-ups you do your second pitch prep second pitch second pitch follow-up text triage what's that like text text messages yeah i am horrible at responding to text messages i will read them i will think that i responded and then i'll reply like four days later and so i actually block time in my calendar to go through all of the texts that i'm getting throughout the day do you actually follow this i do i do and i will say for people um that aren't aren't in venture or aren't doing early early stage startups a lot of thing is done over text and over phone calls it's a highly inefficient process it's not like corporate where you know everyone's on email and everyone's on slack it's mostly through one-on-one text so all right we'll just round it off so we're going email processing part two then ad hoc strategy what does that mean ad hoc strategy is uh so part of the the goal of work life is we help a lot on go to market and so typically we're working through various different go to market strategies for certain companies gotcha then you do a virtual dinner amazing uh life admin so that's like you know what laundry what is that code for laundry uh when i when i published this it was around the time i was i had a crazy backlog of just like random things like i woke up one morning was like my driver's license is expired my passport is expired i haven't left my house in a year like i need to get my life in order and so that was the week that they said this was screenshots and published there you go all right evening block from 8 p.m to 11 p.m and then what bedtime 11 p.m yeah usually okay do you think that's a difference we want as well and so i could probably like throw in my sleep data if we want to get really weird do you so i i um i try like i say no to everything i think shawn you might be the same way but for my i try to have nothing on my calendar i don't want to talk to anyone ever uh and like a meeting to me is like a really big deal like i just don't want to do it they gave me an ea and i was like oh so great first time having an ea what what do you do and they're like oh like calendaring i manage your calendar if you want to book meetings i'll book them for you if people want to book you i'll do it and i was like oh okay all right uh look you're gonna love me this is the easiest task ever somebody asked for a meeting just say hey he asked if you could slack him instead and then if i ask you for a meeting just say are you sure and just delete all the group meetings in the next three weeks just delete them and i'll add them back in if they were important and so basically her job was just to make sure nothing gets on the calendar rather than taking things off rather than putting these on do you think that um this calendar has been this discipline do you think it's helped you because it's i mean i'm looking at like i'm trying to find all the unfair advantages to how you kind of came up so fast probably not going to say it sucks i can tell you i can tell you pros and cons pros to the pros to the insane calendar is it did provide a lot of structure i felt that working from home uh i am not the best at working from home i will say that and so the structure has been really helpful um it's been great the reason for a lot of the uh new routines is because i do have a team now so i have a team of five people behind the scenes and so i need to make sure that the the firm is running accordingly and so i think having that structure is really helpful um i also find it does help me say no and to have specific moments throughout the day where i text founders or jump on a call just because i i had talked to a lot of traditional venture capitalists and if you ask them how they spend their week or if you ask like you know what did on friday friday afternoon like what did you do this week it would all be a blur because there's so much activity and so many things that are happening and so i found that quantifying it a little bit was a nice way for me to at least establish some of these routines like will i continue doing this forever probably not but it's at least something that was helpful um when getting the firm off the ground and sam we were looking at that that spreadsheet of uh what do vcs make i think we should talk about that so this is one of these yeah this is what does the solar capitalists do yeah um so the reason why go ahead you find it sean and then i'll talk so bri bri the one of the reasons why i'm prodding you so much is this whole vc world it it kind of um i i just like i can't tell if i'm just low iq i just it's really hard for me to understand like how the money actually gets in debris pocket you know like how i understand you invest it i understand you um invest in in startups and you wait 10 years to sell but like sometimes i'm curious like okay but how much money can you actually make and so we recently found i have no idea how our friend found it a spreadsheet that i think it's all uh user submitted salaries and carry numbers of maybe like a thousand different vcs do you want to read it read that often i'm trying to find it it's a little bit hard to find here while we're while we're live but basically i don't know if you could do it sam if you could find it but basically it broke it down by fun size so it's like all right if uh so you were p people were volunteering their information here's what i make that's my base compensation here's what i make as a bonus and here's what my carry is and it was like you know my fund is 0 to 50 million 50 million to 100 million 100 to 250 million and then like all the way up to a 2 billion plus fund and um and it was it's even there there's like quite a lot of variety right because not every partner has the same deal but what it looked to me like was that for small funds um and you correct me if i'm if i'm wrong here but this is this was my my summary of like you know 500 rows of data just eyeballing it it looked like if you work at a small fund let's call it under 100 million dollars is your fund size um the good news is you know you're taking two percent of let's call it a hundred million that's two million dollars and usually it's just one or two partners maybe you know some some admin people kind of behind the scenes um but you can you can basically take a a large salary and you have a large percentage of the carry but you um but then on the other side the small the small funds seem to do pretty well and then the lar the really large funds that were like a two billion dollar fund their you know their fees itself is insane um right two percent of two billion every year that you're taking is a large number and then they're carry um you know they're the multiple they're they're expecting to do on a two billion dollar fund they may they may not 5x that fund they may just two exit the fund or three x that fund and so their carry expectations are different it looked to me like this venture capitalists kind of have like a high paying job maybe 400 500 000 a year and then if they hit winners like you seem to have hit some winners or you have some winners in your portfolio like you you you've hit a lot of winners if those pan out if hop in truly does end up as a five to ten billion dollar company then you know you're gonna you're gonna have a big windfall which might look more like 20 to 50 million dollars can come your way if these winners pan out go public and whatnot so tell me how accurate that is or like put differently what are your expectations on like how much you can make doing this thing you're doing now yeah um great question i wanted to touch on something that sam said as well um what's interesting when you look at venture capital today is when i was initially starting the firm i went into this with a belief that venture is or traditional venture is on the decline i saw angel investors that were getting into really great rounds i saw um solo capitalists or super angels like i know scott belski has been on the show elod gil is a close friend and someone that's deploying a lot of capital i mean a capital that looks like almost a large top-tier firm and so i saw that individuals were doing the work that you know a 20 to 30 person venture firm were doing and so i think it's interesting to see like i'm a great case in point where i was in marketing i went to a state school i grew up in ohio like i'm by no means a pedigreed person but i have been able to build a track record and i have been able to raise outside money and i think this is just like the very very early days for what's about to happen where there will be a lot more people that look like me and there will be a lot more people that start their own firms because i think it's one of these things where like the nature of venture is changing and my investors like smaller funds because you have one of those higher return profiles as opposed to some of the larger institutions that their multiple is coming down over time and many of those lps are having a hard time getting access to those funds at all so a guy like um so who what was the guy's name uh alad gill is that you say zayn i've read a great book by him i forget operator's manual i think it was called no high growth startups or something like that manual handbook uh yeah it was good that was a great that was a great book i had i hadn't heard of this guy but like i see him everywhere and so is this just basically an incredibly high net worth liquid person who just writes massive checks to hundreds of startups a year is that just i mean is it as simple as that um in a lot's case it's a combination of personal capital plus outside money as well i will say that a lot of the solo capitalists i mean even the um you know my fund size is primarily my first check-in i do a lot of spvs and i do a lot of follow-on investing and that's with a handful of lps and so many of us we kind of publish here's our core strategy and then behind the scenes many of us have other playbooks that we're running as well and have you made have you had any returns so far since since you've started i have those have mostly been on the spb front um you know i i'm setting up uh special purpose vehicles where i have one or two lps where they're um it's it's primarily their capital i might write a small personal check or something small out of the fund alongside that but i'm starting to see some returns in companies however i will say i'm holding on all of those positions what do you think is a re because this is what the thing me and sam talk about which is like with investing you have you have illiquidity for a long period of time right now typically right you invest in a startup it might take seven ten years for it to exit um and along the way you're getting these paper markups and so i guess like give us a sense of if you are if you do go the solo capitalist route and you i would say you're like the success case of going to solar capitalist route there's a lot of people who could try it may not have the same results as you but let's say things work out how do you think about um because i think a lot of people are trying to decide do i do this do i start a business do i take a job somewhere or do i work at a fan company do i what do i do and so what do you think's realistic expectations for if it works this is what it looks like over like a seven year period right the first five years you're just taking kind of your salary which might be 250 000 might be a little more a little less um and then like but you're hoping by year seven or ten you're able to get this this type of a personal personal win out of it which makes your average over the 10 years look really good i guess can you walk us through the numbers because i think for most people this is just a black box they don't really understand they don't really understand how the money would what the money could look like in this uh if things work out yeah i i'm hearing all sorts of variations to this model i mean i have friends who are running early stage startups and they've raised you know five to 20 million dollars and they're deploying capital while they're operating i think that's the best case scenario i mean if you're ready to start a startup and you have ceo potential and you know exactly what you want to build that is going to have a much higher um you know you're you're building a legacy there you have the ability to hire people like those people will even start startups like i just think there's so many great things when ceos are active angel investors that's why i chose to raise from a lot of founders and not traditional lps or you know traditional finance financial institutions um i think they have a lot more access and they have the ability to invest in startups opportunistically not as their full-time thing and while they still have really great access and mind share in the ecosystem you know for individuals like myself like you know i had 10-ish years of of tech company experience i don't even want to say startup experience because i was at a big company and then i was at a second more medium-sized tech company and those scenarios you know you your investors are looking for your ability you know have you already built a track record do you have an ability to invest in really great companies um and so that's one thing to consider i actually spent about two solid years of blogging tweeting you know really investing and building my personal brand so i could gear up to go and raise outside money so i think you have to build a really strong case if you want to raise from outs from outside investors um the one thing that i will say um you know angelus and carta have made this incredibly easy i think the forcing function and venture which has caused you know the ability for anyone to become a vc or to raise their own fund is these platforms which basically connect you with investors they make it really easy to manage like your back office and you know you don't have to deal with lawyers and all of that stuff right that's the habit you dodged my question on how much money you could make but that's okay maybe maybe you don't want to answer that no let's go into it i think this is fun i mean this is this is the the title of the podcast so i think i think we should go into it um i would say so every solo capitalist does it differently um some people are purely one person um they're pocketing all the management fees they're taking all the carry um i'm actually seeing today you know if you're raising a 5 to 10 to maybe even 25 million fund if you're doing something on angel list that's a true solo capitalist fund um you can actually take 2.5 to 3 management fees um what i did for mine is i did two percent management fees the way that i thought about it because and this is a rolling fund it could be a traditional fund or it could be a rolling fund so the rolling fund means that structurally you're able to um talk about your fund broadly you're able to market your fund which historically um you know you weren't able to market your fund when you're actively fundraising you know if someone has distribution if you have a podcast um you know if you're an active angel investor and you already have great deal flow or you're leaving a high growth startup and you have a great network rolling funds are great because you can market it and you can constantly be bringing in new lps it's not something where you go out you raise money you ask a bunch of people for money you know maybe a handful of people say yes you do a first close you go out and ask more people for money you do a second close like that historically has been a really time consuming process and as a solo capitalist how you spend your time is your strategy and so you don't want to spend the majority of your week meeting with investors and you're not meeting with startups and so it can be something that really impacts the business model and so i think that the rolling fund works well if you already have distribution if you don't have distribution and you you know want to experiment with raising outside money oftentimes the people that are doing this really well are individuals that have a valuable network i mean maybe they're leaving stripe or airbnb or one of these companies where they have a very entrepreneurial culture and the people you know that used to sit across me at work are likely likely to go leave and start a startup and they're going to be able to raise from top tier funds like that's one of the strategy as well where i've seen many of them go out and raise some outside money or you know there's a lot of the startups that have been really successful in the last generation their alumni actually have whatsapp groups and they've created their own syndicates where you can co-invest alongside the airbnb mafia or there's a stripe group or that's somewhere where i spend a lot of my time where i help a lot of the alumni groups build their first syndicate and that's been a ton of fun because you get to meet the whole company and you get to really you know understand who are some of the um power builders i guess i would call them um inside the company who are most likely to leave and start something so so what would you say the the potential earning then is for a solo uh capitalist to go back to sean's yeah it depends on your goals i mean i'm seeing solo capitalists that are going out maybe you start with a 10 to 25 million dollar fund one for how quickly um the fundraising climate is moving today you know in the next 12 months you could go out and raise you know 40 to 60 million dollar fund too um the interesting thing is like this isn't purely a new model i think what's changed is that the types of people that are starting funds do look very different from the last generation um like i look at um iden san cut at felicis you know he was a super angel and then started felice's ventures mike maples who's been on the show you know mike was a super angel and then he started floodgate i think what's different today is how fast you can make money because there are spvs and ways for individuals to invest in later stage companies like early stage is one thing but i think later stages where a lot of people are finding great returns in a short amount of time so you have your 25 million dollar fund as the operator what do you expect your your your pay to be it's a good question i mean as as you said earlier i mean a lot of people are holding for the long term and so i wouldn't bank on cary you know in the first you know seven to ten years but you do get a a reasonable salary because many solo capitalists are do taking 2.5 to 3 management fees so 2.5 2.5 percent of 25 is is what i don't even know i can't do math in my head so that's uh there's a great line on pomp's podcast you guys somebody asked them this question they're like wait if somebody has 100 000 bitcoin and bitcoin goes to 750 000. how much is that worth he just goes i don't do public math think of what they're like what did you just say he goes i don't do public math you don't do math in public he's like yeah i don't do public math and i just was like that's actually a great policy i don't do public math so 2.5 of 25 is so you have you have 625 000 a year in salary off a 25 million dollar fund and then the carry a fee sorry and then if that and if you're solo so yeah that's a great living and then what what what would you estimate you could do with your fun three exit four exit do you have like a target uh right now it's north of five x damn all right so five x so that's a hundred uh four what i can't i don't know 125 million 125 million you pay back the 25 first so now there's 100 million a profit of the 120 100 million a profit you keep 20 that's 20 million so you might make 20 million at the sort of in the termination of the fun basically after 10 years that sounds amazing right it's amazing it's amazing i also find i mean when once you get into this world um typically you'll see that's that's the core fund and the core fund is like your v1 like that's the first thing you do to build a track record and to like get in the game where people start to make a lot of money and make a lot of money in the short term is what i mentioned doing spvs or even buying secondary one of the things that i've been doing a lot over the last year year and a half is one of the things that holds people back from starting a startup is the fact that they're illiquid and sitting on a lot of equity at their last startup and so there are a lot of vcs that are exploring like what would it mean to buy shares from you know employees to then put them in business and so that's another way to think about it as well i think there's different playbooks that you can layer on top of each other once the fund is in a good place then you can get more creative with spvs or you can get more creative with even buying employee shares and companies that still have a lot of upside um you know and so i think that becomes pretty creative as well let's switch gears to ideas so what spaces what ideas uh do you have that you think people should be building in or you you see interesting stuff so give me a sense of like it can either be a specific idea or it could be kind of like a trend you're noticing what do you got yeah it's interesting i tend to look at what are the smartest people that i know thinking about or working on i consistently see um a lot of people are moving into crypto and into climate change i think these are two areas that you can't really ignore um and i'm also seeing people leave very well-paying jobs that have a lot of equity to work on things like climate change and so i do think that there are trends that are starting to bubble up that have maybe been either underserved by venture underfunded rather and so it does seem like there's a lot of things that are happening especially during covet i feel like during the pandemic people started re-examining what matters like you take away the fancy office you take away all the perks you take away the ability to you know physically see your team and so i'm i'm seeing a lot of people that are leaving to work on things that they actually care about which is really interesting not to say that they won't make a lot of money but to say that there are new opportunities and new types of companies that people truly want to build and so that's been something that i've been thinking about so what um what's an example of some yeah i was going to ask about climate change and climate tech that's interesting give us a cool idea in climate change that you've seen or you have yeah i mean today it feels like it's very early days i'm seeing a lot of companies that are thinking about carbon offset or they're coming up with ways for corporations to be think more think in more sustainable ways i will say i mean a lot of the stuff that's directly related to climate change i probably don't see because i do a lot of workplace and future of work stuff i think a lot i think we're going to see more specialized firms that are focused on climate change or that are focused on frontier tech the cool thing about being a solo capitalist and having more of a perspective on like this is my area of expertise and this is where i can add value means that when i get together for dinners with other new solo capitalists or new funds they're specialized in their own way and so i do like spending time with experts on climate change and frontier tech like there's so much happening in space right now do i have the you know the experience or the network to really dig in not at this time but i love hanging out with people that are working on space tech and what uh in in the work life portfolio so future of work what's um what's an idea that that our company you're excited about that's not already like well known it hasn't hasn't had that breakout moment where raises a huge round so people in tech find out or everybody's already using it like slack or something like that so what what's an example of a company that you think is super cool give us one from your portfolio yeah absolutely one thing that's not obvious about the work life portfolio is i do spend a lot of time in education and reskilling i think this is a really important thing where even from your earliest days like kids are brought up being asked by their parents like what do you want to be when you grow up and i think this is sort of a question that historically you know kids have been taught to do very normal jobs like well you should be a teacher you should be a doctor you should do like these very traditional things there was an interesting um study that i read when i was just thinking about work life building out the first version of the pitch deck where kids today are you know kids would rather be youtubers than they would be astronauts like maybe that change that changes today because we're now going to space and so space is very cool again but what's interesting there is there isn't really education that aligns to that you know i think the textbook education is you memorize something you take the task and you forget about it like my recall from elementary school middle school high school is zero like i studied for a test as soon as the test was done i didn't think about that topic again but i am seeing new platforms and new styles of learning that kids are being taught based on the things they're interested in i invested in a company called primer which is essentially online education i think we're thinking about like do we call it homeschooling i think homeschooling tends to have a fairly negative or you know neutral connotation depending on who you are but the concept is can you know eight to ten kids get together and can they learn video game design can they learn about you know certain types of writing can they build their own websites like what are these tangible skills that are aligned to the hobbies and interests of kids that they develop at a very young age and can they build their own network or community of other like-minded kids so they actually care about school when i bring so i've been thinking about this whole school thing both sean and i have invested in a little bit of it sean teaches a course i've taught of course before i've been thinking about school for a little while and i've actually completely changed my opinion it was one thing now it's the total opposite the whole like i think that the the everyone talks about education is broken it's broken this and that i think only part of it is the for the top 30 universities i think are doing just wonderful stuff and here's why sean if well you're different i didn't go to a fancy school brie if you could have graduated if you had to graduate with a quarter of a million dollars in debt but you could have gone to harvard would you i actually think i would to be honest i think it's worth it i completely agree it's 100 worth it it's 100 worth it if you could get into a top 20 university and you have to get go into a ton of debt it is 100 worth it and that if that's the case it ain't broken i think it's doing great if someone's willing to like go into a crippling amount of debt and go ahead why why okay okay great why do you think it's worth it because you learned so much from those great harvard classes no right that's not the reason why you don't learn the school is not about learning cool so you get the stamp that says i went to harvard yeah so now every time a guy like sam or me looks at you oh harvard okay yeah you perk up a little bit um and then the second thing is you get the network right so you're gonna bump into you know the next winklevoss and zuckerberg and whoever else uh that's on on your campus at that moment right those are the two reasons the stamp and the network yes the problem is that there's schools like belmont university where i went that costs fifty thousand dollars a year and then they're like [ __ ] belmont i mean who's this no one knows what belmont is they provide zero value um like there's no point if you go to belmont you should quit right now and basically the only way that we should solve education i think is by letting those businesses just go out of business and die and then keeping in the top 20s the top 20-ish i agree with that i mean the liberal arts schools are hurting a lot i think the 40 50 60 000 a year school i mean i grew up in ohio and there's no shortage of like liberal arts colleges that have a beautiful campus but you know is it the type of school that someone's going to pull your resume and put it at the top of the pile or in the era of today we have ai that's scanning resumes and they're scanning specifically for harvard stanford mit like those are the people that have the one up and so i do agree with that yeah that's nice well i think i think but you're saying you know you you change your opinion did you think that before that harvard was a waste of money did you really think that yeah i was like good while hunting like you know like yeah like you're going to go you know for like eight dollars of late fees you know yadda yeah i mean you want that romantic crap to to be true but it's not my wife went to an ivy league school i was such a redneck when she said she went to penn i was like oh is that where that football rapist coach went that sucks uh and then she was like no it's part of the ivy league i'm like i really don't know what that means i think i've heard about that in like a harry potter book but um and like then i met her friends and i was like well this is totally worth it 100 worth it whatever i actually i have a bit of fomo i i very rarely have fomo but going back to my crazy psychotic calendar um the virtual dinner on wednesdays is with friends that are vcs that all went to stanford gsb together and so i'm the only non-gs beer on this virtual dinner we used to meet and have dinner in person we weren't always internet friends but what's interesting there is once you start having dinner and getting to know them you're like [ __ ] i could have been like hanging out with you for two years all the time like grabbing lunch hanging out white boarding coming up with startup ideas like the whole concept to me makes a ton of sense because once you start start spending time with friends that do have an ivy league education you just feel a little bit jealous because they got to hang out a lot more when i was at college so i went to duke which is kind of like more like more like what you're talking about sam and uh i remember after my halfway through my freshman year or something i called my dad and i was like hey you know before i came here we had been thinking like should i go to a state school i could go to university of texas or should i go to duke and like you know i'm not doing so great here like i kind of like you know i'm like a minus student type of thing and i was like i'm at first i wasn't trying now i'm trying but i'm still a b minus student even after trying because like the kids here are just like everyone here is like the smartest kid from their high school so like they're all smarter than me and then they all already work harder than me i'm just learning to work hard um and so i told him i was like you know i feel like if i stay here i'm just gonna kind of be like in the middle of the pack and i started telling i was like he's like well why do you um like you know i i think you're being hard on yourself and i was like no no like my friend tophek is like super genius and like during the summers you know i go home and play nba 2k and he goes and drives like a you know an ambulance on the war front in palestine like helps people and like my other friend over here he's doing this other thing and so i was trying to say that as like you know i'm not i'm one of them i think you're wasting a lot of money sending me here like this i'm not gonna be a winner here i'm gonna be like average or below average as far as the rest of the kids here and he goes you're not there for grades you're there because tawfiq is your friend next to you and that guy's your friend next to you and that guy's your friend over there you being friends with these people you're not even going to realize it but your whole what you think is normal is actually going to be excellent because it's just going to seem totally excellent will seem average to you just by spending four years with these people so don't stress yourself out about the grades don't don't worry about all that you're doing the right thing just by being by being like five feet away from all these other people and i was like man that was like you know that's like dad hits you with some wisdom and i didn't even really realize it at the time i was just like okay i guess i'm staying here uh but now when i look back i'm like wow that was actually like kind of a stroke of genius uh and on his part and and so to bring it all back whenever i hear people talk about like the future of education education is broken i'm like maybe like it's broken in the sense of like i think people shouldn't pay for this stuff unless it is of this caliber but also um i think that a lot of people approaching this this this market they think like well i just need to make like a better mousetrap or like i need to um just like make it so you can learn more important stuff and i'm like i don't think that's actually the right way to go about this the mistake is uh oh man the classic we're still teaching you know these classes and they're teaching it from textbooks how boring i'm gonna teach it i'm gonna teach better subjects in a better way and the problem is that people don't choose to go to college for the classes they don't choose to go to college for the information they go because they want the stamp and they want the social experience and then they want you know the parents need that as an insurance policy and uh you know so college does many things and then they solve only the information problem but they don't have a credential they don't have the social experience they don't have it the other five reasons that people actually go to these places that that ends up being a big problem bree what i'm looking at your portfolio right now of all these what do you think is going to be the biggest hit right now hoppin's the most obvious um this is a really special company um you know when they initially raised their first round of funding i believe they had around four employees um i caught up with johnny last week and they're at 800 820 so i invested a little over a year ago they're now valued at 5.65 b um and so they're really building a a really disruptive platform i say platform because initially they started out as a way for companies and festivals and publications to host conferences online they've since then moved into streaming they're moving into all forms of virtual collaboration and even hybrid collaboration where hoppin is being used at in-person events as well and so i feel like this is a company that has uncapped upside they're making a lot of acquisitions um you know they have only been around for two years um you know johnny was initially based in london he built hoppin because he had an illness where he had a compromised immune system he couldn't go to networking events he was you know in his early-ish mid-20s um and so he built the technology because he needed it and so like the team itself is in it for the right reasons and moving really quickly and so that's one that i'm super excited about um you know but there are a couple of other ones where they're stealth they don't have a website yet they're building quietly behind the scenes and i'm very excited for those companies to come out as well but you can't talk about those right now i can't talk about those ones what are they doing what are they doing two two themes that i'm really excited about the first one is disrupting venture capital and that's controversial because i myself am a venture capitalist but a number of startups that i've invested in are non-dilutive ways for people to raise money like i think venture has a very they look for very specific things typically it's more it's more um software focused business models you know typically it's founders that are in an ecosystem where there are a lot of vcs i think that's changing but it's going to take some time for that to change what's interesting to see is i was the first money an investor in a company called pipe um pipe is non-dilutive capital for software companies or now any companies with recurring revenue that wouldn't that that one's going to make you a bundle how do you end up as the first money in pipe how does that happen yeah i i'm excited to tell you this story because it's it's it's atypical um what happened was i was in la for my birthday um so my birthday is september 12th i heard about pipe on september 10th something like that um i was at drinks with friends they're like you got to meet this guy harry hurst he's very charismatic he's building something in sass like you got to meet this guy and so i had called a few investors i was emailing people i'm like hey you know how do i get an intro to harry wasn't happening wasn't happening and then finally on my birthday um i tracked down his phone number i text him i'm like hey here's like here's who i am here's what i do i'm in la and it's my birthday can i come to your office and so he um you know we ended up meeting in the middle he's like okay uh you don't have to come to our office we can go to soho house and so we we caught up on my birthday i was super excited about what he's building um i committed on the spot i you know started the process to wire the money from the parking lot like i'm sitting there on my birthday late to my own birthday laptop out doing all the things to get ready to wire money for this company because i knew if i waited it wasn't gonna happen um you know founders are meeting so many angel investors and so many vcs through the process where sometimes i'll talk to founders and like yeah room are so excited to work with you two days later they're like oh i completely forgot because it's been a whirlwind and so i wanted to make sure that that email was sent that we started the process and that i was going to keep bothering harry like frankly we didn't have a relationship so i was bugging the [ __ ] out of him so i could invest in the company but okay so let's take it even a step further this even though i've i lived in silicon valley in san francisco for eight years and i felt like i was you and i probably shared so many friends technically i guess i was kind of part of it but not really but it all like this guy harry how did he even create this much hype for you to chase him down like that there were a couple things so harry um it's a disruptive model i will say that you know we've seen um new ways for founders to raise money but oftentimes there's misalignment because you'll have ways for founders to raise money but it's on unfavorable terms less sophisticated investors and so for harry he the initial concept was enough where where investors are like oh we need to catch up with them and like learn what's going on here it sounds like you were the first money in but people were telling you you got to meet with this guy who are those people why were they even saying that if they weren't already investors in the company what was he you know who who are these people that were giving you this great tip that you were like okay i gotta i gotta meet this guy and if if they hadn't already invested because that makes sense when somebody's invested they say hey i just invested in this thing it's great for you should check it out um but that wasn't the case here that wasn't the case there were a lot of people that were trying to meet pipe um you know i think a lot of ways when you're fundraising for a company i always encourage founders like many of them get discouraged in the beginning they're like no one cares like no one cares until everyone cares and that's how it always works like the last 12 hours of fundraising is always a mess because once people once someone hears that someone else is investing or someone else is interested it just all snowballs into like a huge amount of texts and phone calls and emails and so in harry's case um he's he's a brilliant fundraiser i mean if you look at the cap table he's raised from the ceo or you know one of the co-founders of every major sas company and so i give him a lot of credit for that from the earliest days um you know he had a conversation with david sacks so you know david had started yammer and and david was very interested in it for the same reason that i was interested for me as a first money and investor pipe is a great resource where when a company hits a certain inflection point and they're thinking about raising more money it's great for me it's great for the founders it's great for anyone that's been involved from the very beginning to introduce options of non-dilutive financing um it's more upside for us it's better for employees like all the way around i'm like i want to spend time with this company and ultimately get work-life companies to use it when it makes sense and so that was part of it as well so then it was basically so did did he know david um i believe harry met um someone on david's team that's la based i just like a cold email or something something like that so that that's kind of interesting so like i mean it's just like it's a huge game of telephone and it's fascinating this is just a fascinating thing what what is pipe valued at two or three billion dollars north of two now yeah okay so they don't have that much revenue like everyone it's it's just crazy that you could say that they're probably gonna grow into that and become way bigger but they created all this off of like a really good story and very strategically getting in the right years and i think that's incredibly fascinating and really really cool it also just speaks to the amount of capital that's available in the ecosystem right now i think oftentimes these valuations are getting out of hand because there's so much demand from the last round or there is so much money where investors would rather pay a high pay a premium to have exposure to the company and to share in some of that upside than waiting until you know a traditional milestone or metric or moment in time where historically they would have fundraised like to give you context and i don't say this uh as someone who wants to brag by any means but when i invested in pipe it was at like a nine post and now they're worth north of two billion and so that's not saying like well you're a world class investor like you've changed this company but it's to say that when you have a big vision you have a good team that's building it when you have a founder that's exceptional at fundraising like investors will come to you and they'll come to you even before you know the next financing round because they want to get in so how much you gonna make off that one i'm holding it's hard to say i'm i'm holding just what's your stake worth uh i don't know if i'm allowed to say that am i allowed i'm not sure what the rules are i don't know if i'm allowed to say that what size but i invested i believe i invested um 150 k and then i'm continuing to follow on well so like there's a lot of math here that involves dilution but you just told us the you just told us the you know the variables that we could do the math but we don't do public math if you recall so we don't do publicly we could tell you the number but we don't do public math and we should you could do like uh all this evaluation might be like well if it's worth 2 billion and you invested at 10 10 million dollars i mean like and 125 grand like you know you could do the math it's it's a whole lot i just don't know you know don't don't do it it has on so on paper it has returned the fund and so i ha i have returned the fund in the the first year and a half um which is an interesting point i i think a lot of investors are very quick to scale the fund size like they want to go out and raise 100 million dollar fund for fund one to raise a little bit north of 10 million and to return it in the first year and a half like that's a pretty safe bet um and one where i didn't overextend myself in a way where it could impact my reputation that's something that i do encourage people i'm like start with where you are today um and find ways to keep building concentration over time do spvs buy secondary like do whatever it takes to like hit that annual number that you need to make to be happy don't necessarily overextend yourself and go out and try to raise 100 million fund i wouldn't have been able to raise 100 million fund but i i have been able to return it on paper very quickly right well congratulations and so uh we should wrap it up a little bit over time and we saw her calendar so we know we're we're eating into like a peloton class or like a pitch meeting or or email processing maybe we don't know exactly which one but texting triage all right so we won't we won't keep you any longer all right so so brian campbell where should people find you and they should go uh let's is the podcast live yet can they go subscribe uh on the field yeah subscribe to

what is it called just go to youtube and type in my first mill and you'll see it right now it's called the hustle but they'll see it and then hit the subscribe button all right i have a ton of stuff to cover thanks for wearing a shirt by the way dude you get all hot and bothered when i just don't have sleeves man this this is a shirt well i guess so we don't all we don't all dress like you know bouncers at a miami strip club so [Laughter] i do look like that i look like yeah like a little special ed today uh do you wanna um what do you got going on i have a lot of interesting stuff all right let's start let's do it um all right did you see everything that i put on here uh well it changed you had a whole bunch of stuff about greeting cards and now it's something else buying lottery tickets all right go for it okay i got a lot of stuff i got lottery tickets i got mug shots i got um uh oh the athletic stuff i actually let's do let's do lottery tickets first and then i want to do athletic stuff because you actually talked about that so i just talked to this guy i don't think i'm gonna do anything with it i don't know yet but i just talked to this guy and i thought it was really amazing now this company that i'm going to tell you about it has to deal with the powerball and lotteries which i actually think that my uh stance on it is i'm personally not in favor of it i i i'm not i'm not on board but i thought it was fascinating so there's these companies that are there's two of them in the space so basically the way it works is there's two major lotteries there's the powerball and mega millions and then each state has a state-run lottery okay and the way it works is you go to the 7-eleven you go wherever and you buy a ticket so there's this company that i just started talking to they're called spins um and what they do is sorry slips spins slips so you know have you heard of this or you see did i write it down i talked to them a bunch of months ago and i talked about them on the pottery but yeah but i did talk about it but we could do it again that's okay i don't remember you telling me about them that's okay most people probably don't um but how did you hear about slips i thought they just launched like a month like this month it's been on test flight for a long time so i used it on test flight it's that's what you do it's clever dude i feel the wind was blowing out of my sails just now i'm sorry okay i'll give you a minute to recover no i want you i want you to explain now because you're good at it i'll try to remember so basically um a lot of people play the lottery you typically go to a 7-eleven or a gas station or something you buy it what these guys did was they let you play the lottery from your phone legally how do they do that well basically wherever you are you'll say i'd like to buy a lottery ticket and then they will physically go send somebody to a gas station they'll buy the lottery ticket uh so sort of like there's a task rabbit essentially that'll go buy the lottery ticket in person for you because you can't actually buy them online they'll buy it they'll take a photo of it they'll sort of custody it online and and give it to you and um and so that's how they kind of bypass the rules around buying lottery like running an online lottery you can't run an online lottery but you can pay somebody to go buy the ticket and then they can give you the ticket um and that's like their two-step process did i think that's brilliant you got it brilliant or you got it right and i think that's brilliant i think it's brilliant because i never would have thought about that and it's the easiest possible solution and by the way i think they simplified it even further where they just paid the guy at the gas station to be the taskrabbit so now they don't even dispatch somebody they're just like hey when this thing rings that's that's somebody paying you to buy a lottery ticket uh and you pay like a little premium on top of what the lottery ticket is and that's the kind of like service surcharge which might be like 25 cents or a dollar or something it's not like percentage-wise is pretty significant but it's not a huge amount of money so people don't care it's like ah it's more convenient because they can i can get a push notification it says the lottery is 200 million dollars today would you like a ticket and you just say kind of like yes and that's that's low friction uh i was saying they have subscription they have a bunch of stuff but when i was talking to this guy i was thinking there's a few i was thinking of the pros and cons so pros of this business it's gonna get big fast [Laughter] yeah i can see it getting big fast that's the only pro that's a big pro in the world of business that's that's the main pro that's the main pro there are so many things about why it won't work are you like why it won't work are you saying basically like ethically i have a problem with this or well no that's just one of the many things so like i wouldn't say ethically i have a problem but i would have to ask myself how i feel about that like i would have to think about it so in one regard it's like i don't buy the lottery and i don't want like if you don't have a lot of money i don't think you should buy the lottery that said who am i to tell you what to buy and also if you want to spend i go to the casino and i like to spend 50 and that's fun so like who am i to say what's like who am i to judge but the second thing i would imagine a app like this would have very similar economics uh not similar economics but similar growth tactics as like a mobile game which means you have to be super aggressive about uh customer acquisition and if facebook google or that pretty much that's it if they ban you you're [ __ ] yes that's that's a legit problem for this and that might be the the big the two biggest what's that also i think had some social feature that was like if you and your friend you and your friends can kind of like share it you could split tickets or something like that like did they they brought all the offline things where like you know an office pulls together and buys 100 tickets and then they agree to split the money i think they brought that into it so it's a nice app i liked the idea i liked the idea a lot um but i just you know whatever there's a whole bunch of reasons why i decided not to invest but i just thought it was uh i think it's a clever idea and i've been looking at this for years so to your question of how do i find this is because for years i've been thinking about how how would you bring the lottery online and i've talked to many people who claimed they could do it legally and it wasn't actually legal or it was only legal in one state to do it that way and they were hoping all the other states caught on and so i've just been keeping an eye out for rule changes and that's kind of a theme like we talked about the name and the nil thing for the for college athletes name image and likeness rule change equals opportunity i have another rule change i'm going to do today um that's another opportunity but this is this is an example of one of those types of businesses you want to talk about that and i and i nil stuff yeah what do you got for it and the reason so you brought this up and i had known about it but i just saw this other article did you see this article that went viral about this alabama kid hasn't even like thrown a plate said he had a million bucks in revenue booked for the year or something crazy like that well the funny thing is the coach nick saban came out and he's the one who kind of said it so he's like oh yeah you know which creates a weird situation like our freshman quarterback uh he's made seven figures you know he's making all this money his teammates aren't making that money it creates an awkward dynamic um but so some people there's really three reactions to this one is like okay maybe there's some truth to that the second is oh is this like for years there's been all kinds of people who make millions of dollars like nick saban does nick saban makes tens of millions of dollars at the coach and all the players played for free and it's like dude you're trying to keep the players down now that they're making a buck you got a problem with it and then there's the third one which is the super mega evil version of this which was he added this line at the end where he goes he's like he's making all this money and that's because of our brand that's because he's a quarterback at alabama which is true it became a recruiting pitch at the same time so he was fake being outraged but really was what they call dog whistling dog whistling to all the other you know high school athletes right now and you come to alabama that check is pretty big uh this guy hasn't even played yet and he's getting this type of money imagine what you'll get when you come if you come here and so all the other college coaches the players were mad at him the coaches were mad at him and the media was mad at him i loved it it was a master a master stroke what i actually did was we contacted i i went and contacted some folks in the compliance industry at schools and they made a comment that said they're explicitly banned from finding or facilitating any type of deals for athletes the school is yes yeah so like nick saban can't like you know they can't be the middle man at all but um what they're able to do is act and so the reason i'm bringing this up is you had this idea where it i mean i guess it's a fairly obvious thing but you said it well uh of like you have to have this software or some type of compliance software in order to manage these relationships and manage those deals these deals and i have an example as to why that's kind of important but so the school can't it can't be the middleman but they have to be in the loop about what you're doing the school will definitely pay which is why i was saying you should build a tool like this with transparency visibility reporting payments infrastructure because the schools will have to pay and once they pay they're locked in because you're going to be the system of record of how the athletes are making money and i want to give an example let me give you an example of a very very very specific example about why this is going to get really complicated so do you know american top team i bet you do it's that it's a corset yeah so it's a a mixed martial art gym in florida they offered 500 a month to miami's entire 90 scholarship football players to advertise their gyms on social media so that's 540 000 but every player has to do it now there's like these crazy there's these crazy rules and so here's an example um an example of the gym deal for many players we mentioned the contract states that they must advertise for the gym over social media but if they lose track and not and all 90 athletes do not post technically that's a pay for play and not an n a n i l deal and it's a major nc nc double a minor so it doesn't matter if you understand that what matters is that it's incredibly complicated and that this is going to get like really complicated i wonder if somebody can also just build the other side just build the uh build the irs so it's like build the little police the independent police task force that's going to be monitoring all this stuff and finding potential violations and then selling this service back to the schools which is like hey we found some athletes that are out of code here that this is actually against the thing we will sell you this type of visibility so that you guys don't fall out of compliance that's another way to do it is you uh you diagnose the problem and then you sell them the prescription that line is going to lead me into my next point that's a totally different topic but when we talked about that uh when we talked about this ncaa thing did a lot of companies reach out to you yeah there was a bun no they didn't reach out they go bro we're already doing this we've been doing this that's what i mean that's what i mean yeah good good good for you great i i agree it's a good opportunity i don't know why you gotta get all defensive about it any any anything interesting uh you know i didn't really look into them because i didn't have time but i think like open doors was one of the ones that a bunch of people mentioned i don't know if that's like the number one uh i i kind of think that it's not really going to be some player that's been around for a while i think it's going to be somebody i i view it as in these markets it's whoever builds this first simple useful thing will get a ton of adoption and then it's then it's a race between the people who tried to build the big valuable thing and the group that got a bunch of adoption to go from small and simple to more thorough and whoever where do those lines cross which which group gets there first and i like to bet on the horse where the founders identify identified hey this is a simple thing that we can get in the hands of every athlete right now or every school right now and we can even give it away for free as long as we get them hooked into our our system we have a relationship with them i think those are going to be the interesting one so i'm kind of looking for who's new um but i'm open-minded about it i haven't i haven't seen anybody make it make a very compelling case that they've got something good going but i do have an idea around this if you're ready for it so are you familiar with how um sports agents make their money like if i'm a agent for an nba basketball player do you know roughly like how that money shakes out no so so basically um if i'm an agent for an nba player i'm gonna take let's call it two to three percent on average um and i'm not an expert of this that may be more nuanced to it but this is what i have a couple friends who do this and this is what they told me so um they make about two to three percent of the contract value so let's say in the nba like a max guy might make 40 million a year so let's say you have two guys you got a max player and you have his buddy on the team who's kind of a bit of a mid-level player and you have 50 million 50 million a year from the team you're gonna make two percent so you're gonna make a million dollars a year as an agent so you can stack some pretty good money now it is a absolutely cutthroat and ruthless business where they're all trying to backstab each other and steal each other's clients um and it is like a slightly dirty industry where there's a lot of sort of like bribery wine you know some on the good end whining and dining and on the bad end sort of like bribery and [ __ ] talking that goes on in order for agents to get clients but i have a few uh ben was telling me about a few friends of his that have an agency as three people and their athletes under contract will bring in about three million total a year and so basically the main guy the main agent is probably banking 2.6 million 2.5 million himself and then the other 500k goes into like operations and paying the other two people they're kind of like salary so how much is the total the contract value will be i think he takes three percent so the contract value was something like 75 million uh just for rough numbers for the year there's like four players right and so and it's like yeah it's really hard to get your foot in the door but when you have this guy like typically the players will stick with you unless they have a problem with you you mess up and so you get their like 10 to 15 year career sometimes and then as long as that player has a name you can use them and their introductions to get like a couple other guys on the team that they're buddies with that they trust when they're looking for agents and then they keep going down market so they keep trying to get guys like right before the draft or you know in college they're you know showing up on campus and just talking to the guy trying to not create an ncaa violation but build those relationships so what i was thinking was so that's the gener general business i don't think it's a great business to be in but uh you know whatever it's kind of there's a few people that win big and then most people get nothing the opportunity i saw was well with this name image likeness i think this is going to breed a whole new set of college hustlers that become sports agents why is that because i'm a player at a school if i'm just some kid in the same dorm like i remember when i was on duke campus i bumped into you know gerald henderson on the first day of orientation and um and he actually kind of a funny story he was like we kind of were hitting it off which is great because normally these guys you know everyone's mobbing them they don't care about you they're looking for like the hottest girl around they don't really care about this brown indian dude what why am i talking to him but we hit it off we're joking around and he goes oh man like what are you doing tonight i was like oh i think we're going to west campus i didn't even know what that was at the time was my first day on campus but i just said something i thought sounded cool he's like he's like oh i'm sick like hit me up when you go like here take my number and um i had finished high school in china and so i actually didn't even have a cell phone the first day of college i was like getting my plans set up and so i was like oh you know i don't have a phone but he he just looked at me like oh bro you don't have a phone and he just like walked away that was the last i talked to him but the opportunity is dude you could have been friends with an nba player i know i know i blew it i blew it many many times after that too with other players um but basically let's say i'm friends with that guy i could just go hustle i could go to the local car dealership and i could be like hey how much would you pay gerald to be on this billboard right he's a big name in this college town so you'll give him 1500 bucks and i could go to gerald and say hey dude i got you a 1500 deal all you got to do is like say yes and take this photo and then he would be like oh sick man and if i did that three more times i'm pretty sure i could be this guy's like business manager within like two months of being in college and if you just plant those seeds at that stage because you're on campus you're one of them you could work the scene locally i'm pretty sure that that's one way to like hit your wagon to someone who's a future nba player and actually become an agent so i think you're gonna find some super agents that come out of this like this one rule change there's some kid who's the next ari gold that's sitting on kentucky's campus or alabama's campus that's going to end up being like worth 50 100 million dollars and they're gonna get their start by selling name image like this like local deals to for the local players yeah i mean that's what a lot of people have done with music you know scooter braun started that way um what was his origin story so i i know who we have okay so if you don't know who scooter braun is he um owned this company called ithaca holdings which i think just sold to uh a korean music label for three or four billion dollars scooter bronze most famous for yeah ethical holding just sold is he like a billionaire uh yeah probably wow to tell you ability you didn't even know about how do you feel bro there i just want to do it there you go i feel great i love it how much did it sell for all right so he sold it to hybe which is the korean entertainment conglomerate that owns i think they they have the rights to bts which is like the biggest yeah yeah in the world or something um let's see what's the sale price i'll look it up you keep talking um anyway so he sold this company he was most famous for being justin bieber's manager but he also managed uh ariana grande and a few other people he's only 35 36 37 very young you'll see him in some of the music videos he was also famous because he bought big machine records based out of nashville which owned taylor swift's rights and he bought that for only like 80 million dollars even though it made 40 million a year something crazy like that and he got a start out of emory university i believe and when he was a sophomore somehow he started throwing parties and in doing so uh met jermaine dupri's mom who owned a record label in atlanta where emery is mrs dupree it's is that you well mrs dupree is like the head honcho of a of a meaningful like production and music and he starts working for him and he and and the dupries and he's like doing this music thing and he's like bringing people all the he's bringing all the kids to college parties as a club promoter and making a cut to like a german degree party then eventually when he's 22 he has a little bit of money save but not a lot like less than a hundred grand he finds this guy on youtube who is a little kid he's like seven eight nine ten years old and he's playing the guitar and he's playing a guitar and he's singing and scooter goes this kid's gonna be a home run he's gonna be a winner so he flies his kid and his mom down to uh atlanta and he goes i want to manage you and the kid's like i don't what do you mean management i don't have a career he goes you're gonna be a superstar one day and that was justin bieber and he uh so he discovered the biebs and he made tens of millions of dollars off that and then recently made a billion plus from selling his company what did he sell it for one one billion so it was 1.05 billion so so just two quick numbers so they sold for 1.05 billion and he had acquired that big machine like label thing with taylor swift's rights for 300 million back oh okay so my numbers are off um rich whatever um and so and let's just go through some more numbers braun now holds a one percent stake in hybe which is worth 123 million itself the bts members each have 18 million in so there's seven of them um and then bieber and ariana grande have 14.3 million dollars worth of worth of a stake in hybe uh high went public at 1.5 billion and it's doubled in the last few months i would have bought this if i knew that the company behind bts had gone public uh but i was not i was not awake at the wheel here so kind of interesting i don't even know how we got on it but but he got started in in college promoting bieber and he also you know who his second act was uh asher roth the guy who and he and at the time he was like this asher roth guy is going to be with the biggest he's going to be the biggest yeah yeah but ashley roth came to him after doing i love college and he's like you know i kind of like don't really want to be famous like i don't want to like be in the limelight i just want to be quiet and so he bailed on him respect so okay we should do we should do more on scooter and i've been also there's a billionaire behind bts this guy like he's amazing what his name is i'm gonna do a deep dive on this guy uh banksy hook uh so we'll we'll we'll go on to this guy let me tell you another story are you gonna reference one thing by the way just one regret i have is that i did not hustle in college i i had like very small small like tiny schemes like i was a schemer i've always been a skeemer but i was such a goldfish guppy schemer back then i was trying to like find a way to win the monopoly game at mcdonald's and i was trying to like you know get into the easiest classes i was thinking small and with my buddies and we started like a sushi restaurant thing but like had i now that i think about it college this four-year playground with a whole bunch of potential co-founders all around you with a whole bunch of potential customers all around you with nothing but free time and nothing but energy and no mortgage no nothing it's all paid for it's a giant summer camp damn that's that was the time to take some shots take some experiments so if you're listening to this or you know something so send them this clip it's also the time to get drunk hook up with girls hook up with dudes try on different hats and explore yourself you don't have to have the pressure to like make money i'm not saying become successful i'm saying take some shots hustle a little bit and that doesn't mean don't party that means um the way i prioritize things was was just dumb which was like i don't know sleep number one class number two friends number three you know it's like i thought i thought college was about the classes and college is obviously not almost almost not about the classes in any any shape or form but it but the illusion is that it's about classes in a little bit i want to talk about the fat fire thing that i mentioned the other day and you kind of said something to me but right now or do you wanna talk about that now you wanna talk about some mug shot [ __ ] i got one other little quick quick college hustle uh idea there's another rule change to be aware of this rule change came from angellist angelus made it where it's now very easy for anybody who does any professional investors anybody like me or you who invests millions of dollars a year into startups we can now make it's very trivially easy to create a scout program to have anybody become a scout for our program which all that means is you bring a great deal to me if i invest you get a piece of the upside so you get to free free roll into investments and you get to network with real investors and you get to be basically hunting startups for fun i was doing this but back back when i was i think i've talked about before the first angel investment i ever did i did as a scout i found a deal i diligenced it i thought it was a great deal i pitched that deal to somebody who had money and they were like great i'll give you a piece of the upside and um and there was no like you know i was like we have to figure out our own paperwork for that well you know it wasn't like a easy one-click button like angeles has now made it well they've had this i've used this for my thing on the back end but splitting deal by deal carry wasn't easy for funds or rolling funds before i think for sbvs it might have been but now it's easy for everybody so i so if you're interested in investing the game has changed here's what i would do my quick 30 seconds of what i would do if i was somebody who didn't have the money to invest in startups but i love the idea of startup investing i would contact my four favorite investors maybe it's you know me and three other people great me me and me so your four favorite investors the top four investors shawn and sean i got four email addresses so here's what you do you send an email and you say you don't say hey can i work for you you say hey every week uh hey i love startups i am a junkie i'm always looking for for interesting startups that are on the come up uh you know i'm a developer so i know about that or i'm into music so i'm watching the music scene or whatever right you figure out what your what your angle is and then you just say i'm gonna send you three interesting startups a week you don't you don't have to reply but if anything catches your eye or you think it's either really stupid or really awesome i love a one line reply and you just start sending that for three weeks straight and if i don't reply after three weeks you ditch me and you figure out somebody else but if you do this you'll walk you'll do two things it'll be fun because it's fun to just check out startups and play that game a fantasy investor but b you'll actually walk away within a year you'll have a portfolio of startups that you have equity in that you sourced that due diligence and that you pitched and that that's like a great way to break into this industry so i think angel's just made it way easier to break in i just wanted to put that out as a psa for people yeah and just go ahead drop your email yeah sean seanpuri.com um all right so a minute ago you said something that was actually really brilliant and it was about the ncaa stuff and what you would do is you would find the violations and go to ncaa and or go to uh like you know university alabama and be like hey this your quarterback is actually breaking the rules here the the fines are x y and z uh a buy our software for why uh way easier sell than buy our software it's hey you have a problem here it is if you if you don't wanna have this problem in the future we obviously we do it look i did it for you already so there's this remember earlier a month ago i mentioned the business of mugshots correct that's right you told me about mugshots.com i think it was yeah and so i went and did a bunch of research on these businesses there's a whole ecosystem of this so i'm going to name a bunch of them so um it's let's see where are they okay so um mugshots.com gets at least 600 000 visitors a month bustedmugshots.com 666 000 visitors a month five find mugshots.com seventy two thousand visitors listed mug chats that's just ugly people ugly mudshots is that what that is i don't know the same thing i think it's the same it busted like in jail not like your face is busted arrest.org 4.35 million truthfinder.com 9.1 million and then be ver been verified 23 million visits and so these are all centered around mugshots and criminal records now you want to hear how these guys make money so what they do is and and here's a a story so there's this guy matt creed in kansas city and he started this company called blabbermouth in 2013 and what he would do is he would post names and addresses and mugshots of local people who had already been arrested then he would mail them all letters and say we have already been blabbing to the world about your release from jail and we want to make you aware of our services as we kind of have a big mouth and for 200 we will remove all the information from our website and they would send that to people and that is exactly what mugshots.com does that's what arrest.com does that's what busted org.com it's free search pay to be removed from the database scrubbed from the from from their search not only that there's a whole bunch of removal services so there's remove slander.com removearrest.org or racemugshot.com who charge one thousand to five thousand dollars to actually just do this to all the to all the companies i imagine what they do is they just charge you five grand and then they go and pay all the websites each like 50 bucks like they just have some affiliate deal and they just take a little bit of profit there's probably some rule there's probably some dmca type rule where if i request to be taken out and you have to take me down that's probably what it is that's my guess i don't know if that's right but i feel like they may not have to pay anything it's just going and filing the claim so in in vast in the vast majority of states posting photos online of uh these mug shots is totally legal okay so you you can't you you really can't get a it's not a big deal to post them it's public record where the gray area is is that the websites uh that populate them they put the mug shots on there and then they turn around like and charge individuals money to remove them um then now a lot of these guys who run these websites like microsoft.com they the authorities are trying to look for anything little that they do wrong or anything that it didn't matter how small but they wanted to do something wrong like for example like embezzle a little bit of money which i i think that there's like a try figuring out if someone is embezzled like you could probably catch that mistake it's like if they don't file their taxes correctly you know what i mean and so the founders have actually been locked up for like three four five months at a time and a lot of these websites if you go and try and find we i went and researched them you try to find out who owns them it's different domains in panama belize things like that it's like this huge web but it's incredibly fascinating there's this entire ecosystem around mug shots and then mugshots removal and it's very fascinating very interesting i think it's horrible but it's interesting nonetheless tell me you're shady without telling me you're shady and then you post your your cayman islands uh incorporation documents or your belize you know headquarters address dan dan come on come on microphone real quick you're a good human being i would say dan is a extremely straight edged human being from what i could tell and dan tell me this when i hear sam explain these businesses by literally my first reaction is awesome that was wow so smart how they thought of that and i think you probably or like many people have a different reaction which is sort of like geez these guys like whoever does this is kind of a scumbag tell me dan what is your reaction to this yeah i just chatted to you i i said the owners of all these companies are human garbage and so is that your reaction with sam describes these as like ugh gross or is it like like my reaction was awesome i mean there's lots of ways to make money in this world that just sounds like a horrible one that's a good point okay fair enough so i i i i'm not like people i do not like this i would never do this i think these guys are pieces of [ __ ] and also i think it's amazing like like i think that like do so doing what this guy matt did of like sending the letter that's like table stakes any schemer who has ever wanted to do that like already schemer out there who's been like 19 like that's such this is the most this is some basic [ __ ] [ __ ] i think this is like the most basic like scam i would imagine but uh no i would never in a million years do it and i wouldn't want to be friends with anyone who does it and yeah i still think it's fascinating and interesting right so there's like uh would i do it no uh do i think other people should be allowed to do it maybe yes or no if somebody does it do i consider them a piece of [ __ ] or do i consider them like you know it's fair game it's just not one it's not for me right like uh i think those are the kind of to me that's like the moral question question box i i get into with stuff like this but uh i don't know i think these are very clever very smart i think they to me i'm always like wow okay yeah i wouldn't do it but huh that's interesting what like if you just piece it together there's a bunch of layers one layer is oh man you can create businesses just taking public data that's not really formalized for for kind of like consumers to like use and you could like aggregate it create a search engine on top of it you can create a product there yeah people do that with zillow people do that with many things so it's just one generic business model type so then you say oh cool if i ever find other public things that are public record but i don't know that there's a main consumer consumer website for it i could build that then there's like huh there's some psychology why are so many people why are millions of people going to these websites what is there like is it just like a gossip thing is it that they are trying to solve some problem like they had some theft and they they wrote down some guy's license plate they're trying to figure out who it is oh maybe there's a maybe there's a consumer problem to be solved here and then there's like the business model innovation or the business model tactic which is the same thing i was saying earlier about ncaa violations which is you don't sell the the search you sell the removal right you sell the solution once they search and uh okay that's interesting too so i i like i look at it as a bunch of different layers and then when i put the whole thing together i'm like yeah that's kind of crappy but like as individual layers it's pretty fascinating to me it's fascinating you want to talk about porn yeah let's do it you saw this thing i wrote down yeah all right so i saw this company that's in yc right now and i don't know how did you wait first of all how do you see all this interesting stuff that's like saying you know how how do you pull off that shirt man i don't know you just do it you don't even think about it uh this case this was on hacker news it was a it was posted as a show hn so i check out hacker news when i go to hacker news i typically will go to the show tab because i find that to be more interesting than the news and uh and then i think in this case ben sent this to me yesterday when we were talking about something that we were just bullshitting about something else related and then he's like oh yeah there's another company like this that's kind of interesting he was laughing at it and i was like no i actually think that's like a legit idea he's like what do you mean i was like well i think these taboo ideas so in this case this is a company that helps people who are addicted to porn fight their addiction so it's a great treatment so it's like alcoholics anonymous for people who are are uh compulsive with porn and i'll get you addicted to this app so he sent it to me as a joke like um dude look at this and i was sort of like i bet that's actually a big problem i bet there's a lot of people who have this problem and i bet there's kind of nothing there's no real legit company that's occupying that space why not why why wouldn't there be something that occupies a space that helps a lot of people and so i started looking into it so they have about a hundred thousand members of their community they say i don't know if that means just registered people explain the product i'm explaining product so the it's an overall company that's supposed to help you overcome a digital addiction so it wasn't just for porn but they started out with a few different products so they had the first one they had was called detox and all it was is basically it was an app that would just like get you off your phone for a period of time it would kind of like lock you off your phone and just tell you don't use your phone for the next four hours you're detoxing okay cool and by the way i've i've wanted to do this myself i kind of made a rule for myself one hour a day i'm just gonna lose my phone i i don't need my phone every hour of the day um the next one they created was socialx that's your personal role that's my personal yeah i didn't know about this app but i just i just put my phone in one different room and i just leave it for an hour um then there's social dude [Music] yeah that's a lot for me i was constant on my phone dude me too and so what i do is i just uh i don't i yeah i only use it from nine a.m to six work hours and then i just leave it oh my god what do you do for fun um well so i'm trying so i mean i i i hear your killer in your night times what do you do i do have it on me sometimes i just use airplane mode all the time so you just can't contact me like i just won't see any messages what do you just use it as a clock or uh like if i were working out i'll use headphones or music right okay but that's it wow so after 6 p.m if i text you you're just not gonna get it or like you get an instagram comment or something you just don't look at it no i don't look at instagram comment no no of course not no uh if you called me if you called me i would probably see your number and pick up but if it's anyone else i'm not like if you're outside the circle yeah i'm not gonna talk to you well good for you man that's that's really good i think that's i think you're saying it like it's a normal thing and and when you say it all out it sounds perfectly reasonable i think like less than one percent of people well let me tell you this this quick story i heard about an earl nightingale you know what earl nightingale is no what's that so he's this uh he was around in the 60s probably the 40s and 50s actually and he was a radio host and he would tell interesting stories but he's also kind of business-minded so a lot of like he was like the tony robbins of the day and he told the story about how he um went to a farmer's house one time and this was right when phones just got created and he was at this farmer's house i forget what he was talking to him about but the farmer's phone was rigging and it was going off and going off and earl was just kind of looking at the farmer and the farmer just kept looking at him having a normal conversation and then the phone went away and then it started ringing again and kept going and earl finally goes hey you know mister like your phone's been going off aren't you gonna answer that and he goes why would i answer that he goes well someone's calling you but he goes sir i installed this phone in in here for my convenience not their convenience and i don't feel like answering it right and that's now how i ch my opinion now toward my phone is is like no this is here for me not for anyone else i uh i similarly i picked up a phrase like that that i'll share that i've been i've been like kind of playing with i don't know if i'm like fully adopting this because i feel like a dick when i use it but my brother-in-law was talking i was talking to him the other day and he's uh he's he's a successful guy in business and he was like he was talking about um i was asking about like a tax accountant and i was like yeah my tax accountant's saying this and i'm saying this he goes i was like how do you do it he was telling me how he runs his relationship with his tax account i was like oh wow that's kind of strange uh like why do you do it that way or like don't they ask or don't they don't they like want you to do xyz and he's like are they paying me or am i paying them and i was like you're paying them he goes okay so then we're gonna like if i'm paying you then we're gonna do this a certain way and if you're paying me we're to do it a certain way he goes so many times you see people who pay someone for a service and then cater to the other person as if they're being paid by them and i started to see this at first you said i just kind of laughed it off i do [Laughter] i'm not fixing this i'm paying this woman to do it right i think i even said this to dan the other day i was like uh dan was talking something about like uh the schedule this of this of like our recordings or whatever he's like oh it's getting real late you know because you guys are always like kind of last minute and all their deadlines and i i just had to kind of say it i was like i feel like a dick saying this but i honestly like it's this is again this is the situation dan are you paying me to record this or am i paying you to edit this thing right like which way does it go because right now you're telling me how i need to do it but i pay you to put this podcast out right so like again it feels like a total [ __ ] thing to say in a mentality but man it's like been very effective i've used this like 10 or 15 times the last two months of just reminding myself what is the arrangement here oh person from the bank is calling me hold on wait a minute do you do you do i work for you or you work for me hold on which way does this go okay yeah yeah all right now i remember let's do it this way instead uh and like fights my kind of like just nice guy get pushed over instincts all right anyways back to this uh app real quick so they have uh the main app the one i think that's blowing up for them is called blocker x and basically you just you go on your phone and you basically set it to disable your ability to go to adult sites maybe on some timer or maybe just like permanently i don't know what's like a self-blocking thing and blocking these sites is actually not that easy um and so you want to be able to block this without blocking other sites accidentally and without letting you get through and so you and so they basically have this combination of things between like a community of people like peers like alcoholics anonymous like here's a bunch of other people also trying to improve themselves this way here's a tool a blocker here's like gamification a streak or uh like points you're getting for continuing on and i just thought this was kind of interesting like is there a modern day aaa like if people are right that social media is the new smoking right that um that that all this like kind of like overload of technology overload of digital news and information and social media is making us unhappy and lonely then isn't somebody going to build the like aaa for that like that kind of makes sense to me even though on the surface it sounds like a weird idea what are you so i'm trying to yeah i i think this is great but let me put some stuff in perspective so i actually use a site like this i don't use it for porn but i use it for uh sure facebook and twitter and things like that and so i wish i could share my screen right now but if i go to twitter right now it says shouldn't you be busy working and i use this thing called stay focused stay focused is a google chrome extension yeah it's a google chrome extension i love it and i just sent it to you according to stay focused uh the cool thing about doing research on chrome extensions is they tell you roughly how many users they have so they have roughly 600 000 users but the biggest person in this space who haven't done a significant amount of research is uh research for they have uh it's called um it's called a block site the thing i sent you it's read out how many users that has block site it says a million plus users crazy right right so that's pretty good that shows there is a lot of demand because chrome extensions are not like mainstream or like that easy to like find and you know so so if if a chromecast has a million users that is a strong validation of demand it's huge and so when i look at what these guys are doing it's kind of interesting so what's it called again i got to pull it up uh how do you pronounce it altmana and mana their name is not the best admonish so i'm looking at what they're doing it's basically it starts with a a chrome esque extension business and then offers more features to get you well i think theirs is a mobile app i think that's i think it's the same as what you're talking about but with the mobile app as far as like their go to market and you can and i think that's actually your android i actually think that's a brilliant way to spin a thing that's already been around yeah and to spin it a little bit differently and i'm on board with this i think this is great so the way the way we were talking about um chrome extensions if you go to the chrome extension store you can see how many downloads it has so google play does the same thing so if you click the google play button you scroll down to the bottom of any google any goo any app on android you'll see installs and this says it'll say you know either like less than ten thousand a hundred thousand if in this case five hundred thousand and then it'll say a million this one's at one million plus so you know it's between one and i think ten million is the next cut off so it's somewhere between one and ten million installs on android which again that's no [ __ ] joke i should invest in this this is a good idea and i actually just researched them so they used to be called this thing called fun switch technologies when i heard that name fun switch i was like i have a feeling that they started exactly how i thought and i went to the fun switches uh fun switches uh linkedin and it said uh mobile first solution aimed at the uh uh uh getting people sorry helping millennials overcome digital addictions and helping mental health uh sorry i'm just reading this as a go are aimed at using the latest techniques and mental help to assist people suffering from those digital addictions basically it was a chrome-esque plug-in and they just spun it to be this porn thing because they saw that's the big market to be in so i think it's really cool i have a feeling that's what happened i'm just doing all this research like as we're talking but kind of interesting okay let's do chrome all right so i had this idea while i was laying in bed this morning so my my trainer has me do this exercise you go what is it called it goes um kegel exercise it's a kegel for my brain uh basically it's a quick like two minute thing you do you do in the morning which is called the events of the day go my way you just sort of imagine your day going the way you want and um and and it's very simple and and and we do the same thing at night as a revision which is you reimagine something some part of your day that didn't go the way you want and you just re you don't even try to correct it and self-help and ask why what's wrong with you why am i such an idiot you just reimagine it going good and then you go to sleep um and this is like such a lightweight mental hack but anyways the um i was doing it this morning and i was imagining this podcast going great i'm imagining you saying that is a great idea uh and this is what came to my mind so then the idea came which is how crazy is that i imagine you saying this is a great idea i had a great idea came to my brain within like 20 seconds so here's the idea a chrome extension that pays you for the sites you go to okay let's start there why would a chrome extension pay you to go to a website well websites want traffic right that's what most ads are so a website i say i have an ecommerce store i know that a visitor on average the right visitor is worth you know somewhere between three and five dollars let's say um just based on the conversion rate and the average order value and so i would be willing to pay a dollar for you to come visit my site so here's what i'm imagining you install the chrome extension the chrome extension tells you hey sean um espn will pay you 30 cents right now to go to their website um you know reddit will pay you 20 cents uh that you know that pet store that you buy from they'll pay you a dollar to come to the site um just click the button go there and you just have to be there for for 30 60 seconds or whatever and then you'll unlock the bounty and it'll just go into your little piggy bank right here in the browser it's a little piggy bank icon oh okay so so i believe that on one side you could get brands to basically buy traffic through a chrome extension and the money goes to the user um either split with the with the chrome extension or just all to the user in this case and the user goes there and the user says ah easy i just have to go to the site i don't have to buy anything no problem but you go to the site you basically have bought their attention you bought their impression it you know they may see something new they may convert they may check out some new product that you have because that's what you drove them to now how does this uh how does this end up paying off well two two things two interesting things happen here the first let's say my wife is a big shopper okay traffic is going to be worth a lot more than my traffic because i'm a shitty i barely shop i just go look at information i steal and i run away so i might get low low bids she might get high bids how does it know how what to bid well it's a chrome extension it sits in my browser it sees how much i spend it sees what sites i go to it creates a value score for me and so it knows what i'm worth the second thing is when i go to let's say now let's so let's so so that's the first part uh it's like page rank but for users users are worth some different amount based on the sites they go to how much they spend um it's like unbundling the facebook ad system so now the second thing is let's say now i'm a news website and news websites always wanted this like micro payment thing like they want me to subscribe 10.99 a month or whatever but i don't want to do that but i would pay like four cents for an article right i would pay two cents and this idea of like ultra micro payments has been around for a while people want to do this with crypto people want to do this with different things but if you first did the piggy bank thing by letting users get paid then you could go to publishers and say hey pay wall this for like two cents using that same plugin we have six million members who um who get paid daily using our thing their piggy bank has money in it all they don't have to put in a credit card ever they can just do like tiny micro payments on their favorite sites when they go there so i think you could build a pretty i think you would change the way the internet works if you if you did this all right tell me about my idea okay so this is not i don't think new right like the idea of like making a little bit of income from the ad arbitrage and and incentivizing you to go to a uh i mean this is maybe what would i use today if i wanted to get paid if i wanted to open up my browser and see some offers to make money to go to some of some websites that want me to go there um you know the penny holder the the kind of blog website yeah they made 80 million a year doing something like that and so uh kind of like that so they would they would show all the latest deals and all the latest like free stuff that you can get and they would make a little bit of money by sending people there and making that affiliate but you have to go to the penny order right yeah so different but same um similar but different correct um so there's this guy named dan that one of our friends invested in and told me all about it and he he's like ugh this is this is a scam now that's my friend's words sorry dad don't hold me to this but i sent you a link to it it's called current mobile.us and that's a similar promise to what this guy made was basically you're going to get paid for browsing the internet passively and i can i imagine that it was something like we will pay you that that ad arbitrage and i'm almost positive that it was like the number one app in the uh itunes store for like a very short amount of time but number one nonetheless um and i don't know what happened to this but i remember he laughed raised 40 million dollars but looks like you're thinking that this isn't doing gangbusters anymore he raised i think he raised 40 million dollars through uh uh what's it called an ico uh okay yeah so he's got current token yeah so there's like a bunch of like right stuff around here that it doesn't make sense to me so brave brave browser also has like a similar idea the brave browser has bat which is the basic attention token so you earn it by going to sites or whatever and then you pay you know you're basically like advertisers can buy the token to get your attention uh you can you can basically like pay the token to like see websites or whatever but yeah you'll be using a great browser which is a great browser if you're doing well yeah break browser has like 10 million users or something like that so then yeah this is a great idea you're just suggesting it on chrome yeah i think that's a wonderful idea yes right all right my my imagination has my imaginal act has turned into fact as they say i think that's a great idea right i think it's a great idea that's why i said it i thought i was excited about it i think i think that somebody could do this it's like honey right like honey is the chrome extension that basically says cool you just go around shopping on the internet we'll tell you when we could save you money because there's like a discount or a coupon and then they started shoving in like kind of some ad slots i was like hey this person's not even necessarily looking at this product but you could make them an offer here um and so i think that's i think that it's honey but it's for your foot traffic basically what is your foot traffic worth it's worth something that's a great way to and that's a great way to phrase it facebook catches all the value google catches all the value of your foot traffic you get none of that value and so what i think is that if you could opt in and say i'll get paid for my foot traffic i'd like to see what my foot traffic is worth you put the chrome extension in you start getting offers you start earning a piggy bank and then that can be used to just either you take the money out or you can pay for things on the websites you go to and i know that websites will pay for the right foot traffic if it performs and i see no reason why this wouldn't perform all right let's wrap dan tell us how we did how was this episode episode was good i liked all the ideas give you a 9 out of 10. all right solid i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

i think when you once you treat your hobby like a job uh that's like a recipe for failure and that's what happens to a lot of people yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like my days all right what's going on what's up man so we're gonna get into some ideas but let me tell you something that i did this week and i cannot give the i actually got in trouble three different times where someone was like hey we had this conversation and you just talked well i'm like well i don't i just when you and i the way that you and i talk now is how we talk all the time yeah and yeah and they're so they're right so i'm going to try to keep this one vague i had this dinner and i was with the guy who has 8 000 employees in china as well as many thousand in america wow and yeah impressive person like a factory or something else in china tech related just like just some huge company you if i gave you 100 guesses you likely wouldn't guess it it's just some big company that exists and in the tech world fair enough and um it's impressive but it's not like a mainstream thing okay and there was this other guy there who made a comment where he was like china's gonna crush us in the next five years or something and then a couple other people people love to say that by the way don't people love saying how china's passed up america a bunch of other people pounced on that and then this guy it was this guy he lives in china um i believe he he he i don't know what ethnicity he was but he looked like he i mean he's probably maybe born and raised in china and then there's this other woman there who actually was born and raised in china and this guy with the 6 000 chinese employees goes a lot of people say that i do not think that's true and i don't think any of you should ever think that uh he was just saying he was like americans actually work maybe as hard or harder than a lot of other countries interesting um and also you talk about this like artificial intelligence and this um it's mostly ai that people i mean they talk about china crushing america and a bunch of stuff but ai is like a hot thing and this guy was like i don't think that would happen and if and what i think you should do is invest all most of your money into american uh equities i think he goes like i'm just so bullish on america and this so it was like an interesting perspective have you ever heard that it's like the one person who probably knows what they're talking about at the table and everybody else who just reads [ __ ] on twitter and like regurgitates it uh all right i'm gonna go with the guy who's got six thousand employees in china that that makes more sense to me that's you know and and that was good i felt great about that and so uh it was just an interesting perspective but we love you some pro-america news yeah well so i'm also just finished reading this really great book uh do you know who giant steinbeck is no of course you do grapes or wrath no what is that [Laughter] i got a blank here wow uh have you heard a kill of mockingbird i have heard to kill mockery that's the author oh my god like john cyber i mean people are going to make fun of you by the way anyway and mostly just read harry potter okay like it let's be clear this guy he was born in 1902 so he's dead he's probably died in the 70s but anyway i'm reading this great book about his memoir from driving across the country for three months in america and getting to know america and it's really funny in 1965 when he was doing this trip he was complaining about how americans are getting out of touch with and are getting too focused on technology and how there's refrigerators everywhere and there's tvs everywhere and how there's artificial food everywhere it's very funny we've always complained about this stuff but i do love learning about america i think america's special i think we have this research resilience and i think the yeah anyway i'm very pro-america so yes i did like hearing it but you want to talk about some ideas uh yeah by the way dan corrected us i don't think he wrote to kill a mockingbird but no of man or something he he he didn't write to kill a mockingbird i'm saying his work is like it's like it's it's like did he write mice and men i know he wrote like grapes of wrath it's just like a famous like american classic i'm just shocked the fact that you don't know that he wrote of mice and men so you know that so the fact that you you by the way i know that as in i've heard those words before that's all i know about that anyways let's let's go into the stuff i do know about because i feel a lot better about that and also bitcoin rally thank you i've been waiting for this bitcoin pump and here we are we're back up life is good because bitcoin is now right it's like spiked up to almost 40 000 uh over the last like 24 hours 48 hours there was a bit of a short squeeze about a billion dollars of short positions got liquidated and that caused the price to uh run up because um are you familiar with how that works by the way like what a short squeeze is like so no so here's the like non-technical non-super uh super like nuanced version of it basically when you have a short you're betting against something and if it goes up you are on the hook to pay the the sort of the price for the for being wrong and so if you think something's gonna keep going up you're better out just closing down your short position just taking the l and saying okay i'll pay i'll i will i will go buy the shares now because i'm you know let's say i was it's at 30 000 i think it's going down it goes to 32. you know what to close out my position i'll go buy the asset at 32 and i'll eat the loss right um but what happens is because all the shorts start worrying that the price is gonna run up they all start trying to close out their positions at the same time so they all start buying so the people who are betting against it all of a sudden at all this buying pressure where they have to to close out their position they have to buy bitcoin which causes the price to go up and up and up and up and so what happened is as it started running up all the shorts had to cover their positions because they were massively leveraged right they're not putting in their own money they're putting in like five to ten percent down and they're taking the they're taking 10x or 20x leverage on their position so as the price goes up they're very sensitive to it and so i think that's what happened uh to cause the price to go up about ten thousand dollars in the last two days is those shorts had to cover their position this is what happened with tesla tesla was the most shorted stock in the stock exchange and then as the price started to go up those shorts you know they basically are paying a huge price for every every dollar it goes up so they start to close out their positions which which puts a bunch of buying pressure which is why it becomes a squeeze because the shorts themselves cause the other shorts to like have to cover and it just causes the price to shoot up way above what its earnings is and anything else dude this is funny it's funny because like when you you do so we're in this chat group sean and me and all a bunch of other like successful young guys and they talk about like alpha like crushing alpha and i'm like i don't know what that means yeah i got no idea what that means we talk about short squeeze i'm like this these words don't mean anything to me i don't even know what they mean you guys feel like so sophisticated to me yeah um all right let's talk about some ideas can we yeah let's do it you want to go or you want me to go you go first okay i have one okay here's another one that's crypto related and you're going to be like what uh but i'm telling you this is a good idea this is actually ben's idea so first of all ben is visiting me so i'm getting to see ben in person he's sitting five feet away from me i wanted him to join this but had so many goddamn technical difficulties setting up that like i don't know how i could get it to be where it works but maybe wednesday we'll take an extra hour beforehand and just get it set up for a two-person setup um but anyways ben ben were talking last night and he's like you know one we're talking about courses right because and i could share kind of like how what the numbers like i just finished my course i can share what the numbers were on that but we were talking about other few other potential courses we could do like what would be fun he's like i don't know he's like we're not the right people to teach this but i think this course with crush right now so sam tell me do you know what solidity is if i say oh solidity so no when i saw you writing i thought i thought it was a typo for solidarity right solidarity is what we'll call it so solidity is the programming language that you use to write smart contracts for ethereum so let's say uh like one of the most promising things about crypto is that you can write a smart contract so think like a basic escrow contract i buy a house you're going to give me the title i'm going to give you the money but i don't want to give you the money first you don't want to give me the title first so we use this third party this escrow agent we pay them five thousand dollars basically you hand them the title i hand them the money they say yep they're both here and then they give it to each other right so in the real world we paid these exorbitant middleman fees i don't know what you paid for your house when you when you bought it or you just did another real estate transaction i don't know what you're paying for escrow i don't even i didn't even look at it i don't know it was like four grand to do an escrow transaction which sucked i was like this is just for nothing when i sold my business i think the escrow was fifty thousand dollars right crazy they think this is crazy so and they literally do like one ounce of work um they literally just oh you hand me the title and you hand me the money great i'm gonna just turn one hand over here and i'll give you the you'll give you this i'll give them that so a smart contract basically says look we don't need this like person in the middle and we don't need to pay them four thousand dollars let's just make a contract with some rules and we'll just instead of writing it like a lawyer contract we'll write it like a programmer contract the programmer contract says hey when this wallet has this much money in it person a has fulfilled their obligation and when this wallet has this asset in it person b has fulfilled the obligation and then release the assets to each other um and so and instead of paying four thousand dollars you can pay four dollars or forty dollars whatever the gas fees are at the time so that's smart contracts so what what that means is a lot of jobs today that go to lawyers are going to go to programmers because you're not going to want a lawyer to write a contract for something you're going to want a programmer to write it down but you need that contract to like work it needs to be like solid bug proof hack proof and like i needed to do the many things that i need my my transactions to do so there is an extreme shortage right now of smart contract developers of developers who know how to write in this new programming language and write these types of contracts but it's clearly like a big part of the future in my opinion and so one idea here is to create basically a boot camp that takes an existing engineer and says hey cool oh you write javascript or like you know you're you're a back-end engineer you're one of like 10 million um why don't you come over here where there's this high demand high shortage of engineers that know how to do this thing i can train you in six weeks to learn how to write like smart contracts and solidity and then go to all the companies that are trying to hire this and basically do a lambda school i think you can do a lambda school that's really niche really focused and if i'm an engineer that like i'm a crypto nerd this is a business that i think you could do you can just train other engineers to like learn how to write smart contracts and then get hired and placed in these jobs that you take the placement fee what do you think of that so i'm doing research while you're talking all right oh wow okay no i i agree with a lot that you said except for the last part so there's this company called coursera have you heard of coursera of course um so they were starting 2012 and i believe that they were started because the two guys i think they worked at google and they're noticing that we are struggling to hire a particular type of engineer i'm just this is just off memory so i might be a little bit off here about some of the stuff but anyway they uh and so they built like these courses and they built it so people can get jobs at google data science or machine learning or something yeah it was some type of data science or machine learning i forget exactly what it was and they they came out of the gate and they crushed it and then like over the last five years they kind of like went nowhere and kind of like it was like what the hell happened to that company and they're not really doing that well anymore well over the last year and a half two years with cove and a bunch of other stuff they started crushing it do you know what uh coursera's revenue is now no idea so they uh they went public did you know that no yeah a lot of people didn't know we didn't talk about they had like stagnated and like wasn't going anywhere yeah that's what everyone thought so in 2020 they did about 300 million dollars or sorry my bad 400 million dollars in revenue and they're currently publicly traded at a five and a half billion dollar valuation and wow yeah crazy right totally forgot about it and what you did with your course well i don't know if you did this but what a lot of people and like you and me we'll do courses and we'll kind of do these kind of like bootleg things not bootleg but like yeah yeah and you'll charge like three hundred dollars or something like that which i've done before and that makes things a little bit and you want like a person to buy it and that thing makes things a little bit challenging what i would do is i would take the thing that you're describing and with this with bitcoin there's like all these crazy new things that you've got to learn really quickly i would just copy the coursera model and just churn these [ __ ] out and charge like eight thousand dollars and it's like we're gonna like a company needs to buy in order to train their people so i think that's lambda for x i would do coursera for x okay i think that's fair the thing with the lambda side which is basically i think every time you place one of these engineers that's like a 20 to 25 000 fee that you get and so it doesn't take much to be i don't i wouldn't do this as like a venture scale business not at all this is basically i'm a developer who you have to be the right mold it's like i've been tinkering with smart contracts for the last two years anyways i've actually kind of like gotten up to speed myself i'm a converted back-end engineer who now does smart contracts and i could go i work at like a fang company today i make 400 000 like wouldn't it be great to make like four million dollars a year and i think this is a way to make four million dollars a year as like a two-person company basically that's why i agree yeah i would never do it in the land so when sean says lambda school he's referring to it's free and you make money by getting like a 25 000 referral placement or a percentage of their income salary i have i know nothing about lambda other than we had austin on the show and i think he's amazing and i love him and you're an investor that's really all i know about it i think my prediction if i had to bet money on it is that it won't work yeah i think that's a i mean i think that's a fair prediction about most startups i think that's true uh well yeah but they're not most startups they've raised like 100 million dollars probably they're not like an early stage startup they're like in the thick of it i think that if they're out of business in two years i wouldn't be surprised right and i would agree with that even as a fan and an investor i would agree with that um i think that okay so here's okay let me do two things first let me share with you a really hilarious story do you know this twitter account greg it's like greg nine five five three two three like three two six seven eight seven a white guy like like a white old guy it's a white no not old guy it's a white like nerdy dork guy no i don't know so you haven't seen this just google search greg meme uh greg meme account uh you'll see it and i bet you've seen this guy so you know like these mimo castle there's like dr park patel by the way big fan of him i think he's a big fan of us uh he works for the hustle you know that right doctor park patel works with the hustle yeah oh my god you just outed dr park patel amazing no no no no no no he like him he's a contractor for us he writes for us sometimes oh my god i love it wow no i did not know that yeah yeah yeah my brain is racing to figure it out who it is now okay no he's not like like i was a fan of his and i dm'd him and i was like hey you don't know the real identity uh i do okay you do but it's yeah so you're saying yeah after you saw a dark fire so then you contracted okay gotcha makes way more sense so anyways what he one thing he does is like every time chamath tweets he's like the first reply and he's like just says it like like i'm proud of you son or something like that like something like totally non-standard so greg does that with like kylie jenner and like other people like that where every time she posts something he'll be like babe why did you like you didn't call me or like it's like we're like i'm so proud of you babe so it's like as if they're dating and so he's this like dorky looking white guy account and uh so the other day do you know who jose canseco is of course ben told me the story so so jose canseco the base former baseball player tweets out i need a i need a smart contract developer for a new token a token developer for a new token i'm going to launch this which is like the classic thing for like paris hilton and joseph has been celebrities that are like ready to launch their own crypto token here we go that what could go wrong so so greg replies and greg's like uh like whatever like me ben what did he say what was his reply was it just like pick me something like that oh yeah he goes hey it's greg dm me how can i help and jose replies and goes um he goes awesome like are you a token developer and then like are you are you developer or smartphone can you know how to do token development i think greg just replies no way jose 200 000 likes on that tweet it's just like one of the most liked tweets on twitter this is like so good so dumb uh but anyways this guy's like crushing it right now like he's got like a hundred and something hundred thirty years handle well it's the funny thing is you know when you sign up for twitter let's say you typed sam it'd be like sam's not available would you like sam eight hundred thousand and six because that's like the next one available so his is greg and then it's like 12 numbers that are like the whatever the default thing would be so it's like you would never think it's gonna go viral yeah it's greg one six six seven six whatever like you know like 10 numbers long so what does this have to do though with okay so that was just my smart contract uh token developer uh tangent my next idea if you're ready to transition i am is is um unbundling a piece of yc so yc does a few things for founders yc puts a stamp on you it says this is a yc startup so all of a sudden your valuation's gonna go up blah blah they kind of coach you so they say oh you know come in for office hours tell us about your idea maybe we help you pivot your idea maybe we help you stay focused on growth or you know how to like tweak it so you grow faster and they do that for three months and then then they start working on your pitch and then there's demo day which is like where you're gonna get to stand in front of investors you've got to give a one minute pitch you're gonna raise money that works they have like whatever 120 startups a year now or something doing that um but another another kind of like course quote-unquote court i'm very i was brainstorming i was like very interested working backwards from what's a course where the person gets a clear outcome this is part of my learnings of like doing a course which is people don't buy a course for learning they buy some change they buy a transformation for themselves and so like you know for a startup going from unfunded to funded or like you know no name to like oh stamp of approval that's like actually a big change and so one one transformation and one change that people would buy is getting their first round of funding it's like i'm not just going to teach you knowledge that you can may or may not use it's like i'm going to help you get funded and so i was thinking could you like i've raised probably 20 million dollars in my life and i've helped a bunch of founders raise money and i think i'm pretty good at storytelling so i was like i think i could help a founder who's got no no funding today get funding in like a one month period and i think i could basically just sit you down with the deck with your story and then basically say cool like there's a pretty intense workshopping of your deck and your story to get that to be as good as it's gonna be and then there's like a bunch of angel like introductions and like teaching you how to manage your pipeline so that you run this like a process like a bidding war unlike what most people do which is they kind of try to date one investor at a time and they go kind of slow and they fear rejection and they don't know how to reach out and all this stuff i can teach you that kind of like the sales process of investing and i was thinking i was like oh you could do this like on a success basis so again like lambda which you don't like but uh honestly you could align your incentives which is by the way i like lambda i just think the business model is silly i think because the thing with education is that most people will never benefit from what you're telling them right well that's the in some ways that's the beauty of lambda but it's also the bad side of lambda right the beauty of lambda is their incentive is aligned so let's say most courses like let's say for my writing course i don't care if you're good at writing bad at writing and i really don't truly care if you're gonna do it or not because i get paid either way right like i'd love for you to take the course and have a big benefit but the reality is like my financial incentive is not such that if you don't if you if you don't hit your goals it doesn't really make a financial difference to me whereas for lambda does they have to select people who are gonna be able to succeed and then they only make money when somebody gets what they want which is a high paying job so that's the beauty of lambda but it's also the hard part about stealing what what were what were the results from your course though like what did that go well uh it went well so basically okay so here's the kind of like the learnings from my course all right so can i guess can i guess yeah yeah we'll do it on each category so first is let's start with the most interesting one money how much money do you think i made doing this course i taught a course on power writing which is basically writing to get a result so like the writing i type i do which is like if i'm writing an email it's because i want somebody to reply if i'm writing a landing page because i want somebody to click buy button if i'm writing uh tweet storms because i want people to share it and like the stuff you learn in school is not the stuff that that actually works in the real world and so it's like copywriting plus plus that's the that's the course all right so i do this 150 is my guess 150 000 very close so i did 127 000 of top line sales and then let's just break down the the p l so so then there's my cost of making the course so i basically had a guide to like custom illustrations and graphics and things like that that would probably be eight to ten thousand seventy five hundred um and he was amazing and he was really good and so i'm like i loved that that was that was worth it then there's mavin's fee uh so maybe the fee is on the top number so i should take that like 10 10 right so so take out 12 grand roughly from 127 then you take out 7 500 of cost production then everything else then there's payment processing fees that was another four three or four grand and so my net was like 100 i'm doing the math bad here but i think it was like 105 roughly um and then okay so so that's kind of like that's the the money in and so that was off of 320 students i charged the first batch i did at half price so i charged i think 450 or something like that uh 400 maybe it was for the for the course uh and if i had that did you do like an mps yes i would bet it was like out of 10 out of 10. so for those who don't know net promoter score basically you ask one question to your audience which is how likely are you to refer this to a friend on a scale of one to ten ten being i you know i absolutely will refer i would absolutely refer a friend to this one being no way seven point three nine 9.1 that's amazing most of everything is but it's definitely nice right because some people didn't reply to the survey so i'm assuming the people who really didn't give a [ __ ] also didn't reply to the survey so i gave myself a true nps of probably eight but it was a 9.1 on the the stats so do you think people loved it i think people loved it uh the feedback was kind of amazing and then i did a survey of like what did you like about it and basically it broke into three categories it was like look i can't you know the first one was dude two of those sessions were like like game changers for me it's like oh you're a cold emailing one like that was great i immediately implemented this and i got you know meetings that i wanted i booked more sales like that one i just i used right away or like the second one would be like you have one about writing inside of a big company how to like stand out with your writing inside a big company that was i didn't even know i wanted that that was a great one and so everybody kind of had two of this i did seven sessions everybody had like two sessions that they were like that was the one and the rest was fine you know like the rest was good but like didn't really like those two i got my money's worth the rest was gravy um and then i asked people the other question i asked people was on average how much value did you get like you know zero dollars the price of admission like a 1x return 3x 5x 10x whatever it was and then the average per the average answer to that was 10x my money i got 10x my value back out of it and i was like okay for what i don't know if that's like a scientific question because how the hell are they measuring that i don't really know but okay downsides guess what the biggest downside was because you've done a course before so tell me what what do you predict was my biggest the biggest downside of it uh well does that include logistics like quality like so i think they'll probably complain about your camera or your sound or the time uh yeah timing was the biggest one because i taught it live and so a lot of people you know were like oh you know i could i either the time worked great for me it worked okay for me or it was horrible for me because i'm in australia and that time zone was awful uh so i only watched the recordings the the i went the biggest complaint i had to do the voice what was the biggest downside of doing the course talk too fast no no i mean like why what was the pain in the ass for me well it's probably just way too much work yes complete underestimation of the work yeah it's so much work i spent probably 50 to 100 hours like making the content which was way more than i thought i would do i thought it would take me so much work an hour or two per session all right so let's say two hours per second that's like 15 hours of work it was like a full day it was like an eight hour day per per session i made plus like the actual teaching of it and then afterwards what i would do is so i structured my the one the best thing i did by the way was i think i don't think i invented this i'm sure other people do this but i didn't really know what it's called but i basically structured the session like this it was like all right you show up so it's like hey we're gonna be here for an hour the very first thing i do is i say all right the promise is this by the end of this hour you're going to be able to do this all right so that's my problem that's the magic trick i'm going to show you today you can't do that or you're bad at it you're going to be good at it by the end of this hour and then i basically would do i'd say all right let's say it's a cold email i'm not going to tell you anything about cold email write a cold email right now and they would all have to sit there while i'm sitting there watching them 10 15 minutes write the thing so it was called do learn redo so i'd have them do it i got that gives the bassline and they would all share it in the slack channel then i would teach them like not everything about cold email and be like hey here's the three biggest things you could do to improve your improved cold emails i do some examples i teach them the theory and then i'd say be like all right last 15 minutes you're going to redo it and then they would redo it and then they would just have a before and after of their one hour session where it's like a really shitty first attempt and then like a pretty good second attempt and then after the course i would take one hour and i would just go through as many examples as i could of students and just give them like feedback through loom so that was like that worked pretty well but it was like kind of intense for me because i'm basically performing a magic trick live i don't know what they're going to do and so it was kind of high risk it wasn't like like it could well are you going to happen my wife did it by the way sarah my wife did it and she sold out she made ten thousand in like two weeks maybe and why did she cap it because they told me to cap it and i didn't care she's not like you and me this is her first time doing like a public facing thing right um you know you and i have you know tens of thousands of hours of like riffing under our belt and like we know how to perform she she's just learning and trying to figure out how to do it by the way one thing you should tell her best thing i did was i did rehearsals so for each session i would invite four kids who are like kind of like 25 and under usually who can't afford the course and i just say hey you want the course for free in a personal session i need to do a dry run with you and so i did a dry run for each of the sessions and in doing that i would realize five minutes in like oh this is all [ __ ] up like i gotta change this or like wow this is way too hard when i just asked them to answer they're confused like they are yeah yeah so i needed to do those open mics basically to make it work but will you do this do you think this will be a significant income source for you in the future or are you going to quit doing it so i'm doing it one more time we're going to see how that goes my goal was basically i put the price back where the original price so it's 9.50 so i'm like all right let's see if there's enough demand there at that point price point because below that it's not really worth it for me i don't think because you need a lot of students it's a lot of work so i'm doing it one more time in august we'll see if it's like good again i had a lot of fun doing it so we'll see if it's fun again or if it gets like old for me but then i also have a bunch of other ideas for other courses that i want to do so i think i'm going to teach different courses which is more work but i think more fun for me can i tell you okay so now by the way we're talking about maven.com which uh this is here's your disclosure we both have incredibly vested interest in this and i want them to make money yeah because we invested in them yeah but i do think they're gonna have to change i don't think it's gonna work to do live courses i don't think are gonna have they can't be their bread and butter it's just gotta be how they get into the market that's that's my prediction but we'll see well i started off being like i'm gonna do it recorded and i started recording the content and i found a few people and i was like uh first of all recording good content takes a lot of time too so it's not like it was gonna save it saves you time when i you know it's scalable later but it takes a lot more time up front the second thing was people were way less excited about me recorded and i was like no no look i'm like it's me i'm like planning this out it's gonna be like as good as i can get it it's gonna be edited it's gonna be tight versus me live and they're like no we'd rather just to be you live off the cuff and like not so tight like the perceived value of live is way higher and so i was like yeah okay if it's easier for me to do and it's higher perceived value like that was one pivot i had to make halfway through of like switching to live um all right let me let me pivot to a different topic yeah you maybe told me about this but i had jake research it i i think you did you tell me about swimply yes okay so i like to keep a list of things that i thought are horrible ideas and i ended up doing like amazingly well i definitely would put bitcoin in that category like you've done like the stupidest thing i've ever heard of ryan hoover told me about producthunt the davey he was launching it and i was like just quit i also thought it was stupid yeah yeah um if you have an easy hack to do this whenever i just have a bookmark thing on my chrome so whenever i see a startup website that i'm like oh that's interesting i bookmark it either into i think it's going to work or i think it's not going to work so i have this like then i can go back like a year later i could just go click and see how many of those websites are still like up and like doing something uh you know and i exactly i've had this for like five years so if i saw this next company that i'm about to tell you about in this next idea if i saw that five years ago or a year ago i would be like well like just quit why why are you even doing these stupid games like this is the dumbest thing i've ever heard so it's expensive the name's even stupid it's called swim lee is that p supposed to be there is that a typo let me see is it swimly it might be swimly no it is swimply it's swimly that's it okay so we're looking at a google doc that's that's crazy i thought that i wasn't sure if that was a typo but he wrote swim please and like everything the way i found this i was just driving and i saw a billboard and it just said swimply rent a swimming pool near you and i was like what and that's what it is so uh you know with everything going on people are desperate to get out of their homes and they're working from their house and they want to get out and so they go and they can rent someone else's pool airbnb for pools if you told me about this four years ago i'd be like this is the dumbest thing i've ever done this is right next to like go out and rent a dog for an hour but you're a believer i'm not a believer yet but the numbers definitely show that i'm wrong so they've grown two thousand percent since summertime and a roughly fourth that what's so if you grow four they've grown four thousand percent in a year what's that mean forty x four thousand is forty x yeah okay they just raised up but you could be on anything right i could start with one and get to four that's true but they raised a series a which i'm shocked and who's their they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're they're like they raise 11 or 10 12 million dollars so so the idea is like i have a pool in my backyard i can set like a 50 an hour rate and somebody who doesn't have a swimming pool in the backyard because that's a big expense can say cool we'll rent your private we'll rent your pool we're going to come swim for two hours 100 bucks there's four of us it's worth it like we're gonna have fun doing that you like kind of clean up your backyard later um that's the idea they raise their money from like some ballers like people who like i think i respect as knowing what they're doing so i definitely think i was wrong uh north northwest ventures they're i mean they're like a huge um a huge thing right nor west generic name come on if you're gonna figure it out yeah but they're like a multi-billion dollar they're big enough that i assume that they have employee used to like vet well yeah of course uh okay so their traffic like if you look at their similar web thing it's pretty nuts so like january it's you know 50 000 visitors and by june it's like hockey sticking to 400 000 monthly visitors uh according to similar web so similar web the exact number's not right but the direction is correct usually and so this thing is like doubling it's like doubled last month doubled the month before that doubled the month before that so four doubles in a row and so i got i was i was interested in the space because i found a company that was raising money and what they were doing and the reason i got interested in this company was we had this guy who i talked about this guy named preston on the podcast his name was uh i don't even remember his last name but preston i think the company he started was called spacious where they would uh do short-term retail space and rent it out for co-working yeah there's this other company that i'll find i'll say the name in a second and what they're doing is you can rent people's homes just during the day for co-working oh yeah i've heard of that and it starts with a c what's it called cozy or some i don't know what it is yeah chills i'm just thinking of names and again that idea i thought was a stupidest thing and then i talked to preston and he's like no these could be legit these could be huge companies it's astounding and so here's a few more companies that that are interesting so neighbor is a storage marketplace and by the way almost all these i would bet against and i am being proven wrong consistently neighbor is a storage marketplace they just raised a 53 million series b imove is an electric vehicle subscription service so you can um uh they just raised a bunch of money i'm actually on board with that it's just like leasing kazoo subscribe to your next car online picasa buy and own a second home with eight others that's just a time share isn't it yeah and then resort resort pass you can share uh day passes to uh resorts pools and hotels so anyway kind of interesting i this space has always interested me because i've been the one saying how i think it's really stupid and it's not gonna work but these things are actually are are beating my are proving me wrong right uh by the way a a you just said something like share a thing and we're talking about courses uh we had this idea a long time ago i still think it's a good idea if somebody wants to do this i'll be uh you know first customer slash your minority business partner who does nothing besides give you the idea which is class pass for online courses so i right now would pay like if you said hey i can bring you a student but you're gonna have to you're going to have to give it to them 50 off but i can get you volume of students and you don't have to worry about getting students um i'd take that and if you basically i think you can work out the math where you can basically get let's call it 100 a month from somebody and then they get access to like your course my course sarah's course you know like 10 other courses right now um and and get all of them basically like and all you can eat past i think there's a class pass for courses that could work for online courses let me um could exist let me keep being a hater but there's this company called um every every dot what is it called two every dot so or every dot two i think every dot two yeah um there's guys doing that for newsletters and the guys running it are great uh his name's nathan really cool wonderful guy uh i know nat is a writer there i like his work there's a bunch of like interesting uh great writers on there but i think this business model is horrible um because dealing with how you're gonna pay each writer seems like a huge pain in the ass doesn't it yeah if i'm like if i'm like a big shocker based on uh who brings in subs so if your stuff brings in a sub you get the bounty of that you give i'm bringing in subs like go f yourself i want to own all of it yeah but you get you say you get the majority bounty on yours so let's say you get 50 of the subs you bring in but you're gonna put 50 of the pool so you're gonna get 50 from everybody else and so it's a but the beauty of it is when you're doing paid newsletter there's this obligation like [ __ ] i gotta write this thing i can't write one a week i gotta write two a week it's gotta be good it can't just be like off the cuff you know random stuff they're paying for this it's gotta be better than normal blog content so what they what every does is say look you just got to write one good thing a week let's say because the consumer is going to get value from eight other writers in the bundle and so that's the that's why this works is for each person they don't have to carry the whole subscription value themselves um they have eight other people contributing to that subscription's value and so just give away some you think this is going to work i don't know if it's going to work i think or the concept at least yeah i think i think it can work i think so basically i think i'm kind of a believer in that that the mark andreessen thing that he stole from whoever which was basically like most business is just bundling and unbundling and so i think that right now newsletters are all unbundled and somebody creating a bundle of newsletters it'll be like the cable package and like you'll somebody will say uh why am i paying for i don't want to pay for 10 individual subscriptions and some of them are good some are bad and instead if i could just pay a flat 15 a month and get access to my 10 favorite writers like great so i think i think it can work are you getting sick of newsletters uh no i have fun i like writing my stuff uh but i i do it on my terms so like i'm not consistent i have this thing i send out every tuesday but like if you subscribe to it you're like [ __ ] you don't send it every tuesday you said it like every other tuesday at best and so yeah because i just like if i'm doing something else that's fun i just don't send it and like you've experienced the pain of my like my like inconsistencies or being laid and things like that like it's just kind of like the way i operate on all things and like you know the good the good of it is like when i do it like i'm never just going through the motions like i'm always trying to bring it but if i don't have something to bring i don't like do it or like sometimes i'm i don't send the thing because i'm doing something interesting but that'll make the next week's letter more interesting because i was doing something interesting um so that's my only way of sustaining these other things i think when you once you treat your hobby like a job uh that's like a recipe for failure and that's what happens to a lot of people they they think it's fun to blog and then they want to make that their career and then you know they make the grave grave mistake of turning your hobby into a job uh when it when you weren't you didn't want it as a job really yeah it's hard it's [ __ ] hard as someone who has not i haven't written them but i have owned a newsletter company that has sent 365 newsletters times four years it's very hard by the way very challenging i heard uh a a another newsletter company that shall not be named uh say that oh you know our subscriber base is like you know the third largest city in america and i thought that was just a badass way of saying like we have whatever two billion subscribers three million subscribers or whatever it is uh and i think you should steal that and start saying things like that yeah i like that one it's kind of like i think the skim was the one who said um the skim said like if we were a morning show we would be the number one most popular morning show right um another great way of framing that's part of this part of the playground it's just like [ __ ] it's a bit [ __ ] but it is yeah it i it is useful right um okay do we want we want to wrap here do we want to go to one more let's do one more fun thing do you have one otherwise i can get one you pick one uh you want to pick one off your list maybe uh do this elon filing a patent thing that sounds good okay so basically i'm working with jake our researcher to like find different signals and figure out what do those signals mean and so there's something interesting i've always been i've always been interested in gas stations because like i said we said earlier i'm like in this nerd about america i love like nostalgia middle america stuff and gas stations are interesting to me because we spend a lot of time there like i have found many memories of gas stations and many of the biggest top 100 privately owned businesses in america if you look at one of the biggest privately owned companies in america most not most but a very large percentage are gas stations right and so by revenue gas makes up typically two-thirds of sales for gas stations but it only makes like one-third or less of profit the majority of profit comes from buying [ __ ] on the inside and elon musk recently filed a trademark for different restaurant services aimed at electric vehicles and and things like that and for food services basically and so i'm very eager to see what tesla's gonna do and also i'm very eager to see how the the modern gas station is gonna change and so far so what are the biggest ones i think the biggest ones are um are casey's quick trip there's a few more that are the top ones they're not doing [ __ ] because if you go to a gas station right now for tesla it's still a pain in the butt the tesla superchargers are way better and so i'm very eager to see and i wanted to know what you think what is going to happen to gas stations and how are they going to continue making money yes i think there's two big changes that are happening so cars go electric then what the hell happens to gas stations right do they just convert into electric charging stations or is it going to be different because you're charging at home right like i can't fill up my tank overnight in my garage but i can charge my electric vehicle that way and so maybe those gas stations they're just not needed anymore they need to convert some other use of real estate um you know it's like blockbuster on the corner store when why would i need that when i could just push a button and stream netflix to my tv the second is self-driving cars which is going to change the game for both gas stations and for um parking garages so you don't need as much parking when you have self-driving cars most of city real estate is parking whether it's street parking or parking garages there's a huge amount that's just parking and because cars are idle ninety percent of the time when cars go self-driving they're not going to be idle ninety seven this time so cities are gonna have to like re renovate basically the the way they use their land because it's gonna become totally obsolete but let's do gas stations for a second so one theory is gas stations become like entertainment hubs because actually charging a car takes a lot more time than filling up a gas tank i think even supercharger takes like 30 minutes right to to to fill up basically to recharge your tesla while you're like on a road trip or whatever and so you know what what do you do to entertain people during that time maybe they're just sitting in their car using the in in car entertainment system but maybe there's something else that you do with food and drink and tvs and maybe it's a sports bar essentially that you turn this into the other thing that i think is interesting is um like so i'll give my cousin a shout out so my cousin rohan has a startup called stable.auto so check it out you're not going to fully grok it from the from the landing page but but i'll just tell you about it so it says company stable uh just stable like s-t-a-b-l-e like a like a stable of hormones auto a-a-u-t-o um so so he started off what he started off doing was he he he was like a robotics guy from mit so he's like look um how do i make it where a self-driving car when it like self-driving cars are gonna need they're great because they're gonna drive people around without a driver but how are they gonna charge like they have to go to a charging station and then are you just gonna have like attendance there plugging in cars and taking them out like how is it gonna do that and so he was creating like if you've ever seen elon tweeted this out once um which is a robotic arm that would just find the charging thing and would like plug itself in so it was like a self a self yeah yeah like as imagine the gasoline pump could go into your car without you having to pick it up and put it in the hole so he built a robotic arm that did that so what my cousin was doing was basically he was just saying oh if tesla's doing that but then there's all these companies trying to compete with tesla i'll make the robotic arm for all the other companies so like every other company has a different like charging like kind of like location on the car how do i make machine learning that's going to find the hole and stick the stick in the hole uh basically for that and he started doing that but the problem was and i told him this which was like look uh like self-driving cars are not here so you're building for a future market like you don't know when it's gonna happen like we all know it's gonna happen eventually like that's a little bit difficult and so um and so and you're also building this robotic arm it's really hard hard to build so he switched to now he switched to something else which is basically like software that basically will um it it basically tells you when you need to when you should go charge your when you should go charge your electric car for so imagine like uber and lyft they have these fleets of electric vehicles uh that are gonna be out in the roads and that's for sure happening and so when do you go charge if you go wait till you're like almost out you might miss like peak peak uh traffic time where you're gonna like get a bunch of rides and make a bunch of money um you also might go charge when it's really expensive to charge because electricity costs fluctuate throughout the day so what they're building is basically an app that you load into your like this is at least last i heard of it it's like an app for any driver of uber or lyft that has an electric vehicle that will say now is the optimal time to charge go over here there's a charging station nearby there's a little there's not much traffic for uber rides right now and the price of electricity is low and so it basically that'll work while you have human drivers and then when you have self-driving fleets it'll do that whole thing automatically it'll basically say hey let's send to this 10 of your fleet to go charge right now let's keep 90 on the road and it'll optimize it so you're like saving the most money both ways but let's talk about what do you think is going to happen where's the opportunity right now i i mean his idea that maybe i i think it's far simpler have you ever heard of bucky's yes tell people what's bug news do you know what it is bucky's is basically in texas there's like a gas station chain that like people love they don't just like it they love it it's a tourist destination and it's destination for a couple of reasons i think i've never been to one even though i lived in texas it has extremely clean bathrooms and they have a bunch of food that people are like obsessed with it's basically shitty sugary food but it has a funny logo and they serve like brisket it's just like low quality but fun it became a thing yeah but it's huge so i think that it's gonna break down in two categories the first categories is just everyday use i think people are gonna keep their [ __ ] at home charge at home or they're just gonna charge while they're in the grocery store and that's how they and that's in whole foods is gonna be the winner the second thing is is traveling and i think the way that that's gonna look is bucky's it's gonna be just like it's gonna be a bucky's meets museum of ice cream so when i go to bucky's it's a spectacle i stop there because i'm gonna get like a huge soda i'm gonna get maybe something to eat but i'm just gonna look at stupid [ __ ] like a bucky knife or a bucky book bag just dumb trinkets going into a bass pro shop basically it's like going into a bass pro shop or just looking walking around ikea it's just a spectacle it's gonna be like that with a little bit of museum of ice cream where there's gonna be a little bit even more spectacles that are fun to take pictures in front of that is where what's gonna happen i think and i think like the shells of the world or whatever gas station 711 711 i actually think could become a bucky because 7-eleven has a little bit of nostalgia like 7-eleven it's kind of it could be cool it's like subways yeah yeah it could subway could be could be uh the next version of vans yeah um so i think there there's definitely some people that are gonna go that route right they make it a tourist destination and they have a quirky brand and that works i think some people are gonna go full automation so like in san francisco we had that thing cafe x did you ever buy coffee from that no it took too long touch it i mean it takes like a minute right it was just stupid i thought it was dumb cafe x is stupid how do you think that's stupid that's like that's so good so if nobody knows who look after describe it so it's basically okay but here's the thing so like it's basically a keurig machine like it's not that fancy but it looks like it's usually like it's in a building and it has like this glass around it and it's a massive robot arm that's making a spectacle of like moving the car the coffee cup around and then pouring the milk in it in reality it could like you don't need that stupid [ __ ] arm it could just be like a coffee vending machine like i don't so that's why whenever i saw that i'm like when i see these like in warehouses and stuff it's just like you put two quarters in and you just get like like at the hospital you've never been to the hospital to use one of those like cappuccino machines like i don't need this dumb [ __ ] arm to trick me and act like it's doing something special okay so that's definitely one way of seeing it and i i could see that point of view i think what's the difference between starbucks and that vending machine is it the quality of the coffee or what's the difference probably not the quality so what is the difference one's a spectacle and one you talk to people uh no no no so i'm saying like between the keurig machine and starbucks like why do you even need a starbucks why couldn't starbucks just be a curious i like getting out of the house and seeing people okay so maybe maybe it's that if that's the case then starbucks is safe the other case is basically that there's some middle ground of like variety and quality that's like above a coffee machine but more like a starbucks where you have like 40 drinks that you want because you want your soy latte with you know uh you know you want you want almond milk and then you want two pumps of sugar and you want light ice or whatever and like that's how you like your drink and so you know you can't get that out of a cup a normal coffee machine either the coffee doesn't taste as good or the drink is not as elaborate and cafe x basically says cool what if we could serve coffee faster and cheaper than a starbucks what if we could serve starbucks quality coffee but faster and cheaper than a starbucks why because we have a robot arm that could just like do the thing 24 7 and never call in sick and never be an employee you never need never have any employee like issues and by the way i take up one tenth of the square footage of a starbucks because it's like a it's like a giant robot in a hamster ball uh it's like it has everything it needs right there it takes up like 10 square feet wherever yeah it's like starting by 10. and so what they're doing with the idea with cafe i don't think cafe x specifically is going to succeed but i'd be shocked if there's not a cafe x type winner down the road because you can shove these things anywhere you can shove it inside of an apartment building and it can make sense in apartment building whereas like a full-service starbucks with staff wouldn't make sense in a stu in an apartment building and so i think that those are going to succeed and so i think there's a version of the gas stations that's like that i think there's a version of the gas stations that basically is just all automation the charging's automated and then you go and you push a button and it creates a giant slurpee for you like 7-eleven but it's just a robot arm doing it we'll see we'll see if it works out but i think it's gonna be more like buckies at least i hope it will be um all right that's the episode i gotta i gotta go get a haircut yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

i want to give you some predictions um so i've been thinking about this i said okay what's apple becoming because i see apple apple's shifting into like health in a pretty big way with these like wearable devices and so let's just say apple which today the core benefit is they give you this ultra personal device you're a little personal super computer that's going to help you with life so i don't think the next apple is a phone company i think the next apple the next apple which is gonna be a trillion dollar company that has uh that gives you kind of like a consumer device i think it's going to be a healthcare monitor i think it's going to be something that is going to be measuring what's going on inside your body and feeding that data back to you and so that's my that's my prediction the next what the next apple looks like not a phone company healthcare monitoring device next amazon this one's stolen from mark laurie next amazon so amazon a place to shop it's not going to be a website where you uh where you type in a word and you get 5000 images as a result and then you've got to sort through them the next amazon is conversational shopping in your house it's just saying what you need and having something go get it for you so basically it's just saying hey we need more pee pads for the dog and it says you want the same ones as last time i say yes and then it's boom it's ordered right i didn't have to type anything in didn't have to enter a credit card it's all on file and this is a hands-free voice assistant that helps me shop for things and when i don't know what it is it could say i could say hey um i need a you know the best camera for my webcam and it could say something like do you want the ones that most of the youtubers use do you want the ones your friends bought the most or do you want the one that's the best value or the highest price and i'm like uh what do my friends have sam has this one would you like to ask him how it is yes it asks sam and then sam says it's amazing and then i buy the thing right conversational commerce something like that that's the future that's the next amazon next netflix you skipped over 7-eleven oh i'm gonna do seven eleven two okay seven eleven the next seven eleven what is 7-eleven it's a corner store that has like it's a little local convenience store this one's easy this one is um it's a cloud corner store so you don't need a real location it's just gonna be 500 square feet that's within one mile of you it might be in this back alley place it doesn't need a good location and it's going to deliver to you with small lightweight drones so small little pass a small little carrier drone going to bring you something within 15 minutes of ordering no human being involved and the whole the whole 500 square foot place doesn't need good real estate and is going to be automated so that um you know when i push the button to order it there's no human being in the place it just pops out like a vending machine the drone takes it straight to me and it lands on a little landing pad that i have in my front lawn for uh drone deliveries and as soon as it's there i go outside i pick it up the next netflix net next netflix i think is going to be one of two things one is it's either in vr and it's more like it's a hybrid it feels like a game so you put the headset on you enter the world and then you walk around and you sort of experience a movie um so it's either vr or or because i think i'm not sure about that one um or it's machine generated movies which is basically something personalized to you so right now a movie is like a really specific story that gets filmed edited produced has actors blah blah i think you might be able to just sit down and be like i want something that's like breaking bad but with casinos and then it just generates it's just machine generates a movie for you uh based off of basically it's like a mashup and you've seen this with music so google released this thing called composer or whatever it's like this ai that basically writes classical music that sounds like it's made by bach and mozart and um and it's basically just it's just taking all the stuff that exists out there it studies it and then it creates remixes and mashups of all those things in a way that's maybe it could be one time it's like i get this thing and it's like a one-time movie for me um that could be kind of crazy remember that man remember that band girl talk yeah mashups yeah yeah i used to love those things man i still work out to that that's my go-to for working same i love that too it was like feed the animal or something like that that's yeah that's a great track i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

so every software company that ever was has always said our product is intuitive and easy to use and the reality is every one of them lies because here's what happens in order for a human to use software here's the thing i want to do and i'm going to translate into a series of drags and clicks and swipes and touches to make the software do the thing that i intended to do let's just say you should just be able to say the thing you want and the software should figure it out like we have the technology now on the language side to be able to understand natural language and all we really need is a translation layer so this is a mega trend to be which is in my mind bigger than mobile [Music]

um consistency i think is the number one thing that people forget i have not missed tweeting a day in three years if you do you lose your spot in the relevancy engine with twitter so twitter every day uh there's there's like 90 of consumers and 10 of us creators well the creators create content for the board consumers the consumer session and the product and twitter needs to figure out how to hook them immediately and so twitter goes to all their previous engaged content and they go well who do they engage with every day and if they've built up a habit of engaging with myself then they're like well let's give them a damn hell tweet but if i don't tweet that day then there may be like oh let's give them a chris tweet or someone else's tweet because they need to go hook them immediately and then if that engagement loop gets built with them over time then also slowly start to lose relevancy with them so consistency is absolutely the most important thing on twitter and most of these channels yeah i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back

i used to go to an atm machine and just put my card in and say print balance and just look at it and he's like i would just do that like every day i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to [Music] so we have an interview with microacquire uh they well we talk all about it then and and it's within it's with andrew he um he sells startups basically on microacquire it's a marketplace for selling startups but we're gonna talk about some ideas first and catch up i uh i've hired someone jake mcdonald to do research i just sent you you of course hired like a guy who looks like an a football player uh and yet he's your like business researcher guy so here's the here's the secret which is uh sean has had a little bit of help with research for a very long time and he uh his name's ben we've talked about ben ben's amazing and i got jealous and i said i want to ben so i went and hired a ben and his name is jake i had been or had jake call ben to get all of his research tips and ben did a really good job and i just sent to you sean my notion doc with all jake's stuff it's good right you see how we organize very thorough yeah he's he's wonderful so uh now we're gonna we're gonna be a little bit more well researched although he doesn't start technically kind of till next week this is kind of we're still kind of getting used to things trainer wheels yeah all right uh cool yeah so basically we're gonna do a couple ideas now and then andrew's gonna join andrew is the founder of microacquire which is zillow for buying and selling companies so we bought one company on there uh i bought a basically we bought it me and andrew bought a business for for this kid uh who's like a college senior we bought we bought him a business to go run um just as an experiment and that was kind of the first time i used it so i think it's pretty cool he's to tell us about like his previous company which he sold for tens of millions uh how that deal came about how he structured it um what he did with the money so we were like all right if you're gonna come on you gotta tell us what he did what'd you do with the money so he tells us about what he bought how he invests money his kind of like very boring investment strategy and why he chooses to do that um so yeah we're going to talk about that with andrew but first a couple ideas all right so i want to talk about this tweet i saw and it's a tweet from doug ludlow you know who that is yeah main street yeah ceo of main street founder main street and so he tweeted this thing out he goes isn't it crazy that bubba gump shrimp the restaurant chain does like 200 300 million dollars a year in revenue um when forrest gump the movie that the brand is based on did like 700 million like lifetime box office so he's like the restaurant is that real restaurant has produced more money than forrest gump ever did and i was like that's interesting he's like why aren't there more of these and so i kind of like this idea which is basically you take uh ip intellectual property a brand from tv or movies and you license it so they did this for um for public shrimp company and so what i went and kind of looked up the backstory of this and the backstory is pretty simple it's like um the movie happens and paramount is actually the one who did this i thought i just kind of figured that some entrepreneur went to them and got the brand actually was the opposite so from what i could read or what i found paramount pictures goes and approaches this restaurant group called rusty pelican and they're like hey we want you to create a brand based off the brand of the movie because it's like a kind of a key plot point in the movie or whatever it's a key moment in the movie and um and so some crazy things about this so first they do that uh it it generates you know 200 million plus a year it gets it got bought by the fertittas i think um and their their restaurant group but it um this is also where you know the actor chris pratt of course he was a waiter at bubblegum shrimp company and this is how he got discovered he was waiting on a table for this producer this is this director producer lady and he's like oh i love that thing you made and she's like oh that's great blah blah blah and they're talking and she's like you know what like you know you want to be an actor he's like yeah that's what i'm just waiting tables i want to be an actor and that's how he got his break in the movie industry also how did you learn about this uh just a hell of a lot of googling my friend we don't all have buff researchers like jake so some of us gotta get our hands dirty and go do some good so let me tell you something real quick so do you know so you said the fertittas you met you were referring to the fertitta brothers right so there's two brothers is the cousin yeah so i think he's like a distance cousin so i was gonna i was gonna correct you but you you know the story but tillman so there's this guy named tillman fertitta so a lot of people probably don't know this if you live in houston if you live in texas you certainly know who this guy is he's a pretty um he's a pretty polarizing figure i think a lot of people who know him think he's a huge [ __ ] he probably he probably is an [ __ ] i mean he's pretty cut through he owns uh this thing called landry's landry's i i've never even been to one i think that's its own restaurant yeah it's like a steak caps i think but then he also owns bubba gump shrimps he owns uh uh i believe like jay alexander's ruth chris steakhouse like a ton of like 30 to 50 ahead dinner places so like not particularly fancy but upscale really upsell uh upscale franchises and he owns about 600 of them but here's a fun fact i am pretty positive uh that landry's is the largest company in america that is owned by one person uh tillman fertitta owns 100 of the business he owns literally every single share uh right around the beginning of covid they were doing something like 5 billion in revenue and like 1.5 to 2 billion in ebitda that's nuts by the way he owns the houston rockets now so that's why that's how he got a lot more famous was because when you buy the rockets people want to know who the heck this guy is um so that's kind of crazy okay so so so back to kind of this idea real quick so a licensing ip so doug was basically saying he's like why don't more people do this and he's like why isn't there a paper company that's like the dunder mifflin paper company or and you know and so there's a couple of these so i went through and i kind of came up with a list of brands that i think could translate here's here's my list and then you tell me what you would do if you were approaching this or if you think this is a bad idea you can tell me i don't think it's a bad idea that's for sure here's my top five top five brands that i think you could license a creative company so dunder mifflin paper company yes the office is one of the most popular shows of all time it has like crazy reruns on netflix uh and there's no signature paper companies what what is another paper company i have no idea so i think you'd stand out all right duff beer from the simpsons i think duff beer could be a real beer maybe is a real beer somewhere uh but i think duff beer is a potential one you don't have too many more uh you don't have another decade or two left with that one though yeah yeah that one's sort of aging out uh wonka bars so anything with willy wonka i think you could i think willy wonka painted this picture of like wonderment around the factory and this innovative stuff so i think you could take that brand and create cool novel like chocolates and candies out of it um another one is if you're an ad agency could you go and actually like franchise or license the mad men uh brand for for that so basically sterling cooper draper or whatever it is jay for price say the name of their agency um you know why not why not use that if you're gonna start an ad agency versus anything else um and then i started thinking about all right where else would i go for this and i think the opportunity here is like depending on what age bracket you go for but i think the 90s had a bunch of uh brands that were famous in the 90s for our age group if you're basically 30 or 40 right now there's a bunch of brands that have like zero kind of like equity value anymore but the brand names you grew up with it so you just so it still means something to you and so we've talked about like warheads or jinko jeans yeah like a bunch of these brands and i think the move here i think one interesting play here would be you don't actually have to create the product you could create so so another idea is to create the nostalgia licensing company and all it does is it goes and buys options on these brands and then it pedals them to existing makers of products and it just says hey why don't you use we have this portfolio of nostalgic brands you could choose one of these that fits kind of your product category or whatever and you could just be the middleman basically you buy up buy cheap options on these brands and then you sell them at a kind of a retail price if you can and even if you get one or two hits i think the business could be quite profitable so that's my random ass licensing idea i went to urban outfitters the other day because there's one near my house and they had they had you know urban alfred is pretty shitty but they have like tons of old t-shirts and they it's like their their whole genre of t-shirts was things that 30 year olds saw their dads wear and and it was like t-shirts ahead like the old coors light logo the old budweiser logo i forget some of the other logos but like i pretty remember blind skateboards or world industry skateboards or independent skateboarding it kind of like transcended a popular culture i thought but they had a lot of those things um but anyway i'm on board that's amazing that bubblegum trip does that much revenue who and it's it's still owned by landry's i guess but dude it's a horrible restaurant i'm amazed at that it's like it's like an applebee's yeah well dude one of my first investors of any business i ever had was this guy who owned 12 applebee's and this guy was like you know i went to college at duke in durham which is a very pretty small city and this guy was like one of the wealthiest guys in durham and how he owned like i don't know 10 to 20 applebee's and i was like oh you could just do that and he's like yeah here's how it works i was like don't even tell me i i i don't i want to be more successful than you but i don't care i'm less successful than you is what i mean i just don't want to own 20 applebee's like that can't be the end game here i had a friend who worked on their ad agency or his ad agency won that account applebee's and they gave him a thousand dollars to go spend at applebee's and told him like to bring a friend and order just a ton of stuff so you understand it and we ordered everything and i'm a slob i eat anything and i'll eat a ton of food like six months of food yeah i'm an animal and he ordered we ordered so much stuff and i eat everything and anything and i got it in front of my plate and i was like you guys just microwaved the steak like this is a microwave it was [ __ ] awful yeah uh what do you want to talk about i just had one cool thing which was i don't know if you saw i tweeted this out yesterday but there's a video of jeff bezo so i i thought this billionaire going to space it's like elon's doing it and then you know uh jeff bezos starts blue origin and richard branson has virgin galactic and it's sort of like oh okay cool like this is you know golf for you know old white billionaires basically it's like this is something that they're playing it's just a dick measuring contest is what it is yeah it's a thing-swinging thing and so and so i was like all right well as i kind of wrote it off i was like you know i think elon was in it you know sort of first and genuinely for for a bunch of reasons um that seemed real to me but you know definitely there's an ego component to it but what was cool was i found this interview with jeff bezos from to the year 2000 so 21 years ago and amazon at this time was like six years old so it was definitely a thing but it wasn't amazon like today it was like you know it was a public company but it wasn't uh it wasn't it wasn't a juggernaut like it is now and i think they probably only had a couple of categories at that point there wasn't like prime and doing video and doing all this other stuff and he's sitting down and they're like you know so so you know what what would you want to do you know what would you do if you could do anything he's like if i could do anything yeah he's like you know i would love to explore space like space he's like yeah i would love to just explore space and you know he's like you know the space and they're like well maybe you could do it someday yeah you're a smart guy but if you put your mind to it he's like well it's hard it's really hard like but i think you could do it and he's like yeah you know it's harder than you think like we haven't made much progress for space and like in the last 20 years you know but the technology is like he's like maybe 20 years from now the technology will be there or maybe we could we could do it and then 21 years sort of to the day he's in a spaceship going you know in his own rocket company going into outer space uh so i thought that was pretty cool it made me give i had a different level of respect for it because it's more like somebody having a vision and a dream 20 years ago when it wasn't cool to talk about it or say it and then actualizing it not just sort of like copycatting elon yeah so look i think that it is like a like a like a measuring contest a pissing match but i'm all and at first you're like well that's lame these guys are so rich why don't you do something good but my opinion is this is good it's just so long-term thinking that it's actually hard to see but i do think that we're going to get good out of this and my opinion is when when rich people want to give money and they want [ __ ] named after them like a building like a hospital wing or they want to go to space and make a big deal out of it and then like maybe in 10 years we can capture some of that value of like all right they kind of paved the way at first a lot of people are like well that's [ __ ] you know [ __ ] these guys but i'm like who gives a [ __ ] that's such that's the that's the most fair trade on earth we named this building after you and you give us all this money hey i wrote your name on this yeah great thanks for the 100 mil yes it's like dude let them have that who cares if they have an ego like you get the money so like in my opinion uh we should accept it as as good although for sure bezos said something kind of stupid the other day although i do like that he said it because it was kind of funny but yeah but at the same time i'm like oh you are asking for it so adam that's not a great move so bezos flew up to space with his brother and this older woman i forget her name and a young kid i believe there was supposed to be another person on there but he had a scheduling conflict uh i swear to god that guy he had there's supposed to be someone else and there was a scheduling conflict so the guy couldn't make it and they go to space and they're up there throwing skittles at each other's face did you see that they're like doing flips bezos he's like he goes hey guys i brought skittles and he brings out a packet of skittles and he throws a skittle out one person he goes and the guy catches it in your mouth and you go and jeff goes let me try and jeff hands the kid the bag of skittles he goes throw one in my mouth and i thought that was kind of funny amazing amazing for skittles i'm surprised he's not like hey i have amazon sugar circles yeah you know i'm throwing at each other you know like our own house brand so i thought that was kind of cute funny and he lands and he says i just want to thank all of you workers at amazon as well as all you customers because you paid for this and he's he said that and i was like that's not the best way to phrase that then this morning i i shared this with you i saw a business insider article which i think is i kind of love them but at the same time i i i can't stand some of those things they write but uh jeff bezos was actually an early investor in business insider and the business insider article uh was written in such a way that it's uh it was complaining about it and it said uh um bezos's flight to space was too cramped and far too short uh oh my god and i was like oh my god you're completely like okay a couple thoughts on what you just said that was amazing first of all the couple thoughts on what you just said i hate the haters uh okay first of all dan just looked it up the person who had the scheduling conflict paid 28 million for their seat so that's kind of insane i think their dad paid for their seat or something look up this story dan tell me what what i'm missing here because wow you know how if you're gonna hate someone don't hate the billionaire who built amazon and then reinvested his money into like exploring outer space hate the trust fund kid who paid 28 million for his ticket and then and then no showed because he you know was doing a tick tock dance or something like i don't know who i don't know the story behind this but that's kind of ridiculous the um i'm so tired of people just like hating billionaires randomly i'm team billionaire is what i'm trying to say um you know people are so dumb they're like why are you wasting money on this do you know when they like do this like when you pay for when you when you fund a space company you're paying you know that money doesn't just like go into space and just vanish yeah i think has like 3 000 employees i think when he spends the money it's going into people's pockets and so it's funding jobs it's funding you know um expert technology development and a lot of great technology we have came because of what nasa did for the space program and so you know one of the silliest things is thinking that the money just somehow gets vacuumed into outer space the second thing is just don't be that guy it's not even that i'm team billionaire i'm team not the guy who's hating on billionaires all the time um this happened actually a second ago clubhouse tweeted out oh like we are open for everybody now there's no waitlist or something like that we got a new logo and all this stuff and you know i'm i'm obviously not you know the clubhouse cheerleader right so so don't get me wrong but the very first comment the top comment is uh open for everybody but you don't even have captions on the live audio so it's not open for deaf people and i'm like okay like you know fair point that it's you know it doesn't have like full accessibility but like that's the top comment that's the first comment like this company has to provide you live audio text captioning otherwise like [ __ ] them like it's just the hater culture is so annoying to me and it's so weak and spineless to be just like a you know like the top comment just like oh yeah you did this great thing but uh you know but whatever and i know that's gonna sound hypocritical because i wrote kind of like a giant thread hating on clubhouse um well it wasn't exactly hating but that's gonna be the easy criticism i wasn't trying to hate i was basically saying what i think some of the like why i think they're not gonna why it's not gonna work out the way they think some of the like strategic product problems i just wrapped it in a funny even though you you explicitly said i hope none of this comes true yeah i wanted to win i think it's cool when things win but like you know i think people are missing the boat um anyways i guess i'm just over hater culture and the easiest way to find it is go read any like response to anything that elon or jeff bezos or these people like people who are doing great things in the world and have won the game uh you know the money game they attract this like really annoying class of haters and i'd actually think you should rephrase it i'm not team billionaire what i'm team is i'm on team people who who set audacious goals and get after it do your thing if that's your thing do your thing and let me let you do your thing i'm gonna do my thing why why do i need to worry about your thing yeah i have respect for someone who says they're going to write a book this year and they write a book or someone who says they're going to lose 50 pounds and they lose 50 pounds yeah i'm on team you set what you're going to do and you actually achieve it and it just so happens that one of the big outputs of uh business is money and that's a great way to measure it but when i look at something like uh sean parker before he got involved with facebook and before he actually became wealthy sean parker started napster napster uh a lot of people well and it probably was the case it was unethical and he actually it was a it he did not succeed financially because of it i've always admired that because it was an 18 year old who just revolutionized something and totally caused a [ __ ] storm and got in the thick of it and made something interesting and so i'm in favor of people who do that and oftentimes those are people who build a hundred thousand person company called amazon but yeah so i i would actually say if you are a billionaire hater out there i think you should actually rephrase it i mean there are people who are billionaires that i think are [ __ ] awful people and i don't want them to exist but i enjoy seeing people who put their their stamp on the world and i think that's what we should celebrate not just defaulting to hate uh the way some people do yeah or you know it's just in general like how somebody else spends their money that's their that's their that's their business right like i think elon right now is living in like a 50 square foot like pop-up house or something you've seen this he's living in like a shipping container or something he sold his house he sold his cars he's living in a goddamn like 50 square foot shipping container and he uses all you know he put his entire like he whatever he made out of zip he put all he poured it all in went into debt to try to make tesla and spacex happen and like when they win you know he gets rewarded for it but even if he decided to do nothing and never work again and just wanted mansions and butlers cool that's is your money do your thing um decide you know criticizing other people for how they spend their money really all that says i wouldn't spend my money that way and i think that's a fair thing to say but i think in most cases the people who are doing this they would do they would spend their money you know in the same ways or worse and for the record if i could if i could trade spots with elon musk if someone said you could trade spots automatically and by the way you'll still be the same age that you are i wouldn't i wouldn't do it yeah not a million years would i trade spots with that guy but i think it's awesome what he's doing for him good do your thing uh all right uh here's something on the opposite end of the spectrum have you ever heard of bill's lemonade no all right so go to this website just type in bills lemonade this is a little fascinating business a friend kind of tipped me off to this and um i can't say their name because i don't know if they want their name said but basically this is this is a uh bill didn't tell me this is like a business and a box and this business does about five million a year roughly and what they do is they just sell you a kind of like a course and the materials to start your own lemonade stand not for kids but for like adults like you could start this outside of a of a concert venue or a ball game or like at your like local like neighborhood square or whatever and what they do is they basically say hey you can you can here's a business in a box if you have the ability to grab this bottle and shake it you can become a lemonade stand owner and you can make this much money here's how it works then you can download their like little brochure which shows the unit economics it's like every lemonade costs a dollar twenty to make that's your cost and you're gonna sell that for you know four dollars five dollars six dollars depending on your location so you're going to have you know 70 margins on this thing and if you could sell x many per day you're gonna make this much money and they basically just sell you this business in a box um it's a very simple business and builds lemonade on the other side they don't take any royalties or franchise fees they say you're gonna get our brand we're going to send or send you the machine the frozen you know lemonade machine the shakers the the cups the everything and uh all you do is you pay for the materials and the like information the course on how to do it and i just thought this is kind of a fascinating idea and i feel like you could do this for a whole bunch of other a whole bunch of other like industries as well like whether it's you know snow cones or ice cream trucks or pest control or something like that like i just feel like there's a whole bunch of business boxes you could make and if you did that maybe you could even roll these up into one thing which is like hey you don't want a job you want your own business it's going to get you a hundred thousand dollars a year and you'll be able to kind of control the hours you work and you're going to work for yourself are there people out there who want that trade as a franchisee yes and then basically you just say great would you like the lemonade one would you like to drive an ice cream truck would you like to do this or that and we own all these brands it's sort of like what 1 800 got junk has where they have the the trucks you can drive the franchise you could buy to be a junk hauler or the house painter or that i forgot they have like three or four of them but i feel like you could create a a mini version of what a hunter got junk with this dude this is awesome i'm looking at this and i'm trying to find um there was a guy when i started my hot dog stand there was a guy in tennessee who was doing this exact same things for hot dog stand so you'd give him five grand and he would send you everything you needed along with the state rules and things like that i need it for hot dog stands bill's lemonade is better because you could spend i don't even know what the price is like a couple hundred dollars on here and i'm looking at it now this is pretty badass you uh and these guys have been doing this forever by the way i'm looking at their website i've seen this brand a long time ago yeah this is badass and they just have like you can buy all your supplies from there i recognize these cups too by the way right i've seen the second thing at baseball games or something but yeah so i think this is kind of interesting another version of this i think you could do is in the services industry and so like here's like another one which is like let's say um corporate headshots so i once saw facebook ads and the profile picture i have for this podcast that's like kind of like when i'm trying to make this like ominous look it's because i saw a facebook ad of a really high quality headshot and a like a striking headshot and it was like i can make i can take a photo of you that will look like this like you can level up your kind of like game as far as your brand your linkedin your website whatever it is um you know it's 300 bucks and like i shoot in you know in the bay area and i i'll come do a shoot for you and you get to pick your photos whatever and i just remember thinking oh that's really smart like i've never seen facebook ads this is somebody i've never seen a photographer doing facebook ads for this but i feel like you could do the same thing here where you could basically sell somebody a business in a box that says hey um maybe maybe photos a little too high skill but you could say like any kind of like service and you could say great um you're going to be the service provider in your local area and i'm going to run the facebook ads countrywide and then whenever there's a lead for your area i'm just going to dispatch it to you and you just go fulfill it and it's a business in a box that way great you wear you wear our uniform you know you could do geek squad this way like tech help or something like that um you could do it for the thing we talked about with like setting up home uh uh home office and homes like office video studios what i would do is i would do it for taking so when we when i rented out my place so i took pictures and i put it online and i didn't get that much love and then i i went online and i found a photographer to come and take pictures for me and i paid her 200 and i got way more uh traction and my wife works at airbnb and i think she has told me i don't remember if uh who told me of i think it was her that told me that the number one uh difference between a winning airbnb and a losing airbnb is the pictures and yeah i definitely think you could have airbnb photos.com or whatever it is and that and you take 25 for every lead that you send a photographer and you could totally crush it that way right um so i like these little business of the box ideas this is like you know the opposite of the billionaire space race this is the bill's lemonade making five million dollars selling lemonade kits to people which is just cool there was this company called i cracked icracked was started by a friend of mine aj forsyth it went out either it was acquired but uh i don't think they even kept the brain anymore and what they did was they actually raised like 20 million or 30 million dollars from addressing horowitz and what icracked did was they were doing this for iphone repair and so i guess to switch a an iphone screen on your phone it takes only like a few hours of training uh anyone could figure it out if i just showed you how to do it and what they would do is they would send you leads and they would take a small cut of the charge so they would charge like 150 to fix your phone and maybe they would take 20 then in order to get leads from them you had to buy iphone parts from them and they would sell you iphone parts and they were doing something like 30 million dollars a year in ecom sales i don't know how much service revenue they're making but just selling right screens they're doing like 20 or 30 million dollars in sales for the service yeah that's crazy what do you think went wrong with the business uh i think they raised too much money and probably spent way too much money on ads i'm not sure if it was quite venture scale uh they got to like 20 or 30 million in sales and i don't know if they could figure out how to get bigger than that and they try to launch more stuff and probably lost focus good gotcha but there's other services out there that are just like them that do like 30 40 50 million dollars a year in revenue also aj my friend who's the founder he's a wild man and i think that he had like crazy aspirations of like having a drone come and drop off stuff uh like things like that and i don't know if that industry is cut out for that but i do think you could have a nice company that makes 30 or 40 in sales oh this episode of visionary's gone wrong he had a healthy business and wanted to change it to having drones drop off your iphone yeah he was also the one who like paddle boards to work every day or something right like doesn't he do something crazy like that yeah he had a small little dinghy boat like a little tiny bow i forget what they called it but it was it was it's super small like uh the small like the size of like a little baby desk but had like an engine on it and he would ride that from where's the oracle office out there uh like 20 minutes away uh i forget in california but he would write it down the bay to his office uh at south park in soma yeah i think that's awesome uh sounds like a super interesting guy i love it yeah he's crazy um all right so do are we gonna get to the episode or the yeah let's do the interview now all right so you're gonna hear uh andrew and uh let us know what you think andrew so how do you pronounce your last name gazdecki my friends call me gas gas all right go ahead sean sorry i never had a cool nickname or friends for that matter but um all right so you did that you did your like micro acquire uh funding announcement thing yesterday i'm curious does that do anything so you know we're seeing this a lot more where it's like all the famous people on twitter and tech like did something they also promoting something me and sam have been a part of a few of these um what's the result is that like meaningful or is it just like a feel-good moment or does it do anything for you yeah that's a good question i would i would say both i mean really you know the goal of that fundraise was i want to build microcore with a starter community and so just having everyone involved in that for feedback and just you know really letting everybody know that this is kind of you know something to watch um so good brand value added and then yeah we saw like 2.5 million impressions on twitter so uh for those listening micro acquire so andrew you've had a couple companies you sold one recently or like a couple years ago which was it sounds like a home run for you but micro acquire although you guys have some really big aspirations right now if we had to like kind of dumb it down it's a newsletter that people pay to get access to and that uh content is interesting startups that you've vetted and are now for sale that's like the current iteration right well it's not just a newsletter right like i go to the website i don't get the i don't even look at the newsletter it's so it's a market it's like a marketplace it's like if you want to go buy a house you go to zillow you see a bunch of houses for sale i only read the newsletter okay who's who's the normal user is it sam or me uh it sounds like you sean so it's a marketplace so you can sign up create a profile list your startup in you know literally minutes then i have a team on the back end that basically creates like a sim completely free we have a streamlined process that does that and then once you go live for people who don't know it's basically a document that outlines basic details that buyers would want to know like revenue how much time are you spending on customer support what is the tech stack who are your competitors um why are you selling asking price market opportunity just basically a pitch deck but more geared towards like i'm selling the business and uh after you go live on micro acquire you thousand uh dollars worth of subscribers so they pay like 299 dollars a year right yeah 290. uh we're like 675 1000. okay and so the i mean you have this grand vision here but in doing this you i mean there's a what did you describe it did you say zillow for startups is that how you described it once zillow framing a basically what we wanted to build yeah so what we want to build is we want to build a global and modern m a marketplace um right now the whole m a marketplace is fragmented and we're looking to consolidate it and really bring in everyone who's involved in ma transactions like when you get on the larger side you know you have investment bankers you haven't m a advisor on the lower end you have business brokers um even just people for due diligence or accounting or you know potential wealth management if you're successful in your acquisition so we're going to be really building a community of advisors that startups can hire but then on top of that we're going to build tools to make acquisitions super easy we we bought a business for somebody on here so we did a what we called a micro spec which is basically uh your idea andrew you basically tweeted it at me or something like that and i was like this is a great idea what we did was we said hey let's put up five grand and um into a holding of blank shell company so we put give five grand to an entrepreneur and then we'll find them a business to buy on microacquire we'll go vet 50 deals 100 deals and we'll go find a business for them to buy and we'll go buy a micro business and then other people thought that was such a cool idea that somebody was like oh i'm in for five i'm in for five i'm in f and all of a sudden we had a hundred grand i think the the total amount was like 85 to 100 grand that we ended up raising from random people on twitter uh to help this entrepreneur daniel buy his first business and said like he was going gonna go get a job and then it's like okay instead you can um you can buy this shopify app that's producing revenue that's profitable today and uh and let's go go buy this thing and so that's what we ended up doing which i think is pretty cool and that experiment is uh is still running so the transaction closed he's figuring out ways to grow it he's sending his little like investor updates it's awesome and i feel i i called it at the time i said this is like when you go to buy like cake mix and it's like just add water this is a like just add hustle here's a business it's here's the code's already written the business already running the revenue's already there and all you need to do is grow it and you just need to add that hustle in to to grow this thing yeah and we did we actually did one with the hustle and we gave and we did the same thing i don't remember who came first but we did the same thing and the guy who won it is a dentist here in new york and he's offering to give me free braces as a thank you do you need racism yeah i'm still working with him on uh finding a business he's um he's being pretty picky but uh we'll get we'll get something good but um yeah he's good to be picky he was like you want to come in for a teeth cleaning retainer braces let me know i would love to thank you he's awesome we've been chatting um almost weekly just going over businesses he's interested in i give my opinion and most of them are like no that one's like too complex or something like that um but sean i want to talk about that that deal that we did you have no [ __ ] idea how much work that was like i literally had to get notarized like 50 emails come through dude we did it legit um like like you know we formed a new inc so a new corporation to purchase and transfer the assets into uh we you know created stock agreements for 20 plus investors so this was harder than the fundraise that i i just did by a mile and uh it took like three weeks the legal bill for me was like 15k and i spent like 60 [ __ ] hours it was totally worth it um dan is amazing i immediately maybe it sounds sounds like it might not be worth it well well here's the thing is it opened my eyes to a new opportunity for microacquire as well which is there's all these amazing operators that don't have capital but again there's so many businesses on microwave that you know they're built by builders they aren't looking to scale the business they're not familiar with sales and marketing and so we see an opportunity to potentially allow them to raise capital from other investors just like we did with dan like microspac specs are kind of getting a bad name so we might need to rebrand on that um but yeah so like if you're if you're like you own an agency and you see a product for two million bucks and you have tens of thousands of customers you can easily sell this product to we allow you to basically present that to other investors inside microwave and this is just like a napkin idea this isn't like a guaranteed thing but streamlining that whole process that we went through sean like that i think could be a really really interesting opportunity and we're thinking about that a little bit by the way the the thing you're describing is like it's basically what angelus did so angelus was like great we're a marketplace to connect uh startups and investors and they started by doing that and then they were like okay cool what else can we do well startups need employees so we'll create a jobs division and then they're like well some of these entrepreneurs want to be investors but they're not investors they don't have the ability to raise capital you know it's very hard to raise a fund okay we'll create like rolling funds and we'll create spvs it will create one-click ways for now you to invest instead of just being an entrepreneur and so they created what's called a market network which is basically people have heard of a network network's just a bunch of like let's say let's say there's 10 dots on the screen and they're connected by like little lines that's a network and all the dots do their own thing and a market network is where it's ten dots on a screen and there's lines connecting all of them but there's money signs going in between each right so like on facebook you transfer likes to each other you transfer comments to each other messages but on angel angellist when you hire someone for a job you give them money when you invest in somebody you give them money when you uh raise money from it for your rolling fund somebody's giving you money and so there's every transaction instead of just being a message is money and so if you've never heard this concept before uh it's a pretty important one and in terms of business go research market networks james courier and the nfx team write a lot about this they're kind of the only ones i see writing about this but i think it's a pretty important idea and then once you know oh there's such a thing as a market network then when you see a business that's structured as a market network you know it's a good opportunity either to start it or to invest in it that's why i invested microquire because i was like oh this is a this is a market network great i've been looking for market networks to invest in this is a good one um yeah so i just wanted to kind of throw that little theory in if nobody knows that that term and one of the reasons why we wanted you to come on andrew was um i want to hear about the micro acquire story but i want to hear particularly two things in this order the first is i want you to go through some of the coolest startups that you have sold or are selling on the platform some of the insights that you've gotten from them and and and things like that and then also what we should talk about at the end is you sold your last company for like 20 uh maybe 30 or 40 million dollars i forget the exact amount like a a pretty significant amount and life-changing amount and you you you told me some crazy stuff that you did with the money i would definitely want to talk about that but can we start with that one i want to i want to hear that one so yeah so before micro car you start a company you sell it for ball parkish give me a range uh or rhymes with 30 million how do you describe this let's just assume i have you know low eight figures i i candidly don't like to specifically say how much i sold my company for i think it's a weird flex and it's hard to do without feeling like you're bragging so let's just peg it at low eight figures but um yeah the story there i started a company in college i was 21 it was a no code app builder so it was a sas company uh only raised a hundred thousand dollars for that business ran it for about eight years grew it to over 10 million in recurring revenue employees was over a hundred there's a lot of moving parts of that business um those people overseas yeah so how do you have 100 employees or you weren't making a lot of profit and you're underpaying people yeah so it was it was a mixture of both not underpaying people but we probably half the team was in-house so our entire engineering team was probably overseas um but the way it started was again i'm not a technical founder at all i don't know to write code at all and when i tell people that they they're kind of like wait what um but i was in chico and there's no engineers in chico but i just went on upwork i previously had a job board before that that i also sold and that was a seed money for business apps but found just randomly found an engineer in china his name was raymond chester i'm still friends with him today and he was just a badass like he could have been a cto at a silicon valley company and i paid him well treated him well i consider him like a brother and considering i didn't know how to hire other engineers or spot good engineers i knew how to manage and that's one tip for people that aren't technical is you know i always recommend don't learn how to code learn how to manage engineers properly and so i ended up just hiring all his friends so we ended up having like a house for them and they had like 20 engineers in china and we had engineers in uh russia we had one and we had a group we had a qa team in the ukraine um so you're a big big communist fan i i guess you could say so i mean not not by design but you know we we did not discriminate yeah was your customer service based out of cuba or what no no so customer service was in-house but we did have 24 7 customer service so we had some customer support reps in brazil france um some other some other areas but all right so let's just fast forward to the good bits so you you build the business and it's good 10 million in recurring revenue you you decide to sell it why did you decide to sell it and then how did you sell it um so i was so initially i i tried selling it when i was 26 i hired an investment bank and this kind of leads into microwave as well we did you know full road show um ended up getting an offer for 30 million ended up turning turning down that offer we also had an offer from a strategic company one of the you know big do yourself website companies you could probably guess it i was young i felt i still had gas in the tank and so i wanted to push for you know a larger exit after we went through that process i just kept running the business kept growing the business kept staying focused on executing which is the number one way to really sell a business is have a good business so went back to you know executing with my team and then uh just started getting tired that's the short answer or just you know managing that many people monday comes around it's like hey can we talk it's like i get it like you wanna switch jobs like please just you can just email me like i'll write your reference like i love you like like please i don't need to hear like you know we're good or like i'm sick you know it just became so much management and i love you know building businesses and the ideation stage the way the transaction went down was uh the private equity firm esw capital had previously reached out to us i think it was like five years ago or something like that like prior to the investment bank and i know this because during due diligence we had to share all the ndas that we had signed and i found them from usw capital i was like oh we've met before nice to meet you again uh you know let's uh let's see if we can make this happen they gave me fantastic terms it was an all-cash transaction uh we did a stock purchase so i benefited from qsbs which if you're looking to sell a business look up qsbs you pay zero federal taxes on up to the first 10 million so i saved i don't know what i saved i gotta ask my accountant but um i actually didn't even know about qsb as well if you're i had qsbs if you're in california uh it's uh about 15 so 15 on 10 million you save 1.5 million dollars or it might be even a little bit more but around one and a half million dollars in savings no it's actually 20. i think it's more 20. so i saved like 2 million on taxes and i paid 13. well yeah you're my bad i i'm an idiot i totally i picked the wrong the wrong one i forgive you sean i i'm calling you the wrong name on purpose man because you butchered my name levels to that joke got you back got you back um but anyways um so we structured a really favorable deal for me so we had two million cash on hand which we added on to the purchase price so we had an agreed purchase price and i said i want a stock deal no earn out i'd love for you to buy the cash and the reason for buying the cash is they buy it um basically they just put a 1x multiple on to the purchase price and so typically if you are required you have 2 million cash in the bank account that is dividend back out to shareholders and you're st you're taxed at 40 so we got qsbs on that 2 million cash um quick transition in terms of me leaving the business so i was out of the business in 90 days that's great and what'd you do uh you said you know you bought a house uh what what's the mindset so you go from basically before that how much money did you have because you were just paying yourself a salary out of the business right like you didn't sound like you had you were at serious selling tvs it's not like you had a bunch of money before that you're running the business you're probably paying yourself some salary but probably nothing fancy and then all of a sudden you come into a bunch of money so describe that transition and what you did what you did with it yeah so i i was okay before the acquisition i i was buying ethereum at like 20. i remember like the day ethereum came on the coinbase and the etf was coming out like approval denial and i was like bitcoins going down let's just move it into this new thing called ethereum so i bought a bunch of ethereum so i had like let's just call like you know high six figures so i wasn't like paying debt you know as soon as we got acquired but right when you go through an acquisition you have a closing date and we had a circle closing date and then all of a sudden this gigantic amount of money just hits your bank account and you're like what the [ __ ] did i just do that was my feeling i was actually kind of scared i was like is this legal like did i just sell drugs like that like you know some people like think like you just celebrate and you're like like i i made it like yeah so i was like the opposite i was like you know kindly i was like chain smoking like a jewel i was like oh holy [ __ ] this is insane you know because you know i grew up poor like you know my dad died when i was six i grew up in detroit i moved to san clemente when i was you know like five i grew up knowing like what it's like to like really struggle for money so going from like that to like an absorbent amount where you know i'm not flying private or anything like that like i'm not like balling like some other people you guys talk to but i'm comfortable like i was seth like i can literally buy a house cash i could you know put money into something really boring and just you know watch it grow over time so it was a life-changing moment but my reaction was holy [ __ ] this is insane and i hope you know they don't come back and say hey we found something wrong yeah and the business when i did my deal when we did my deal i remember i called the bank ahead of time and i let them know i'm like there's going to be like a big deposit and i don't want you to think that like i'm doing something illegal like is there like a check mark you need to put next to this like i called you i told you like this is normal and they're like no like it's fine and they're like how much do you expect to come in and i remember being on the phone i like i whispered it i was like i didn't want anyone to hear i'm like it's like uh around this number and they're like i can't hear you and i remember saying it again and i had and i whispered a little bit more and and i i it was uncomfortable i was like this is kind of weird uh saying this and they're like yeah that shouldn't be a problem at all and i'm like well you you don't sound impressed like yeah sam i i i did this thing for a minute um so the the first thing i did was um i hired a wealth manager to move all the money out of my bank account he just bought bonds i knew nothing about bonds and then all of a sudden i'm like why is there more money and they're like yeah that's how bonds used to work at least um but when i went in to wire the money so my office was in la jolla in san diego it's kind of like the beverly hills of san diego um the guy was like this is the biggest wire i have ever done like can we triple triple triple triple quadruple check this and i was like really like la jolla like there's like 10 million dollar houses everywhere it's like yeah this is the biggest one like i'm nervous and so we wired that over it's a lot of money but what i used to do i i was i was just gonna say one other funny thing i do i would go in i this is kind of like a like a lame move but i used to go into the bank a few times before that wire and i'd pull out like a 20 bill i'd be like hey can i get like 20 bucks out just so they can see my account like like yeah i just need 20 bucks and then they look they and i come in looking like this i'm like 29 because i was 29 when i sold the business so like you know i'm gonna do some immature stuff like i'm not gonna be a professional like you know and i i i um you know i i hadn't been married i didn't have a kid at the time so you know it it it was party time at that at that moment um so yeah i'd go into the bank and be like hey were you like i was gonna say similarly we had uh this guy james hong who created hot or not on the podcast he said the same thing he goes i used to go to an atm machine and just put my card in and say print balance and just look at it and he's like i would just do that like every day for like the first like in know week that that it happened and just he just wanted to print out the balance on his little paper rip it up and then like go about his day he just made him happy so on this podcast we've had a lot of really we've had a lot of really successful people we've had some people who have sold things for over a billion dollars we've had people who have sold things for hundreds of millions of dollars we've had people who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars this is all a huge amount of money but i have found myself when we talked to these incredibly we just had darmesh on the podcast and i was like dumbass isn't it crazy i could see your lick your hubspot shares you know right now you're worth like 900 million dollars that's wild and um so you kind of like get in this bubble of like oh yeah it's like you know uh 20 10 million whatever 30 million whatever the numbers are we're like oh that's like you know that's a nice start you know but then like when you when you think about one person having that amount of money particularly when they're young when they're 29 um that's it that's a that i ran the math here they had a friend that sold his company and he's uh 32 now and he's got over 50 million dollars liquid and i was like dude this is crazy that you have this and we did some research and we found out that there's like 600 americans uh who have that much money or more who are also around that same age it's like dude that's crazy you're like one of the you know almost top 500 richest young people in america that's a an astounding amount of money and that's kind of like what you had andrew it it's an astounding thing and you talk about like well i can't play private uh you can't fly private but it's like yeah yeah yeah you can you really can i mean you're like incredibly wealthy if you have that amount of money at a at that young of an age the age factor is a really big deal here i i agree because i mean so moving in do you guys want to hear what i bought i told you i'd share it so the first thing my friends call me kind of like um like like a white rapper kind of guy like i love hip hop like i love fast cars i love big houses yeah detroit man if it wasn't eminem it'd be me um so i bought a big-ass house cash um 2.5 million uh san mateo right on the golf course i see like literally deers running around in my backyard um and i recommended that to you sam cause it's like it's you work so hard and when you come from nothing just having i wanted something that i could just be proud of like you come over and you're like damn you don't get this with a regular job and i'm like yeah you don't you need to start a business and i'm happy to talk to you about that because that's like all i talk about is startups and stuff like that um and then also for my wife just for you know supporting me through the years and you know we wanted to start a family so um bought a beautiful home uh and then i bought a c63 amg like you sam but i bought a older one for the yeah badass car uh for the naturally aspirated end it was my second one um i wanted just like a newer one with less miles um and that's that's all i bought um that's pretty that's pretty much it just and then i put the rest into uh just like really boring index funds like vanguard dimensional um i don't i barely angel the yes i got a black mercedes uh black amg mercedes i think technically mine is faster than yours just but i looked i looked it up oh my god but they're both cool they're both cool i got a house i didn't get nearly as fancy but a nice house and then i also put almost every single thing into a vanguard total market index fund and sean and a few other people just mercilessly like kind of kind of mock me like if they don't mock me like sean kind of rolls his eyes he's like why aren't you taking risks and i'm like i don't know this seems pretty risky so you and i are the same uh same type of thing i don't know why shawn and all these guys we hang out with i don't know why they like buy stocks all the time i'm like what are you doing like what i don't even know how to like what do you mean dude it's fun it's the real world casino uh you know like whatever you got to have some fun with it i've never sold a stock and i don't and these guys are doing it like every day sharing their screenshots and i'm like you're nuts i think that's nutty i i guess i guess my view is like what what more money do you need like the way i view it and if you do the math like you know 10 marker returns compounded for 40 years sell when you're 70 you're set like you're going to be bawling when you're seven you're going to be like rich like like you're going to die with that money and so like for me i don't like checking the stock market i don't care to i don't want to understand it um i no longer own any bitcoin or ethereum like i have the most boring investment strategy so people listening to this that are like in real estate or you know stocks or probably like this kid's an idiot but i like waking up without any money problems i don't have a mortgage i don't care if my stock portfolio goes down like it's just there until i'm 70 it's a set plan i'm not deviating from it but i guess for me money buys like just peace of mind like i just i have no worries and so you know tying in the micro choir it's like i'm comfortable taking big swings because you know i have a win under my belt um comfortable with everything i have i have no material wants it outside the lamborghini uh urus i'd take that if i could afford it or actually get it approved by my wife um who's a very very uh cost uh conscientious italian um but other than that i mean you know just love building businesses and that's all i focus on and that's i think that's the key sam is like you know when you go boring it allows you to focus on what you're really really good at rather than trying to like manage stocks like investing in startups like what's crypto doing today like who's this new i don't know whatever yeah it's it's like zuckerberg zuckerberg wearing the same gray shirt every day he just removed one whole thing he needs to think about which is like fashion how i look what i'm gonna wear or how i'm gonna dress that day and just lets his brain focus on the one thing he wants it to focus on that day so i wanted to ask you i want to wrap this up because uh we're gonna basically use this as like kind of half the episode than half the episode's gonna be a different riff but i wanted to ask you because you're seeing a bunch of businesses on mic require every day what um you know this is the podcast of business ideas what ideas or niches or spaces are you seeing interesting things give us two or three ideas that people should be looking at or spaces that people could be building in that you see opportunity um that you would do if you were kind of like you know 22 again or whatever yeah definitely well first i'm going to take the cop out answer and i would start with something you're passionate in i think that's huge like if you're not passionate about it there's someone who is and they're gonna just beat you but i think what's really opened my eyes about microchoir every day i wake up and i get to see the most interesting startups i was telling um someone earlier today like there was a rabbit breeding company for farmers to track like when they make other rabbits or something like that make like a million a year or something like that like super niche and profitable and i'm like and it's a sas business it's legit um probably not like the bet i would not recommend buying that business it's not for me but it just is an example of just how broad i think the future of of the small business economy is going to be online digital and profitable people who used to want to start like a restaurant or like a plumbing business or something like that those young entrepreneurs are going to be looking to start a niche sas company or a niche e-commerce company like categories that we see a lot of activity in are obviously shopify sas applications lots of communities even newsletters like kind of everything online and like it goes as deep as like we sold this company that was a marketing automation platform for just specific types of dentists and they were making an absorbent amount of profit sold within like a couple weeks but that's kind of where i think things are going is we're going to have a few really really large companies you know ventures going in to you know tons of tons of different companies and we're going to see just probably a handful of winners is my guess and then we're going to see a long tail and the tan calculating that someone put this out where um you know you have a 2.5 chance of becoming a unicorn when you raise venture capital so those are my odds i'd probably increase it to 20 just with my my luck my friends call me gazlock that's another nickname i have um but for the other 97.5 percent there's microacquire you know if you build a business and you know you want to sell for you know a small but life-changing amount you're not getting a tech wrench you can do that but yeah trends just very very niche very very focused i think is the key and those are the businesses i get most excited about and then if you're looking to buy a business there's a ton that just are built by really really talented engineers great for acquirers i'm seeing tons of those and then also for people that are experiencing sales and marketing you want to just like we did with dan shawn where we just let's hustle on this thing and try to grow it that's also a huge opportunity let's name a few specific ones you have this one started by this guy named arson nurmagomedov i know how to say that last name because khabib khabib khabib nurmagomedov i didn't realize that that was a common last name um but so this is a b2b saw or can you actually talk about this i'm looking at the email a b2b software company corporate gifting i don't even know what that is 20 million in arr 3 million in profit it looks like right am i reading this right yep yeah so all those are private so i can't name the names the one that what you're viewing at the top is a podcast that i did so um arson sold rest pack for half a million on micro require in about a month i believe it was like a developer api tool there's over a thousand plus startups on my require right now so i i don't have my i'm not that smart my memory is not that good but uh keep going yeah no i just oh i i i'm looking at one of the ones you had listed here on this idea sheet i guess so that one wasn't one that you sold so i just want to hear about a specific one a a few specific ones that you've sold as well as like maybe a few specific ones where you saw this you're like oh my gosh i could have i should have started this company or like this is amazing i i if people knew that these types of things they existed they would totally be starting things like this okay so i'll talk about the ones that i know i have permission to talk about one um was a company called uh push engage it sold to um an individual named sied he runs a firm called also motive and he basically is doing a wordpress type roll-up and he looks for yeah we've talked about we've talked about wpbeginner on here a bunch so it's yeah awesome guy that acquisition was in the seven figures that went closer than like she had moved fast i don't close in like two weeks or something like that i don't i don't know the exact details but um the founder was happy ced was happy um another one would be median which sold for a quarter million 300 i don't know the exact amount of the time i had but it's basically like a live chat video tool so if you log on to a website instead of going to like crisp chat like this intercom button i'm seeing right here you can just click it and then like my video pops up and you're like hey like and then i can take control of your this was probably my favorite business because you can you know add it for sales teams support teams and anytime someone has any questions and it was they had really really large enterprise agreements with some big big names that i can't say because they're under nda but public companies that you would recognize and that one was interesting another one the marketing automation platform for dentists that one sold really fast um i did another one with um a company called xmark clock which is like a time management solution for construction workers and the guy was based in europe and he sold for over half a million again in less than 30 days um all cash transaction i'm just trying to think of the podcast that i've done there i mean there's so there's so many so it sounds to me like i think what people should do is if you end up going on micro choir i've done this in a couple of different platforms uh basically you can learn a lot just by checking out the different businesses so even if you're not ready to buy uh get the premium subscription or whatever so you can read the like actual details about the businesses and that's like a you know like a 300 mba that you can give yourself because you're going to discover all these different niches the patterns you're gonna see which businesses sell for more which businesses sell quickly and it'll really shape your thinking so that's kind of my recommendation whether if you're buying obviously you know it's a no-brainer but even if you're not buying i think this is a great way to learn i've done this i've looked at probably 200 online businesses for sale just with the only intention of like learning yeah and um and that's that's how my brain just sort of collects a bunch of data so i would recommend doing that um but we should we should wrap it here because we're gonna have to do one more segment after this but uh andrew thanks for coming on man thanks uh best of luck with mark require excited to to be on board with this thing and uh yeah thanks for thanks for sharing the story i think people are gonna dig it yeah i appreciate you guys having me on and uh yeah zillow for m a coming up appreciate you guys uh supporting sweet thank you i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to let's travel never looking back

when we think of entrepreneurship and we think of starting stuff we think how can i be innovative how can i be new in reality in order to make a lot of money it's how do i get locked into this to to the point to where like it's gonna be a pain in the ass to go anywhere else i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right everyone we've got a good episode we're going to talk about class ring the class ring business shockingly brings in close to a billion dollars a year for a company that you might have heard of but we're going to do a breakdown of them um what else is it we're going to talk about stretching gyms i'm a huge fan of paying 100 and going to the stretch lab we're going to break that business down what else we gonna talk about we talk about the business of ephemeral tattoos so tattoos that only last year this is a trend that i'm watching and uh and we talked about some some of the pod stuff how we're looking at youtube how uh how we're thinking about content right now and then last but not least we talk about a couple businesses that are interesting kind of google google based businesses i call them couch cushion businesses because it's like these little things in the cracks that you that you don't really you don't really once you go look in the couch cushion you you find some money but um you don't really think about these and some of them are scam some of them are not we talk about those at the end yeah in my opinion most of them are scams and we actually do a breakdown of them around the 50th minute of this podcast so wait till the end and we'll get to it you'll love it talk soon did you see did you listen to the episode that i released today or today's monday uh it's uh did you listen to that no what is it so i consumed like eight or nine like pretty interesting pieces of content last week or and i talked about four or five of them did you see this guy named ben moula who i talked about no who's that okay so ben moolah i put it in the doc if you've heard the monday episode today this is a little bit of a repeat but i cannot stop watching this guy he's this big old fat guy like 400 pounds fat because he's probably like 6'3 and he's disgusting he's like smoked cigarette and he like looks like he smells and he like always hits people like on the back real hard he's just gregarious and in your face and on the surface he appears like incredibly dislikable and cocky and i love him he turns out to be he seems pretty quite charming and he's a real estate tycoon down in south florida and all he does yeah should i google this guy ben moolah yeah all the photos of him like it's just it's an immediate turn off but then you like get into the videos and he's been he's basically he's like a successful guy who's now just starting to do youtube he's probably in his mid-50s and so he's not like a youtuber who you know he's he's does it the right way where he's successful and now he's doing youtube very fascinating i can't stop watching this guy you see what he looks like yeah so he's a ben mala is his name so uh he looks like um what's joe rogan's friend's name joey joey diaz he looks like joey diaz does real estate joey diaz moves to uh florida and does real estate and he he wears like gaudy clothes and he's sitting there smoking marlboros outside of like a ramada inn or like a holiday inn that he's about to buy for 20 million dollars but then he gets into like a 500 000 bentley and so it's like a really funny juxtaposition really interesting guy great advice on real estate in business nice very fun youtube you'll have to start watching this guy he's brilliant i'm gonna subscribe he's beautiful and that's actually what we need to do with our podcast our podcast actually i'm gonna i gotta figure out how to do this we need to become a youtube channel that happens to have a pod do you know what i mean yes i know what you mean uh explain why you say that though so for one i'm just i've been a youtube fan for five years i've been a paying subscriber and it's my life if it's not on you like i don't i only watch youtube um including youtube tv though which is basically which is tv but so that's a little cheating but the discover ability is so good and i've been watching gary tan's video you know gary tan yeah yeah i he's wonderful i don't think his content is any better than us but i think it's packaged better than us for sure and there's a lot to learn from that and i think that whenever i see a video he he does i'm like oh man i totally could have done that he just packaged it in such a wonderful way and the discovery of discoverability on youtube is significantly better than podcasts for sure and um it's just more fun it's more fun to watch a youtube video and like i don't know if we have it kind of skewed because we're able to um we have youtube red or whatever the premium thing is called so we were able to go in the background and basically make it a podcast whenever we want i think for a lot of people they don't pay for that thing uh so that's probably the main difference but once you pay for that youtube is just amazing it's so good yeah we need to make that shift i'm gonna work on that this week actually and then one last quick update one thing that i'm trying to do that i've actually done for the last tell me what you think about this i've done that for the last five or six days and i didn't mean to do it at first but now i don't want to break it i've walked around twenty thousand steps a day for the last about five six days what are you using to track it well just my iphone so i was using the health app then i downloaded like a uh what's it called the peta what's the uh anyway i downloaded an app for it gotcha and it's awesome a pit pedometer that's what it is a pedometer it's awesome have you ever walked have you ever tried to do like 10 to 15 000 a day bro walking that is walking is the new running no uh i don't know i've i've never really liked step counters i always found them to be like kind of underwhelming so for example i was like you know like i've got like a fitbit or whatever the first one of the early ones of those were and i hit 10 000 steps on what i felt like was a very lazy day and immediately in my head i was like oh this is for like old sedentary people and uh i can't use this as like a barometer of success for me but you're really fit and you seem to care that you hit 20 000 steps who cares right isn't like an hour of intense exercise really what you want and not 20 000 steps yes and no so there's pros and cons so the con is that for walking the amount that i'm walking it takes forever like three hours just three hours of straight walking uh some regards that's a pro because it's fun to be out there and seeing stuff i'm in a new place exploring so it's fun but the pro is also uh so basically if you run 10 miles that will like if you run 10 miles really fast that will take you 60 minutes right if you walk 10 miles that's gonna take you three four hours but you can actually burn the same amount of calories doing it which is kind of interesting right it takes the same amount of energy to move your body that distance but when you walk that much you don't get that hungry the problem whenever i run a lot or whenever i workout a lot i get really hungry and i out eat the calories that i consumed with walking i haven't done that i don't i don't i'll eat the calories um like i don't get starving so it's been like a really easy way to slim down anyway i just thought i thought i'd bring that up you want to get into it uh yeah let's do it all right which one you want to go with first jostens right actually you just on your random life updates so two things on that uh one i don't know where this came from but over the weekend i guess you were talking about step counting and i was just remembering there's this little clip i watched on youtube from the office about when dwight gets a standing desk i don't know if you watch the office but you've never seen this do you i don't know if you remember this probably not it's pretty obscure but a deaf dude i mean i'm like i'm a normal 30 year old that i've i could quote every single option right so so dwight gets a standing desk and like everybody who gets a standing desk like it's like awesome for 15 minutes and then you start doing the thing where like you're on one foot while you're like kind of letting the other foot like chill for a second you're like stretching out your ankle and then you're doing the other side and you're kind of like squatting a little bit because you're tired of standing and um and they're basically like oh wow dwight at first he's like [ __ ] on everybody like oh you're sitting you know this is here he goes i feel like i'm working in a suicide cult like because you guys are all deciding to sit and um and so then they like turn the tables on when they know he's getting tired and they're like dwight um wow i can't believe you you've made such a great decision you're for sure gonna just do this forever right like there's no way you go back on this right and he's like of course not but he's like secretly like fatiguing really hard from the standing desk and uh anyway so they sort of like guilt shame them and he like ends up with this um little like like hidden stool in his pants so that he can like stand uh he can like sit while he's like pretending to stand um and so that reminds me of the step counting thing which are these like little phases that everybody goes through and where you're just like you know what i need st i need to i need to hit my ten thousand steps like i feel like everybody has this phase of their life where they like get into that they buy the device they do the thing for a bit then they like get off of it most people do at least but anyways the reason i say this is over the weekend i was supposed to be working because i got back from this trip and i supposed to be working and instead i was just watching a bunch of content i was watching um you know you know aaron sorkin so i was like yeah i mean the famous director yeah writer uh you know kind of like i don't know if he's producer director or writer but all three maybe he he created west wing newsroom uh the social network movie and he's like amazing he's brilliant he's known for his dialogue so i was just kind of like trying to branch out trying to learn about what is how do you even write dialogue what is that what makes it great why is this guy so much better than everybody else so i was watching a bunch of his videos where he talks about how he does it and it really made me want to write a tv show and not to like make a tv show or make a career out of it but i just want to write one episode and so i decided i'm going to write an episode of the office and i'm going to release it so that's my challenge for this next 30 days in the next 30 days i'm gonna write an episode and it's just gonna be text and it's gonna be i'm just gonna steal all the characters from the office and uh i'm gonna see what i can do and i think this is gonna be a lot of fun and i'm gonna release it to uh anybody who i guess follows me on twitter on my newsletter or something like that my prediction is that it will at worst be mildly good i think you're good i think you're good at it i i think it'll be good right so like that's the beginner part of it but i think i could be i'm also like i think you could i think i'm like cocky about it i feel like i can do a good job did you ever read uh this guy ross wrote an episode of silicon valley so this guy he used to he was an early facebook employee he's the creator of mozilla the browser uh yeah or firefox or whatever uh oh no his name's blake i think blake ross yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so he went he he just like for fun wrote an episode of uh silicon of the silicon valley hbo show and it's amazing if if if you've never read this you should definitely google this and read it it's and you if you watch the show when you read it it's like as good as a normal episode of the show it's crazy and so i was very inspired by that i was like man what a what a polymath right like the guy can create a browser early facebook employee and is just able to like write a screenplay basically on his first try which was i thought incredible i think you're i think at worst it's going to be pretty mildly good i think at best you could actually have a home run that's my prediction for how how this is gonna be and uh so today's july 19th you now have now you're on the ball well well no let's do august the end of august august what is there twenty day how many days are there 31 days all right you have to august 31 and then uh now you're on the hook and in general i'm thinking about content like okay content strategy because i'm kind of like i haven't been posting much on twitter or anything like that and i feel like once i started getting really into twitter i just noticed all the other kind of like twitter thread want to be people like me out there who were just like doing the same thing it was really a turn off like i enjoyed doing it and i enjoyed the results of it that's what i told you i hated that everybody else was doing it made me feel like such a schmuck uh i felt like you know going to a club in order and then being like you need to get a table if you want into this club it's like oh okay here's my credit card i guess i'll pay a thousand times what the bottle costs like that that was the i felt like a big chump the first time i did bottle service and the second time i felt like a chump in life was when i was doing twitter threads of you know generic business advice like everybody else and so now i think i'm gonna go i'm gonna zig and zag the opposite direction where i'm just gonna go with like i'm gonna do a few like what i think are pretty badass pieces of content that are extremely challenging for me and if they flop they flop but i'm gonna like go ham on them like i'm gonna you know like i'm gonna write a rap song or i'm gonna write a screenplay i'm gonna like like try to create something that's like much more uh intense and possibly awesome i i think you're right and i'm gonna take credit because i wrote about this and i talked on this podcast about this about six or seven months ago i was like these threads are killing me i think longer form blog posts are going to be coming because everyone's like i want to start a newsletter i want to get popular on twitter i'm like all right great do that i actually think that there could be a bigger opportunity to create a more in-depth blog post i i have i had a i have a feeling that this is kind of what humans are craving at the mo or like this is like uh i don't know what people are craving i mean i think every type of content will always release one tenth as much content but have it be ten times as good and because of that stand out from the crowd and have more fun like because i'm not like constantly just doing quick hits i'm like trying to do great work each time which i think is harder but more fun maybe something that i've been thinking about is related to content because i i ask myself all the time about how you can i like repackaging content there's a few things that i've always been interested in content so there's this thing with email so a lot of people think of email as like 2 300 words that you can fit in there or whatever i forget what the space is it's a certain megabyte space but you should actually think of it like i'm just going to make these numbers up these aren't right it's 150 megabytes and it just so happens that 250 200 2 500 words is 150 megabytes but what else can you tell that story and there's some interesting technology that i've tinkered with and we've never gotten to it the hustle but i think we should so you can actually host a gif on your own server and this might change with apple's new update but you can make it so when you send someone an email you can have like a 30 second gif on there and a gif is basically a video with text which is the same thing as instagram without sound right it's the same thing and what about what i've always wanted to do was to put that on there and then have a part one and then you tell at the end of the part one at the end of the 20-second thing you said all right now hit refresh and you actually hit refresh and part two shows up on your interesting and i've always wanted to do things like that like i think that's an interesting medium i think that could like be hacked and be and you could have a really really cool storytelling yeah i think so i i would suggest someone try that on email it is possible like it's technically possible to do that and i think that could be really cool another thing is i've always asked if you were using twitter for a longer form blog post what would it look like if you had a blog post on twitter that was something like 500 tweets long right um i've been thinking about like what would like how do you hack the how do you hack the rules yeah that's kind of interesting to me um anyway all right let's look at it okay so that's my content uh i'm putting my stake in the ground i'm announcing it publicly so now i'm committed to having to do it do you want to talk about let's talk about stretching labs or stretching gyms can we talk about that yeah let's do it because you were talking about walking this is actually where i was going to transition to which is kind of like the slow exercise movement so i was working out with somebody who's i think they're 41 and i was like they're your former bodybuilder and i was like so um you know so like what's it yeah what's what are you working on nowadays you're trying to get like shredded or like build muscle what's the he's like bro just function i was like what and you've been talking about the super mobility training he's like i have a personal trainer he's like he's like he pointed at the bench press and pointed at the like kind of like the stretching table and it was like i want to spend more time there not there um and i was like interesting and and by the way i woke up with like massive shoulder pain today so i'm all about it right now but um i noticed there's a trend so i have this this is my segment called trend watching i got two trends today so trend watching the first one is stretching labs i never really heard of this but there's gyms that dedicated to stretching i don't know if you've ever been to one one is called yeah one is called stretch lab it's a franchise i think they have like 1000 locations in just like five years or something crazy like that so definitely like franchising pretty hardcore nationwide and then there's another one um i like the name of this one stretch relief which is kind of like stress relief and it's based in new york and uh it was like a physical place where then with covered now they do like online whatever but i'm kind of into this you so place you go and you're not it's not yoga it's not pilates it's like it's not cycling it's not spin class it's not uh you know high intensity training it's another one stretching and like i just think there's a market for all of these what do you think about this you've definitely thought about mobility and stretching a lot i am obsessed with stretching i stretch a ton i download all types of different apps because i enjoy trying them all but i stretch on a consistent basis you're like trying to do the splits and stuff right yeah yeah like i work really hard at it and i like study different types of stretching the only type or one of the very few types of stretching that's proven to work i forget exactly what it's called but basically it's this idea where if you want to stretch your hamstring um like in a split let's say you're doing the front switch and you want to stretch your hamstring you actually need to push down for 10 seconds really hard so you're you're you want your hamstring to flex for 10 seconds and then you release and that allows you to stretch even further i don't it does something with the brain i don't entirely understand how it works but i've read a lot of studies and it's one of the few proven ways and so i've been obsessed with that i've gone to stretch lab it's a hundred dollars i've did it in san francisco and in austin totally totally fun totally worth it i loved it i've been trying to go in brooklyn where i'm staying now i can't find a place that does this i'm completely on board with this i've also tried to buy different stretching machines stretching machines have always fascinated me because stretching is one of the few exercises where you don't actually have to put that much effort into it and to get results like someone can kind of do it to you it's not like with running where it's just like i gotta put all the effort like i can just kind of be numb and someone can do it and so there's split machines where you can do side splits and you like sit in this thing and you crank this wheel and your legs open up that's okay that's that's fine but what i've been looking for is front machines and different types of stretching machines i have found close to nothing and so at my gym in my house i was thinking about buying a set of wenches like a winch like it goes on the be on the on a jeep to like pull a cord i was gonna put some on each side of my wall and create a stretching machine it's probably gonna look like a sex machine yeah i was gonna say i think you could just buy something else and just use it for a different purpose i guess you could just buy a sex machine or like a a reformer but anyway i'm totally on board with this i think stretching is good actually a trend that's going to continue to grow we've talked about it now for a year now we've talked about ram ramwad which is called range of motion workout of the day right which is an app that's killing it we've talked about kelly's star we've talked about a lot of this i'm totally on board with stretching yeah stretch tech um so i'm keeping an eye on that trend i have another trend if you're ready to move on to my my second trend really quick what another thing you could do with stretching so it's stretching in order to have one of these franchises you really just need a table right like nice tables with some bands another two other things that are really interesting to me in this space this the first is um chanting and breathing work so i i went to breath work i went to this one class where i paid 30 dollars and we just sat there with 30 other people doing breathing and then eventually you like chant i don't understand the science behind it but i know that i felt great it was fun it was a good experience for 30 dollars absolute high i so before not in a fitness context but one time i was when i started the sushi restaurant i was staying in l.a with the sushi chef his his mandate was if i'm going to start this business with you guys you're going to each come i had three co-founders there's three of us he said you're each gonna come you're gonna live with me you're gonna work every day at my restaurant for three weeks each and only one at a time so you don't have each other as your little safety net um and i said okay so you know one guy went out there a second coming out there then i went out there and with me he goes uh it was like you know kind of a life altering experience a very wise guy like kind of like a mr biagi sort of character for me and one of the things he did he's like are you religious and i said no i i don't believe he said um he said i'm buddhist i said okay cool do you know anything about buddhism no and he goes um all right tomorrow morning 7 a.m like meet me in the living room and i was like oh [ __ ] here we go and uh we went there and so i i didn't know anything about buddhism and i still know very little about buddhism but buddhists have this chant um that they do as like at least his practice or his maybe his sect or whatever it was they have this one chant it's called namyo harenge kyo so it'd be and you repeat that for like one hour straight you're chanting just one hour straight and so we start and i'm just trying to be nice and i'm like okay i guess i'll just kind of sit here and like uh what are these five words what are they what do i need to know what they mean no oh they i don't need to know what do you mean he was just like just just the sound is therapeutic and i was like oh that's interesting because like in hinduism oh you hear that in yoga a lot too and there's something about the vibration of making this sound audibly making the sound that by the end of it you feel different than you did at the beginning and so by the end of this hour i had this like i don't know what it was it's like a rush of euphoria basically uh from chanting and he was like i do that every morning it's like a med it's like an audio i forgot it's called transcendental meditation or something it's a form of meditation where you're not trying to it's like a way to quiet the mind by chanting the same thing on loop and when you quiet the mind you know you finally you know you get a sense of peace that's very hard to achieve otherwise and after i did that i was like a big believer in chanting so i've continued to i'm not buddhist but i've continued to do this chanting thing on and off for like the last 10 years of my life well and you feel like an idiot doing it so if i told you to do it without your guy there you would feel like a fool and i went and i felt like a fool too so i went to one of these classes and you do breath work which i don't understand the science behind it but it felt awesome it felt like i was it felt like a very mild uh drug yeah yeah and and you part of it is chanting and it felt great and it when i talked the guy was like yeah this is like our mvp like i found it on event right he's like we're thinking about scaling this and doing it it was all startuping guy and i was like dude this greatest business ever you just need like a space for like 50 people and nothing else yeah the floor yeah you don't need anything like i'm in if you ever like it so so anyway i think that's interesting i also think ice baths are interesting i know i've been noticing on instagram loads and loads and ice baths we talked about this company what was the ice bath company called the barrel company ice barrel ice barrel so ice barrel dot co or something it's um i know the guy who started it and they're selling an ice barrel for like twelve or thirteen hundred dollars i'm seeing them everywhere i think ice baths particularly places that you can go just to take an ice bath i think are going to get quite popular i think an ice bath also has a slightly meditative purpose to it so the i would add that i would add those two things to stretching to look out yeah same uh i just yesterday i sent this tick tock this guy is like hey guys just want to take you through my morning routine he's like a 60 year old dude who's just like absolutely chiseled somehow it's like okay i don't know i don't know how your body looks like that a little unnatural but okay was it mark sisson no i don't he wasn't like a famous guy he's just like a guy he's like first things first i get in the cold plunge and he's like i get in and i don't do a lot of like he's like i just get in that's it and then he's like and then at three minutes i get out i go in the jacuzzi he like hops over his pool to get to his jacuzzi he's like and then we're gonna go to the sauna and like all the comments are like sir i don't have these amenities at my house like i don't have all these things and i think that's the opportunity which is that when people have these things they sort of swear by them like our friend ramone swears by it tony robbins always talked about this is how he starts his day goes straight into the ice plunge then go straight to heat um and so there's definitely some like anti-inflammatory and like sort of uh neurological effects waking the body up like this with something a drastic physiological change a stimulus and you don't need caffeine you don't need drugs to be able to to get your body to respond and um but i think there's a problem which is that they're so inaccessible so one we talked about ice barrel and then somebody reached out a guy who's in my club ltv like uh the the e-commerce group i have for people who have an e-commerce store of a million dollars are up and he said oh yeah i have this one uh brand now but i'm starting a new brand and um his first brand is pretty successful i think probably 20 30 million his new brand is gonna do ice baths but it's just a device you put into any tub like your normal bathtub and it makes your bathtub water really cold and i was like oh that's way better because i don't want to do like icing i don't want to buy ice all the time that's a huge pain in the ass um and this like iceberg thing like it's a 2 dollar barrel yeah and you can only you can't use it if you have an apartment right and so i'm like well if i already have a tub and you just let me fill it up with normal water and i put this thing in for 10 minutes and it gets cold like that's awesome actually like now you just built like a 150 dollar device that does this without the headache is it like electronic like you plug it into yeah i don't know how you put electric things in water like i'm a little bit suspicious well it's like it's like the opposite of a heating pad yeah exactly and so it cools water so i'm very excited about this but if anybody has like either ice or sauna technology send it to me so show me show it to me i really want to try these i'm very big on this stuff great uh same so the second for trend spotting is uh tattoos yeah ephemeral tattoos specifically so if you go to ephemeral which is kind of hard to spell e-p-h-e-r-e-m-a-l ephemeral dot tattoo check that out so basically this is a trend i've been noticing first there was a company called inkbox that just made temporary you know temporary tattoos kind of like essentially it's a body sticker and uh and they started doing pretty well they came out a while ago and they you know they do kind of like 20 30 million dollars plus in revenue uh last i had heard which was a few years ago and uh so inkbox had done pretty well and this new one emerald tattoo just raised 20 million dollars it got my attention i said what's going on here so what these guys have is a biodegradable ink that you um that can go into even like a normal tattoo gun so you got to go to a place so inkbox is sort of like a sticker you just put on your skin and then it just fades away this is like actually a legit tattoo but it's a one-year commitment instead of a you know a 50-year commitment or whatever like a normal tattoo is so you go you actually get it and you know tattooed onto your body and it degrades after 12 to 15 months it fades away and um and so they have like one studio open in like la one in like new york and they raised 20 million dollars to do two things one is to release like colored tattoos because right now it's just black and white and the other is like to open more studios because the way it works is you put down it's like tesla you put down a 20 deposit and that lets you basically book a reservation at this thing and they have like a million dollars worth of like pre-booked reservations at their studios that they just are backlogged on and need to need to do and what i thought was interesting about this i was like okay cool it's like some kind of material innovation on the material science of the ink but i like that this can go into a normal tattoo because i think what i think the best i think it's sort of stupid to open up their own uh you know tattoo parlors maybe you'll do a few of those but there's 21 000 tattoo parlors in the united states that's like the same number of like high schools or in the united states so there's one one tattoo parlor for every high school essentially is that is that a real stat yeah there's estimated twenty one thousand tattoo parlors and there's about twenty four only twenty twenty five percent i think you're wrong by the way them having this studio is awesome it doesn't matter if it makes money or not i guess what i'm saying is i think what they should do is they should sell this to every tattoo parlor as the hey you want diet coke right you want the diet tattoo you don't you want the not lifelong tattoo commitment hey we sell this thing it plugs right into our normal thing and we're we have the staff we have the brick and mortar locations so i think they could roll out to 10 000 locations like this rather than opening up their own store brick after brick so anyways i'm pretty excited about this i think it's kind of a cool idea i uh i'm gonna sign up i'll go to it they have a brooklyn one i was about to get some more tattoos i would totally do that right you have a few uh a few interesting tattoos on your body that you could talk about i've got a few bad ones so i have one two three i've got four homemade ones and the way that you you do you the way that you do homemade ones is you use a sewing needle and an ink and you just make a ton of dots i did that when i was like 21 and like partying i was highly intoxicated i don't entirely regret them but they look silly it says like what do you have on your you have like something on your foot tattoos no it says wow or mom it depends and then i have a feet tattoos that say act now which are kind of cool they're kind of cool but yeah like self-administered tattoos not every day you see one of those which is actually uh quite popular is homemade tattoos it's called stick and poke when i did it i didn't think that they were that popular but i think they actually are quite popular but anyway this had two business i i'll 100 sign up for that it looks sign up for them it it it looks pretty sick they are black and white so like they do amazing yeah yeah they look pretty like like i would get it but if you're like a cute girl and you probably don't it's not just that they're black and white it looks like they're not like colored in so they're just like an outline of a shape or at least that's what i see on the website it's like a cat but like the cat it's just like the outline of a cat yeah i'm into those ephemeral tattoo i i think you're on board there it just opens up the market right like there's if there's if there's like a circle that says this is this is a circle that represents the number of people who are willing to get tattoos for life you say and now there's an option that you can have a tattoo but it's only going to last a year and it'll fade away okay that circle just got like three times bigger four times bigger you're just increasing the size of the adjustable market for tattoos which is smart so i think that's cool because you get to try something for a year that you could potentially impact the rest of your life you know it's always freaked me out like and and we don't discuss it too much but or like as a society we accept that that's normal buying a home you basically go into it for like 10 minutes and you're willing to spend all of your money like every dollar that you have in 30 years of your life after like a 15-minute walk-through is that crazy is that you actually give you 100-page disclosure that you can't understand and then you read some scary stuff in there and then you're just like i guess i guess i just live with that termite issue i always just thought it was mind-boggling that you can you you have to spend 15 minutes for making a decision that emote for most people it's all their money and also it's for 30 plus years of their life right off of off a 15 minute walk through that's always that's always been crazy to me so this is that that's well this is good for tattoos that they get that moment you want to talk about these uh these top two things i think yeah so so i was thinking about class rings uh or i think um somebody ben shared a tweet with me that was just like a meme it was like uh the the if people want to know how we get ideas for this so me and ben just sent his other [ __ ] off twitter all day and then some of it you know it's just like a memes but but i thought started thinking about he goes some guy coleman oates he goes y'all remember when a company would come to your high school and gaslight you into buying a 400 class ring and you know there's just like whatever like 100 likes on this tweet and i just thought it was so funny and i remember that happening i remember buying a class ring and i lost it i don't know where it is it was like a waste of money it's so ugly i was never gonna wear it uh but i bought it because i was like i guess this is like the moment i'm supposed to commemorate these four years and you know it's now or never basically to buy this ring so i like kind of got pressured into buying it and uh so i started thinking about this classroom business so let me tell you some things i discovered all right so this guy's kind of like my billy of the week i got two very boring business people that i'm going to feature here so the first guy is called otto josten and otto josten is the founder of jostens which is the number one clash ring maker and otto johnson he invents the clash ring basically so he started this thing in 1897 in ottawa right this is like you know over 100 years old and um and so he invents this thing and basically says okay great we're gonna have these rings that commemorate the occasion and um and so he he creates the classroom so what how does this work so basically high school or college you go to the school um at the end of your senior year you get up-sold into all this stuff you get up sold into like um you know shirts yearbooks but the clash ring is like kind of like one of the more expensive items 400 500 600 for a class ring sometimes and um and so i was looking into the history of this company so basically the company uh you know existed for a long time goes public uh in like 1965 or whatever stays public for a while ends up getting acquired by private equity so it gets acquired by uh by by something called newell brands and this is an interesting company to look into they own rubbermaid crockpot oster like all these like home home appliance companies then they old like elmer's glue sharpie yankee candles like all these brands that we know about they have 10 billion in revenue across their portfolio brands and so they had they bought jostens and they were like look this company makes about 700 million dollars a year but it's been flat uh or declining like the yearbook and clash ring industry is sort of like declining five percent a year and so it's like ah you know maybe there's room to turn around so they buy it for one 1.5 billion i think yeah and then they try it for a few years can't do anything with it they sell it to another company platinum equity for 1.3 billion so they take a 200 million loss on it sell the company so still owned by platinum equity and it's just this thing that exists so it started getting me interested like how does this whole business model work and what i couldn't find is what's in it for the schools because the schools definitely give these people like real estate uh on campus or on on premises to sell this stuff so i wonder if there's a rev share i couldn't find that that detail but it got me thinking how would i compete with this if i was going to compete with this so i thought this would be a fun brainstorm so all right boring business how would you compete with this well let let's walk through how seniors come into this you know i use did you use josh johnson's in high school i think i think we bought jostens yeah uh so basically if i remember correctly you're a senior and you get a magazine do you get a magazine like do they hand do they hand like a pamphlet to all seniors i remember buying it from a table there was like a table set up with a little like tablecloth and on it was a bunch of rings i think they did have a brochure of like here's all the different models you can order try them on and then like you place your order and you pay the thing and then it arrives you know months later and your school knows who's ordering i think because i didn't order one i was like i don't this is nonsense i don't i don't like high school this much like i i don't want to ring and my school came to me and they were like are you having trouble at home and i was like no they're like do you need money to buy the ring we'll buy it for you and i was like no that's lovely i i appreciate you guys but i just think it's stupid i don't want i don't want a ring and then they had a ring ceremony and they just handed me a plain box and it had like i went to a catholic school and it had like a a cross or something in it so that they just high school you're talking about yeah so they like had some type of thing to give me and i was like i appreciate you guys but i don't want any of this stuff but anyway they the school knows who orders as well right and so so okay i was thinking about okay i think there's two models there's distribution and then there's product so on the distribution side i would definitely try to figure out how do i partner with either the school themselves or a sub entity in the school and so um uh did you invest in that company copper that i sent you we passed we passed okay so one of the clever things that they do i won't go into their whole playbook but they have an awesome playbook on how to there they make it like a debit card essentially for high school students and um they grow really well and the people who were behind it they created a different product uh for high schoolers and they had a playbook basically how do you get high schoolers on board for your thing and one of the things that they do one of the pieces of the playbook is that they go they partner with one of the like organizations in the school so they can't partner with the school itself too complicated but they'll go to like the baseball team or like the volleyball team and they'll say hey you guys need like 500 bucks for your like uniforms this year great we'll sponsor it in exchange you guys help us promote our thing you guys become an affiliate for every additional student you bring on board you get more money for your org and so it ends up being like you know a direct ad affiliate deal with with with the groups and they're obviously highly motivated because they need to pay for their stuff so similarly i guess what i would do is i would try to for the distribution side i would partner with either the school or partner with like you know the band or like you know some group in the school and say hey uh if you guys help us sell this you get a rev share with this thing so that's how i would get my foot in the door then the question is what product because i think class rings are incredibly ugly and i think there's sometimes a good thing about ugly things because they stand out and they seem special or unique or different versus like they're not ugly they just all look alike like every class ring since you know this this thing has been invented at like 1890 like it's the exact same thing if you see someone wearing a class ring it's like all right al bundy like you're living in the past here right like well yeah i'm like you're a [ __ ] like you're a dork you peaked it's a dork move right so how do you so first if you can make it unless you were like one of the early classes of harvard like all right i get it right yeah like unless you won like you know the ncaa championship then you wear your championship ring yeah and even then you should probably just keep that on a shelf in the house but like i think it's okay it's not meant to be worn necessarily so here's the opportunities i see so my my best idea that i came up with and this was like an hour before we started recording this my best idea is class sneakers so i think sneakers are like hot real estate and i don't know if you've ever seen people who make custom sneakers like either for celebrities or for like brands they're awesome they have like a paint gun or like it's like a tattoo gun basically yeah they can like create it's like a graffiti mural on a pair of air force ones so that's the first thing i would try to do is class sneakers i would try to basically say great how do i come up with a base model maybe it's like converses or air force ones or something like that plain plated white shoe and then okay everybody's graduating right now they're all let's say class of 21 so i'm gonna have class of 21 and then i'm just gonna make different color schemes for the different schools and uh and then if you pay extra like you can get your name sort of like embroidered on the thing or like whatever your phrase or whatever you want on the back of it um and i would basically sell commemorative class sneakers that can either be worn or they're just put on you know put on the wall put it and put in the in the house somewhere as a piece which which shoe which brand and model i think uh maybe i'm out of touch here but i like kind of just like uh like the old school plain white air force ones i think those are like yeah that's right one of the best canvases to to use for something like this but simple i don't think it really matters i think you basically you need some shoe that in reality if i was doing this i probably would like find something that's shaped like that but it's not already like a hundred dollars right because i need to get the shoe for like twelve dollars and then i need to do the custom you know the paint work on it for like another eight dollars and then i need to sell that shoe for like 180 or 200 or something like that i think that's the model here and i think you could do this with instagram ads facebook ads and partnering with school organizations to do like kind of ref shares um and i think it could be cool i think it's like a status symbol so that's how i would attack jostens right if they're making 700 800 million dollars a year on their ugly ass class rings i would start with class sneakers as my first idea yeah i think that's good or so i'm looking at i'm looking at it dude they sell some ugly ass [ __ ] i cannot believe this business is in place and here's the take here's the takeaway here is that once you get locked into some to a certain contract yeah i would actually phrase it like it's hard to [ __ ] up or default if you're the boring default it's so good such a good position to be in and a lot of times when i think of like when we think of entrepreneurship and we think of starting stuff we think how can i be innovative how can i be new in reality in order to make a lot of money it's how do i get locked into this to to the point to where like it's gonna be a pain in the ass to go anywhere else and that's the takeaway here i'm looking at johnson's they they started you said in in in 1897. yeah okay so if you started something 124 years ago and you are still in cahoots with these high schools this is significantly better than any enterprise sas company this is significantly better than a newsletter do this when i think of this is idiot proof jostens is idiot proof i used to say that uh real estate has the highest uh number of low iq millionaires jostens is is the the best example of that i've ever seen i love this company and i think that when i start stuff that's that's what i should think of uh how can i just create something that people buy forever and i have to innovate on the product zero that's exactly what they've done the best example of this that we came up with that we had on the podcast was the uh the workplace compliance poster that you have to have for like the hr or safety or whatever work the poster every office has in the break room um that poster you just have to buy every year it's like 100 or something and you just have to get it every year otherwise you're out of you're like out of compliance you're like out of code and uh you know zero employees just sort of like an auto renew where i send you this like one cent poster for a hundred dollars is like such a beautiful beautiful business and in fact i almost want to just come up with like another compliance poster actually this is my next idea here live on the podcast what's another like [ __ ] ass compliance poster that i could make that i could sell to every company like maybe it's like something with like the modern day woke stuff like it's about like you know anti her openness and her anti-harassment and like pronouns and like everything it's just like a reminders of like how to not be canceled so so it's basically there's like a reminders poster that gets updated every year with the latest cancellation policy and uh you just need to make it seem like a totally boring company uh thing and you just sell this to every age you said send it to them once and then you like get them on file to like have this in their you know restrooms every year or something like that if you work for a company like this like one like what you're describing or jason's so it looks like on glassdoor they've got three thousand employees dude if you're working [ __ ] dude you're asleep you've been able to sleep for 65 straight years what do you make up there in hibernation what are you like why do they even need employees that's what like i'm looking through this like what's the point of having a person do this like you could fire most ev all your people and just build stuff that it automates it and you simply have sales people that just try to like sell stuff but like you don't need anything i i i'm looking at their class door i'm like what on they have a thousand to five thousand people i thought it said three thousand in another place i don't even know what you do like what what do you if you're the ceo of this company what do you do every day are you like hey this week we're gonna try this it's like no you're just keeping the lights on the whole time and i'm okay with that it sounds like i'm criticizing it i'm not what the [ __ ] do you mean if you work for this company has the little mini pudding green in their office you know that little putting green of a one-hole putt-putt golf you could put in your office michael burris yes michael burr he has one of those in office he's probably listening to this right now looking at the putting green and being like god damn it uh those guys are wrong about everything but they're right about the damn putting green i gotta get rid of this thing this is what i i want to start something like this where you just have to do no work ever i mean i just just undercut them right so i think i think you could advertise on facebook and instagram and be like hey seniors don't get ripped off by jostens same ring half the price yeah this amazes me i have none of the employees and i'm going to drop ship this out of china so like hey don't get ripped off by josten's that's that's my ad creative again somebody wants to do this just keep me up i just want to hear how this plays out if you end up doing this just advertise against this all right so this is crazy right so i want to talk about the second one this paint one this is interesting by the way i sent you an instagram there's another person who's trying to compete with them and they're just making a classroom that doesn't look tacky uh so that was also like one model which is like these rings look cool it's someone called j hannah or something like that that's her instagram jay.hanna and it looks like they got meaning meaningful traction yeah these are clinic clash these are clash rings there's only four it's like they just stand for like kind of like earth wind fire and ice or something like that but they're just kind of clash rings with the year and uh they just look better they look cool when you wear them so that's another way you can go about this all right um here's you wanna know about here's another company that you're gonna be mind blown about do you know what the pantone color chart is the pantone matching system i googled it googled it and i see things that i recognize like a like a color wheel yeah okay so here's here's the story here's the story you need to know okay so um there's a guy frank who sent this to me on twitter so shout out to frank uh he's got like an egg profile on twitter but he listens upon he just goes hey pantone this has got to be a huge business these guys sell this freaking color book for 500 and so i said wait i have one of those color books on my desk what the what's there's a business behind this and sure enough okay so here's the back story uh there's this guy okay so otto josten was our first you know billy of the week lawrence herbert is my second uh lawrence herbert basically they oh these guys they owned a print company uh print a printing company and they got tired of the fact that like they had all these inconsistencies in colors right so you would try to just describe a color or it's blue color but like which shade of blue and then all these different inks they were trying to keep track of a name or whatever and they said screw it we're going to create the global standard for colors so all they did was they took every single shade of color and they put a number on it and they gave this to every like manufacturer fashion house architecture firm like you're picking the colors for your curtains what pantone color you're gonna use uh you're picking you know the color of your fabric for your clothing brand what color you're going to use you're you know uh crazy like ben jerry's uses the color chart for they have a quality assurance uh group that basically looks at the brownies that are going to go in the brownie fudge bites or whatever and if the brownie color is between you know brown 690 and brown 669 then it's good it's properly baked and if it's under or over it's like too baked or it's under baked so they just hold this up and they look at the brownie and they say does this match this color or not and so this thing is used ubiquitously so they created this pantone color system the matching system it's like 2 500 colors they make over 100 million dollars a year just sending out this little brochure this little pamphlet there's a booklet with all the colors in it and everybody buys these things we have one here because when we need to communicate with our manufacturer for our brand we have to tell them hey use pantone color 506c or whatever it is so they know that we want that specific shade of blue how did this uh product start so so the guy owns the printing company decides to create the pantone matching system and the number one way they got the word out was this marketing stunt like we we talked about um michelin star and we talked about like that that that system so they started coming out with color of the year so they just they would make they put a ton of money and effort effort behind color of the year so 2016 rose quartz 2015 marsala you know 2012 tangerine tango is the color of the year 2011 classic honeysuckle color of the year so they they they do this big marketing blitz around what is the color of the year and in order to come up with it they have this hush-hush process where they invite 12 like trend spotters to their office and then they each give presentations and kind of like debate around like culture and where the where society is moving and then they come out and they're like honeysuckle is it and then they immediately blitz the market with that they send that to all the like fashion houses ad agencies and then they start using that in their campaigns and they start you'll start getting emails which is like oh buy our thing it's got the color of the year this is honeysuckle the color of the year for this dress and so brands start using that for their own marketing and so it started spreading that way and so they sell these booklets for like you know eighty-five dollars up to five hundred dollars these booklets and then every year they launch like a hundred new colors so you gotta get a new booklet with all the new colors in it it's like the dictionary and uh i just thought this was amazing i didn't know there was even a company behind us and it makes over a hundred million dollars a year all right i'm gonna blow your mind all right we're gonna we're gonna build office go to wgsn.com so wgsn.com do you see that yeah i think you've told me about this one these are the trend trend makers right they have like a ascent of the year or something like that no colors it's colors as well exactly what you described um they do almost exactly that except except it's a it's really like one or two reports a year but it's a subscription service and they sell to businesses and they're a public company so i can look up their revenue so their revenue last year was 90 uh 90 million euros i think this is a euro so 100 yeah 100 million dollars and it's been doing a hundred million dollars or it's been doing around that forever so it's currently researching reports basically but it it it's we could dumb it down we had the founder of david's tease on here and he was talking about how he uses a brand he he used to pay for stuff like this and i remember asking him like is it just [ __ ] or is this like why are you buying this like i don't know how much this report is like thousands of dollars for this thousands and thousands he was like oh totally worth it like that's how we got the new like flavors and fragrances for the news teas every year i was like wow okay interesting so it's called wgsn wgsn.com and to dumb it down starbucks who will buy a hundred thousand uniforms or a hundred or [ __ ] 10 million coffee sleeves they want to know which color for christmas what shade of red is going to be interesting enough or um if we're buying these uniforms uh for this one this promotion which color is the right color by the way the starbucks red thing my wife loves starbucks she goes starbucks anytime she can and she literally looks forward to the red cup moment where they switched the cups and like it's like it's like an emotional thing almost it's like um it's basically like oh [ __ ] like like the season has changed christmas time is here i get these warm fuzzy feelings and part of that i associate with is the red cups which i just found to be like crazy that anyone cares well yeah it just means that it's winter time um and so this company called wgsn companies pay i think it's 18 grand a year and they also have someone you could talk to so you can ask them a question it's called the that's what they call their advisory service they just like you you ask people questions but then they also so i believe the way the business works is they they do two things they look at loads of different data on which what's what type of color is selling well and i imagine it's just someone else's data the second thing is they survey people and so they'll survey like people who they deem as experts and they ask them questions and then they create this like survey response of like all right here's according to all the experts this color these colors for this type of niches are going to be the colors that you're going to use in the future and if you know if you have a company that's not like growing that much but it's worth 90 million euro a year in subscription revenue i mean that's like a three four five hundred million dollar a year company or a company that i think makes like 30 million dollars a year in profit only off colors and this is the second one in a few minutes that we've named colors are very interesting and by the way these guys the pantone guys they then partner with some of the firm to come out with the so the pantone became has become the universal like language of color how do you describe color to somebody you describe it the pantone chart uh and by the way the reason why there's like a science there's a bit of a mechanical reason why so like a normal printer if you use a printer i think a normal like household printer will has this thing called cmyk if you've ever seen that like capital cmyk what does that mean it's like cyan magenta magento yellow and black or something and basically you can mix those four colors and you can make a whole bunch of combinations of colors just using those four it's like rgb for tvs and um but pantone if you have a pantone machine then the pantone machine basically has like 18 base colors and so you can mix and you can mix because it's 18 specific base colors you can create all these really specific shades so when you give somebody the color it's not just so that their eye knows what it is except they can punch it into the machine and create that specific pigment or that specific ink or that specific printed color on top of whatever it is so there's like you know they needed something like that which is pretty cool um but anyways these guys partnered with somebody to come out with like the pantone of taste and the pantone of smell also right how do you describe a fragrance well how how do you do this and so they partnered with some company they they also tried to own that space and which i just think is awesome to be like kind of the global authority i agree naming of a color and somehow a private company owns that which is insane it's like owning you know the periodic table or something and we were talking about you called it boring i think this is fun i think this is actually kind of fun this i don't know if i would want to do it all the time but this is like a fun thing because you can kind of shape culture i mean we were talking about that red that starbucks like you you or like the coca-cola red or the fact that um do you know that coca-cola invented santa claus pretty much or like the way that we the way that we envision santa claus i don't want to go too much off the cuff because i didn't actually research this but i'm a i like old stuff like and i like american history um and so i've read stories about this but like the modern day santa with like that red suit fat guy who's got a white beard that's a coca-cola invented that oh [ __ ] we need to go deep on that one we should go back okay uh all right so i'm gonna call this business i discovered this business the hard way so we were traveling we left something at you know the tsa security checkpoint where you're like putting all your stuff in the bins or whatever and uh we left something in there and so we get on the plane my wife's like no where's that thing oh don't worry i'm sure we can just sort of call them or like you know file and file a report and are you trying not to say what it is uh what the item yeah oh it was i mean it's just like a baby stroller bag thing uh you know it's like 150 item but like not you know whatever nobody it doesn't matter what it is left an item there um we so i'm like okay let me google like just hey item left tsa las vegas airport and um and the first thing that comes up is thing called insta file get you follow follow your claim you get your thing back i click it and it's like oh just tell us what your item is and we'll get it back to you don't worry about it and then you go through the flow and then it tries to charge you 29 dollars at the end i'm like okay whatever oh and as i'm doing this oh so i go through i follow this i'm starting to follow this thing and i start to get my spidey spin sensors tingling i scroll down and i see you know is the file is not associated with any airport tsa or anything like that i'm like oh what is this pretty interesting business so so first i think it's clever a clever move right i call these couch cushion businesses it's like finding change in the couch cushion it's like these little cracks in the system where you can just like slip right in and create a business so of course people are gonna be losing you know one out of a thousand people are gonna lose something in tsa what are they gonna do they're gonna google it and these guys are the top ranking result for that uh for every airport i think and so um they just all they do is filing a claim is actually free what they do is they just rank at the top they get you to pay for it and then they go file the claim on your behalf and this forwards your they just forward your report to them and then they forward you their response and it's like i mean a scam it's not a scam it's it's like a kind of a managed service the part it's very misrepresentative and so you go read the reviews people are very angry at them i don't get angry about this sort of thing i actually i'm like oh clever clever you've found a way to like you know capitalize on this um and you know there is some value added service because again there is like an agent in the middle i don't know how much that's what i'm saying it's my it's it's very technically it's not a scam it's just misleading it depends if they're actually better at if they actually save you time or money uh or like you know increase your odds of getting your thing back if they're really just forwarding your report and then forwarding their email back to you then there's like zero value add but if they are actually like you know filing it right following up for you calling and getting the answer then great uh you know that's dude i can't find anyone online who works at this company yeah you can't find the owner you can't find the about page and that's why i'm like okay yeah and you know probably more towards scam but anyways i just thought this is fascinating how many different businesses are there like this there's probably a ton of different business like this that are just like these really hyper-specific scenario searches that um that you can rank number one for and then when you do i bet you kind of print money i bet you this business is you know profitable seven figures business just off this one uh this one thing like mugshots.com or mugshot website what is that to look up mug shots yeah you've never tried to look at someone's mug shot oh my god it's littered with scams so google like uh find mugshot california or like you know like imagine like what imagine a friend gets arrested and you're trying to find a mug shot google whatever you're going to google uh all right so i'm seeing a bunch of ads four ads at the top right let me find mug shots for free it looks like a search bar i can search their name and it goes finds the public records and i'm guessing it's going to charge me something at some point crazy right yeah it's pretty wild so a lot of these mug shots that they get they're just public so if you know where someone gets arrested you can just go not all counties are that way but you can just go to like um uh san francisco or so that would be like alameda county uh mugshots and you can actually go to the website and they just like and they just aggregate it but they have super super slick onboarding ways to like uh get you to give them money and the website's super optimized right like this right next to the search bar it says norton security and mcafee secure the why do i what does that have that's a virus scanning protocol what does it have to do with me typing in someone's name to search for them like but it's just like these random ass trust building badges right next to the search bar just to get me to do this for free yeah so it's not actually gonna be free it's incredibly scammy and anyway it's very similar to what you're describing we can actually do a i'll actually do a breakdown about this uh very soon um maybe next week i'll do a breakdown on this business historically incredibly scammy probably you could own the person who who can own one of these businesses and make like 10 15 million dollars a year profit although you got to like you know live this shitty life where like you're just kind of a piece of [ __ ] scamming someone but it's like it's crazy fascinating um that these mugshot businesses i think they crush yeah so do you know who naveen jane is yes so he's like a billionaire guy now but he the way that he became a billionaire he's kind of done a good job of rebranding himself as this like inspirational tony robbins guy yeah but he owned a bunch of scammy businesses and i believe some of them were ponzi schemes that he took public so what was it a ponzi scheme i don't think exactly but basically during the dot-com boom uh there was a company called infospace and he was the ceo of infospace and i don't know the full story i should look it up but i remember reading it because i met his son his son uh this guy ankur jane a really interesting guy and you know like he's he was kind of like i was sort of like why is this kid so like polished why do i feel like when he's talking to me he's talking like on cnbc or something like that like this i got this like politician vibe from him and so i was looking him up like oh he's the son of this billionaire and they you know grew up you know in the same neighborhood as like you know whatever bill gates and other guys and then somebody had told me somebody was like yeah his dad's kind of controversial so why is that and he said he started info space took it for space public and then before infospace crashed in the dot-com crash he had like i know sold a bunch of his stock he ended up doing great all of his employees you know lost their kind of like the company went under but he ended up doing very well that's the like long and short of it now i don't know if it was like you know some kind of like underhanded stuff i'm not sure but definitely there's like a long kind of like report that it's pretty hard to google for it because i think he's like scrubbed it but you can find it from the old like seattle times or something like that uh but then he started another company that also had controversy called intellius and intellius is the one you're thinking about and um intellius i think it sold uh like for over a hundred million dollars but what it was is sort of like in the uh it was a so it's a way for people to peruse criminal records and conduct background searches online but the way the way it worked if you look if you google like intellius scam or intellius shady you'll see that like it basically looked like one of those like free credit report like kind of services or it's like oh you just type your name you'll get your your data your report and there's like this tiny checkbox that's like you know you know you agree to pay 19.99 for the rest of your life if you do this and like and so that's how they were making a bunch of their money was they were just taking aggregating public records making them a little more searchable and they had this sort of like hard to see subscription that you were paying for at the end of it uh maybe i i don't know exactly you must have entered your credit card so it can't be that hard to see but there was a bunch of controversy around intellius i remember yeah yeah yeah now he's got like this company moon express that's like sending rockets to the moon and like and now he's got something called volume it's like imagine a world where illness is optional and it's like you know trying to save the world save the planet type of guy and if you hear him talk he's extremely charismatic um as people who who tend to you know run schemes tend to be and so he's um i don't know i i don't know i don't really have an opinion myself i just know that there is some controversy around this guy but i find him to be a pretty fascinating character i find him very interesting to hear when he talks very inspirational type of speaker and now is doing these kind of like big picture elon musk type of things but got his start doing something much less savory we should have someone come on and talk about some of the stuff i didn't realize that i i knew what atelieus was but whenever i do these background checks i like doing background check stuff it's fun have you ever like like don't you ever do it to like see like have my parents ever been arrested let's find out um no i had never do anything like that but i'm also not like ancestry.com or 23 of me i think there's a lot of people who are just like big into like self-exploration kind of like my past other people's past things like that and uh i i just haven't done that a ton well so that's me so i understand a lot of people i think most people like answers.com is a huge business so i think um anyway i think this yeah i i i didn't realize i i thought that someone could make 10 or 20 million dollars a year from this but now that i remember intellius i think was doing hundreds of millions from this yeah i ran into some another business like this that was looking for people's addresses so when we had that like i i came on the pod i talked about somebody was stealing from us and we knew who they were we're gonna find them and send the cops to their house and stuff like that well i needed to find somebody's address and so i started basically if you have like a couple pieces of information a name a phone number stuff like that there's these like websites that will come up they'll say hey yeah we'll give you this we have a huge database of everyone's address just put in their info and then you get like three steps down the funnel it's like oh to unblur the address you gotta pay 9.99 in a month it's like why do i need this monthly i'm not doing this every month but okay sure i really want this address and like they're just like i bet you'll forget to cancel this and it's like a slogan a lot of times with those services you can do a good enough job of if you actually cross-reference a ton of them you can actually find the name on blurred because they'll show you three like pieces i'll show you like three possible options and like the third one which is likely it is is blurred but then you could like do some weird like triangulation and figure out which one it is it's kind of interesting i've done it before as well yeah this is like sort of the dark parts of the internet and all they're doing like you said is they basically take stuff that's public record or they take guesses and then they um they aggregate it and put a fancy kind of search bar and they just do a good job of ranking and google are paying for for google adwords and that's their business model but uh you know i don't know too much about these i've never thought about doing a business like this but when i run into them as a customer i'm like hmm what's underneath this how the heck does this thing work me too fascinating me too and my mug shots is a classic i'm gonna do some interest in a mug shot i'm gonna tell jake to do to look at mug shot stuff that's a great one um all right i think that's the episode right yeah let's wrap it i feel like i can rule the world travel never looking back

i don't care if i only had a hundred thousand i'm spending 50 000 because this is the whole point of working really really hard is spending my money on stuff that will make my family happy and they'll talk about forever i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what all right welcome to the episode we actually talked about like maybe eight legitimately wonderful ideas we talked about privacy startups we talked about ghost.org which is a wordpress competitor that we actually think is going to be a 100 million dollar plus company we talked about bird flow.io which is a new business that just started like two weeks ago that's quite interesting what else did we talk about uh we talked about ikea hacking which is the art of souping up and upgrading your basic furniture into something dope using ikea parts and what you know that little trend that might actually be something that you could build a little build a business around this is going to be an interesting episode because we actually rattled off a ton of stuff it just went from thing to thing to thing to thing uh damn sam tells you why you should be spending three times as much on your engagement ring as you're planning to five times as much i spent five times as much and i don't regret it at all and i actually think everyone should so listen to the end that's the uh that bits at the very end at 54 minutes i think give it a listen and also go and click that subscribe button on itunes and that follow button on spotify because we're going to be launching some more episodes that are interesting next week and go subscribe to the youtube channel we just had our first video that had a hundred thousand views on youtube so we're getting big over there let's do it um all right sean grab your iphone for me i'm gonna talk to you about something but first i'm going to show you so all right go to your iphone go to settings type in privacy and click privacy type in privacy all right all right and if you're following along on an iphone do this for me this isn't like a track that's like a real thing all right click location services and then scroll all the way to the bottom where it says system services yep all right after you click that scroll halfway down to where it says significant locations do you see that yeah click that and it asks you for your password probably it just face id'd me all right all right now your lotus your latest location it might say vegas or nevada or something click it yep so what you're going to see is my precise location your precise location is tracked forever so since you used your phone and you could clear your history but you see how it's like tracking all your stuff by the way i i clicked it it says arrived via 27 minute drive it's like it knows exactly when i arrived and how i arrived because it used apple maps or like it uses a bunch of stuff it'll tell you like how you got there it'll tell you what apps you're using when you're getting there it'll tell you all types of interesting stuff now the reason i'm talking about this is i want to tell you a story about privacy and i wanted to show you like why this is crazy because you like knew that like if i told you like intellectually you'd be like yeah of course oh your iphone tracks you yeah of course uh so i just wanted to show you it is weird to see it like that it's weird to see it and the reason i'm bringing this up is i read this story about this guy named kyle mcdonald and in 2011 he basically did this story where he well actually let me tell you this first so he was interested in in privacy and he thought he read this line and it said can you imagine living a life without any private information where with no private bank statements no private files on your computer um it's hard to understand right but what if you actually ask that question a little bit differently so do you trust the government do you trust large banks do you trust facebook do you trust google do you trust these large entities with your information because that's kind of like the same thing it just asks a little bit differently and so he did this first test where he created this thing called key tweeter and every 140 characters on his keyboard automatically tweeted uh so like there was no privacy because he wanted to see what was the world like without privacy and he took it a step further and so he went to an apple store in brooklyn and they had 50 computers and he installed an app on all 50 computers that automatically took a picture every like 30 or 60 seconds and any time it detected a face it would send him the pictures and he published it as like an art exhibit an art thing of like look at what people look like when they're looking in computers at a laptop in apple and after publishing that the secret service raided his home uh and apple apple contacted the service they raided his home they took his computers they did a thorough investigation they declined to prosecute but they definitely could have done something and i thought that that was amazing when i started thinking about that i'm like isn't that crazy that i am i would be i would be upset too if someone took my picture i wouldn't be upset to call the police but i would be upset i wouldn't like it isn't that crazy that i'm upset about that but i like type in all my information uh throughout the web or i let someone track me and it's quite an interesting way and i thought what's another way and so i discovered this little hack i'm like when i see that it actually changed my perception and so there's this issue going on where i actually think these privacy startups are going to be huge in 10 20 30 years now my problem that i'm having personally is i'm actually struggling to find different solutions that need to like different ways to solve or different problems that need to be solved but i agree with this general premise of like when i just did that experiment where i showed you your tracking stuff and when i just like read this guy's uh art story i was like yeah i'm totally not okay with that i don't like that right but you're trying something out that was like this you go say your tweet you go imagine if you walked into go ahead yeah so let's just say that you're walking around the street and a company walks you into their office and they go check this out and they give you a file cabinet you open this file cabinet and there's 10 000 pictures of you and your family taken throughout the last five years and you had no idea those pictures were being taken how would you feel about that of course you'd feel violated now they would say they would say look you were in public and i would say yeah i know i i was in public i can't be too angry but i still don't feel right about this now that's exactly how what happens with your data you know that you're opting into things you know you're you're consenting but sometimes you don't realize what you're getting into and you if you actually truly knew what was happening you might regret it and i think that the next generations of humans uh like the guys who are five and ten years old now i actually think that they're not gonna like this stuff and we're gonna see a lot of products that come out that fight it because i think that like when you think of like oh wow you used to be able to smoke in a restaurant in the 1990s i mean i remember when i was a kid i could smoke in a restaurant or you you'd be smoking a restaurant now we think that's asinine i think that the privacy stuff now we're actually going to look back in 20 years and be like i can't believe that that was you're able to do that so anyway i wanted to start it off with that uh that experiment i like that uh i like that story a lot and i'm with you we've talked about different quote-unquote privacy-focused startups ranging from like privacy.com to duckduckgo and how that's actually privacy.com by the way become like a real kind of like sort of competitor to google in a obviously in a niche but hey it made it it made it out after you know 10 years against google um and we've talked about different different versions of this whether it's browsers uh phones a lot of the crypto stuff is based on these these same principles right like you own your data um and you just you custody it yourself rather than trusting this like kind of central company to do to hold it for you and um so i'm definitely with you that i think that some really big companies gonna be there because people really give a [ __ ] about this and you could tell people give a [ __ ] about this like it's ironic you were saying go to your apple iphone settings because if you want if you go down the street in san francisco you're gonna see huge billboards and it just says privacy and it's just apple and there's a phone blocking out your face like this like somebody holding a phone and you can't see their face and that's their whole ad and that's their differentiation that's their shtick about like what they care about at the super bowl they had that ad of somebody just looking at their phone like typing like kind of like a text message to somebody they're just laughing uncontrollably but they never explain what it is because it's like hey that's your information and um and so apple is like basically bet the farm on privacy as like their core attribute that they're going to be providing to customers like the number one value prop now and um but you know here you go you go into you go into your phone settings and it's like hey yeah we've tracked your location and you can share that and here's here's all the different services you've shared that with um you know here and they are trying to fight back like you've you've probably heard the facebook stuff that happened but if you're not advertising on facebook you you shouldn't actually realize how big of a deal it was you should explain what's going on because even i i don't own an advertising business anymore but i did even i was a little bit under under educated but it's actually a an incredibly big deal and this is an incredibly big deal for a consumer but also as business people last week we talked about this inflection with the ncaa athlete thing this is actually a new inflection it actually helps guys like me who owned an advertising business but i don't not anymore right yeah so so basically facebook's this you know obviously it's the advertising juggernauts facebook and google and with facebook facebook relied on having obviously detailed targeting information about you people always said oh it's creepy um you know your iphone my iphone's listening to me and uh and by the way do you know the explanation of why of how that works it's like dude i was just talking to my friend about this and then you know and now it's showing up in my my facebook ads and like the reason why is because your your friend has searched for a thing or interacted with a product and then they know that you were close to your friend your phones are in close proximity and so they start showing you ads that have been like your friends that your friends have been interested in because they know that that works and there's a chance that you had talked about it and then you know out of 30 times that that you didn't talk about it you just saw an ad it just went by you and then the one time it's the thing you guys were talking about it stands out and you remember that and you think facebook's listening to you but nonetheless um facebook basically had the biggest targeting machine in the world right you could segment by state by religion by whatever and then they've slowly stripped away some of those things as they got in trouble for you know like privacy with the election about what what sorts of things you can target on but fundamentally facebook knew more about you than you knew about yourself facebook knows before you're pregnant right facebook knows you're pregnant before you know you're pregnant and it knows based on your behaviors it knows based on your interest and knows based on many things uh you know a lot of stuff about you and so what happened is apple basically stripped the one thing facebook needed um it lets you facebook basically lets you opt out of data tracking so when you update to the new ios or sorry apple did when you update to the new ios system it says hey do you want to share all your data you're just like no and that one no took away facebook's entire like kind of like knowledge about you as a customer and so you've opted out of this tracking and so now when you go visit websites facebook doesn't get that data back to it it doesn't get that that information back and so as a facebook advertiser if you're in ecommerce right now all the numbers just show sort of changed overnight uh like even when you send it you show a facebook ad to somebody they click it and they go buy a product from you facebook's only catching like 60 of those conversions it doesn't know about the other 40 because they've opted out of tracking or it didn't work and so uh facebook all of a sudden it's kind of like scrambling to figure out all right how the heck are we gonna like deliver the same value to our advertisers which is our main business model without the it's like you know fighting with one hand tied behind your back now uh halfway through the fight and so that's that's sort of what apple did to facebook and facebook tried to fight it in court and they tried to do all this pr where they're like you're hurting small businesses and in reality they are you are you are yeah but you know net net it's good for the consumer to not have facebook just build this like super rich profile of your every move and your every taste and your every tendency uh just so that businesses can advertise to you better so if you're listening and you've got a privacy or or something like related to this idea i would love to learn about it reach out to us i'm i'm interested um i got i got a few more ideas do you want to go you want to you want to go after one uh yeah go for it you do one all right i'm gonna tell you one interesting one i'll tell you two um the first is called ghost ghost.org have you heard of ghost.org i've used ghost yeah okay so i'm interested in this ghost it's a wordpress meet sub stack is the best maybe explanation so it's a wordpress site uh it's its own platform so it's a wordpress competitor but they offer a handful of features like you can accept money for a paywall uh article they have a few more features i actually don't know all the features that they have and why people so let's say the use case is you want to spin up a website for yourself you can use ghost you want to spin up an email newsletter that's either free or paid or both you can use ghost instead of substack or you could want to spit up a community a paid community you could use a ghost and so basically ghost is this open source version of sub stack it's this low cost instead of let's say subset they take 10 of all your revenue ghosts just says hey pay us 10 bucks a month and we're happy and so they don't take they don't take a percentage of your revenue so for a lot of people that could be thousands of dollars a month that you're saving if you use ghost and they have different tiers so 10 a month 30 a month 80 to 200 a month and so there's a few interesting things about it but first like the guy behind it is intriguing so he launched it as a non-profit which i actually think is stupid but it probably was good for like pr and a lot of people actually worked on it for free to help him i think definitely he should switch but it's actually making three and a half million dollars a year and he uses a ton of people like free labor like people who just want to contribute and i think he actually has um staff but what he does is if you go to ghost.org slash about you he actually reveals all of his revenue and i think that's interesting because i was going through this and i uh i'm a an investor in a in a company called convertkit maybe you are too i don't remember but um this company called convertkit they do something like 30 million in recurring revenue right now they're in the value of like you could say that maybe they're worth 200 to 30 million dollars based off of like public comp so 10 times um revenue-ish and i was looking through ghost.org's numbers they're very similar to what convertkit was about four years ago when they just got started and so my prediction and i want to go on record by saying this is a i think this is awesome and b i actually think that this could be a multi-hundred million dollar company in the making and you could watch this guy build it in public and i think it's interesting also he had one major quote so typically people who build these types of things are kind of like nerdy and engineer-like and which means they're sometimes like reserved and held back and i which i which i like but he had a great quote that i read he goes someone goes what's your major advice for people getting started he goes honestly my single biggest piece of advice would probably be to stop looking for so much advice and shut the [ __ ] up and go build something so what do you think about this company do you agree in my prediction that this could actually could be a multi-100 million dollar business okay kind of boring but i agree right it's more entertaining when we disagree but i i totally agree i i used ghost for many of the reasons you talked about a i was intrigued i thought their story was interesting i liked that they're kind of like kind of like pirates they were sort of like just going against the grain on a bunch of stuff that they were doing product is good uh not super simple to use it's kind of like like i also find you know frankly i find wordpress to be a little bit confusing if you want wordpress is incredibly confusing yeah like it's kind of like easy to get the first thing going and then to get it to do what you want takes like a lot of stuff um i'm surprised this is as small as it is so 3.7 million annual run rate i'm surprised it's that small because ghost has been around for a while four years so so i don't think that's i don't think it's that impressive where it is but it's sort of like a duck that go uh where i'm like i believe it i first i believe that these guys are not going to quit so i think that's like you know the first thing these guys aren't going away and when they don't go away they are very differentiated and uniquely positioned where they're going to pick up like 10 or so of this entire wave of like like self-publishing that's going on with sub stack and others um and i like i'm more excited about this business than i am about substance uh 100 i completely agree with you and i i i the the reason i'm bringing this up to listeners is not necessarily this is a new idea that they can go and do but if you want to go and watch this person build uh he updates the blog every month and he reveals most all their revenue they're also a non-profit so if you dig around if you google like ghost foundation 501c you probably can see their total financials because nonprofits disclose that but really cool company that you could watch being built it's still small now but it's going to be fun to watch this being become huge over the next four years yeah i'm with you on that um all right i got some uh ideas so one is from trends actually this ikea hacking thing so yeah um so so i saw this in in y'all's trends like whatever the weekly newsletter thing that you guys put out and um i thought this was pretty fascinating so what is ikea hacking ikea hacking is when you buy something that's sort of like a basic looking piece of furniture and then because ikea is like a what's it called totally modular store like any piece of any piece of furniture it's like all the wheels are kind of like they accept this one like one peg so you can go swap 50 different wheels onto the same piece of furniture or same thing with the handle or the facade or the like you know the top the table top the glass top whatever right so it has like this um uniform nature to it which lets you just swap parts almost like minecraft or roblox or something like that and so ikea hacking is the art of taking something that's sort of a simple plain jane looking ikea piece of furniture and then you go to the store and you just buy different little uh upgrades you know like you're souping up a car on uh on pimp my ride and then you but you're pimping out your your your dresser or your your desk or whatever it is and you make something that looks pretty sick and actually it was just like you know 180 worth of random ikea parts that if you assemble them correctly they take you from this before picture to this after picture if it's the youtube video put up the before and after that's in from the trends thing it's awesome like it just looks so simple like very basic looking thing to like a really cool looking thing and this was all just done using ikea parts so i have some ideas around this but did i first did i even accurately describe it yeah you described it correctly and the way that we discovered this or i i think i mean i i used this four years ago when we first started our company basically i found this subreddit called ikea hacking and what i did was i bought a 150 kitchen countertop it was basically like a a really nice wood block that's all i mean that was like a like a countertop but i and then i just went and got some legs from from like a whole totally different thing this countertop you're actually supposed to lay on like granite or like a like a like a countertop and i just but i just screwed legs on it and i put it in the middle of our room and that was like our kitchen table at our office and that's and i think i started talking to stuff about ikea hacking it's very fascinating i don't know what the business ideas are though okay so here's the business idea so first it's r ikea hacks it's got 78 000 members on reddit so back to the episode we did with greg eisenberg where he talked about unbundling reddit this is a classic example so shout out to greg basically i would look at a community like this and i'd say huh these people are pretty passionate about what's uh what they're doing here and like these photos are kind of amazing these would make for great ads this would make for great content just seeing uh seeing this right and so i would just go to r reddit.comr slash r ikea hacks and then i would sort by like top top post you know for the year or something like that and just go get a sense of like what's there and then click comments and read all the top comments of all the top posts so i think you could do a few things here right i think you could do so i would then take many of the proven business models and then i would like apply them here so if i was getting started what would i do to start i would start by saying look i don't know the exact business model but what i do know is that this is great content so i would create an instagram account right away right because the first thing that you got to know is that most people don't bury their head in reddit they're not going to find all these new subreddit even someone like me who uses reddit every day i didn't know about this subreddit and so let alone my sister who will never use reddit and she'll only use instagram and so like the first thing i would do is i would immediately create an instagram account that's just posting the ikea hacks the best pictures from from reddit basically just plagiarize it and just put it there and then just credit the username from reddit in every photo as a photo credit just just just so you don't get in trouble yeah just so i would say what are you talking about i was given credit right there and it's like dude you're ripping this off um so that's the first thing i would do i would try to get that to like 50 to 100 000 followers on instagram because that's now my asset that's my audience that's interested in this thing that i can then leak out different products so it could be a course like a simple like 100 200 course that's like your guide to ikea hacking it could be like individual courses it's like the bedroom course the the off home office course the home garage you know the the garage gym course or whatever right like maybe different modules that i would do so i would maybe think about courses i would think about maybe i could sell these as kits so like maybe i could save you the hassle of having to go to ikea but like figure out oh i need this knob and then this little paper thing and then this other thing and then those three together are what you use to like make this vintage looking dresser maybe i would just sell the vintage looking dresser kit and it's it might just be as simple as a recipe walk into ikea go to the section 198 point c and go pick up this item right um and so it might be something like that i don't know what i would do but i do think there's like a small bootstrap business and this is a good business for somebody who is genuinely passionate about this right so like how do you take what i'll call your like okay this is not meant to be offensive but like there's a lot of hobbies that are like basic [ __ ] hobbies so what's a basic [ __ ] hobby basically tommy is a hobby that you think is unique to you it's like saying like no you're [ __ ] disgusting no offense uh like any time you say no offense it's like it would be just brace yourself for some offense yeah no don't [ __ ] hate me no offense so so no events here so like for guys the basic [ __ ] hobby is like sports oh bro i love i love the nba yeah you and like 80 million other people right now right so it's not like a unique hobby so you can't how do you turn your passion into business well it's not a unique passion so you're probably gonna have like a me too business unless you think of a new angle and so another basic [ __ ] hobbies like oh i love interior decorating it's like cool you and like 90 90 million other people who like to watch hdtv and just judge stuff or like you're happy to scroll on instagram pretty looking things and push like well i think that's why if you if you look at it from this angle with like ikea hacks you're finding a niche and you're building your own audience on that on that like that one kind of trend and then maybe you can release some kind of subscription product education product ddc product like something to that audience and now you've turned your basic we already talked about the basic [ __ ] version of this for us which was the knees over toes guy um yeah another another example of working out dude yeah another example of this is phillips hughes phillips hughes light bulbs crazy subreddit that is like has a rabid fan base i've actually like lighting or something right what is it phillips hues it started as just a bulb that was and you would say alexa make the bulbs or you know make the living room purple um but then they have like 50 other products now and people like have all these blogs and they're actually making good money i bet you like apartment therapy or like one of these bigger brands actually owns one of these blogs i'd have to scroll down and look at who the copywriter owns the copyright but basically it's blogs on where to put the lights like under the bed in order to make it feel cool right an example of who did this well is house of highlights i don't know if you followed them on instagram but they're they're big basically they they took espn sportscenter which was like this 30 minute television show highly produced and all i was doing was showing you the best highlights of the day and so back in the day you know like sports would happen all day and in the evening or the morning the next morning you would watch sportscenter to catch up through the best highlights right it's like just the sugar and house of highlights smartly realized hey you know we can just post those as like 10 second clips on instagram as soon as they happen all day and like i can basically have like two people two like people who like the nba just run this account and this account can grow to like a million people so the guy like omar created this thing i i i think literally owns it yeah so he ends up selling it to bleacher report and uh and runs it there they run it now i bet you whatever you sold it for you sold it for way too little um and so like you know overtime did kind of the same thing um but but anyways that's like an example of taking these like how do you take this content that's not your content it's not original content uh it's in this like kind of basic [ __ ] hobby and then you turn it into like a media media property that you own and then you own that audience and you can figure out what you want to do from there so there's this couple who uh they got popular because right before the pandemic started it was a french guy and his american girlfriend who are now husband and wife and they started baking croissants in their apartment and then they brought it to work and they like sold them to their friends or their co-workers uh and then eventually they created an instagram and they went viral and the apartment that i'm staying in right now bought like pre-ordered you have to pre-order eight weeks out because they're sold out for weeks and weeks and they're just baking this these croissants and cookies out of their apartment and the guy who owns my apartment got them and then ended up going out of the country and he's like hey you can actually have my order it's like 90 of like these fancy croissants and so on sunday i'm going to get those fancy croissants and i invited dave nemets the founder of bleacher report and his wife to come over and eat these like i was like hey you want to cut these are like fancy girl croissants like i don't unders at the time i didn't know the story but like for some reason i think this is a big deal you want to come over and eat these with your kids so i'll be eating croissants with the founder of bleach report on sunday and i can ask him the story about house highlights that's yeah do please do it's an amazing buy by him like like mad credit to them for picking this up before before espn or anybody else i think by the way he listens to the podcast or at least he like talks to us on twitter a bunch um and so he seems great and bleachy report i saw his talk at hustlecon very impressive um like the way they kind of like won and they survived i just remember this one anecdote he told which was he was like yeah we basically like every other content site was kind of like okay i might butcher this just because i'm trying to remember a talk from three years ago but here's what i remember him saying every other like sports news website was just talking about whatever was interesting to them they're all kind of putting out the same content he's like we needed to be smarter right like we needed to say every hour a writer is going to spend we don't have the same number of writers or budget so they need to spend writing articles that are going to get more traffic than anybody else and so he would just reverse engineer it so he like they would just study google searches and they would say oh everybody's searching when what time is the nfl draft he's like so we would immediately like have like the number one ranking thing on google for what time is nfl draft where to watch it and how to watch it and what's going to happen in the draft just like this kind of filler content on a website and he's like people really like the draft okay we're going to go like all in on the draft and we're going to write 10 times more content about the draft because that's what there's a big appetite for that espn is like under serving and so i thought it was pretty awesome how they took kind of like a supply demand approach to it instead of like an artsy right like an artsy approach of like oh you know this is what this is we're a journalistic publication and we should uh we should write the hard-hitting pieces about whatever or like you know well here's what i'm passionate about it's like no they like took a science approach to it which i liked and then the other founder went and did that he had a non-compete after he sold bleacher report so he couldn't do sports anymore but he started a media company called bustle which is like women's content so all types of articles but like an example of his long tail search strategy he deployed the same strategy so like if you google like what happens when i get my period while i'm on the beach like bustle will show up number one it's like there's only gonna be like a hundred people a month or something that's searched for that if i have no idea but like that i think i had heard through him that was one of the examples or if you google things like that you'll come across bustle and they do like over 100 million in revenue and so it still works right and by the way one insert was just pivoting off the instagram thing we talked about this in the past but there's some new news so we should bring it up we talked about this um this woman who's an influencer she's a fitness influencer on instagram kayla i think it's cenes or something i don't know exactly no i think it's it's every woman listening to this is just gonna be like what the [ __ ] guys i think it's it's new what there was something else we we tried to pronounce that we just like couldn't it was just like a like i don't know some some fancy luxury brand uh for purses or something like burmese yeah yeah she wears herpes of bags um so anyway she has this app so she basically took this instagram following it was just posting like workout clips on instagram and stuff her and her boyfriend i think or her husband i don't remember who was well before the app they were just selling a pdf sarah my wife exactly she bought it for 29. my sister-in-law has the pdf and she was just using this pdf for like is it like the the beachbody or if i don't forget what it's called it's like some some kind of like 30-day program yeah that's our 30-minute workout that was like you know from from this girl and she was buying the pdf then they turn it into an app right so they turn it into an app app starts doing great um my wife is a subscriber you pay 100 bucks a year and then you open up the app and it's basically like from what i remember you open up the app there's like five women who are like the trainers and it's like one is like very muscular one is like very just like thin one is like half kind of like toned or whatever another one has like a huge butt it's like which body do you want and go follow their program and so you would just pick it and then you would get like daily workouts kind of like a video that was like very good and so anyways that app was doing like i think they had done over 100 million dollars revenue i don't know if that's annual or cumulative but they just sold so i don't know if you have the details in front of you but they just sold for like 400 million dollars or something right like they just exited um exited the app this week yeah for 400 million they sold to this company called ifit which is about to go public they said they were doing 100 million in revenue um pretty amazing no-brainer to buy definitely worth it i think and it's pretty weird that 100 million if you're doing 100 million in revenue you uh you know you sold for for only 400 million so it's pretty low multiple for like a digital product but uh yeah they're probably not i don't think so probably spending a ton on on marketing okay um yeah i i maybe maybe not i mean she had 13 million followers and it is based on her uh thing on her uh on her following um can i tell you about an idea that someone just sent to me and i thought it was pretty amazing okay look at the thing called bird flow in the dock so it's called bird flow dot io did you click on that i saw you text me about it this morning but i haven't checked out this so tell me about it okay so this guy said it to me he goes hey i had this like software company and it was trying to do all these problems and solve all like it's called crowd flow or something like that and he's like it's a i spent three years working on it and then i just said [ __ ] it i'm just gonna create a really micro small app i'm gonna build it in two weeks it just does one thing really well it's called bird flow and if you click it it says marketing automation for twitter but basically i'll i'll tell you like it does three different things but the main thing is everyone who clicks follow on your profile it automatically sends them a message and you could say anything in that message like hey thanks for following or hey thanks for following check out my website and i installed it he's charging 29 i installed it and it's awesome it's awesome it's awesome i love these little micro sas tools i think it's so neat this is exactly how buffer got started and that's a multi-hundred million dollar business right yeah i like the the micro sas tool that does one simple thing that helps you win on a platform you're already like trying to win on that's the key right so like i'm already trying to win on twitter i'm trying to win on instagram trying to win on reddit whatever and if you could build the micro sas tool it's like here's you know other examples of them uh there's uh what's it called jungle scout which is for amazon so let's say you're trying to win as an fba seller on on amazon so you're selling a product on amazon jungle scout is this app you can use and basically when you're searching any amazon like search search result you can use you can open up jungle scout and it'll basically tell you how much that product is worth how much how much search volume there is for it how competitive it is to be in that niche and how much money they think that product is making so that you can find winning products that are like high demand low competition and then you could build a fba you know an fba business in that niche and so it's a simple sas tool i think jungle scout does some stupid amount of revenue too because they were recently partially acquired by pe in the hundreds of millions of dollars of valuation greg mercer is good friends with neville and in austin and uh he like uh this is i guess public i mean he's got like a plane and [ __ ] uh so whatever it was sold for like neville will post pictures going to like tell you ride in uh private jet and i'm like dude who's the jazz guy or he's the jungle scout guy the guy who sold part of the company who started it gotcha yeah so so super simple tool that just helped you in there and they just built they just kind of like dominate that one niche of like fba you know fba selling or in this case twitter automations right so oh somebody and so i like this a lot i need something like this uh for me because i'm trying to basically grow my audience on twitter and then cool the less work i can do the better right like i love digital sales people all right a digital sales person that's what i think about when i think about landing pages or like this like little like automations that's a digital sales person as somebody who's going to work 24 7 for me for zero cost or you know in this case whatever it was 29 a month um that's their salary and they're gonna do exactly what i say every single time predictably and uh they're just gonna generate more value for me and so i look at my landing page like a digital sales person i look at my automations like convertkit things like that as digital sales people and um yeah this is a really cool one i like this a lot now you can see this getting really annoying i mean people hate getting these auto dms but uh it still will work yeah yeah it it might be annoying but i actually just made mine it just says hey exclamation point thanks for following now here's the problem that i already found so i it's already sent out a couple hundred messages for me i guess i get maybe 500 to 1 000 new followers a day this uh i feel like a douche saying that this let's say it a couple women replied yeah so a couple like really attractive women applied and or replied saying like hey what's going on you know like your work basically they apply yeah so like these like attractive women replied and i was like [ __ ] i don't want like anyone to get the wrong idea to think that i'm hollering just at them or that i'm hollering at all you know and so i didn't reply to them but i was like oh my gosh like let's see i actually might be able to this could definitely get me in trouble a little bit i could totally see it right when that when that kind of i sent you that message it was kind of weird right it was hilarious um yeah i could see you know the same thing with somebody else pointed this out too which is like let's say you write a thread that goes viral you might get 5000 followers you're going to send out what 5 000 auto dms and then get like 2 000 random replies back it's gonna like kind of ruin your inbox and maybe get you banned from twitter i don't know because it'll just rate limit you so so i think there's some problems with it maybe maybe this guy's built in some rules like for me i would only want to do this i would only want to dm somebody who has over x followers or that i you know i already follow or something like that so then it kind of like limits the number of people that does it too you need it to be like hey you know only if it's a you know farmer looking white boy then send this so i don't get in trouble with my wife you know like i needed to be like this guy needs to have like you know patel or gupta at his last name if it's gonna send this auto dm so my indian fanboys can uh can get these messages from me but not everybody else yeah i could see it get me in trouble um all right you want to do another one yeah let's do one uh okay little idea that i think is kind of interesting um i don't have a ton to say about the business but it's more like this is a cool way to get ideas so this is my first time traveling with uh with babies and uh traveling babies it's like you know all the things you would expect like on the plane you know kid pooped through his clothes had to change it you know like on a tray table because we couldn't stand up because the fastest seatbelt sign the person next to us looking at is like we're gross and that is disgusting i mean you are exactly i know i know i agree um but there's a bunch of problems so like we had to take our car seats right because you can't just like be like i'll get there you know i used to pack light i used to be like cool i'll get there i just need my phone i'll call an uber get to my hotel if i'm missing something i'll just buy it there and with this with kids it's like the opposite it's like can't even get in an uber because you have to like have a car seat all that stuff so i saw this business called baby quip that i thought was kind of cool it's again one of our like telltale signs is any business that shows up at the top of a google's a popular google search but the website looks like it was last updated in like 1996 um those are businesses that print money and so it's like congratulations you have identified a money printer and so i don't know how successful baby clip is but i would suspect it's pretty good as a bootstrap business and what it does is it's basically a marketplace so i could say hey i just landed in las vegas i need two car seats i don't want to lug two car seats check them in uh you know like on the fly like you know drag them to the airport check them in take them home like just meet me at the airport with a car seat that i can just install into a rental car or i can saw into it to an uber or whatever uh and then like let me rent it for four days and then when i'm leaving come pick it back up from the airport and so that's what baby quip is it's a baby equipment but it's a marketplace where people will bring you what you need you need a stroller i got a stroller for you don't plug that heavy thing around just use mine when i'm here people are making a lot of money just google searching i was like i was google searching and again it's a very good content play i was google searching baby travel packing list so i was like what do i even what am i forgetting here and so they had a blog post i was like here's all the things you need to pack for your baby and then at the bottom it's like by the way if you don't want to pack your stroller and car seats because they're heavy as hell like you know you could just use baby clip and get it when you're there and i was like click through and i was like this is cool and so i just thought this is like a very clever business that is a look for problems look for annoyances look for inconveniences and then those become your opportunities if you can design a solution around them so i just have a clever little business this is awesome so baby quip is actually it's a peer-to-peer marketplace so i don't think you actually said that i thought it was the company that would give you stuff no it's just like jane whose kid outgrew her car seat and she realizes she can make you know 200 a month just renting it out to people as long as she's willing to go drop it off and pick it up from the airport i have these guys raised money they've been around for a while they haven't it doesn't look like they've raised money um but yeah they you know they are basically like just a kind of like a uh looks like a bootstrap business from everything i could tell launched in 2016. they've had over 30 000 orders uh i think they did a crowdfunding campaign at some point so maybe they're and they're on shark tank this is kind of interesting now i i'm not convinced that this is gonna this can be a huge huge thing but what is actually what is actually interesting is let's go to new york it tells you how many reservations someone has ever had i bet you that there could be like some mom who's just dominated like a la or a new york scene like can just rank really high on all the uh all the big cities and lend out all their stuff and so what it does is it tells you how much it so what basically what happens is you land in new york you but before you land you tell baby quip you hire camila shannon who's the top in new york she's rented her stuff out 773 times and she'll bring you any gear that you need and you could see all the gear that she has and she costs 40 to 60 to deliver the stuff to you plus there's gear for there's a a car seat for ten dollars a day there's a play pin for forty dollars a day there's 15 pound dumbbells for five dollars a day there's a this is crazy this is awesome this is awesome this is a great find yeah so so another example of this by the way have you used or or probably not used but you're familiar with them i'm assuming teachers pay teachers no what's that you've never heard of teachers pay teachers no why it doesn't doesn't matter this is just like one of those things that you know about because it's just awesome and uh so google teachers pay teachers so what this is is oh my god if you if you remember like a teacher spends a huge amount of time every teacher spends a huge amount of time like creating their lesson plans and quizzes and tests and they have to like keep recreating like content basically for their little classroom of 30 people it's pretty inefficient right so you go you you teach kids all day already kind of an exhausting thing now you go home and you um you have to grade papers you have to come up with tomorrow's lesson plan and then you have to design the quiz for thursday's quiz then you have next friday's test so you have all this stuff you're just constantly this content treadmill and what teachers pay teachers did that was genius was they said look that's a lot of effort and you may not be the best person at coming up with the lesson plan or the quiz for this science topic so why don't we just create a marketplace where any teacher can list their lesson plans their quizzes their tests and you can just find go instead of just making your own go on here for 10 bucks and go buy the best science thing for a fourth grader trying to learn about you know geology right now and you just go buy the thing for 10 bucks and you've saved four hours of time and so it's like a great trade so teachers pay teachers is a marketplace doing this some teachers were making millions of dollars just creating their uh putting their content up for sale here the business itself does i think 300 plus million dollars a year in revenue and growth and gross revenue yeah yeah it was bought by a private equity firm and like just look at their traffic on this thing man it's like over 30 million yeah yeah so it's an insane business um beautiful business too because it's like wow you turned some teachers who created amazing lessons and amazing tests and quizzes you turned them into stars and millionaires which is fantastic i think the best teachers should be millionaires in the age of the internet uh there's just no reason not that they shouldn't be on the other side you saved a bunch of money uh and a bunch of sorry you saved a bunch of time for all the other teachers so that they're more arrested and uh can go into class and perform instead of being you know like kind of falling behind constantly on the content treadmill and so i thought this is like you know an amazing idea same it reminds me of the baby equipped thing obviously this is much bigger much more successful but it's like these nice kind of like pain points turned into you know marketplaces solutions this is badass maybe you could also do this for speeches i uh i remember doing the uh my brother john um gave her wedding speeches he gave a great best man speech and that's a great idea three people uh paid him money to write their speech uh and i think that you could do that for uh i think you could start with just wedding speeches but eventually do all other types of speeches dude that is hilarious and there's absolutely do that because there's a ton of googling right like when you have to give your speech you're like oh god pressure super high rep like how many reps have i had doing this zero um okay let me go to google and let me try to get some inspiration let's try to get the ball rolling people go to youtube and they try to watch like you know best best man speech ever right best bridesmaid speech ever and then you're like okay like what am i gonna do copy this not quite but if somebody created these with templates um that could be pretty good i like that yeah i actually think you could do that there's this company called book in a box started by tucker max who was one of my investors before it was uh when they did book in a box they would you'd pay them any number from 20 to 100 000 on a bunch of different options and they would write a book about your life so you could like get speaking gigs or you could give to your kids or like whatever for any different reasons you look like an expert be a thought leader and then a lot of their authors started getting speech offers you know they would someone would pay 10 20 30 000 to have someone come and talk about like best practices and meetings because some guy had wrote a book on how meetings suck and how to make them better and then they created a new subsidiary that would write you do your powerpoint and presentation for you and you'd pay more money for that and i was like that's cool that should probably be the business more so than just the book thing right uh and so i think that actually teachers paying teachers you could also do speakers paying speakers i mean you could do the same thing there's another uh angle to this which is i think that teachers are sort of this extremely teachers and nurses these are two workforces that are very very large they have a unique set of problems they're extremely like kind of word of mouth heavy and i don't think that the existing solutions were great for them so on the podcast a long time ago we had uh the founder of like incredible health come on which is basically like a kind of like a job marketplace thingy like a kind of a link danish i had four nurses that was right before uh covent how'd that do uh they raised a bunch of money i don't know if they're doing well or not but i can't really say but um but they've raised a bunch of money because the opportunity is large meaning there are so many nurses and there's a shortage of nurses and there's high demand for nurses so there's nurses so there's a lot of fees paid for placements so nurses want great jobs and then hospitals and and clinics basically are happy to pay to place nurses and so there's a lot of money to be made if you can build the right network there if you can build a vertical linkedin for just nurses and i think there's a similar opportunity for teachers not in terms of placing teachers because it's not the same level of demand for like hiring teachers or but i do think that i do think that if you build like a professional networking thing for teachers that's better um they don't necessarily want or need to use linkedin i think you could build a custom solution that is for teachers it's like how do teachers how are teachers going to engage with like kind of like their peers all right what do they need to do are they going to do they need to share tips do they are these job opportunities is it content like teachers pay teachers i think if you did a brainstorm if you were in if that's that's the niche you were in i think there's a lot of opportunities for teachers just because they're such a huge workforce and the generic solution like linkedin is not going to be tailored to them how much do you think teachers paying teachers got acquired for i would say if i was gonna put a guess i would say 500 million dollars yeah i i would i would guess 400 500 because it is kind of a monopoly in its niche or more or more even if or rather if you said it's worth more than that now i wouldn't be surprised yeah a week in research i didn't research i didn't plan to bring it up but but we can look it up it might be it might be out there publicly no i don't want to upload your twitter two more uh yeah i don't have much more what do you have i blew my load early i have one uh okay so we can we can end on kind of like this life wisdom thing so so last night uh we're hanging out we're talking uh you know i'm hanging out with with some other folks who are traveling with us and uh yeah family members and so i i was i asked this question i said all right um i said what do you think i said let's take fast forward you're so how old are you 31 something yeah you're 31. i said all right fast forward you're 90 years old and let's say your life like you have your life as it's gone so far and then let's just kind of like project forward like it just keeps going the way that things have been going like the on the track you're on let's say you continue on the track you end up at 90. um what do you think if you look back you're going to be most happy with the way you lived your life and then what do you think you're going to regret the most about the way you lived your life so far and so i was curious after i asked that question i got some answers from the group i was curious i was like i'm going to ask sam this because i don't know what he would say i think it's a hard question to be fair but i'm curious what comes to mind uh for you um i would say that i let my temper control things you know i i lose my temper easily sometimes you know you've seen it sometimes when i get mad at you or when i get mad at dan or someone else and it's like it's sometimes they've actually done something that is warranted um oftentimes it's like it's not that big a deal and so i get super [ __ ] frustrated and i'll hold grudges over like a relatively small frustration and i let my emotions control some of my decisions and uh i've lost a lot of money and a lot of friends because of it so that's what i regret is that and i work quite hard to fix it but i i wish i would have been even more aware of that early on what else do i do i regret that's a great answer do i think that i'll regret um i i wish i didn't spend years neglecting my health thinking like oh i can get to it later on like i should have fun now i wish that when i was a kid um my parents instilled uh healthy eating habits because i think that like that still kind of [ __ ] with me right like eating a lot of bad sugar what else um what about the other what about the what about the flip side what's the one thing you're gonna look back and you'll be like you know glad glad that you you you lived that way or you did that thing or you you made those choices starting at age 20 i wrote this down i said by 30 i want to i want to have started and started something that will make enough money that when i have children i won't ever have to worry about how to give them what they need and also i'll be able to spend time with my family even though i didn't have a family or anything like that i was like that's what i think i'm gonna want by that time i'm 30 so i'm gonna work against that and i achieved that and so um i'm most proud that i now can can only worry about the emotional aspects of the family even though i don't even have a family right okay i'm most proud i got that problem out of the way the the the financial problem what do you think of that question is this uh is a good question or is it it's a really good question i i actually changed it around i ask myself this all the time well it's quite similar i go i think like how what can i do today that will make my future self proud and not regretful right and so i thank myself for and and and i say 10 years but i would actually change it to six months because often times how many times and the other question i ask myself is in six months will you wish that you have done this or wish that you had started trying to do blank so it's like losing weight exercising is a really good one sick in six months will you look back at yourself and be like [ __ ] i wish i already had started learning how to speak spanish i wish i already would have read these books i wish i already would have done this so just [ __ ] do it make your future self proud so um that's the question i asked i think it's a great question and what was your answer what do you regret and what are you proud of so i had trouble with the regret side i was thinking about it and i was like okay i went through some i said i couldn't think of an easy answer so i said okay what happens when you can't think of the answer right away you you just start throwing out what might it be right so that it doesn't have to be this but what even comes to mind and so i was like oh well i regret kind of like spending too much time working okay it's possible um no i don't think so i mean i think you got you're pretty healthy with that you worked really hard when you were single or not married yeah i work like three times harder than i work now so something that made that shift well i was like will i regret um like working on the wrong things like oh you just worked on this like like right now i'm building this dvc business it's like oh well like you know this this frankly this is a business that's meant to make money it's not like the joy of my life like this podcast is more like the joy right this is the fun and it's building up into something that's big but like the business i'm doing is i'm doing it as a business so maybe i'll say uh why didn't i go try to like change the world in a bigger way maybe i'll say that i started brainstorming these and what i realized was that the only things i think i'm going to regret are either going to be health related but even then when i by the time i'm 90 i don't know how much i'm going to care about that if i you know if i got to 90 so it didn't quite work but i think if i asked that question for like 50 or 60 i would say definitely one of the top answers would be taking care of my health better um you know just just prioritizing that number one um number two was like any when you're i think when you're 90 you're short on time so you'll probably i'll probably look back and think [ __ ] i pissed away a bunch of time on the wrong stuff and so i that's what i that's the second category is like where am i pissing away time that when i look back i'm gonna say i can't believe i wasted those precious years on the wrong stuff or the wrong things caring about the wrong things or even in the moment focusing on the wrong things the last one is relationships it's like i think ultimately so my answer that i came came to in the end was i'll probably regret not having more kids because i think the older i get the more joy i'm gonna have like the most the most value and joy in my life is just gonna come from my kids and i know right now it feels like oh my god i can't i couldn't plot i have two i couldn't possibly have another because why it's already so hard with two how's your wife she's young it's not the it's not the biological clock it's like the workload it's like oh my god like how am i how do i have another kid with these two kids with the business stuff with the podcast with the 10 things that i do you know and in two years you can sure i'm not saying dylan i guess what i'm saying is i think that's the one thing if i look back i'm probably gonna wish i had more kids because it's probably gonna be from age 65 to 90. it's probably gonna be the number one thing number one source of fun in my life is gonna be my kids i think you should uh you should address that i told sarah i want five and so we froze our embryos listen to this we froze our embryos and i've got six kids the reason uh i don't know okay sarah's got this sarah's got this thing sarah's got this thing there's just a net genetic component that we made sure we didn't want to pass on so the kids were healthy and um i got five kids all girls and so uh i'm asking her if i can go and do it and do it again because i would like to have two boys two girls right and so i've got five kids waiting for me but they're all girls so anyway um i actually think that that's a good one i asked my twitter following how many of you uh how do you feel about kids and age and you almost unanimously the people who had so this is like a biased survey you're right so it's like what do you mean how do you think about kids in age what does that mean uh i forget well i forget the exact way that i asked it but i said do you wish that you'd had kids sooner or later in life okay gotcha and uh and of course like there's like a bias here like people who are already bought into one category will likely answer and support that category or support that decision but almost unanimously i feel like the answer was i wish i had my kids sooner in life and that actually shocked me because particularly in new york silicon valley la the coastal bigger cities it's actually versus like missouri where i'm from it's actually more normal to get married and have kids at 21 22 23 whereas on the coast coast it's like 31 32 33 and you're constantly told you know just wait just wait even like andrew wilkinson told me a couple of my friends told me and i guess you're you you have consent you could actually give your opinion most everyone said i wish i had kids sooner and one guy actually changed my perspective on everything he i go why why do you think that he goes because now i'm just going to die sooner and i wish i could have spent more time with them yeah i don't i don't know the answer i think whatever i think it works either way it's not really i don't really i don't think there's a right answer there but uh but i i kids are great they critics are really great um so so i like that question i like the one you had too so i guess like if i was gonna do i recommend people do this after the podcast if you've listened this far i would basically write down both i would say what's the thing i'm gonna thank myself for and what's the thing i'm gonna regret when i'm 90 uh about the way i'm living my life right now and and if i just project it forward and then there's the one you said which is six months from now what's the thing i'm going to wish i had started doing now or stop doing now yeah i'm still gonna wish i'd done it then there's a lot you could do in six months and now you're not gonna maybe have a life-changing thing but like you can lose 60 pounds in six months maybe you can um learn a little bit of a language enough to like go and speak maybe in a different country and you could read a bunch of books you can learn a new you could learn how to play the piano in six months i mean you could do a lot of like interesting stuff so yeah you could go uh you know repair the shitty relationship you have with your dad or whatever you know you could do you could do many many things uh i guess that's the other one i thought about for for for the regret is like uh not having maybe spent more time or being kind of like just like nicer to my parents like i know i'm gonna miss them a lot when they're gone and they're gonna go like it's gonna happen and once they do i'm just gonna i think that's probably gonna be one of the things i'm gonna wish why didn't i why didn't i you know talk to him more or spend more time or you know tell him you know thanks you know something like that is probably going to be one of my answers for that so i'll wrap this i'll wrap this up with a quick story that hopefully will change people's change people's perspective so do you know who ramit sethi is safety he's got this business book business slash book a huge brand called i will teach you to be rich he's a good friend of mine and whenever i have money like doubts or questions i call him and he kind of like so for example and he always like thinks about everything like very thoughtfully and i was talking to him about buying a ring from my wife years ago and i go how much should i spend and he goes uh like i told him i wanted to spend 5 000 and he was like no no no no and he like told me a budget way higher he goes trust me and he explained his reasoning and i and i listened to him i went and bought a ring that was i i spent 27 000 on the ring and i didn't have that much money what was his reasoning though his reasoning was like first of all it's your wife like whatever she wants like what's the point of working hard it's to make someone like your wife proud and happy and she's going to want to show this off she'll just make her happy second if you're going to be married to her for potentially 80 years who gives a [ __ ] over 20 grand divided by 80 grand or 80 years um and he goes just don't be cheap on the stuff that actually matters this probably really matters to her now some people doesn't matter but then the second thing was i called for me and i go hey ramit you took your family to europe one time to italy he goes yeah uh you want me to plan yours for you and i go well yeah but what do you mean he goes well like i love doing this and i'll plan yours for you but i only have one rule i said what he goes i'll plan it for you but you have to have an unlimited budget i was like what the hell he goes dude the whole point of traveling with your family like you're very so i'm taking my mom and dad and my wife to italy my parents have really never been out of the country other than one time to visit me in australia and he goes i'm gonna get you got to give them on a limited budget i was like dude i was gonna spend like fifteen thousand maybe and he goes no no no we're gonna spend 50 at least and i was like that's so much money he goes dude you're never going to go out of the country again with your family and i've done it before like one time it's the one thing that they will never stop talking about and i don't care if i only had a hundred thousand i'm spending fifty thousand because this is the whole point of working really really hard is spending my money on stuff that will make my family happy and they'll talk about forever and i was like you're right i need to quit being a cheapskate i'm gonna just so i bought my mom and dad first class they've never been first class first class tickets to europe um we're gonna like have a great time and it kind of changed my perspective on spending and being tight so that's my quick little story that's amazing i love it alright we should we should end on that uh all right good episode dan what do you think this was good i'll give you guys a nine and a half no okay good i'll take that last one was an eight but or an eight and a half all right that's the episode i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on a road let's travel never looking back

i think this is a good strategy you say no to most everything then when you see the thing that you're like this is it you go 100 all in on it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to all right we're live you you didn't know enough about red ventures to bring that up uh i talked to somebody who sold their company to red ventures and they were telling me about it and i was like oh i just made a note i was like fascinating gotta go research more so i put it on here just to be like i'm gonna go research more and then you added i know a lot in all caps so you already know a lot which is great maybe we we can talk about later also another thing that i actually forgot to add this i was watching the ufc fight and do you remember about four weeks ago maybe two weeks ago we discussed this business of giving away like cars and you have to um i saw an ad at the bottom of the ufc fight and i think that like one way that i find ideas is anyone who's doing brand advertising so there's two types of well i guess there's many types of advertising but there's the first type is performance which is uh you click on something and i could i could see 100 when you purchased and i could see everything about that and i could like attribute it's it's attribution market marketing performance marketing is what it's called the second is brand marketing so like billboards or what's another example i don't even know yeah just tv commercials right you do a commercial you don't know necessarily and they try to measure it but in reality budweiser when they run a commercial at the super bowl it's because they're trying to build awareness they want budweiser to be top of mind maybe they want to talk about their zero calorie beer they're just trying to build awareness and they're not directly hoping that you watch that open up your phone by budweiser right that moment that's not the way that that that marketing is designed they hope that you eventually walk into the store and it influences you this is what geico does and often early early-stage companies particularly tech companies who are like savvy with internet marketing start with performance and then when they exhaust that then they go all right now like we need to like just we just need more people in the world to know about this product and so what i love doing is i like looking at who's doing brand advertising because not always but often that means that they're like crushing it yeah it's like buying art if you're buying art you're rich if you're buying brand ads your company's rich yes that's a great example and i saw uh ufc they had this ad for watch gang and i think watch game may be sponsored in an embedded episode but then also like before one of the fights it said this episode is brought to you by watch gang getting a rolex every month and i was like what is going on with that what is that i've never heard of watch gang and i know a little bit about watchers or at least i'm a fan and so i don't want to i even though i am kind of bringing it up but i don't want to get into it too much but they were doing i went to watchking.com and they were doing a contest for a rolex giveaway rolex yeah this so my co-worker at twitch uh when i was there he um he came up to me he shows me his watch and i'm like hey man nice watch he's like i got this in this uh this watch club that i'm in so tell me more and he tells me about watch gang and he's like yeah i found this website i had no idea if it's a scam or not he's like it's crazy this watch is like a 250 watch and i'm paying 30 bucks a month like i don't really understand every month they send me another watch and i was like i was like okay it sounds fishy like he's like yeah exactly so i didn't even know if anything would come but like look at this it's here and um and so then i went and played with it and it's like one of these like super optimized websites it's like you you open up the website bam let me get your email for this thing oh you don't want the email spin the wheel and win some more oh you spun the wheel okay you have 30 seconds to finish your checkout or else you're gonna like your family will be taking ransom and so it's like this like and if you go to it it's just like one hero image and then it's like uh you know the tagline basically is uh you know get new watches sent right to your door do you keep them you sure do are the watches good no sir they're amazing right so it's like well-written copy huge hero image i'm like this site prints money and so i just made a mental note about watch gang at that moment and it's like a mystery box like you don't know which watch you're gonna get you might get one of those thousands of dollars watches or you might get the like hundred dollar watch but you're always getting a watch of good value and the weird thing is who needs this many watches i don't know nobody needs 12 watches a year as far as i'm concerned but maybe i'm just not the demo yeah so when i see this stuff like if you're in the internet long enough which you know it's not that you don't need to do it that much in order to see that when you see something like this you're like something is going on to where it's maybe a scam and full of it but also like if you told me this made 200 million dollars i would be like yeah yeah i totally buy it it's an arbitrage place so it's the same way that like um you know most of the d2c brands they're not like truly making the best products but they're like look if we're really good at facebook marketing or if we're really good at affiliate marketing or really good at whatever influencer marketing then we could build like movement watches they built 100 million dollar plus luxury watch brand in two years they made it sound like a old school brand they you know they partner with all these influencers they use this market it's a marketing company not a watch company really and so that's what this is for sure this is a marketing company not a watch company they could swap this out and do this with golf clubs they could do this with shoes they could do this with whatever you could just you could take this watch gang website and you could do it with sneakers right now and i think you would do pretty well i think there's something with that there must be something where they're getting the watches you know super discounted somehow like these might be like out of style watches or refurbished or some i don't know what they're doing but there has to be some way that they're able to give you this watch and still make money in the something what i don't know if it's 30 bucks still or i don't know how much this i don't know why i i saw the ad whenever i see people advertising on the ufc i think uh they're like there's a lot of new brands like manscaped advertisers there and i had heard of manscape and then they advertised in the ufc i'm like oh they they must be monsters they're so you have to be okay with your logo getting covered in blood and i think most brands just don't want that and then the brands that were okay with that got this big upside of a huge amount of eyeballs for a very low uh very low ad cost and so early on you know it looked like nascar every fighter would come out and they'd have like 50 logos of like from their mom and pop like barber shop in their local town to like you know some random insurance company or uh you know energy drink or whatever and they've been trying to get it more and more mainstream although they just announced 175 million dollar deal with crypto.com is crypto.com scammy or legit i don't know anything about it well they offer eight percent uh return eight percent cash back so that's how you know it's uh it's probably not totally uh uh it's not that it's a scam it's again it's like these sort of hand-wavy types of things it's like yeah you get our crypto card it's a metal card it's awesome and then when you spend you earn eight percent in crypto bucks say wait what's a crypto book that's our own currency we created it's like oh god it's like you got to hold 5000 crypto bucks and then you earn the eight percent it's like uh dude do i want to go buy five thousand dollars of your crypto buck in order to earn the eight percent here i don't know i don't think so yeah they they let a lot of stuff like that and and advertise with them but um i want to bring up a couple topics you have a few ideas but you talked about this house thing so i want to ask you about that um yeah first time since covid we went to uh vegas and i'm staying in a house uh i'm staying with somebody and their house is unbelievable dude i am like like a family member this is somebody i'm related to yes so this is this is a house that's i think it's worth like probably 15 million dollars and 50 million dollars in san francisco we'll give you a fat house 50 million dollars in vegas let's give you what what i mean i'm in a resort i'm in a personal resort like i was walking in and i was like trying to not trip into the koi ponds along the way just to the door door opens up there's a freaking you know from the hotel that little what the bell man has that cart to take your [ __ ] to your room they have one of those because the room is so far away from the door because they're just so big of a house and so i use that i get to my room my room is like you know everything's magical dude we were eating dinner and then all of a sudden like a convertible the roof retracted from over our heads the walls disappeared they went away and then we all went swimming in this pool that surrounds the dining room while looking out at downtown vegas it's unbelievable and the reason i say this is because i thought i knew how much money i wanted i thought i'd do what i wanted and now that i've stayed in this house i'd like some more money please that's that's my brutally honest feeling my raw emotion that i have 24 hours into this house is oh [ __ ] this okay yeah i can be happy without this but why can't i do this too this is this is pretty nice i've never seen how much do you think you need to have to have a 15 million dollar house what do you think your your like investable asset like relatively liquid net worth needs to be like 60 70. i think 100 to be safe 70 if you're 60 70 if you're uh like 50 60 i guess if you're if you're just kind of like playing it you're you're comfortable with it being riskier i guess or like if that 50 60 that you have is not totally at risk you could say oh okay you know i've got that cashed out i'm gonna put it in safe investments and 15 million i'll put into my house um this house was previously owned by somebody who's like kind of what their grandfather started like caesar's or one of the casinos two of the casinos downtown and so it's like a billionaire family and they sold the house to these guys and then they uh and then actually the funny thing is they sold the house uh and then they regretted it as soon as they sold it to them the day later they were like hey you know the broker calls broker says my client really regrets selling that house oh no and it was one person living here so it was like this it's this enormous like you know 30 car garage bowling alley type of thing i don't know if there is i haven't even explored the whole house yet i've only seen like one-fourth of the house so far but um she called back i'll give you a million dollars extra in cash just to have the house back one day later and they turned it down dude i think that's cool i i love visiting that in my head i think i actually don't want that maybe maybe it's because if you're wealthy enough to buy that then you just have people who could take care of it but when i think of owning something uh that expensive and that nice i'm like oh my gosh i need to take care of it yeah that sounds like a lot of work uh i think that's true for most things i feel differently about a house for two reasons one is i think a house like this makes sense when you have what they have like tons of kids basically so you have you have like a full family uh right they have four kids and it's like um this is your family's compound it's like this is your home base your kids like you kind of you wouldn't really do this i don't think if you're a bachelor if you're a bachelor you want to be you know penthouse in manhattan or something cool like that but this is different this is like it's a suburban home right but it's like a family compound so i think that's the first thing the second thing is a yacht or like cars those are like low use high maintenance whereas a house is like tremendously high use and actually quite low maintenance for for most homes because for you know they have a cleaning staff they have like people that can come take care of stuff and yeah there's bills i'm not saying there's no bills i guess what i'm saying is it's not like a car where you're worried about getting scratched when it goes out when you go park it anywhere and you're driving anywhere and most of the time it's just sitting idle unused in a garage with a tarp on top in this case for a house you're constantly in it you're constantly using it especially if you have a big family so i would say house is the one area where i would splurge uh almost every other material possession like fancy clothes cars it just doesn't make sense to me when i hear about people like this i always the same question pops up in my head which is how much should they spend per month so if you had to guess this person's total family uh expenses including the house what would you guess it i imagine you get a mortgage on it you get a mortgage on a 15 million dollar house like like randy moss said straight cash baby they had they had to in order to get the house they had to like go in oh my gosh so you don't have a mortgage on the house normally a mortgage i mean what they do is they can finance it afterwards so they buy it in cash and then they'll go and they'll refinance it basically get they'll cash out you know they'll leave 30 down and then they'll take the other 70 they'll pay you know some percentage but for this you can't even get a traditional mortgage for this yeah you get like a rich perspective so they got like a hard money loan basically if they wanted to cash it out or okay so including that let's not include that that's hard to conclude yeah because that's even hard to calculate i don't even know what that i mean that could be like 100 a month i don't know what it would be that's a lot but life expenses not including the house which is a a ton yeah i would not be surprised if it was between a hundred and two hundred thousand dollars a month that'd be my no i wouldn't be surprised i wouldn't be surprised that's so much money to spend it could be a little less could be 70. it's definitely not less than 50. it's my guess i'll ask you today i'll find out where that's always that's a good question um she's like what's your burn yeah exactly what's your burn that's a good question so let me tell you really quick and uh so this house this there's a lot next to my house that i mean you know that little crappy shack that was next to my house yeah it's for sale i think i'm gonna buy it and i'm gonna build a house there and try to sell it or rent it out and i'm excited to do this and i'll talk about this on this podcast i'm excited to do it because i've never done a project like this i've never done like a physical business really i've only done uh you know digital stuff and i think it's gonna be exciting do you think that's a stupid idea or a smart idea no i think it's a smart idea because it's gonna like kind of change the way you look at the world a little bit and it's right next to you if this was like even two miles away i'd be like nah dude it's just a headache when it's literally right next to you that takes a lot of the like overhead of managing a project or even thinking about a project or researching whether there's a good or bad buy it's like okay what's the worst case scenario you're gonna have a house next to the house you have you already like this neighborhood you already like being there your friends are all there you're going to be able to like airbnb this with low maintenance because it's right next door you know you'll never have to worry about it and uh your friends can come crash there when it's not rented out um or you can like expand to it if you build your dream house right you can build your dream house right next to you which is a fun fun project to do for you and sarah and uh then maybe you leave your house you go to that house if you like build it for it takes a year to build or whatever so i think it's a great idea um and it's not like it's not about it's not a financial idea in my opinion it's a it's a life idea it's a it's a fun thing to do that will probably break even to be profitable when you do it what i'm learning uh about finances is that you know you and i talk about investing in different stuff you can just just your average joe has access to this as well so this isn't like there's just if you just park it into a general fund like a general index fund life is so easy and you get almost amazing returns like compared to everything else do you know what i mean like it's so easy you don't have to well you need a big base right that's the problem for most people yes that that vehicle is available for most people but let's say you're getting seven percent a year you put a hundred thousand dollars in okay cool you made seven thousand dollars pre-tax right now you have 107 000. you need to let that [ __ ] compound for like 15 20 years and like charlie munger once said when they asked him what hey your guys's playbook seems pretty simple why don't more people do it he said no one wants to get rich slow i think that's the problem is that nobody wants to take a small base and let it compound for 20 years or very few people do and that's that's the issue there yeah it is it's boring but it works and then um i want to bring up one quick topic i met three interests two three interesting people this week so i think people like hearing this i enjoyed hearing this about this 15 million house all right i met this guy named jason have you ever heard of this company called block works block works no is this like a construction company no it's right up your alley it's a media it's basically like the hustle like morning brew like axios but for crypto oh okay i think it's blockworks.io maybe dot co maybe oh is it dot co um so block works it's this guy bootstrapped he's only 27 years old i went to his house last night in new york uh in brooklyn awesome business probably will do eight figure yeah maybe 10 north of 10 million in revenue this year completely bootstrap started it because he used to monetize so he was like 23 years old and he cole emailed pomp and said listen to this podcast i'm working on come to this event just like he was just like constantly emailing him pop pop who's this big bitcoin guy but who was less of a big bitcoin guy years ago said all right you've been emailing me too much whatever you're persistent i'm thinking about launching this podcast i need help launching it and monetizing it do you want to help this kid who was a kid at the time said yes and then eventually launches a crypto media company called block works he launches it three or four years ago it's only an llc so he completely owns it it's not like it didn't raise any money really fascinating business very simple and he just picked the right category and now they're doing conferences it's a slick looking website right yeah you go to it it looks like bloomberg or something you know it looks like a proper you know it just looks like a template of a good news site in general and so i think he's like the subscriber base to this right so like is this done through email or done through direct site visits they make a lot of money through email and then they have podcasts so so there's and then they have conferences and so they have a conference for what it's worth showing them close to half a million visits a month yeah so it's not it's probably that's like if you look at our uh traffic the hustle.com maybe we were uh two times that and i know that we had eight hundred thousand to a million a month right and um and we had talked about coin market cap recently which was uh probably the bigger player in this space so coin market cap sold to uh finance i think and how much they sell for was like hundreds of millions right five hundreds of millions if it didn't sell for that it's worth that and the shocking thing was that coin market cap had like a larger monthly traffic volume than i think the new york times or wall street journal i think it was uh which just shows you like the level of interest like when we talked we joked about this we were like oh like how do we make this podcast grow and i was like pivot to crypto there's just like this insane appetite for crypto content because people get in they think they're going to get rich and every day there's a news cycle of like the world the world is you know we're going to the moon or the world is crashing and like what's going on and so crypto was a phenomenal um place to go so i like block works i want to share one thing but did you have something else on block where she was here i have a topic related to block works no he it's just an interesting business i just thought it was interesting it's just not how big look at their about page it looks like they have 20 people on board um i don't know who's full time and who's not full-time but and then if you click their podcast they have like 12 podcasts it's like a type of company where uh you it it is sexy in that like it's a media company for crypto i mean that's definitely sexy but the guy is he's 27 but he runs it just like a small business where he just he just slowly adds and adds hats and i think it's really fascinating i think they're i think if i had a bet and i don't have uh i just got to know him and i don't we didn't even talk about this if i had a bet i i would imagine you're going to see this company sell for in the 40 to 50 million range in the next 18 months and i just wanted to bring it up now to call it out uh about like see it before it actually happens right i would take the over on that i think it's gonna sell for more if the numbers you're saying or what it is just looking at it i think um traditional media companies don't sell for that much if it's only i don't know what the revenue is exactly but it's in the range of 10 million if it only if they only do let's say 9 million in revenue that's probably only worth 25 million dollars you're not putting the crypto premium right so so companies sell based on their story and i think the story here is going to be that hey look this is where this is where financial news is going financial news being probably the biggest kind of most valuable segment of the news uh not biggest in terms of popularity but most valuable per per user right so the wall street journal um you know it's a very valuable publication because every one of their users is interesting and interested in investing somewhere between thousands or millions of dollars and so i think if your crypto if you're the crypto bloomberger the crypto wall street journal um like we saw that coin market cap sold for several hundreds of millions not necessarily because their revenue was that much higher but because a big exchange wanted to grow and exchanges are worth like coinbase is worth 80 80 to 100 billion dollars so uh binance similar like these company the exchanges are so big they were like great we need a media arm right this trend we've been talking about hubspot oh we want a media arm robin hood we want a media arm and so they've been buying up media companies in order to own their own media arm which is basically cheap user acquisition for them and so whether it's them or it's a traditional media company that will buy i don't know but i do think that a crypto news site is going to get whatever whatever a normal media site would sell for i'd put a two and a half x on it for for crypto right now because it could be i wouldn't doubt it and and what i told him is what i would tell the audience as well which is sell to a tech company don't sell to a media company if you want to create a media company build it in hopes of selling to a tech sam's like make a list of enterprise sas companies then it's just like them and take an all stock deal all right now now you have set yourself up no i'm just saying like do you think that a media company is going to 3x in market cap value like pretty quickly or do you think that coinbase will i think you would much rather go there right but yeah i would rather own 50 million dollars of coinbase stock than i would have ca uh of uh new york times stock right right um another sort of related thing on this so i was thinking back i was doing some reflection uh yesterday actually i was thinking about uh crypto and i don't know if i've told you the story but basically very early on uh my crypto story was like this we were at lunch at the uh i was running an idea lab so that's a good position to be in when new things happen running an idea lab you got a bunch of engineers and designers you already have funding and you're ready to take a new idea and just chase the market so bitcoin i think at that time had its first kind of pop from like the seven dollar range to like i don't know what it was 20 bucks and then 100 bucks and it was all happening within a period of like one or two months uh that that first bike happened then it came crashing down after 100 back to like 17 or something like that exact numbers are wrong but ballpark bitcoin is very cheap back then and our um our sis admin guy pete uh who's like kind of like a very early internet guy like would hang out all day at work he'd be in the irc channels not slack and he's talking to other sis admins at other companies and [ __ ] like that and these guys like and he was always like a security like he was always like ah these big companies are tracking us and like you know he's the kind of guy that would use duckduckgo early on type of thing and so he was like in the right community for something like bitcoin and so he starts telling us he's like oh bitcoin bitcoin's amazing dude we're mining he's like mining it on our servers in the office he's like yeah it's great i love bitcoin and we're like ah here's pete you know pete who's kind of like a like a more like a neckbeard archetype right he's like oh pete's you know really into some something again great yeah so what's he worth now well i didn't take it too seriously but i think he was more like a lot of people who early on they weren't putting a ton of like cash into it they were mining it or they were like earning it for doing a job and then spending it because they were like wanted to be a part of this new economy uh by the way have you ever heard that story about andreas antonopoulos do you know who that guy is no oh maybe is he the guy who looks like is he greek he i think he's greek yeah based on the name but he's basically um he was like the bitcoin evangelist so he was just when bitcoin came out he was going and talking everywhere just talking i know who he is as a person bitcoin's amazing he wrote this bitcoin book it's great and so anyways he's given like he's spread the gospel he's like what you need when you have a new movement it's like this guy was out he was i don't know much about the bible but like you know he wasn't jesus but he's like you know paul or whoever was you know taking the gospel and going to spreading it and so he um he'd been doing this for years and he had been earning any money he had he would only take in bitcoin and then he would spend it on his rent and he would spend it on his coffee he wanted to live in crypto and live what he was preaching that this new financial system with real kind of like hard money true money uh sound money as they say is is the is the way to go and so anyways bitcoin price keeps going up up and up and people are like oh andreas you must be like a millionaire 100 times over by now no and he's like well no like i was living off bitcoin i was spending it like i was like i was earning it for talking at some things but i didn't charge a ton because i just wanted to get the word out he's like and then when i had it i was using it to pay rent and i have a family and like no i actually i i actually didn't have a ton well he wasn't saying it like you know pity me he was just like you know contrary to belief popular belief here's the case and so there's this guy on um on twitter friend's name he's like this famous guy who he forked bitcoin and like has his uh he owns bitcoin.com he's kind of like this he's not very well liked in the bitcoin ecosystem roger van roger vera or something like that is his name so he starts making fun of andreas on twitter he's like oh my god the biggest bitcoin like you know like uh carnival barker for all these years didn't even make money when bitcoin shot up in price to thousands of dollars per coin like like what a joke uh like like nice one schmuck he starts making fun of him and then the bitcoin community rallied and overnight donated anonymously to his wallet and made made andreas a millionaire in bitcoin overnight um of people people donating money because they were like no i got into it because of this guy he's getting made fun of because he didn't profit off of this like [ __ ] that uh so i thought that was like a pretty cool moment like one of the cool parts not the like annoying part anyways back to my story i'm uh i'm in the idea lab and basically my cto catches the bug too and he starts saying he's like yeah fiat is trash i'm like what is fiat a car like what are you talking about and he's like fiat currency that means currency that you know the government makes up and prints like by there by their fiat they create this currency he's like it's bad i'm like well okay why like the dollar seems fine and he's like yeah it's fine till it's not fine look at the history and he starts telling me about this this i'm like yeah but that's like ancient history he's like just yesterday japan announced that they're going to double the money supply in the next 10 years i was like that can't be good right he's like yeah that's massive dilution that's like if you just doubled the shares in this company right now i would be pissed and he's like he's like so he's like we should do something i'm like okay paul like run with it what's the idea normally paul was the guy i would give directions to he's not the ideal guy he's like tell me what to build i'll build it i can build anything and in this case he's like mocking up a website and he's based like crypto doesn't have any of the basic like financial instruments that uh that the normal economy has so all we got to do is just build either an exchange or a like kind of like a maybe like an ach protocol or like a place to deposit in a savings account like we just need something like that for crypto so he mocks it up we start going with it and uh our ideal lab was backed by this couple michael and sochi burch which makes an individual couple who's you know independently very wealthy and so he come michael comes by for lunch the next day he's like hey the lawyer like our lawyer susan told us that you're uh you're doing like a bitcoin project and i was like yeah kind of exciting like and i don't really know it myself i wasn't the one with conviction it was like my team and i was just backing them and so he's asking me he's like isn't that like like kind of like for the silk road and like isn't that like kind of scammy and i was like no i think there's merit to it but i couldn't like make a strong case he's like dude i don't know man like if we do something wrong here the financial space like look if we if we make a social app that fails whatever i burned a million dollars of funding if we do something that's illegal the sec comes after us i can lose everything so like let's put the kibosh on uh on our crypto exchange that you guys are trying to like create like launch tomorrow and i was like ah [ __ ] so i go tell the team and blah blah and we long story short we do nothing so we don't launch the thing i don't buy any bitcoin at that time when bitcoin's like under 100 um and we we move on with our life and then like now years later i'm just chasing that you know crypto dream the whole time buying it at like you know twenty thousand dollars a coin instead of when it was at 20. and i was thinking back on it i was like what was the right move there and i said i'll kind of lay out my thinking here i think the right move and i think many people will come into these situations where a new trend happens and you're you know you want to chase it but there may be risks associated with why you should or shouldn't do it and um here's kind of like my my revisionist thinking you tell me if you tell me actually i'll pause there tell me what you think i should have done in that situation did i make the right move or what could i have done differently because i think it's important to kind of learn from our game film as entrepreneurs well so like objectively you made the wrong move in that you you didn't we know what the right move was now but looking back knowing what you knew being who you are i would say i wouldn't say you made the right move but i would say you didn't do anything wrong right okay so fair enough so let's say uh door one is do nothing always right so do nothing that's what that's the one we ended up taking door two was create and launch this kind of crypto exchange slash money transit or whatever that was like where we were headed what i think was i should have looked at what does door three four and five look like so the first thing i should have done is i should have bought the currency right um that's kind of an obvious one if you believe in this thing enough to build a startup around it you should own some of the underlying asset um as as something you want so that was like the first part second was when i got pushback from somebody richer smarter and more experienced than me and i didn't have the answer the answer shouldn't have been okay no okay i'll stop it it should have been well let's let me put together a case for doing this give me a week to put together a case of why we might do this why this might not be such a bad idea i agree with your logic let me put together a case and let's start with that and so i could have took a pause breath and i could have said all right let me go and actually like get to conviction myself and if i have conviction i'll convince anybody in the world to do that we should do this but if i don't have conviction it's just a matter of i haven't really thought this through enough and the third option was or the next option was what are the other things you could have done so what are the no risk ways to ride this wave that's what i think block works did that's what coindesk did that's what coin market cap did so there was other things you could have done you could have created a media company that said all right i'm not gonna like try to be a financial exchange and that has some risks but why don't we spin up a media side well there's going to be if this is going to be a thing people are going to be interested in the content we could build that and then that gives us options to launch more stuff so that would have been a smart move that was zero risk um financially as far as like the the sort of regulations and sec goes but still would have been writing that way i didn't think about that because i didn't have all these other business models in my tool belt of like what else i could do another would have been to instead of just launching like a media company it could have been an agency so we have several friends like andrew from uh meta lab uh our friend greg who launched late checkout you can launch agencies that help big companies understand what to do with this thing and you can actually charge a [ __ ] ton of money to do this consensus is the big one right now that's the big kind of consultancy for this i think they do over 100 million dollars yeah we talked about them they're here to multi-billion yeah right just from just from this just from consulting with big companies saying hey do you know how to spell blockchain we can we can spell it for you and so um so basically there was other business models i could have done so looking back i would say that that's one learning i had and i guess like going forward that's i think it's important when these like new waves come out to like dive in on them learn about them and then think about all right should i try to build the big risky thing should i try to build a community should i try to build a media site should i try to build an agency like i have 10 options and depending on my level of conviction um i can go in either one of those directions i can build the audience first i can build the technology first i can try to land grab and do something there we could have created our own currency there was 10 other ideas that we could have done but anyways this is like a but to continue talking about that strategies it is to continue talking about strategies my opinion is that you should actually take door number one in most cases and yeah and when you see something that you think is like this is one life strategy and i think this is a good strategy you say no to most everything then when you see the thing that you're like this is it you go 100 all in on it um and and so there's a few examples of this so and and when you go all in on it it's a high risk but it's high reward type of thing so examples are you become buzzfeed and facebook gets popular you launch an entire media company buzzfeed cheddar did this as well they launched an entire media company off facebook live and they sold for 200 million dollars now you have loads of examples of it not working for people more examples of it not working than it does does work right um but when you when you spot these waves i actually think that uh like the the the risk versus reward is far in your favor of doing it and bitcoin is one of those where of course we know now you know you didn't know that what what are the hallmarks of a wave all right what were some recent waves and then what how do you know when it's a wave versus just shiny object distraction i think engagement for sure so i think it's it's not the wave is not how many people are using it but the few people who are using it how much are they using it right and so does this feel like a cult do these people seem crazy uh that's actually a very positive signs for waves yes i think that's the the biggest one is uh are people like how into it are they so like i was just talking to a guy that was selling um who did a multi-level marketing scheme where and he didn't know it at the time but he was he thought it was multi-level but it was a pyramid scheme he was like well i'm just like a sales person for this energy drink he was a participant in it yeah yeah yeah and he was like but i loved it and i thought it was okay it goes and then it took me forever to realize that it was a pyramid scheme and then i was like scamming people so i had a bail but for a long time i was so into it and like when you see like people who are so into something like amway like herbalife they actually become huge huge companies even if most people don't get it you don't you only need a few people that are passionate about it so it's all about engagement yeah i would say that so i was like what are you gonna look for with the wave second one is complete behavior change so like facebook early on was a good example of this where all of a sudden people were checking something like 30 times a day there really weren't websites that you would go check 30 times a day and uh facebook was one and so similarly like fortnight or twitch something like that it's like wait you're just streaming a webcam of yourself for eight hours like playing video games it's like yeah not a lot of people do it but the people who were doing it were doing this completely weird behavior that made no sense and had no like real parallels to what people were what that same person was doing before and so if it's been able to consume this person's life and change their whole like workflow then it's going to do that for other people right like uh remote work is like that in a small way but that's that's another one a third one is go ahead the third one is just a technology wave so a new device comes out that can do something that the other devices couldn't like oh this is a phone it has an accelerometer in it and a gps so now what what can you create when you have a gps in your pocket well you can push a button and someone could come find you and pick you up and take you somewhere else using that same gps and so like you know ridechair became enabled because this new device was there or you have a camera in your pocket at all times well then i guess people are going to take way more photos than they were before all right that's when you get instagram you get snapchat so i think the technology wave is the other one yeah there's a bunch of these and and and it's actually fun to talk about like we all know what the waves are but there let's talk about some of the waves that we've seen recently that actually turn out not to be waves um or likely won't be waves clubhouse is one of them um a lot of people dedicated a lot of stuff to him i could have seen a startup raise money on top of uh a clubhouse show or something like that right um and but but but i don't actually hate people taking that shot and i think that a lot of people do right and i think i think you have to measure how much do you have to lose like for example in that scenario i was talking about i would have launched the crypto thing because i had nothing to lose our investor who's like basically a billionaire is like hey you know what i don't mind if you fail on the startup but like don't have the sec come after me like that doesn't seem good let's not hold like a if this works we're gonna have like a hundred million dollars of user deposits that we're like on the hook for that sounds bad i don't you know i i it wasn't easy to get this billion dollars i don't want to lose that so for him it was the correct decision to say let's not risk ruin when you're you know you have nothing well you have nothing to lose and so feel free to go more all in and take more risks faster and if hey if clubhouse turns out to be a dud what'd you lose six months of your life you know like two thousand dollars it's okay so since we're talking about reflection and stuff let me tell you a quick story so i'm gonna send you this guy's linkedin i met this guy this week so i like just last week we were off i was off so i just went and hung out with people my friend joe introduced me to this guy named val i don't even know how to say his last name um but val i went out to lunch with this guy named val so this guy's story is basically he came from a soviet union country i forget he came from soviet union i forget what it's called now the area that he was from ubekistan is what he's from he's a uh like a jewish immigrant from ubekistan he at the age of 18 listen to this he started a cellphone ringtone business he was the only employee and it did 10 million in revenue in year three he was started when he was 18. so this is when he was like 21. 10 million so 10 million in profit he said he goes based on the ringtones to americans yeah he goes i was the only employee oh i care from where i don't know what you said uzbekistan uzbekistan i believe selling 10 million dollars worth of ringtones to stupid americans isn't that beautiful i love that and that amer uh amazing um i believe it's called uh you can scroll down it's called tone media uh i believe that's what it is um on his linkedin something like that or tone fuse i don't i don't even know which one it is you get so many of them and the reason why this guy interests me is so i'm gonna tell you everything that he has done since but it's all been bootstrapped no outside funding and all in different industries so the first one um he probably has more but these are the ones he told me about so uh a phone business the ringtone business he's he's like the revenue and he goes by the way revenue and profits are pretty much the same thing because i was the only employee he was like it went like 2 million 4 million like 10 and then i sold it and his second thing was called mobile fuse which is a ad tech company uh it's that's boring that's not that exciting but it's a big business something like i imagine he didn't tell me but i imagine like 50 60 million in revenue pretty big then uh while he was getting that started he noticed that peer-to-peer lending was popular so things like you know sofi yep stuff like that so he created a company called prime meridian capital i've never even heard of it but i think their url might be poised lending basically at this point they've given out billions of peer-to-peer loans so totally different from ad marketing or ad tech then from there he started a uh a thing called i don't even know how to pronounce this chicalo but he was telling me all about this but basically a company like zales have you you know zales or do you know uh jake kay jewelers jared ernest jones peoples there's a bunch of them so it's all owned by this company called cignet cignet is a multi-billion dollar diamond business and what they do is they own all these brands and he was telling me he was like i was thinking about what makes that company special and he was like basically they have this headquarters where they just look at which diamonds are most popular uh which which brands and which cuts are selling the best and how can we tell all of our brands what we think are gonna be the next big thing how can we help you optimize that brand by selling a little bit more efficiently how can we buy in bulk things like that so it was basically it was just a normal mom and pop store but we just multiplied it by however many and so we just created these these this trends bit and then this economies that scale you know buying in bulk stuff not particularly special but but just executed really well and so he goes is well you know i'm going to build software so i'm going to help all the mom and pop jewelers do that same thing and so we went and started this new company and if you look at his linkedin and go to the website you can see it looks like really janky really simple um but they uh what they do is a mom and pop brand can sign up and they'll the the the the the name of the company i think it's called i don't even know how to pronounce it it's a horrible name how do you say that jocalio jocalio it's yeah it's really bad uh so jacalio will help you get bulk discounts but then we'll help you uh spend your marketing so it's almost a little bit like part agency part buying in bulk part um crm where you could like look at sales and like help predict which is going to be the most popular in order in bulk and i believe this company is going to be doing around 80 or so million in revenue um wow and so this freaking guy will have to like he's he he he's english as a as a second language and he's real quiet and he's real understated very low key and he was just telling me all about this and i had a few learnings the first is just it's crazy the story i haven't done [ __ ] in my life the second this guy's a [ __ ] beast third yes he it just and he didn't he's not flashy i mean he had a nice watch on but he had normal clothes and he and he didn't brag about himself i had a pull i pulled it out of him and he um a few things what we tell ourselves about why we can't do something it's [ __ ] it's mostly [ __ ] i mean some people are more talented than others but you could just get so much done just by just by working really hard so what we tell ourselves about why we can't do blank that's nonsense second there's this i don't know like some people call it like the i think it's called the red pill i forget what people call it where they like see the world differently i've hung out with enough people that just crush it and a lot of people who you don't never even heard of and i'm in it and oftentimes i'll like when i'm looking at this house i'm like oh should i buy this lot i got to sink this money into it it's going to fail but there's so many there's a few people in this world and i know a lot of these people who just be like yeah of course just let's do it and they're just so confident i actually think you have a little bit of that in you um they're just so confident and they default to optimism optimism and it works so well it's like this this ability in this case it's money but it could be anything it could be um you know well we're just gonna fly there and we're just going to figure it out but this is like default to yeah of course it's going to work a few people have that and that attitude gets you so far uh and and i i've been able to experience that just by being around some of these people but it's just a really fascinating person wow i love this uh i love that little story i love this guy this is extreme this is really cool and uh yeah i'm impressed i love meeting these kind of like under the radar you know self-made kind of like business badasses that have hopped from industry to industry it's like there's zero luck involved when you're going to do that right there's luck is luck is a like kind of a scalar it's like a multiple of like the thing was successful whether ringtones were going to be worth 10 million or 20 million or 50 million of 1 million it was hard to say but if you're the type person that's going to make the ringtone business the mobile ad business the jewelry like independent business the whatever uh the the peer-to-peer lending company um you have you know the track record speaks for itself you know what you're doing as far as like identifying an opportunity and then chasing it properly and i just googled this guy uh i it looks like he has a twitter but like no followers and he has 200 followers on instagram and he posts pictures of his vacation with his family like nothing sexy i mean yeah he's got actually some fancy cars that's sexy but i guess this whole point of like you get caught in this bubble of you have to build an audience no you don't yeah no you don't you don't you don't you can and maybe that could be fun for you you don't you could do something that no one has ever heard of you you could just cold call and you could get done with it likely whatever you want to get done and another thing that i've learned is just intensity so this idea of well you have this ringtone business that's kind of silly it's like yeah maybe but i bet you like i mean it could make 10 million dollars a year which is like crazy rich um and just like stepping it up on the stepping up on the amp it up format on the intensity idea so i was working out this morning um with the guy whose house i'm in and so he was like hey like i don't know if you're up but like trainer's coming at 8 a.m if you want to get a workout in yeah fantastic i'm up let's do it so i go downstairs home gym crazy go inside trainer's there we're doing our thing and um and i don't particularly work out i'm not like a super intense workout guy like i'm trying to do well but like my default is like i i feel the way most people feel in the workout like i'm getting super tired i'm like my muscles are failing like they're not i don't feel like i could do that anymore you know like i'm trying oh like if she's like all right how much you want to squat i'm like well i don't really know and uh all right let's start with like a little bit and then like let's go up from there i'm not like trying to like prove something every second of the workout but he was talking about um intensity during the workout he's a very intense guy and so he uh um at the end we were doing abs just to finish and so we're doing like a russian twist thing or whatever he's facing the other direction he's doing the other ab workout and we're just taking turns i'm doing mine he's doing his i'm doing the russian twist and he heard me ask the trainer i go should i have my legs in the air she's like yeah that makes a bit harder and i was like okay cool let me try and so i was just doing it um it was just kind of like an offhand comment and then when it was his turn to go to that it was like the second round second set he's like i gotta i gotta put my legs up now and she's like no no you don't have to you can just put it down he's like no if he's gonna do it then i gotta do it and he's like he's like that's the best part about working out with somebody is that their intensity picks you up and if you pick the right partner then you match their intensity and you just get that little extra that you're working again if you're on your own he's like that's the best part and i think that's what this podcast is for a lot of people is we are like their workout buddy for their like kind of like the brain workout basically of just thinking about businesses being excited about things learning new [ __ ] and so i think that's the benefit we're giving some people through this podcast but it's also what um what like when you go meet this guy and you you know what's the benefit of being this guy you're not gonna do a deal with him you're not gonna invest in his company but literally just having met him and heard his story all of a sudden now you you can you got red pill you're gonna see the world differently just because you know that he exists and when we tell his story now hundreds of thousands of other people listening to this are gonna know that he exists i think that's really cool and i think it's something you should be intentional about of getting around other people so that you have those red pill moments and you get around other people's intensity so you raise your game so let me give this guy a shout out i'll spell his name because i don't think i said his last name his name is val v-a-l last name i don't know how to i'm sorry val but uh anyway that that's his uh that's his name pretty interesting dude if you click like contact info all of his companies are there his emails are on his linkedin interesting guy um okay so we're like 45 are we gonna go to ideas are we gonna are we gonna are we gonna you wanna keep it to this like little i don't know what what do you wanna do with so i have one that i think is gonna be a good segment we're gonna finish on that let's finish strong people are gonna be by the end of this people are gonna be hyped up all right so somebody i think by the way i i think they will dan are they gonna be hyped on this okay very hyped thanks you sounds great dad is trapped somewhere dana's trapped inside my computer right now it sounds like all right so uh so i want to finish up with this idea of uh teenage side hustles so somebody emailed me and they said hey you know love the pod my kid is i think 12 13 years old they're like i want to get him into entrepreneurship my daughter is like 11. my son is 13. i want them both to learn about business uh do you have any ideas for side hustles or little like kind of like mini hustles that a uh a teenager could do and so it got me thinking and so i started going down this i thought this would be a fun brainstorm for us i do have some ideas that i wrote down for this but i basically gave it 15 minutes of thought and i was like okay cool i'll do this on the pod live what do you think great you you gotta kick it off though because you spent more time thinking about it and then i will uh i'll come up with a few while you're talking all right so here's the teenage side hustles i break it down into four categories so the first one is called blue collar stuff okay so this is stuff people teens have been doing for a long time but with a twist here so uh local normal blue collar stuff you go you mow lawns in the neighborhood you deliver the paper you shovel snow depending on where you're at i think that's all cool so here's how i would step it up so i would say hey here's one thing we could do right we're going to provide a service to our neighbors but let me teach you in business about leverage right we don't want to trade our time for money i don't want to be the one mowing the lawn i don't want to be the one shoveling snow so you could do two things you could teach them to hire up other kids and basically have the other people in the neighborhood doing the work while you are doing the sales and uh you're taking in the money and you're paying out from there so you could teach them labor leverage there the other way of doing this is you have them uh learn two things at once so you have door-to-door sales in your neighborhood but secondly you teach them about lead gen so instead of actually having to do the work all you need to do is make the sale um or or get the warm lead even so i was thinking you could go in a neighborhood you could go door-to-door so here's my specific idea for them go go around your neighborhood and you're gonna you're gonna knock on the door and you're gonna sell one of two things either pest control um so you're gonna say hey we live in the neighborhood you know our house and other houses have had issues in the past with pests and infestations and it's better to catch it early before it becomes like a major problem and you have to gut the whole kitchen because you got this you know mice infestation or rats or or cockroaches or whatever and so um would you be would you want a free inspection uh would you be interested in an inspection to let you know if your house good condition bad condition or needs need some work and then basically what you do is you call up the local you know pest control service and you say hey i have 15 houses in my neighborhood that are interested in getting an inspection and um and you know i think that even if 10 of them or 20 percent of them convert that you guys will get some good business out of this so um i'm calling up local services local service providers and seeing if anybody basically would want to uh want these leads and i have all their information for you i did the first first contact with them i have their name their number and i have the details about what they're interested what they're worried about what they're interested in and basically i would sell those leads to a local pest control company i think you could make good money doing that just around your neighborhood and other neighborhoods and you would learn that hey you know where is the value capture the value capture is in getting the customer not and actually going and looking under the floorboards for cockroaches okay so that's the first first blue collar one the other part of that oh hold on listen to this so i'm i'm trying to find there here it is okay so i i know a guy he spoke at hustle account his name is gabe gabriel oona asaseki so what he did was he he's a friend of mine uh he started this company where basically uh they did legion so it was called cal finder so if you google california home painting california pest control you get brought to their website they just do a better job of displaying information you submit a lead they send it to a pink company and that paint company pays them five dollars for that email address the way it started is he bought a yellow notepad and he went door to door to find people who would be interested in having their home painted he collected a list of a hundred names in the first day and then he sold that for ten thousand dollars to a variety different like different pink paint companies and he did that a couple more times and then he eventually created a proper company that made 20 million dollars a year in sales so that's the outcome or potential outcome to that yeah so the downside of this your kids might start making more than you do a year uh but the upside is they'll learn a lot about business all right so that's the first one you could do this with anything pool fencing hey you notice you have a pool but you don't have a fence you know it's against california law to have a fence without a pool when you have kids um you know would you like us to come out and give you an estimate of how much that would cost to keep it safe and you know so you could do pool fencing pest control home painting whatever doesn't matter um so i so my specific idea would be blue collar lead gen that's number one number two events so you've hosted conferences and events i think that you could if you're a teenager i think you could host a neighborhood fair here's how this works you go out you rent the bouncy house the slip and slide all the stuff that like for one individual home to do it's kind of an expensive birthday party but if you're gonna do it and amortize it across around across the the cost of the whole neighborhood it's actually not a bad idea and so i would create the neighborhood fair i would charge for entry i would uh i would have a local sponsor you know the local bank would sponsor it because who could turn down your kids smile and say hey i'm hosting the neighborhood fair would you be a sponsor for us for 500 or whatever and uh you know all the proceeds go to us as kids you know to fund my own education and so i would basically rent a bunch of cool stuff have cotton candy have all the stuff charge tickets and uh neighborhood fair that's my second idea events what do you think of that one i think that's okay i would do the first one over the second one the second one sounds like a pain in the butt i'm just giving them options here i'm giving them options keep swinging three the theme of this one is little kids acting like adults so we've all had the like kind of fundraiser thing where you you go door to door and you say hey would you like to buy you know cookie dough and ice cream and wrapping paper for our like school charity great so here's my twist on that my twist on that is that you call it the the bitcoin junior club or something the bitcoin kids club and basically you go door-to-door and say hey i'm really interested in bitcoin have you heard about bitcoin yeah i've heard of bitcoin well hey the neighborhood we want to create we uh you know two of us three of us kids in the neighborhood we were creating the first kids bitcoin club and what we want is uh for every house to invest somewhere between you know about a hundred dollars and we're gonna buy bitcoin and you're gonna own it and we're gonna take a management fee on top of what we of of the of managing the money right so we're going to create a little investment club we want to learn about finance and money this is a great way for us to do it and for you you'll be owning bitcoin we're going to help you out we're going to teach you all about it we're going to give a presentation at the end um and you know hey if your kid wants to be involved in the club they can too and so i would create this little and i would create a small little money management fund and i would try to get houses to give me you know a thousand bucks if they can depending on your neighborhood this is either impossible or it'll be easy and i would go to the rich neighborhoods and i would say that's what we're doing and for them they actually get to own an asset so it's not like they're just giving away the money they're actually going to get the asset but you're going to charge you know you're well instead of a normal two percent fee we're going to call it a 10 fee that you're going to take in exchange for managing money and then you're going to send out a newsletter of the report about what's going on in bitcoin i think it's awesome i think that it's just like yes this is an easy yeah it's just it's cute enough that it justifies sending your kid to hang out with people exactly okay so those are three ideas the way i was thinking about this and this is another piece is like how do you even brainstorm this so when i brainstorm i don't think about what's the idea right i'll think about two things so the first thing i thought of was what do i remember from my childhood and then what's the 20 twist i could put on this right so that's the fundraising idea but the twist is now it's for bitcoin right or uh i used to mow lawns but the twist is actually i'm going to like sell those leads to a lawn mowing service that's the first way i think about things what do i already know that i can just put a 20 twist on to make it fit this situation the second thing is i don't look for answers when i brainstorm i look for questions so here's the questions i wrote down before i brainstormed this i said what's cute when a kid does it but annoying if an adult did it that's a great i started brainstorming ideas right the second one is what's fun for kids but boring for adults like you know my daughter she loves like cleaning like if i let her clean she'll clean a folding she loves to fold uh kids actually like i used to have a lot of fun mowing lawns but like as an adult i hate to go mold on my lawn now and so if i know something that's fun for a kid boring for an adult we can have them do it the next one is what are kids actually just good at that adults are bad at so there's just things that kids are just better at okay what are those and lastly what amount of money is a win for a kid but would not be a win for an adult because then the kid can do it and they would be happy with it but no an adult won't do it because this is not enough money there for the to fill the void of what they're looking for at the opportunity cost and so that's how i brainstormed this so that's just a little peek under the hood about how to think about stuff like this is don't answer look ask a bunch of questions and then spitball if i for my kid i would probably have them i would think of what skill should they learn now that they won't have time to learn in the future so uh for for them that will have big impact for them i think it would be door i think door-to-door and i would sell i would send them to it like a an amco or i think it's sorry cut co or some type of like door-to-door knife or door-to-door books some type of cutthroat time where it's like look you're gonna spend three months for two two different summers in a row you're gonna do this you're not gonna like it at first but the skill that you learn you're never gonna be able to learn this again like this in your life and it's gonna it'll it'll change your world if you can get this yeah exactly we're not going to baseball camp we're going to cutco camp you're going to learn how to sell knives door to door this summer that's what happens what i'm going to do that i think that would be the right move yeah anyway so those are my teenage side hustles to like i forgot the person who wrote in to whoever wrote in that's my answer sorry i haven't emailed you dan what do you think did we we meandered a little bit yeah i really liked the end i used to sell calendars in high school door-to-door got a friend by the way another my brain's still firing on ideas here's another one digitize the neighborhood's home videos everybody i know who's like kind of like my parents age they have a bunch of photos and albums and videos on like little cassettes that's a great business they're worried that those are all gonna go away and you just say hey i'm gonna drop this box off in front of every door and i'm just going to put a sticker on it and i'm going to say put your put your photos and videos here in here i'm going to give it back to you you know sort of i'm going to send you it i'll put it in the cloud for you so you'll have these forever in good quality and you never have to worry about these going bad or losing this box or water spilling on it or anything like that let's let's save your memories i think everything is one that's the the g that's incredibly smart because you don't need to be that good at doing it you just have to have time yeah exactly we could basically just go drive it to like costco or whoever does this but or you could do it yourself um i don't know if it's costco but like some of these yeah one of the retailers they do this they'll digitize that's a great service to offer uh offer because your time is free yeah right i would that's a good one that's what i would do i would pick that one um all right i guess that's the episode we'll see what people think of that i thought it was actually quite good i enjoy hearing stories uh love people so we'll see if it's good yeah let us know uh tweet it sam he's the sampara on twitter tweet at me i'm sean vp and uh let us know what you think of the episodes we take that feedback and that's how we adjust a little less randomness a little less life advice a little more ideas a little more stories about wealthy people whatever you guys want so let us know how you want us to shift it i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like my days off on the road less travel never looking back

i had this thought oh this is what it would have been like to talk to bill gates at 21. yeah i feel like i could rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my law in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back so this episode is gonna be it might be shorter than normal right yeah i think so okay i wanted i just drove uh like 30 hours and i listened to a ton of content i want to tell you sean about some of the stuff that i listen to and why it's interesting is that what you want to do for this entire episode yeah let's do it and i'm sure you'll have some stuff um uh that you've consumed okay the first one i found this podcast that has like actually let's see how many reviews i think like no reviews i think i emailed the guy he's amazing but uh it's called how to take over the world we should just have this guy we should just absorb this guy's uh podcast we need to acquire this guy's podcast this should just be on our feed wait did you did you listen to it no i'm just looking at the description of it and then the gems that you just told me and i'm like this should be part of mfm this is great it's amazing this guy he uh he it's like his hobby and he really he they're so in-depth so it's called how to take over the world what i think he's doing is you know a lot of biographies of great people like napoleon uh julius caesar the raw child they're like 800 to a thousand pages so it's like a real commitment to read it so he just reads it and he takes notes in one episode he did one on napoli and he goes i have 60 paper thomas edison he goes i have 60 pages of notes and he just reads the book and takes notes and then just explains and tells stories from the book and does it in chronological chronological order and it's basically turns if you listen to a thousand page book on audio on audible it's something like 40 or 50 hours but with him i just listened to this two-hour podcast and i feel like i've just read most of the book it's pretty amazing but he also gives his analysis about it and so i listened to a few of them i listened to one on edison one on napoleon and one of the rothschild rothschilds and there's three commonalities that i want to tell you about these guys so do you know who rothschild is rothschild am i saying that right yeah so basically it was started by this guy named angel rothschild in the 1700s he basically built like the amazon of of this his little ghetto in in germany where he would sell like he would mail you an item and if you wanted it you would send him money and it wasn't like that big but eventually he started he grew that over 50 years and started investing in stuff and then his kids started the goldman sachs of of europe so it was like a long uh slow build up to building this family business so i'm gonna tell you three things that i've noticed that these folks had in common the first all of them enjoyed their work so there's a story where nathan rothschild this um this one woman was talking to him he's like you know i hope you better hope that your kids aren't addicted to work like you are and he goes oh no i hope they are because i love what i'm doing and i don't ever want to stop uh same with napoleon someone said napoleon what what's your heritage what race are you he goes i'm of the race of men who found empires [Laughter] uh like they're addicted to it like they love it they they can't they can't not do it same with edison edison he was like nice to his kids and nice to his wife but he was really never around and they called he called his um uh his studio which was in menlo park i believe it's called miller park in new jersey and they said that it looked like a homeless encampment because there's these men in suits but they were just like laying around on the floor and sleeping there because they would do their best work from midnight to 6 a.m and they would just sleep below under their desk and they're like well why are you doing this he's like because there's so much to do and we love it like we can't not do this so they all enjoyed their work the second thing crazy crazy high energy so super high energy so the napoleon he went to egypt to go conquer something and on his way he stopped in like some island where he like reorganized the government in three weeks and he and he changed their currency just they all have crazy high energy and that's something that i didn't actually think was a big deal but they all had crazy high energy now here's the third thing that i found to be kind of interesting a lot of the successful people that i'm learning about on this podcast they eat very very very little so like edison would only drink milk sometimes for months steve jobs for months for months milk steve dude do you remember steve jobs how he had a fruit yeah i was gonna say he's a fruitarian or whatever it was the same thing he used to only eat like lunch and it was just fruit you know or something like that for a period of time rockefeller or rockefeller and vanderbilt were this way too like in their first in like the it was it's all when they're all described like look he ate very little typically didn't eat breakfast ate very little they're all like physically hungry and that physical hungry hunger some it does actually seem like it leads to some type of like success does that so so um yeah okay so let me give you my take on all three of these so you said uh they really enjoyed their work like their work feels like plays the way i would describe it where they didn't feel like they were forcing themselves to do something they couldn't wait to go keep doing it i would also say there's an obsession there now like it's like i'm obsessed with stuff like is that do i enjoy it i don't know if i enjoy it but like i the ocd forces you there's an obsession so there's a conor mcgregor fight this saturday and he has a great kind of like monologue from back when he was a nobody but he was talking about it he goes he goes i've lost my mind to this game he goes i think you must do that i think you must become obsessed you want to lose your mind to your craft and i've seen that as like a common thing for a lot of people and and that actually relates to the eight very little a lot of time you get so engrossed in what you're doing that you just forget to eat you forget to go to the restroom you forget what time it is you forget the cl you know what you should sleep or you forget to pay that bill because you become completely obsessed and engrossed in what you're doing and you get in in a flow state really and in a flow state you um you sort of block out a lot of the other stuff that's going on and so i think that's that's those two sort of go hand in hand um and then the high energy i'm curious what that means to you so that's like it doesn't mean like you're bouncing off the walls right yeah that's what i imagine what did you mean no it doesn't mean that you're bouncing off the walls but for example when i go and when i'm at a conference um like let's say it's my conference or let's say it's uh at our at our talk that we did the other day how did you feel at the end of that the live shows yeah uh i felt kind of drained i felt drained i felt exhausted yeah but what i think like what i think high energy means is i felt just so worn out then but i think that some people they would feel good and they'd be like all right let's go like get some more deals done let's go invest like like like i invest a little bit of money but if i was a full-time investor you're doing deals all day and for me by like four or five o'clock i'm like ugh i can't talk to another person i'm exhausted i can't think about this anymore but i've seen some people that can do it all day and they just aren't worn out and they just keep going and going and going and going right that's what i mean yeah i i'm with you on that um yeah okay i think this is cool and i like the um the study of of the sort of study of greatness and what i've also found is that like we've talked about this before it's like would you want to be elon musk would you want to be like basically this stuff comes at a pretty big sacrifice um for other things in life family often um you know relationships you know it's hard to relate to people or spend time with friends or anything like that if you're doing this so when you so i'm like you i like digesting these i like knowing it but then over time i've learned that like the goal is not to be steve jobs or a collective jobs or anything i just kind of am fascinated by it in the same way that like i'm fascinated about how you know a rhinoceros moves and eats and i don't necessarily want to be a rhinoceros i just find it interesting that it's extreme creature i love freaks i like the freak show and these guys are freak shows i also love bold people i admire anyone who's bold so for example i was reading a book about steve mcqueen he was just an actor like he didn't change the world he probably didn't work that hard but he was like known for like saying his opinion and he like lived a very like free life that and it's like in the same field i like these people i like men who will who do what they say and they say like things that are different than other people but then also i love these freak shows like napoleon now let's actually talk about each of these thomas edison like elon a bunch of divorces one of his wives died from a morphine overdose his kids didn't really like him or get to know him that well even though he was like a kind guy but he was never around napoleon died on an island because they kicked him out and he died basically with nothing alone in an island off the coast of africa rothschild um he the the the i mean they were okay they actually had good ideas but um with a lot of successful people like this yeah you don't actually want to be them necessarily yeah um okay so what else uh what else you got so you consume that what else you consume okay have you read uh naval's almanac yeah shout out to um jack butcher no no uh uh eric right eric i think jorgensen is the last name yeah he was the main guy and jack animated whatever yeah oh there it is so naval has uh so it's a two-part i actually don't know how it came to be did naval just do a bunch of podcasts and interviews and he summarized naval's feelings yeah basically so neval had been putting out his content for years different podcasts and stuff like that and a lot people like me and eric and others were big fans of it and what he did was he said all right uh you i don't know if you've ever bought the book or have the book poor poor charlie's almanac i think that's what this is ripped off of which is charlie munger who's warren buffett's business partner it was like about charlie munger and so uh he tried to make you know if naval is one of the good great thinkers of our time then he tried to make the compilation of all the [ __ ] naval said he took it from all the times naval talked about wealth and they pulled it all together and put it all in one place and distilled it down and this book uh is broken into two parts the first is wealth the second is happiness i found the wealth stuff to be a little bit boring um i don't even remember i i actually skipped over a lot of it i don't even remember what he said about wealth do you yeah i mean i think it's it's the same thing that that we've talked about on here but he has this tweet storm that went ultra ultra viral like maybe i don't know 50 to 100 million people have seen it by now and it's called how to get rich without getting lucky and he talks about these four things i i mean i can go into it or i can skip it if you want to talk about it a little bit yeah basically his summary is like you know here's some of the principles that over you know naval's become very wealthy and over time he sort of learned for himself he wanted to be wealthy as a kid because he grew up pretty poor and he wanted to be wealthy and he wanted to be wealthy not in a way that required outlier luck and he says this great thing which is like you know i want to if i lived life 100 times i want to end up wealthy you know 98 uh 99 times or like if you took away all my wealth now and you drop me you know butt naked in in the streets of bangalore um i want to be able to again in five ten years end up rich again and so that means i actually understand the principles of how this is done and i'm not relying on unluck and so he talks about those principles and he basically says you know you want to have these like three or four things so first stop renting out your time you'll never get rich renting out your time which is you know 90 something percent of people are employees somewhere you are basically renting your time to an employer and um you'll never become wealthy or you rarely become wealthy with that path uh you become wealthy by owning a piece of a business either as an investor or as a business owner or as an employee who has shares like employees at google or facebook who have seen you know gotten a lot of wealth by the appreciation of those shares and so um then he talks about you know how do you how do you get to that point well you need a few things you want um you know use what you call specific knowledge which is basically like like sam you know how to grow a newsletter you know how to write content you know copywriting right you know certain things and so you need specific knowledge then you pair that with accountability so you want to do it in the name of the hustle or sam or some brand that accrues that reputation so you want to put your name on the line and say i'm going to do this thing and so that when you do it you get paid for it you know the people at the hustle who write your daily newsletter but are less well known they actually have certain skills they have certain unique knowledge specific knowledge but they don't have the account they're not putting up the accountability they're not living and dying by the sword of this news that are working or not um maybe inside the company they are but not externally and then you have leverage so you know back in the day if you wrote something you would maybe distribute it locally on your newspaper or on a flyer or something like that but with the internet you have leverage where you can put this in an email and you can send it you can put the same amount of work in to write the email once you can send it to 100 000 people a million people or 10 million people it's the same amount of work because you have tremendous leverage through technology and so basically he talks about like use these three things get specific knowledge be accountable put your name on the line that way you get the risk and the reward and lastly apply leverage to maximize the the value that you get out of the thing that's kind of the basic formula and the whole book basically um is broken down to this idea of life is about health wealth and happiness or sorry wealth health happiness and he says we actually pursue it we go we pursue wealth then we do health then we do happiness and he's like that's actually a fine way to pursue it it's that's a very practical and fine way to pursue it the reality is is that it's the reverse is true like in terms of importance so it's happening happiness health wealth but it's whatever it's finding pursue that way and he has this beautiful line in the book where he says something like um of course once you get the wealth you're gonna see that it's actually not nearly as important as you thought but you're not gonna listen to me and you have to pretty much discover it on your own yeah you're not gonna listen to me i wouldn't have listened to me um you know the type of person who's attracted to this content you know they they're going to go through the same thing you have to learn that the hard way and so that was pretty interesting so i liked that but the second half is all about happiness and there was a few things that kind of stuck stuck out to me the first is that um he basically acknowledged he he was like look don't worry well then let me preface this by saying neval interests me because he's like i mean he's probably a billionaire i have to imagine he started angelus which is a multi-billion dollar company he's an investor like he's in the game and he acknowledges like i'm in the game and so like this is a little bit hypocritical but basically he was like what i found is that a happiness must be a choice like i've been unhappy for decades and then i decided you know i'm going to be happy and he steals a lot of philosophy from stoicism and he steals a lot of it from buddha buddhism and the idea here is that like your past is unimportant and the future is unimportant and to say that you want to do x y and z for legacy that's [ __ ] because what's going to happen is when you die it's going to be as if you were you know if it's the same feeling that you had before you were born which is like nothing so like who cares about some [ __ ] legacy which is like hard to fight against right uh but and he's like it only matters about the about the present and where you are now and that gets a little bit fluffy but i still thought it was really useful and oddly did you if you read the book he talks about not working hard he was like you actually should only do work that feels like play yeah and i thought that was kind of cool and he's like life's too short by the way just to grind and work your ass off which again i'm like button of all you're like a billionaire like is this like what you know how do you i have to like kind of come to grasp it with us a little bit but i thought it was cool he also talks about um very oddly gives diet advice he's like just don't eat sugar stay away from sugar do high intensity interval training and stretch a lot yeah and he even says he goes uh i try not to he's like you know i don't talk too much about health because i'm pretty good at health i'm okay but i'm not self-actualized in that meaning like in wealth he's done better than 99.9 percent of people uh so you know for him to talk about it well he's self-actualized it he has actually done it uh for himself and seen it done by many other people and so he feels comfortable putting out his whole philosophy on it he's like in terms of health like i'll say some general things that you you know it's hard to argue against but i try not to talk too much about it even though it's very important because i myself you know for many years didn't have an exercise routine or wasn't you know the best eater and now i'm better but i'm still not the best i'm not world class at that i'm not 99.9 percent at that one i'll i could tell one story so i called a friend and and this is almost like stuff i've read or listened to in the last like four days which is a lot but i want i i i had a friend and this is all related to what this is related to what we talked about earlier about crazy people i love freaks and i had a friend call and tell me about their best friend and let me tell you this story so there's this guy i'm gonna change some details i don't want to reveal it he was an accountant and on some large deals that he was working on at the age of like 30 he was able to save up one to two million dollars i think it was two million dollars at the age of 30. he was single he lived relatively frugally but he worked on some he worked at a big company he was just an employee but he worked on such a deal that he was able to capture like some of the commissions and he made like two million bucks with that two million dollars he angel invested a little bit and one of his angel investments made like half a million dollars and so here he is sitting with like two and a half to three million dollars at the age of mid 30s okay so about last 20 months ago when was bitcoin six thousand dollars yeah about about a year and a half two years ago or no sorry when it was three thousand whatever it was he put three million dollars into bitcoin everything he had everything 100 of everything he had to the point of like i think he like saved like 10 000 or 20 thousand dollars for living expenses he put most everything he had and also he borrowed money i don't i'm not uh he was able to borrow money uh somehow like through like like as simple as like robin hood gives you a little bit of margin but he was able to borrow money to the point of like he was in debt a significant amount of money and he bought a ton of bitcoin well last december when it hit 65 or 63 000 his 3 million turned into around 100 million dollars and he sold about half of it so he's got like this cushion and then he up and left and moved to another country and he lives there because he's like you know i'm just i believe that like this country is the future and the point of this story is i'm not like this crazy person i don't think you are either you have a family you're not going to up and move them although you will take interesting bets but and i recognize i am not this human being i am so thankful that crazy people like this exist not for our amusement necessarily but like the world need like his boldness was like rooted in some type of selfishness he wants to get risk rig it rich but that type of boldness even though this may not be the best example but that personality type is what pushes society forward and actually does weird crazy stuff that ends up becoming normal and common for us right dude i don't know if i i don't think this is uncommon but i feel special the way i feel special that i'm this way but i know this is actually most people i think but i [ __ ] love uh greatness in any field like you could just be like hey um you play billiards i'm like no check this out this person is the best in the world at billiards tell me more i stop watching them i'll watch them for eight hours straight i'll then go watch the documentary about them and then i'll go find like you know the book about them and i'll just keep going deep because there's something about greatness that um is just so like attractive to me and so recently uh do you watch the tv show dave of course i like uh what's the guy's name the rest of ricky yeah little dicky so dave is a show that i started watching and i love dave dave is like a hilarious show to me and it's like a very unique show right uh and it's not like most tv shows it's not made like most tv shows it uses like everybody's real names it's like kind of set in hollywood it's this guy's story of trying to be a big rapper which is his real story and then it's kind of like he's not like it's not entourage where he's just like cool and cool [ __ ] keeps happening models keep throwing themselves at him it's like the opposite uh he's kind of like a nerdy jewish guy who happens to be an aspiring rapper and you know things happen to him that are not so great all the time and so um i just love this dude this dude is like he's so talented he's very talented as a rapper if you haven't listened to the little dicky sway freestyle we should put that whole freestyle at the end of this episode dan do that just grab the whole audio for that free style and put it at the end of this one where he gives the girl flowers he gives her flowers exactly um that freestyle is amazing although i mean obviously it's not an actual freestyle and then um you know to be to then go into like how he marketed himself so he's a former ad agency guy who got his job at an agency and was like writing a rap song for like doritos to like win the client win the gig when the account then leaves to go become an actual rapper he his story is kind of like he uh he works for a long time on his album doesn't show anyone has no results to show for it kind of like runs out of time and money doing this and then like launches his first music video and it like goes viral and because he had put so much work into his craft of like making this work and he's completely authentic right so like back to a navalism escape competition through authenticity most of the things you want occur in very competitive spaces and the answer is not to try to out-compete everybody by being better because everybody's trying to be better the way to do it is to be different the way to be different the easiest way to be different is to be completely you because nobody can be better at you than you you've been you your whole life you have a lifetime of experience at it and so similarly for dave uh he his niche in rapping is like being you know an awkward white guy rapper just kind of growing through life trying to get with women and failing sometimes and sometimes succeeding and et cetera et cetera um and so i think this guy is so impressive to me and so i love finding these like you know whether it's in the ufc that's why i love conor mcgregor and his rise because early on i was like this guy seems like he's full of greatness and then you see it play out and you're like wow that was amazing uh dave in the rap scene so this look and you're talking about this with edison and some of the books that you can naval like some of the the content you're consuming um i don't know like what do you think are we kind of like are we unique in this or is this i feel like everybody loves greatness right but is there something different i don't think it's the same i i think that i think it's because we have a privilege we've been privileged in that you and i have seen people who have we have seen like dozens of people accomplish things that a most people like like hear rumors about or movies about like no i know this person they and a lot of them it's financial but you know they sold their company they made 500 million dollars like we know many people have done that and so we like we first hand know like man greatness is real and you could self-actualize we know it's real the second thing is we know people that have created or invented or worked on things that everyone else takes for granted and you're like dude you have no idea what it takes to like uh to have like made that a reality it just it's so impressive and i think that um because of that yeah we like appreciate bold people who are also capable right and so i think a lot of people are like that but not that many people for example when i go to a convenience store and there's like a sign taped to the door i'm like do you have any [ __ ] pride fix that [ __ ] like put a proper frame like do this the right way it'd like be the best that's why i test you to test lack of greatness i can't stand that but like but you know there's a reason why like we're not the only ones there's a reason why jiro what's that jiro love sushi or zero sushi yeah yeah like or like nike nike's old marketing is not about the rubber in their shoes it's about like great athletes because everybody loves great athletes uh that's the easy one that everybody loves no i i i but i like it like when i look at like i don't care about weightlifting but i look weightlifter i'm like dude the gay look how this guy's like weighing his food every single day and getting up at 5 30 like just for the like i just i i love that um so we'll um let me move on to one more thing but uh yeah i do i love greatness and i'll tell you these last two things that i've read one point on that i would say definitely a lot of good has come has come from being a fan of greatness um but i would say try to be a fan of greatness not a fan of the people um and the reason i say that is because what often happens is when people get really into greatness they go study these people and then they they're in their net conclusion is wow they're great and they're different than me and i they sort of like separate it's almost like oh that's a different species um and there's a there's a way to do this that's better which is basically you take you get entertainment and inspiration from them and education from them of the things that they do but like don't count yourself as something different treat yourself like that's that's you you're them you're you're no different than them they are just like you they're just you know made of the same things as you had the same doubts as you had the same insecurities as you had the same struggles as you and uh and so like don't like create this divide of the great people and then you because then it's counterproductive then every time you you learn about their greatness it reinforces this kind of like negative perception of yourself instead if you think about yourself just like them then every time you learn about them it creates a positive reinforcement about what you can also do and i'll tell you just the last few things that i consumed this week that made a difference the first is not or the last couple non-violent communication it's real touchy feely you know what non-violent communication is i've never read it but i've heard about it yeah yeah it's a way to speak uh in a way i guess i don't know how would you explain it basically i have a problem like i suck at dealing with people like my emotions get the best of me i get angry at people and i communicate stuff and i'm like why am i getting angry like this is so counterproductive i do this with sarah i've done it with you before i've done it with all my co-workers i just communicate horribly so i'm actually trying to learn a better way to communicate a more effective way to communicate and this is like giving you a toolkit so it's basically like it just gives you like a better way to talk to people so you can give us one nugget from it so what's one tweak dude it's really hard it's like like it's so opposite of how i do things so if for example like like there's like a like okay so the there's a lot someone who's an expert on this is gonna like criticize me and how am i explaining it but it's quite complicated for me because it's so not normal but basically the idea here is like look i'm not gonna judge you for you telling me this i'm not going to get angry i'm not going to judge you but i actually just want to clarify like so you feel like this correct okay well what i need from you is x y and z are you able to like are we able to can i get that from you or no and then it's like that type of like very like crystal clear and then like you'll say things like look can you repeat back what you thought i said so for example um i'll tell you to do something and i'll say and you'll say okay fine i'll be like can you repeat back well you said if you don't do this you're going to yell it or you let me find a better example okay my wife and i we got into like an argument over i forget what we got into an argument over but i said um can you repeat back to me what you thought i said well you said it's gonna piss you off if you if i do this again and i was like no i actually didn't mean to express the idea of i'm gonna be angry at you it was just like it hurts my feelings when this happens right you know what i mean so it's a different it's a different way to communicate i'm not good at it this is why i'm reading this [ __ ] book clearly i can barely describe the damn thing the last thing or the second to last thing the courage to be disliked great book i started getting into it um because after naval and it's just like there's a few takeaways here i'll read the my four takeaways the first is it's dangerous to believe that your passive term is your future i know it's fluffy if you focus on what's wrong with you you might be looking for reasons to hate yourself on purpose again fluffy third most of what we think is competition is just made up and is hurting your happiness and four this is like crazy woo-woo basically life is just a bunch of like sounds and lights and like the emotion we assign emotion to it and so you don't actually like you can assign a happy emotion so that's the last one and then the last article i read that made a big difference there's this new yorker article written in 2014 about sam altman have you ever read this maybe i i like to study sam altman but i haven't i don't remember this one it's written in 2016 a new yorker it's called sam altman's manifest destiny and i was rereading this and i want to tell you a few reasons first in 2016 he talks about this they ask him what his hobbies are and what he does when he's not working he goes uh i like racing cars i like renting planes and flying them oh and i've got one odd thing that i like i like to prep for prep for survival seeing their be bolderment he explained my problem sorry i'm butchering this the problem is when my friends get drunk they talk about ways the world will end after a dutch lab modified h5n1 bird flu viruses five years ago making it super contagious the chance of lethal virus being released the next 20 years will become well non-zero so i have a plot of land in big sur that i can fly to i have antibiotics batteries water gas mass made by israel defense force all ready to go this was in 2016. that's kind of cool right he also talks about basically he sold his company and he uh he goes he profited five million and he invested all of it in startups which i thought was pretty crazy because we're talking about like crazy freaks um it's just a really good article i think people should read this because sam altman is like a freak weirdo and that's like a compliment um because we're talking about extreme personalities and i think it's like a really cool insight and it's one of the only article long-form articles i've ever seen written about them so i've been rereading that this week that's a cool one i'm going to check that out i remember paul graham had once said something and paul is obviously a fan of sam alban because he programmed star y combinator and then he put sam altman in charge of it um and sam altman was by no means the most successful yc alumni at the time i think his company sold for 30 million but it was kind of like many ways of failure it didn't succeed it raised 40 and it sold for 30. yeah exactly um and so i think he got some out of it but you know whatever but uh paul graham once said like he's like when i was talking to sam altman i think maybe for the first time or second time he's like i had this thought oh this is what it would have been like to talk to bill gates at 21. and like that's like pretty high praise for somebody so i i thought that was like a pretty cool um i don't know pretty cool description pretty cool yeah and there's there's a lot of weird things about altman that i love i should come up with a better word than weird but peculiar things so for example listen to the sentence in a class that altman taught at stanford in 2014 so which by the way in 2014 he must have been like 28. he remarked that the formula for estimating a startup's chance of success is something like idea times product times execution times team times luck where luck is a random number between zero and ten thousand and like like little lines like that i just think it's crazy that someone thinks like that and it's just it's peculiar it's exciting it's really neat there's another story where he um he's working with the with brian chesky the ceo of airbnb and they're about to pitch in front of everyone at uh yc and there's this great line where he says brian chessy goes i attribute a lot of our success uh to sam altman and yc and they're like well why he was like well right before our deck uh they we had a limited we had our deck it was all built out we had limited our projected revenue on the deck to 30 million dollars chesky said sam stopped us and looked at us and goes do me a favor take all those m's you know the 30 million and change them to bees altman recalls telling them either you don't believe everything you said in the rest of the deck about how big this is going to be or you're ashamed or i just can't do math yeah and he just said change all the ends to bes and i think like that weird type of thinking is actually pretty interesting yeah people who can cut through the noise and just like get straight to the heart of it um all right this is cool this is kind of like stuff that sam's been reading and listening to stuff we've been consuming i don't know is this interesting is this going to be good or true i enjoyed the conversation i don't know dan what do you think is this gonna be a good pod yeah i think it's cool i think it'd be a fun thing to check in every couple weeks or a month all right well let's see but that's the episode lil

really heard this a bunch of times which is a lot of times as an entrepreneur you just need to be in the market you need to be in the game and even if your current thing's not working if you are aware of these like inflection points you're the perfect person to just shift over i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right we had a good episode well i think we talked about a lot of stuff what do we talk about we talk about the zapier for sound we talked about yeah we talked about the opportunity now that college athletes can make money what are the business opportunities around that that just opened up and i think if you're interested in software i think sean you actually gave like one of the one of the better ideas in the last three months that we discussed so that's kind of interesting we talked about a new company that's creating a search engine for company documents it sounds boring but it's actually could be quite a big business what else did we talk about the last thing is we talked about this business model idea of basically go take the r d that the big companies do and that they make custom software for themselves like the starbucks mobile app or the domino's pizza ordering app and then make that available to all the mom and pop so we did a bunch of examples of of that and where the opportunities might be all right listen up let us know how uh and how you liked it my twitter is the sam parr then sean's is sean vp all right what's going on yo um i'm in new york i um i had a hell of a week but i'm here tell the story so i leave uh so i'm driving so i got this like nice car and i love driving it i i'm living in new york for a few months i wanted to do that long drive because it's fun for me in my car i'm all ready i got my dog everything i get 15 hours into the drive i get out of my hotel room and i have two spare keys on the same ring because you can't leave one of these fancy keys in the car otherwise the car won't shut right so when i go to the hotel i put them on this on one ring and then when i get in the car i separate them i'm on the phone my mom first thing in the morning just saying what's up put my keys both of them on the roof for a second get in the car start the car drive off 60 minutes later i stopped for gas and i go shoot the car's telling me that i can't start it because the keys aren't here what the heck where are the keys turns out i left him on the roof 60 miles back drove off and i go back to find him over many hours of searching for them someone ran over both the key fobs so you actually found the destroyed team i found the destroyed parts and i had a locked bike my like nice bike was locked to the roof along with my thule like rack was locked in there i find those keys thankfully otherwise i was gonna have to call the welder to like weld my bike off and like pop this lock open and i find those keys but my fobs my 800 i think they're 800 or a thousand they're expensive completely smashed to bits i call mercedes they tow my car this is on a thursday they go we are not going to get a new key in until thursday so obviously [ __ ] you got you you're supposed to be in new york you're stuck in tennessee i'm driving from texas to new york you get stuck in tennessee your car keys get smashed your car's just sitting at a gas station and you can't get a new car key for a week and i'm with my dog too who's like an 80 pound pit bull and i'm like dude what do i do and he's like well we could just store it here so i'm like all right well i'm not going to stay in tennessee for like eight days i try to get a private flight i try to fly because you can't fly with a dog eventually i like waited in line for hours to get so from my point of view i get a text message in our group chat that's like how much does a private jet cost what yeah and i need to get to new york i'm stuck here i can't get on a normal flight because my i have an 80 pound pit bull with me i don't want to leave my car but i guess i have to and how am i going to come back and get my car very confusing situation it was a very confusing situation now let me tell you a few things that i learned and this is related to this podcast so i've flown private once or twice i've never paid for it it was just like a rich guy who i went along um so yes what i what i learned was so we have a friend in this group we don't have to say his name i don't know we could or could not but anyway he went to europe and he sent he goes i got a hotel that was three thousand dollars a night for 350 and i was like what how and he sent me he sent us a screenshot of the email and he emailed the general manager of hotel and he goes hey i'm i work at this company i'm going to be there i don't i mean he said he worked at this company because it's a huge company just for clout but it doesn't really mean anything i'm going to be there with my fiance my budget's 400 a knife do you have anything available i would love it to stay in this room or this room right and he searches for all the five-star hotels in that area and he just sends the same thing to all the general managers yes and then every once in a while they give him a hotel so he's staying in a 3 000 night hotel for 350 and that got me thinking so i googled nashville private airport and i was like look i want a private flight either like right now or first thing in the morning uh my budget is i'm willing to spend seven thousand dollars do you have any airlines or do you have any uh pilots that want some like quick work and they were like well like it usually cost fifteen thousand dollars i was like well look you tell me what if you have someone who has work you tell me what's the like because like you think like private airlines like there's no room to haggle but it's like they're they're just like small businesses and so they get me a quote and that it ended up falling through but i realized that you could they're like uh you know like they actually got another bid whatever so it didn't work out but i realized you could totally haggle with these people it was so fascinating yeah the hotel thing is great because i feel like anybody can do that and uh and you know if you have a little social media following or whatever i know instagram influencers do this i've never even thought about doing it i probably still won't do it because it sounds like it's kind of time consuming but um i thought that was pretty great that little tactic that he uses i thought uh you know these situation when you got in a pickle you had to get creative and um you probably like learned a bunch of stuff that you didn't know you know 24 hours before that and never really would have paid attention to had you not done that like yeah you know what to do when you're stranded private jets can you commission a private jet can you hop on to somebody else's thing like what are the other options you know somebody's like somebody from this podcast or the listener was like i'll drive your like hey when you get your key fob i'll drive it to you in new york if you uh like hang out with me for 30 minutes or something like that yeah i i saw i i don't know what i'm going to do my it's not going to be the situation i don't even resolve till tomorrow so i got to figure out what i got to do coincidentally i have to be in nashville for work august 1st ish there's like a podcast conference that hubspot wants me to go to right so i might fly down there and drop but anyway crazy uh weak but can i tell you a few things uh i noticed when i so i've driven and then we'll get some we'll get to ideas but i i've drive cross country a lot i've done it a bunch of times i love doing long road trips in america and it's always fun to get out of our little silicon valley or new york or whatever like fancy tech guy bubble and a few things that like i noticed the first dude the average american eats so poorly and what makes you say that well granted i am like on the road but like i i try to like actually go to these small towns but man like just seeing what i l i'll just like go to a gas station or go to mcdonald's or i'll go to like um a restaurant and i you know because i eat in the parking lot with my dog and i'll just like sit at what and just look at what people order and like the lines are packed for rallies or sonic man people this whole healthy eating thing that i think is popular amongst like affluent people i don't think it's popular amongst all types of people and that is crazy to me because they're just killing themselves you didn't see a lot of keto and intermittent fasting on this road trip is what i'm hearing no man just processed foods and i'm not like the healthiest i mean i splurge i like diet coke and i'll eat mcdonald's but oh my god when you're driving you're gonna see it's like pit stops it's like here you stop here for gasoline you stop here for sugar you stop here for caffeine and then you just repeat that loop gasoline sugar caffeine gasoline sugar caffeine i'm just shocked at the i'm shocked at just how there are very few healthy options it's amazing uh i just like when i would go to like a fast food place i'm like look dude just give me a grilled chicken breast and like vegetables that's all i need by the way we had talked about vending machines before and um when you're talking about this healthy eating thing i got pitched this company i don't think i'm gonna invest but it's called daily blends and what it is is basically it's a vending machine it's a you know healthy eating vending machine but instead of snacks it's basically just a meal in a jar and you push a button and it basically gives you a jar and the jar has like a ready-made meal inside all you got to do is kind of like put the dressing on top mix it up and then you're ready to go and um the thing i think is smart is they are real they're basically doing big corporate partnerships so they're getting into like every hospital so like every hospital needs to be you know should they should a hospital really have a vending machine that's just like twix you know you know candy bars and like you know red bulls or should it actually have like healthy options and so whether it's like big companies big hospitals this sort of thing i can kind of squint my eyes and see like obviously it depends on the food and how that works but you know they're able to charge way more than a typical vending machine because people are getting like a healthy meal out of it and they basically have like a central kitchen they make all the jars and they go stock all their vending machines in that city and i think this is kind of a cool idea i'm not going to invest but it reminds me a little bit about that that water company you know the like office water company that's done really really well yeah that's like like a billion dollar company i forget especially the bee yeah yeah it's something bevvy bevy's the name of it yeah so bevy is like one of these genius things it's like hey does your office want like fancier water fountain good use a bevy and they just get planted in every company and then it's just like a recurring church and the guy who uh quinn the guy who came on to talk about uh vending machines he said that the thing is is that these healthy options like the the the the honey pot is at uh wework where you have like a eight dollar sandwich um but he's like basically like most of america just wants a monster yeah but i think i think that's fair um but i think the one smart thing they're doing is they're going there's like if you just take hospitals and um airports and things like that like they kind of they're sort of incented to have like another option and a kind of a better option even just from optics point of view and so i think you could do pretty well just by getting prime placements through that but anyways yeah random tangent off of what you said about healthy eating on a road trip and then the last thing that i'll mention is i am so bullish on america over the next two years dude um every rent-a-car place that i've gone to sold out like it's so hard to rent a car right i had a friend maybe it was your friend if someone i don't know if you're part of the said that they had a hitchhike in hawaii because they couldn't get uh a rental car they had to just like hope someone would pick them up um so rental cars are crazy i like to stay at motel sometimes i'll stay at like a i'll range from a 30 night place to a 200 night place just like whatever i'm in the mood for all everything's sold out uh the roads are packed every convenience store is packed i'm so bullish on america and i went and talked to some of my staff and uh some of my friends who are just like average americans they have saved a significant amount of money over the last two years and they're all like i wanna i'm i wanna go buy something i need i need i need to spend yeah what was it after um like the world war whatever the roaring 20s it seems like we might have the roaring 2020s here where uh people are ready to travel they're ready to just go like kind of like max out all their experiences after being sheltered in place for you know a year plus sometimes and uh potentially saving money have you so i like sp went out and talked to people like like who i know earn between 50 to like 150 000 a year and i was like how much money have you saved and they're like more than i've ever saved in la in years and i was like what are you gonna do and they're like i'm ready to i want to buy a rolex or i want to buy they want to spend right so like my traveling lately when went to miami and everything we saw like it just consistently like i try to buy a um accessories for my trip like a like a new rack for my car everything is out and i'm so bullish on america over the next two years so that's just an interesting insight from traveling you want to talk about ideas yeah let's do it um all right so i think the big one is this ncaa thing we had touched on this briefly but basically the law changed that allowed college students to make money off their name and likeness so previously you're a college athlete sorry i should have said athletes you previously you're an ncaa athlete if you um if you make money you lose your amateur status you can't play your sport anymore and you can have your scholarship sort of like revoked even potentially if you uh you you uh you've run afoul of those laws so that changed and all of a sudden overnight a bunch of opportunities opened up right so this uh this thing that was just bottled up because of regulations and rules all of a sudden the court got taken out of the bottle and you get to see what was going to happen and so i don't know if you've paid attention to this but i think we should do like a mini brainstorm on just what we see that's interesting or what you saw people doing yeah so can you explain the rule because i think that there's some stuff around it like you can't actually can you not make the money yet is it like put like you can't access the funds is there anything weird like that uh i don't know about that i think they they they definitely started getting like signing contracts and getting paid i don't know what the uh i don't know what the nuances of the the fine print of the law is i didn't look into that so i had this suite mate in college so if you google pure sweat have you heard of pure sweat basketball pure sweat so this guy named drew hanlon he's from my hometown yeah he's the trainer like on instagram that you always see with every nba player yeah so that i've known him since i was a kid and he was my suite mate in college so i knew him in high school and then we went to college together and i was i was a track and field athlete he was a basketball player in college and he was my suite mate so we uh i got to know him quite well and he'd be working on this thing called pure sweat it started out just as like a binder of like paper binder full of workouts that he would sell for like 50 to kids in the neighborhood and then eventually he like made a website and an app and i don't know how successful it is but he was always working at night in this thing he didn't drink or he didn't party and he was always working on pure sweat and he eventually after college started training uh what's that guy like the greek freak or whatever and then like uh yeah brandon beale bradley beal because he's from st louis davis um uh zach levine yeah so he like trains all these guys and i've always i i wasn't close enough to ask him but i was like i wonder how much that pays but anyway he has this app that's like a hundred dollars a year and in college i like we i was a college app division one college athlete i wasn't like even remotely a big deal but they make you sit to these seminars on how you are are allowed and are not allowed to use your image or your name and he was in that office all the time because he was tr he was wanted to make sure he was following the rules because he had this business pure sweat so he couldn't sit like he i think he was allowed to say like this is drew hanlon from belmont university or whatever but anyway this guy crushes it i bet i bet you makes five to 10 million dollars a year off his little business and i have a feeling and by the way do you know that like these like summer camps for basketball programs that's the money maker yeah my uh i have friends that run these that's the money maker and these guys my friends they were they're get paid by the hour i think but i think they were getting paid like 50 to 100 an hour like something crazy and the program makes so much money from these camps so what i think would what what i think is an easy opportunity is you're going to see loads of little pure sweats which is like a really simple app that just has basketball workouts that you pay 100 or 200 a month or a year for i have to imagine you're going to see loads of that that's just such an easy low hanging fruit my best friend trevor he was a kid from wyoming sort of like a five foot nine on a good day white kid who when i got to duke i had found out oh the roommate i got randomly matched with he's trying to walk onto the basketball team so i'm expecting this like six eight black dude to show up and instead this five nine white guy shows up from wyoming and i'm like no no my roommate is trying out for the basketball team i don't know who you are but he's like no that's me and you know this guy was kind of like a drew hanlon type of guy super hard worker amazing shooter you know like whatever you would expect so he was like the best high school basketball player in wyoming comes to duke and tries to walk on ended up long story short didn't end up making the team he was like the last guy cut um and then you know stayed on a sort of like water boy hoping for his like rudy moment and then like that never came like some spot opened up and then they took some other guy because his dad is like super rich and he's a booster of the school and they put him on the team instead and he's like oh [ __ ] this but anyways in the summers what he would do is he would go back to wyoming and people knew him there they were like oh you you went to duke you're uh you're you were like a legend high school basketball here and he would run these camps and every single day he would have basically like three camps running simultaneously each kid just pays a hundred dollars he was underpricing it like crazy and um you would make his whole year's worth of money in like a two and a half month period and then he spent the other nine months out of the year just traveling around learning stuff and then come back and do it again the next summer because he had that brand affinity the way that you're talking about that local brand affinity so i wanted to go over a couple things i saw happening so the first thing is uh cameo was a winner so winners and losers so so cameo is a winner um all of a sudden every athlete just put themselves up on cameo and if you go to cameos like ncaa page you'll see they already cameo already has an ncaa page yeah they already have an ncaa page they're ready to go and this is like you know one of the easy ways celebrities make money there's like you know 17 pages of of people available on the ncaa page oh my god that's so funny and they're all so cheap it's like 25 yeah right because they're like oh sweet that's you know three meals for me on campus here um okay so the second is did you see what bar stool did yeah so bar stool um sponsored an athlete for gambling right so so dave portnoy i don't know the exact story but i was just sort of following this on social media he goes he's like emergency press conference he goes on online and he just says i'm announcing barstool athlete what is that i have no idea and like that was like basically his emergency thing and so then somebody saw some athlete message him was like i'll be the first bartel athlete and he's like okay great we got this you know like whatever some volleyball player girl from this college she's our first partial athlete so he tweets it out you know the more people start rolling in he's like i didn't even say what this is yet and so then he goes he goes on on for a second video and he goes listen a lot of you asking how to become a bar stool athlete if you play division one sports and you blink at me i will sign you i'll send you a t-shirt you want pizza you want campari i don't know what's gonna happen here we may just become the most powerful agency in the world here and so i actually think that like that that legitimately could happen because now the athletes can have lawyers they can have agents um that are helping them with their brand deals and barstool is just there they're ready to take advantage of this they have that brand that's super loved amongst college athletes and so i think they're going to do really well out of this so i would say they're another winner that's that that we talked about the four levels of luck that's level four luck where your reputation is such that luck finds you and so that's what's going to happen the best athletes are going to want to work with barstool just because of their reputation it's almost boring to discuss the ideas for this because it's obvious you just look at what i mean it's just they're now professional athletes almost that anyone has but what i think is interesting is this idea of inflections so like there's these cultural things that happen well it's not sometimes it's cultural sometimes it's political sometimes it's technical uh technology driven but uh mike maples who we had on the podcast he actually has a blog post where he talks about inflections because i look for inflections so it could be everyone has an iphone so now gps is possible or we were able to build this technology to making gps possible so that's a a cultural inflection or like um you know being gay is cool now or not cool but it's accepted so now like having like a gay dating app or whatever you know like that's like a cultural shift or weed is no longer frowned upon that's a cultural inflection um now there's also regulation and political inflections one of them being about two years ago when telemedicine the law changed although it's changing back that provided a huge gap this is a perfect example of a regulation slash political inflection uh and that that big businesses are built in times like this i'm not gonna be the one because i don't care about this but this is the type of inflection that we're going to look back same with sports gambling you know those guys have been at it for years and years and years and it was pretty horrible businesses i believe for a long time something changed boom they took off same with ufc they weren't allowed in new york they weren't allowed here something changed boom they're allowed this is one of those moments that we'll look back on in 20 years and be like think of all the businesses that came from that one ruling yeah there's a couple examples of this so um with you know gdpr this is the like kind of like privacy it's the thing where you go to a website and it says we want we want to you know use cookies to enhance your experience here like uh okay accept cookies and so this is you know a law change that happened and then you saw companies come out of this that were like i think pretty pretty big companies so um one of them is one trust so i think one trust is like over 200 million in annual recurring revenue it's probably the fastest growing enterprise sas company in the last 10 years and it's basically it's gdpr compliance as a service hey big company you are not so the way you set things up is not compliant with the new laws you can get smashed for not being compliant here it's going to spend your it's going to take your team of lawyers and engineers in your company like weeks if not months to just understand the laws then make the changes so that you're compliant like we can do this for you and so one trust uh you know already at a five billion dollar valuation um in less than i don't even know when gdpr came out that's like i don't know five years ago or something yeah so so that's kind of like an exa great example asano was another one this company i wanted to invest in in that same space because that regulation change made that happen another one united health so when obamacare kicked in companies like i think oscar and united health i don't know too much about this space but what i do know is if you go look at the stock chart for united health it's like flat flat flat flat oh something happened at like 2 2009 10 range what happened oh you know like as the as obamacare kicked in the stock price went from like 24 a share to 400 a share now and so uh you know that was a better investment than amazon google netflix whatever during the same period of time because they were well positioned to take advantage of the new law changes so one of the law changes that i think you could take advantage of here is there's the obvious ideas which is great you're an agency for ncaa athletes like what we're talking about barstool or your cameo right you're a platform where they can go on and monetize their their name and face another one is these athletes have to report the deals that they're doing to their school so you can't just do like anything you have to report it i can tell you what most of these athletes are not going to do a good job of keeping track of all their deals how much they get paid what the date was what the terms were and all the collateral they're going to need to report this and the schools are going to need it to report it to the ncaa so somebody who builds that back office sort of reporting tool that underlying infrastructure layer um that's going to become incredibly valuable a way to think about that is like carda or or angel list like these underlying platforms that sit underneath um the the the entrepreneur and so that's one that's one opportunity that i could see taking i actually think that's the best idea that we you've had in a long time all right i'll stop there i won't give you more i don't know what like the total addressable market is for that but like i mean it's enough uh well just i mean for what's happening right now by the way universities to spend tens of thousands a year for your software like that's it's there's enough and you'll be sticky right and you become the system of record for all these things they're not going to want to switch two years in because this other system of record has a new feature so whoever gets plugged in as the system of record has the opportunity to like own that data you're you're entrenched in all these universities who are not looking to take a bunch of risk and then you could build on all the add-on services so you can build on other things that allow you know whether it's banking or it's contracts or it's uh marketplace for deals whatever you can build all that on top of the data records record book you know what i just realized now this company that you and i invested in there's actually a lot of competitors but we invested in this company called stan yes um i don't even know the url it's like stan dot me stand with dot me and basically what it is is you um you put a link in your twitter bio or your linkedin bio you click that link and it's like link tree where you see like five different pages you can click off to but it says like book a call with me sell you this thing it's basically for commerce you know like giving you money for an exchange for some type of you know whether it's time or document perhaps we'll see those type although i don't necessarily believe that that will be the case but um this thing might like impact that business but so i think there's a bunch of cool inflections here um and this whole like idea of inflections i think there's a lot to learn from i was just reading about thomas edison and basically he was like look i just invented this light bulb it's gonna work it's amazing but there was no power at the time and he's like well we can power it by putting up these these wires that go from house to house to house and the government was like no we're not doing this and so one day he uh hosts a dinner and he goes i want all you guys to come to this dinner and they come up to the dinner and there's no lamps so it's pitch black and they're sitting there they're like what the hell are we doing and then he just flips a switch and boom his lights come on automatically and there's waiters there ready to greet them and they're like and he's like this is how people are gonna live from now on and they go oh great okay fine we'll we will allow you to uh put electricity throughout manhattan in the smaller area to test it out and so this idea of and that is how by the way i got chills while you're telling that story i love that and that is how uh ge came to be eventually was uh in a bunch of these companies uh that thomas edison had on uh you know he was involved in a little bit of everything and so anyway until you tweet something that thomas edison invented the word hello yeah so basically before edison people would say greetings or good afternoon like hello wasn't even a word in fact the word hello it was pronounced a little bit differently it was like how low or like something silly like that and when he invented the phone he was actually partially deaf and also the phones weren't very good so he would call like an operator in order to set this up and they would have to think of a word to say to be like the greeting on the phone and he was like well the word hello i can actually stream that pretty easily and so i'm gonna start saying hello like it was hello it was like originally it was meant to like as a as a word to like say oh you surprised me hello you surprised me you know uh and so that's how he started saying it and then once people started using the phone they started saying it and the phone got better and then it just became a hello wow and that's that's how the word hello came to be and then anyway this idea of inflections are actually really interesting so there's all types of moments where these things are capable and i think that this ncaa thing it's interesting the idea you said is interesting but the concept here of inflections is actually more important because we're actually seeing it happen right now and by the way i hear this so often um two two examples come to mind one i was talking to um this guy jesse poojie who we should have on the podcast i know him he lives in st louis that's right and he was telling me his story you know oh how did you build your company he built this company ampush it was like this digital marketing agency that was working with dollar shave club and blue apron and all the big brands and so and they eventually sold it and so one of the things he had said he's like yeah you know we were just doing this other thing and it was kind of wasn't working and then that's when uh you know like that's when whatever the facebook platform launched um or facebook announced you know news feed or google launched adwords or whatever right there's all these like moments where a new thing comes into existence he's like well like this thing we're doing is not working so like let me go jump on that and um and the same story is true for for uh our friend sully who he was like yeah i quit my job at microsoft i wanted to go be an entrepreneur i didn't know what i was going to do so i um i moved back in to my parents house and like that day that i moved in i was you know just browsing the internet and i saw that facebook launched this new platform app platform so i was like okay cool like let me try to build an app today and he's like i didn't know if it was gonna be a thing but like he was one of the first app developers on there built a simple dumb app and like immediately started to like go to fly on facebook because facebook was that good of a like uh platform and it was so new that people wanted to play with the new thing on the platform and so that was like their start and i've really heard this a bunch of times which is a lot of times as an entrepreneur you just need to be in the market you need to be in the game and even if your current thing's not working if you are aware of these like inflection points these shifts these platform shifts or or big changes either in law or technology or uh open platforms things like that you're you're the perfect person to just shift over because you're kind of like already jogging you're not at like a cold start you're not like at a job where you got to decide if i should quit or not and um and you weren't so successful at your current thing that you're that you're married to it so you hop on over and i've just heard this many many times over this same um same model of like yeah i was just doing this thing it wasn't really working that great and then boom i saw that facebook ad platform launched so i made an ad for t-shirts and i started selling like crazy and then i started you know then you know those are the glory days and it's all downhill from there but and we are seeing we're seeing these actually constantly so um like there's a thousand examples that we can just give that just happened in the last five or ten years i mean you said facebook you said google you said you could say the same for snapchat clubhouse likely won't pan out but that was definitely an opportunity to have one this ncaa thing the medical thing where now doctors could practice uh remotely because kovid i mean working remotely i mean there's just they happen constantly what i like to do is i like to read politico politico is a cool site that tells you on regulation updates that's a great way to learn about these um but there's like loads of different inflections and they happen consistently and you you could be an insider to have to see some of them so like you know if you're not working in tech you're not going to see like the the power of facebook early on but like a lot of them are actually like the the information is oftentimes blatantly obvious it's not obvious that this is going to be the one but it's blatantly obvious like all right this could be a inflection right yeah and it goes back to that same two by two matrix uh this athlete thing is um is basically its new problem like all of a sudden a whole bunch of people have a new problem these athletes have to keep track of their records they want to make money they can now do this and there's going to be old you know you can take some old solution and repurpose it for for this new opportunity this new problem that that exists in the world and so all right let's move on let's do another one uh do you have one or you want me to do yeah so um i just found this company and i actually heard of it for a while i'll tell you two interesting companies that i i discovered um the first one it was it's called nera.com before this it was called fyi i think yes um so the reason why i came i i found this do you know who heaton shy is i know he shot yeah i invested in euro by the way oh you did yeah oh sick all right well we could talk about it so heat and shock so there's this guy named neil patel who's like the face and if you are probably a little bit younger than me then you probably don't know who he is but if you're about my age or older you probably know who who neil patel is he had this amazing blog called quicksprout and this was like if you wanted to learn anything about search or google his blog for somehow i don't know how he managed this covered pretty much everything and he built a huge blog for seo and it became a huge business and he launched loads of different software products on top of it well heaton shaw was his uh right-hand man and probably the operator behind the brains behind this he just launched this new business a while ago and i had i looked at my old messages i dm'd him two years ago when he first launched it but i didn't have any money at the time and i was like dude this is amazing and so he changed the name to nira and it's really simple what it is is basically if you are a company like hubspot so you have 30 or 3000 employees or the hustle when we had just 10 employees even when you have 10 employees my current gmail has a 100 gigs full so let's say you do times 10 that's a thousand gigs that's like a terabyte i believe of data that's like hundreds of thousands of documents and images and whatever it's really hard to find all of those images but also it's hard to know who has access to all these things so for example you have this document called salaries and you must have like accidentally said like share to everyone who has access to this to this folder you don't [ __ ] see that or if someone quits they still have access to this document called passwords like stupid stuff yep well heaton built this software that i didn't even realize this was a problem i mean i have had this problem but i'm like oh this is actually a great thing that you could sell it was a blind spot you're just like oh this is just the way the world is you know it's just like a problem you live with until somebody says by the way you know you can you could stop that right yeah yeah yeah and so he's been working on but here's so so anyway it's the the product is is interesting but that's not even what i care about it's basically just a search engine for an entire company's documents well that okay so that's what it originally was that's the f1 that's what fyi was which was like a quick way you just type in you don't need to know that the doc is in like normally you want to find a doc you think oh that's in google drive or that's in dropbox or uh maybe it's an asana or so i need to go find this thing so what he made was just like one search bar to go find the document across all your cloud apps and i think you know after a bunch of trial and error and customer development you found out that that's not the problem we're solving the problem we're solving is that second part you talked about which is the security if you go to nero.com it's just it just says protect your company documents from unauthorized access which is exactly what it says like says that's the problem you were talking about right like i just brought somebody on board and they were showing me um you know like a spreadsheet from a previous company that they worked at and i was like you still have access to this and he's like yeah i don't know like i'm not obviously i'm not doing anything bad with it but like yeah it's so [ __ ] up you shouldn't have that you know that's like their kpis um and i'm guilty of this too like you said like you share one thing with an even with a group or a list and now they have a bunch of stuff or somebody leaves and they shouldn't have it or you're sharing it with some vendor and like that vendor still has access and it it is impossible to go through all your documents that are in the cloud and make sure that who has the right thing and so nera is solving that problem by creating like one interface works so i think that's kind of a like a pretty genius uh problem like a problem that they identified that's worth solving i think every this is a every company problem uh as far as i'm concerned and only growing but i want to explain why first of all how did you hear about this because your friends at heaton he hollered at you yeah loosely he uh we're not dead but he's like we're cool with each other and then i saw this i was like oh that's dope how did you see how are you know all this see i'm friends with him and he like i hope we talk and so i saw he was talking about there oh my god that's so funny you're you're in on everything um he uh but there's a few things that's interesting first of all like i'm pretty positive this has i mean he could screw it up and and i mean like there's execution risk here but i think like it's going to be pretty big like if as long as i just have c plus execution but what is interesting to me is and this is out of my world you know you and i do stuff that we come up with an idea and we can make money off of it in five days but it can also like go away pretty easily he's been working on this for two years before is getting any customers with like 10 employees because in order to sell these enterprise contracts especially to the i.t department where everyone's like up tight as they should be you have to everything's got to be buttoned up and it's really cool that i get intel or insight into that because i normally don't ever see that you have to have so much patience to build these sas tools and so i don't think i'm cut out for it but i thought it was really interesting specifically the enterprise ones right there's two types of sas there's like bottoms up where it's just like kind of like consumer like oh you just have this cool product a developer hears about you pm hears about you they just sign up themselves and you're hoping it kind of spreads virally throughout the the company because the product is so good it's product driven growth and then there's enterprise sales and enterprise sales is basically saying i need to go be able to knock on knock on the doors of people the right people at the top of a company i need to be able to sell a product for over a hundred thousand dollars a year eventually and um and that's my that's my game and i'm gonna the sales cycle might be six to eighteen months and i'm gonna do what i can to accelerate that but in reality that's just the way these companies move and i'm with you that that is not the dna i have that's not where i would be that's not where i would be strong but other people you know who do it obviously enterprise sales is like extremely valuable when you can when you can do it yeah so i just wanted to bring this up because it was interesting to like talk to him and be like yeah we're working for two years doing this our road map is this and that is just not really what we talk about a lot of like this like epic planning and like really like all right in three years hopefully we'll be here uh next in two quarters we'll be at this and i actually think that that's good i i wish i were like that a little bit i'm not uh but i thought it was crazy fascinating to see how you have to sweat the details so much before you even get a customer and you just spend so much money right you know 10 20 engineers to do this so i just wanted to bring that up you want to do another one yeah let's do one um i think i've said this once before on the pod but i want to do i'll do it quickly you tell me if we've already talked about it but it's this idea of zapier for sounds have i talked do you know which idea i have here you didn't bring it up last time but i i've heard this phrase before from you i don't think you brought it up you were the one who kind of really highlighted zapier to me right i was using it and zapier for all i knew might have just been like two dudes you know who built this as a side project and they're kind of in they're on andy hackers.com bootstrapping and they're at you know 8 000 a month of mrr no zapier is like a billion dollar company multi-billion dollar multi-billion dollar company that was largely bootstrapped i think i think they they got they raised a million dollars in funding and used that million dollars in funding to get to a billion dollar status right so so pretty freaking impressive when you go to the product it's like a very simple thing zapier just lets you say hey it's like a pipe so it just connects two different services so you might say hey whenever somebody signs up for my on my website for my mailing list put them into this spreadsheet or like send me an email um and so you're just connecting like gmail and your your website or you're connecting like whatever shopify and slack so you just connect you just create these little formulas if this happens then do this and so that's what zapier is and zapier's become very very successful obviously because people want that they they want to say okay they want to basically nobody wants to build anything it's like there's a million there's a tool for everything but they don't speak to each other so the xavier is like a connector between tools so anyways xavier for sounds what is it so my friend um samir had this idea and uh smirbala and he was gonna do it and then he like found a better opportunity like there's a fast-growing startup and he joined as like a exec there instead um and i was like oh dude i love this idea and i agreed for like i put like a one and a half year embargo on talking about this idea because i thought he might do it at this point i'm pretty confident he's not going to do it but the visioning outline was pretty damn good he goes every team every company has something in there some event that happens in their company that they celebrate for the hustle it might be getting an email subscriber maybe it's getting a new advertiser to come on board or selling a trend subscription and um like wouldn't it be great if there was just a sound right the old kind of like and in most offices there's like a gong i bet you guys had a gong or your sales yeah you have a gong you have a gong you literally you go you make a sale you stand up you walk to the gong you grab the thing and you hit it and everybody knows boom the good thing has happened and in our office we used to manually wire this up we built a charity product and every time somebody donated it would go cha-ching on the like speakers in the office and you would do that until it gets too annoying and then you kind of turn it off if it gets like too frequent and so i really like this idea of basically taking any service you have maybe it's stripe maybe it's your email list maybe it's uh your your um your bank account whatever and um and anytime the good you just basically create these formulas you say if this good thing happens play this sound play it on my phone that's like essentially like a ringtone and you know or play it on my sonos speakers or whatever in my office and so the cool thing that you could do with this is i think that's a pretty simple problem and i think people will like that they'll be able to hook it up but it actually gets pretty sophisticated because you can't what you can't do is you can't say like hey you know what at the beginning notify me about everything and then as it gets more mature what you really want is to say hey when we get if we hit 100 subscribers today play that sound i want to know when we hit 100 for the day right because every everyone now it's too annoying it's too frequent so let me set this better rule so there's nothing that lets you set those rules so i think there's a very simple company to build here that's zapier for sounds that could be a sas company that you know i think it could do a few million dollars a year but maybe it's more like zapier maybe this is a bigger problem than i would have otherwise expected and could get into the tens of millions or even 100 million dollars of revenue just celebrations as a service what do you think all right what my reply is going to sound like a tangent but it's not so again i'm on this edison kick i'm reading all about him and in the biography when he created the phonograph so basically a record player people are like why are you wasting your time on this stupid toy like this is not interesting this is not going to help anyone this is so dumb this looks janky and obviously it wasn't right it changed the world and uh it was the first time that anyone had ever heard requ someone's voice before besides you know just talking and a lot of really cool ideas that great people have or ideas that turn out to be amazing whether it's airbnb or uber they sound like these stupid dumb things you're actually particularly good at finding things that are toys or silly on the surface and making the case for why this can actually be huge and big and you're because you kind of default to optimism what is your default to optimism and how this could be big because my default is this is such a silly i'm i'm i recognize that i default to that but although i'm trying not to my default is this is just a what like what that's such a small silly thing tell me everything uh yeah i think it probably is a small silly thing but i like things that for sure can win at the small scale and there's a hey who knows a path that you can go down because i think most things that end up quite big um they typically will start with what looks like a kind of humble humble level of ambition right facebook it's a college network for harvard and then oh maybe it's it's a social network for all colleges and then it becomes now you know they literally just start building this like internet pipe in africa to basically bring bring internet to more people in africa so more people can use facebook right like their ambition was progressively growing there's interviews of zuck early on when they're like oh are you gonna expand to high schools he's like no i don't know i mean like does it have to it could just be a cool college thing right that was zuck then and zuck now is like you know let me take over the the universe and so i think i like ideas like this that that will start small the thing that gives me hope that this might be big bigger than you think is every single company i know wants to celebrate their wins and morale goes up when you celebrate your wins and so if you can come up with simpler ways to celebrate progress i think it'll make happier companies and i think that managers will want that want that option or want to be able to configure that option so that um yeah everybody feels a sense of progress everybody feels a sense of of a boost as you know like you used to say every email we're a pirate ship and every email subscriber is a little bit of wind in our in our sales right so how do you make it actually feel like that versus just sitting in every day in the office and only focusing on all the problems and all the things that are broken i actually think that uh there's a great lesson here i didn't used to think about this way when i was a little bit younger and now i'm i'm changing but i remember when i first started creating stuff and i see a lot of people who are early in their career of creating stuff they think like uh the market's like too saturated like no one buys courses or uh you know there's already like ads no one clicks ads but what you actually just did was interesting is you looked at the macro like the the high level like human beings do want this so you so the way that you just described it you goes you go everyone i know all companies want to celebrate a win like we all know celebrating a win is first for is great we also know that a lot of them celebrate a win with a sound therefore it actually is plausible that this could be interesting and i think that that's far more productive and helpful than starting the other way around so for example i would justify a course like we all know that people want to learn how to do this and we also know that a lot of people buy stuff so like it's pretty justifiable that if i execute well people will buy this and that's like an easy way to like back yourself into like of course this can succeed it can succeed a lot i don't know but and i think that that's actually a really interesting way that you tend to look at things um and that's cool that's cool all right let's do one more uh one more idea right now do you have one or you want me to do one i could tell you one and um i don't want to make this all about stuff that i'm investing in but so i i will disclose i am an investor in this but i actually am not entirely sold on the idea i'll say that so click that website stake dot rent okay i'm on it so let me just tell you what i see first reaction it says cash back for rentals is here pay your rent and get cash back at a home or office that offers stake okay so what does that mean okay so there's this guy i don't even know his name i barely talked to him but he created the rewards program for amex and a couple other airlines and so these reward programs they give you stuff in order to make you happier so you want to stay with amex so uh discounts to stuff uh in order you know when you sign up for amex you you get a discount for movie tickets or on your insurance and so he was thinking and this guy knows nothing about real estate i don't i don't think so um and he was like we should actually do this for rent and when you think about it a lot of actually renters or or landlords actually do this so they say i'm gonna give you a month's free or two months free have you seen signs for that yeah especially to start your lease yeah yeah so it's very common so they're already doing that and he was like you know if you give someone one month free that's 8.3 of annual rents that you're giving someone a year right if instead you made it so you get three or four or five percent cash back every month that you pay your rent on time that's actually kind of an interesting way to build loyalty amongst the renter and it's like a smaller you know it's like a gold stock like sometimes sean might be happier if i give him a gold star versus like giving him a hundred dollars right you know what i mean okay that's interesting and so the math i mean three percent every month would add up to more than eight for the year so how does the math work is it like more like one percent cash back basically or what yeah it it it's a smaller fee i i don't know what th what the exact fee but you it's usually less than it's like less than six percent a year um and so it's something like twenty dollars a month but it and they get the money if they pay the rent on time and they're busy they're proving to the landlord hey look if i give if i help your renter if i if your renter feels like i'm getting a bonus for paying my rent on time every month uh i will lower the i will lower your your sort of defaults and your uh late payments uh on rent by expert just a little bit yeah if they can show that one behavior then they can go to every landlord and say the same thing that's the idea exactly and i thought that was kind of interesting and the reason why i thought was interesting is there's actually a few things i don't i don't care about the stake dot rent whatever who cares what there's a few things interesting here one what i like is a guy with no experience in real estate but experience with human behavior being around loyalty and looking at different places to apply that that intrigues me um i lost my train of thought but but that's really interesting to me oh and the second thing is when i heard this idea i'm like well this is like this doesn't seem like a groundbreaking idea like this seems shockingly obvious and easy to pull off why isn't anyone doing this part of me was like well if no one's doing it there's a reason why no one has done it right yeah like that's one side of things but the other side of things is like maybe this isn't the right outsider so i thought this was like an interesting idea do you think that this this can work uh yeah i think this could work i i think it's hard because if you it depends on your world view like the first time i heard about um what's it called layaway you know you know about layaway and this yeah i mean it doesn't really exist much anymore it doesn't sound like privileged i think it exists i think it exists in a big way still so i think at like um you know i think it was more popular years and years and years ago like when i my dad used to tell me all the time when he was a kid he would do layaway right so so basically layaway i i didn't know about this but basically let's say you go to a walmart and um you go to walmart you want to buy something you don't want you don't have the money to pay the whole thing you basically say i want to put this on layaway and you it's what i thought was going to happen is it's more like those uh you know buy now pay later type of things where it's like um you have to keep it yeah like it's like a firm or something like that where you you buy the thing and instead of paying the whole hundred dollars up front you make four payments of 25 bucks and you you pay it over time but you get your thing from day one with layaway from what i understand it's the exact opposite layaway you just put the thing on hold there and then you come back every month and start making your payments until you own the thing so it's like kind of like it's like doing a chore in a way right it's like it's like telling your parent hey if like i will i will work hard for four straight months in order to get this thing and so this is apparently like a very big i should have looked this up i didn't know we're going to talk about it but uh layaway is actually like a pretty huge part of like the economy especially in in like kind of like lower end retail like walmarts and stuff and so um so i thought that was kind of interesting and and it got me thinking about like all these little like incentive structures around paying for things so what you're talking about is incentive structure for uh rent there's other incentives around rent i don't know if you've seen have you seen rhino it's like a rent uh service basically you pay your rent and you build your credit by paying yeah i love those i i i wanted to do one of it so it's sayrino.com i wanted to use one of them because for years my credit was only okay because i didn't have credit but i'm like it's [ __ ] that your rent doesn't count as credit yeah so so i don't know if that's what reina does but some people do that then then what rhino is doing is they're basically like they looked at when most people when you go rent a place you put the first or the first and second month's rent down as a deposit and they're like dude that means there's like x hundreds of millions or billions of dollars that are just deposits that are just locked away and so um and so so basically what they created i think was like an insurance product that said hey you don't have to pay you don't have to pay your you don't have to put a thousand dollars down as your deposit instead you pay five dollars a month as an insurance policy and we will we will cover the landlord if the deposit ever kicks in and you get to keep your money instead of putting down thousands of dollars as a deposit and having that dead money just locked away for a while and i thought that was i think that's what rhino does now but there's all these like interesting things around either real estate incentives another one i want to tell you about is smile.io have you ever seen this probably not it's more of an e-commerce thing but i'm right now i'm in the process of designing like a loyalty program and um so when you when you said this thing about the guy who did it for amex that's interesting because i was just researching amex as loyalty like the psychology of these programs let me read it so smile dot io turn your hard earned sales into repeat customers maximize your customer acquisition efforts and turn transactional sales into passionate brand advocates i don't really know what that means so do this instead go to this website and just look at the bottom left where it says uh where it says give 10 get 10. give 10 get 10. um well i see three for 40 at the bottom left see there's a little pop-up that says 10 get 10. so in this is two things so this is powered by smile.io so basically what smile. is they're going to e-commerce stores and they say hey you should have a loyalty program you should have a referral program just like starbucks and amex and these companies that spend millions of dollars and thousands of hours fine-tuning and designing this thing we'll just make it like a shopify app for you and so what does the shopify app do so basically you go on and it's like you want a referral program cool here's the thing that will be on your site so any customer who comes in they know that if i share this with a friend and they get a discount so created a two-way reward system the second thing is if you scroll down there's like a little like points program in this case it's called bubbles um but but the points program basically says here's how you earn points you follow us on instagram you like our stuff you buy you for every dollar you spend in the store you get five points um tell us your birthday well if you if you create a birthday we'll give you 500 points uh write a review you get 200 points so they incentivize all these behaviors that you know leads to a stickier customer and in doing so they get points that they can redeem for free [ __ ] in the store like store credit basically and so all of that like reward system magic they just make available and easy for any e-commerce store right so then it sounds a bit like infomercial but really i don't i have no skin in the game here i just think it's a sick product but i love the idea of basically taking like what the big brands do and what the big brands have spent millions of dollars developing for themselves and then just turning that into an app that any little mom and pop can just plug into their store and have that same user experience and so i've seen this as a trend as a business like kind of like model blueprint i told you about that company i invested in joe coffey they did the same thing they took the starbucks mobile app which was like super slick made it easy to order on your phone you earn stars for everything that you buy and they basically give any mom and pop coffee shop a white label version of that same app called joe coffee and so now you can have order ahead you can have loyalty points you can have push notification marketing you have all the things that starbucks put like probably tens of millions of dollars into building they just made for and they said good we're going to arm the rebels we're going to give this to all of the indie coffee shops instead of just what just starbucks having it because they can afford the r d this is sick i uh yeah this is sick i'm looking at it now uh does this work have you implemented this like when i see these um rewards programs or things like that like when i go to a lot of ecomm sites uh there's like a wheel that you spin and if you enter in your email you get something like there's all these like tricks and we put we went from normal and pretty looking thing that says hey you know give us your email for a discount code to the wheel it tripled conversion rate tripled so have you implemented this club tub i just uh started working on this last night to to implement it but i'm like i'm figuring out what are the perks because you have to find the balance right if you give too much value away it eats all your margins and if you make it too shitty then nobody's motivated to do anything you wasted your time you got to find the sweet spot where it's like compelling enough to them and it doesn't eat away your margins and that's the sort of like that's the art of this um of doing it but i love that i can do this without knowing how to code i think that's kind of like you know a great business model an idea and so i would do that if i wanted to think of other ideas like this i would just go look at what do the top retailers like i'd go to starbucks i go to lululemon i would go to you know whoever macy's uh nordstrom and i would walk around i would use their online shop and i would walk around their store and i would say what have they built that's custom and awesome for them and then how can i make the white label version of that and offer it to every other retailer that's competing with them there's this great thing i want to bring up basically i don't know where i heard about it but at facebook chamath or someone early on discovered that there's like the magic number of seven um i basically if you create a facebook account we need you to add seven friends right away and if you add seven friends you're likely to become a facebook user forever or for a long period you know what i'm talking about yes basically they've said the aha moment meaning aha moment when we talk about product building is just like a user comes to your site they don't know what the [ __ ] going on they're kind of confused they're trying to sign up and finally there's an aha moment where they get actual value from the product they're like oh you know like if i go to mint.com the aha moment is seeing all my financials you know like laid out in front of me in my budget and my pie chart oh wow automatically that's the aha moment for mint you got to do a whole bunch of [ __ ] connect a whole bunch of bank accounts and credit cards to get to that but when you're there you're sticky for facebook what they found was seven friends in 10 days was the aha moment so once you saw seven different friends on your feed and if you could do that within 10 days you were like super super sticky so at the hustle we found i don't remember the numbers off the top of my head but we found like if you open five out of seven days right off in the first seven five times the first seven you're gonna be with us and we're gonna call you a gold person right and so uh whatever and we have this new thing called snippets where we're trying to automate a lot of the email content and you sign up for the hustle and you tell us what type of news you care about and we automatically like give you a customized email and what we're seeing is that the people who fill that information in and it's like a relatively long flow they are like three or four times more engaged than other people right and a debate that i have and i'm bringing this back to what we're talking about is that i actually think the question is like were those people more likely to become power users anyway and they are filling that out or are they becoming power users because they fill that out and i would argue it was the second one so like if someone's gonna give what's this tub huh whatever this would become whatever we're talking about yeah if the are they going to become are they power users already and so they're more likely to give you your email and like you on instagram i would actually say no because you were there going through this little small indoctrination process they are now becoming power users it's like what are you are you confident therefore you're going to flex your muscles or do you flex your muscles and then become feel like you are confident right and so i actually think that making users do this stuff you are turning them into power users yeah i mean it's true too i think there's an element of both i think that the people who are already power users are gonna be like oh my god my favorite thing has more value i can go get like let me go do it and then there's a whole bunch of other people that are potential power users if the circumstances were right if they followed you so then they would see your updates if they gave you their email so that you could show them the new stuff blah blah blah then then you're gonna get more uh you're going to higher likelihood of turning that casual person into a hardcore person and so i think i think both do happen do you want to save this you want to wrap up now and save some of the stuff for next week yeah actually i just want to say two more examples of the same trend so um the the same trend if you go and look at the hustle's emails uh you guys have at the bottom like a a survey thing it's like were you happy medium or sad from the ceo you have an ambassador program and a lot of those were like things you either you got off the shelf and modified or you just built homegrown and so if you're a newsletter if you're if you want to build something for the newsletter industry go look at what the hustle go look at what you know axios or what these guys are all using and be like cool how do i give every newsletter the ability to just have this feature without um without having to build it themselves because clearly it's working and they're competing with groups like the hustle that are like years ahead have employees have money to be able to spend on this type of stuff yeah and we did have to build a lot of that by the way and it was horrible and it breaks all the time and like it's i would wave like a lot of people a lot of people who there's this whole there's a large contingency of people who say oh let's build our own stuff a lot of people who have been there done that will say the exact opposite which is never build anything if you don't have to always use off the shelf right i fall into that category and i wish i wish a lot of the stuff had existed i'd rather pay a software fee than an engineer and you talked about this once you were talking about paywall software you're like yeah i'm in the media business and like the best sites have really good smart paywalls that convert and then the rest of us are using this kind of like crappier version of that like why don't we all let's just pretend and say the new york times has the best paywall flow that's causing highest conversion rates somebody should take that and just say do you want the new york times payroll on your site great here's new york times paywall as a service an example another example in this trend is um slice so basically domino's had the best uh pizza ordering experience it's like you would order the pizza on your phone then it would show you the progress bar it's like oh you know like you know john has put it in the oven uh you're 20 minutes oh it's out of the oven we're just putting the toppings on top oh it's in the car it's almost near you hey it's at your door and so like you know they spent a lot of money doing that because they're dominoes they can afford that and what slice did was slice went to every indie poppy indie pizza shop and basically gave them an app that was the domino's mobile ordering experience and said hey now you can compete against that so let's just compete on the basis of whose pizza is the best rather than well they made it so easy and fun to order and mine still is like call me and i'll write it down on a piece of paper um and they became a billion dollar company doing that in that space it's the same model that when you see three or four versions of these that's the pattern recognition to say okay that's a that's a blueprint i can follow to get a new business idea i agree and we want to wrap up there yeah let's wrap up this one and then uh yeah all right we uh that's the episode holler let's travel never looking back

worth and it appears you're worth a billion dollars yeah so yeah how does that feel and he's like uh no i told him i was going to talk to him about that so we talked to him about just like well let's rattle off some of the dope things he's done so started hubspot hub spots like whatever 25 billion dollar company or something like that but he's done some other cool things early investor in coinbase dropbox and loads of different stuff right and then also just has kind of like he's like us he's got that itch that entrepreneurial itch so he like we talk a little bit about he's got like 20 domain

got ideas loaded into them like oh here's what you might do with this idea and then here's a good domain name for it and so i think he's you know he's sort of like he's one of our people in that sense like he's an idea person he's a frameworks person so he shared some frameworks he shared a bunch of ideas two two really big ideas one idea on air he goes sean if you want to start this i'll fund you right now for five million dollars yeah he made me an offer i pretty much couldn't refuse i just had to sort of you know uh yeah squeeze my thighs and sit still here so so you know but i thought it was exciting i thought the actual ideas were really great um so i think people are gonna like that we talked a little bit about the we talked a little bit about wealth we talked a little bit about kind of like early days you know hubspot and hustle acquisition and then we talk a bunch about ideas and then we uh some of those ideas are about like a new different type of linkedin or remote community we talked about um oh he talked about his framework for evaluating if an idea is good or not if he should pursue it that was actually incredibly educational it was awesome dude it was great so uh we'll get to the episode can you guys do me a favor though click that subscribe button on itunes and that follow button on spotify that would mean a lot uh do we have to tell them anything else well there's a thing going around where if you just post on your social networks and you're just like hey you know psa to whoever needs this this podcast you know makes my commutes amazing this is the best business podcast hands down um you know good karma comes to you in your next life so that's just something if you're interested in having a good next life i would just do that yeah and i'll reshare that for sure i mean because it impacts my ego and we hit i hit i share all i share all compliments so go ahead and do that make sure you share the itunes or spotify link with it thank you very much here's the thing about me i like compliments all right yeah all right enjoy this episode i don't remember what i was going to say but right before you came on i was asking darmesh what he listens to and he says that he listens to us almost every day for the past 60 days amazing has that uh changed you have you probably become a worse person you seem like a pretty good person i feel like if you listen to us for 60 straight days there's gonna be a part of your brain that's good but a part that gets like corrupted slightly you know it's i think that's true that's an astute observation um it's you know we've just have uh i won't say like completely diverge in past so i'm just a yeah it's been good though i'm a believer in and like just these kind of orthogonal things that's like oh this is not stuff i'm like you know looking at retail businesses or like you guys have a wide array of stuff um but i think that kind of thing like builds a different muscle group and i think it's been it's gonna be useful for me um i'll put it to you that way it's i think we're not uh right at birth by any stretch we have things that you know we reflectively have in common but um there are things that i'm just different and it'll come out in the pods i'm a weirdo we're on now so this is a pod but we uh yeah this might i have a feeling this might go a little long and i'm okay with that uh sean do what you want but we um i like in my world so i was just hanging out with heaton shaw yesterday and your name came up we were just talking to nathan barry the other day your name came up sean and i are in this text group where people talk about big clout your name comes up your name comes up everywhere like you're you've got you're like a little like you got like a spider web like you get your hands and all these little things and i i think part of it's because you've been in the game for a while and you're incredibly successful but do you so uh this is dar mesh darmesh is the uh you're the co-founder of hubspot is your title cto yes do you are you active like are you working really hard at hubspot like how do you have time to have your hands on all this different stuff uh so the answer is yes uh hubspot is my obsession and preoccupation uh anything else that you see me doing uh there's probably some diabolical threat that connects it back to hubspot there is right um so yeah it's my baby it's the thing that uh i spend pretty much all of my kind of non-family time non-personal time on um so it's my and i just want to describe for people who are not watching so you should go to the youtube channel it's youtube.com i think hustlecon and you'll see the videos but uh so here's what i see so darmesh is sitting there he's got a keyboard like a piano keyboard to his right uh he's got i think a steve jobs uh piece of art behind him or is that lennon or something like that i can't tell exactly who it is john lennon maybe um and you're in this room so just is this where you work on a day-to-day basis uh so this is well yes and no so that's why you're getting tricks sean you're getting tricked listen this is my living room um but it's a like i capture a moment in time when the living room was somewhat less disorganized than it usually would be but it's a virtual background i've got the green screen and things set up so i can oh okay that's pretty good because you usually when you have a green screen it's like half your head also turns into like the background and uh this one's actually pretty good all right i'm impressed i've done like a multiple green screen so i'm sort of surrounded with it so if i need to twist the camera one way or the other um so you're kind of doing the oasis thing we talked about you basically you have a virtual background but the virtual background is not just you on a beach like a fake situation it's your actual living room when it's like clean and perfect the way you want it or whatever and you're like that's what i want my background to be regardless of the reality of the the current whatever your current situation is i like that trick really cool is that the keyboard itself is actually real that's not part of the background you'll see so let me um let me do like a a very brief intro and like an overview of what we're going to talk about so darmash sent us like a list of ideas we're going to get into them but i need to give a background here so the listeners entirely understand so hubspot today is like a 25 or 30. i don't know whatever the market cap is uh so 25 billion dollar publicly traded company you co-founded it 15 years ago i think prior to that you had another startup that you sold for a significant amount of money we can talk about that throughout this whole time you own uh i believe millions and millions of dollars worth of domains like you um you bought your wife like as a a gift humanism.com which we gotta talk about that's pretty funny you've um you're an eight or an angel investor in a lot of different startups including coinbase and things like that you've got your hands on all these different things like you according to wallmind or wallstreetmind.com you're worth today 850 billion million dollars uh so like you you do a little bit of everything in the world of business it's incredibly fascinating and so i wanted to today talk about you might be well you might be the wealthiest person we've ever had on this podcast i'm going to ask you questions about that um i don't know it's fine please we're going to we're going to ask you questions it doesn't really matter that's one thing i've learned we can talk about that too well that's that's okay if it doesn't matter we're going to talk about it we're also going to talk about um your ideas uh we're going to talk about building hubspot we're talking about why you invest in what you invest and we're going to talk about um uh do you ever invest in non-startup stuff we're going to invest about we're going to talk about a lot of stuff sean what do you think well i would have asked them okay so here's my question my question is actually not about uh darmesh it's actually about uh sam so uh so you see i've always wondered this so you acquired the hustle and i hope you could be as uh as transparent as you want here i think sam will will not care um so i would say dna wise the hustle is kind of a unique company sam's a pretty unique uh dude that you kind of brought into your company different dna probably than the vast majority of employees there uh give me kind of like well and you do you're part of the deal too sean so you're in the book you don't have to deal with me on a day-to-day basis so so doing that deal and bringing these guys in i guess like i don't know are there any interesting observations any entertaining little stories about either pre-acquisition or post that had to do with you know sam and the hustle i'm just curious kind of like what's your view on that side of the table because i've only been on the same side that sam's on yeah and we haven't hubspot has not done a lot of acquisitions uh in the past we've done a handful of them uh pretty much most of them have gone well the one thing that made this different i think as you as you observed is um the dna of the hustle is different than hubspot and um and that's both a good thing and a bad thing so the thing i was worried about is um and and i until now i don't think sam and i have actually ever had a one-on-one chat so this is my therapy session therapy for uh two people johnny the thing i was worried about is that um you know so sam is a kind of what i would think of as a kind of type a personality um just like he's out there he's hustling against the uh name of the company um which is fine but it's just not uh most of the makeup of hubspot is not that we're very we're uh i don't know what the right it's gonna overly stereotype us but we're not type a we're like a kinder gentler humble just quieter kind of company um so that's one thing oh here let me explain it this way sam would be described as brash i don't think anybody would ever describe pub spot as brash well today kieran the guy i work with technically my boss he was like you should probably hire someone outside of hubspot for this role for your growth and i was like well why he goes i think you're too direct for anyone who works at hubspot it's like that that's an example i think that was good advice but um but it's worked out it's worked out well so there have been um like the one kind of minor story i can recall there was a like a twitter back and forth that i think sam had with uh rand fishkin i don't know if you recall this sam that there was something that was said about vcs or investment or something and ran's been a good friend it's like an and uh but it's like oh okay well it's fine i'm like okay you know it's like and not like either party was right wrong or indifferent but i know them you know at least now a little bit uh both but anyway so it's but it's been fine in my defense i i hope and even our podcast defense our goal is we will disagree with people but i hope that it never comes from a place of like disrespect or i'm trying to like hurt your feelings no but i will say i do put entertainment first sometimes so sometimes i will poke the bear for the entertainment value of it when you know the kinder nicer simpler thing to do would be to do to do nothing or just back away uh so i do like to have fun either on twitter or the podcast hubspot too much but one thing i will say this was as far as the deal itself it was one of the better things hubspot has done um in terms of like the strategy behind it i think um is strong in terms of like it gets hubspot into a thing which is where i think the future of kind of sas companies has is going to be heading which is more and more of them are going to control their own kind of distribution versus kind of renting audiences from other people and recent horses and there's other deals that have been done around the same timeline but i'm a believer in companies kind of controlling their destiny in terms of distribution versus constantly just buying from buying audiences and renting them from someone else see this is where you should just say just drop a one line be like you know and we got it at a fantastic price just to drive sam crazy for the next seven years just leave him constantly questioning himself look i think there yeah could we have sold for more definitely maybe like that always is a maybe right um i think that when we sold hubspot i felt was undervalued uh i think when i think the day the deal closed it was or maybe like what was the stock in january was it like it was worth like 350 or was it even less 250 i don't remember today today it's 600 bucks so like our guess my guess was that i think hubspot is undervalued um and also i wanted to create a reputation of someone who was like a fair deal maker and like like i think people will know that uh like if i built something i sold it the all all parties got a good deal and so okay all right sounds good we can switch off the hubs the hustle acquisition so let's do some ideas no wait i want to talk about one thing really quick can we let's talk about money stuff okay because i told darmesh i was gonna ask him this so first of all is it weird that i know what your net worth is today because it's like public information um it's not weird for me honestly like i'm a um i'm generally like transparent i believe in kind of the openness um of the web it's um and i'm a in a sense it's a publicly traded company like that's you know what i want my bank accounts and all my accounts kind of published on the web no but the fact that i'm an executive in a publicly traded company and most of my net worth is in the form of shares which you can take the number of shares which is on the public record and multiply it by the current price and get which is probably roughly 85 90 of my overall net worth because that's where all my money is in hubspot shares um i don't find that weird uh it's yeah has your life changed as this as this has like accumulated and and things got didn't different or has it basically so you had another company before this how much did you sell that for uh 10 or 15 in that range based on how you count it and has your life changed since that moment significantly because that's a that's a significant number in itself right yeah so here here's the thing it's um and i'd like to say no you know i wasn't focused on money or i'm not focused on at the time when i was younger i was very very focused on money and i had very kind of modest upbringing and i was like okay well it wasn't like the money and the accumulation of it it was the freedom you know ever since i was little i i always want to kind of configure the universe to my liking so to speak because i've got my quirks so like these are things the way i like to do things um and having to kind of work in a normal kind of classic job doesn't give you a whole lot of control over your your part of the universe you don't get to control who you work with all that much or who you hire you don't have a lot of degrees of freedom um so yeah i've been thinking back and then i you know i kind of thought about money um and like the first i'll say five million or so um has a dramatic impact had a dramatic impact on my life right because that buys you an inordinate amount of freedom right you don't have to work again um you can invest in things you can do pretty as long as you're not out you know buying small islands and overtaking countries i mean that's a decent amount of money for for folks right um and then after that and their other kind of i don't know exactly what the demarcations are where you know more money adds on a marginal basis a little bit more freedom you can do more things um but you know like the kinds of things i do like i enjoy food and restaurants there's only so much you can actually spend as a reasonable human being even if you like the finer things it's like okay unless you're trying to make a statement and spend 100 times with the average of whatever x is it's kind of hard to you know specifically well even if you have kind of high-end taste honestly the most common thing i've heard i don't know if you would agree or disagree is like there's these levels so it's like first uh in depth in if when you're in debt to no debt that's like the first jump where oh freedom got this weight off my shoulders yeah then there's kind of like you know um uh it's what i'll call there's a zero to one million where it's like oh my god you know mentally i'm a millionaire that's kind of just like a mentally freeing concept an interesting concept that's why we named the pod what we did but also you know that that'll afford you a certain type of lifestyle and then the next jump i've heard is like at 10 or 10 or 10ish where it's sort of like okay at tennis you sort of um you don't have to work like at a million you still got to work at 10 you don't have to work you can kind of like have a couple places to live you could do whatever you want you don't really need to check the prices when you go do things and then there's sort of like 100 or more which is sort of like you know the uh ego gets involved it's like okay now i'm keeping score against you know in the in the business olympics against against these other folks and also you know i could do some like you know like i can i can i can buy an island i can buy a piece of an nba team i can i can go do these different things that are like kind of like bucket list and and the joy what i've heard is sort of like you know for most people is sort of like the joy actually like de-escalates from the from the beginning there like getting out of debt is sort of like the most relief most joy and then sort of like it starts to diminish sort of step by step as you go like the 10 to 100 feels a lot less impactful and less sort of changes your joy in your mood than uh like going from zero to ten yeah i just have two friends i want to pull on as long as we're talking about money um so one is one thing that's kind of helped me reconcile it um in terms of um you know having to be in the net worth now is you know the plan my wife and i have talked about this the plan is to donate 90 plus percent of it right like we have one child we're not going to spoil him so it's not like we're trying to build a multi-generational dynasty that is right not the goal um and so then like you know if i make a really good return on a startup or something like that it's like okay well i'm discount 90 for my wife's foundation that's essentially what it comes down to right right it moves 90 of whatever it is uh i mean i don't i think it'll end up being higher because i just don't think we're capable of actually spending the spending the money um but yeah so that makes me feel better but just kind of taking it back to the early days one kind of lesson i learned early early on and this is useful um beginning part of my career is the kind of the relationship between time and money and one thing is that we spend the better part of the first half of our lives converting time into money right and you're looking for the hours you're looking for yeah you want to get that you know rate up as you can and then the latter half of you're desperately trying to buy time back with the money however best you can right so that's um and it varies a little bit as to when that kind of turn happens but the thing that i kind of learned this was and i thought about it probably a few years after that um so i was making 3.65 cents uh in my first job when i came over as an immigrant and i worked all the way through school took me seven degrees to get my seven years to get my four-year degree i was working full-time the whole way through um and that wasn't a lot of money and as it turns out um i had to do pretty much nothing was delegatable but then once i got to the point where i was making 10 20 50 an hour it's like okay well now and like all of my time i can make as much billable as i want to as much as i'm humanly possible willing to work there was someone willing to pay me for that time i was an engineer that's how things work back then it was and the the pivotal point for me is i i got this uh it was in my early 20s i got this bump to like 125 hours working as an engineer and that was an ungodly amount of money i was in birmingham alabama this is the uh the 90s uh that was like real money right and i was working lots i was making a fair amount so then i made the decision that if there's anything i'm doing with my time that could be done by spending less than 125 an hour i'm being an idiot by actually doing it right if i enjoy it that's a different story but if i'm not it's just stupid and so i've carried that kind of idea it's like okay so what value would i place in my time right what is occupying my time that i can kind of delegate or even if i'm paying a premium it's like okay i could pay 75 an hour just up for someone to pay you know to mow my lawn yeah i hate it but it's still profitable right like you're like why would you do that like i would do that every day of the week um so the one thing that's changed for me um so now like i went back and did the math because i knew i was going to be on this podcast and you might be folks like numbers if i let's say i've worked on average 60 hours a week and i've done that for about 30 years give or take um it's my kind of professional career my average hourly rate across the 30 years would be like 10 000 an hour right and now it's back loaded right effectively by hourly rate and so now it's like okay well if there's anything and i would actually pay a premium right now right above that right like so i would not spend my time even an hour on anything that wasn't worth at least to that it's like okay well like the future of me would buy for 50 100 000 if there's some option value on that time anyway the the short message is uh most people don't value their time enough and don't think about it objectively enough and it like anything else is a resource but it's finite um but put a number on it and then ask yourself like what are the things i'm doing with my time that are not worth that um right and so naval has this uh phrase in his like kind of how to get rich uh podcast or whatever how to get rich without getting lucky he says um he goes you know put up put it up put a um i don't know what he calls it like an outrageously uh outrageous hourly rate for yourself like an emba a super ambitious rate ambitious one one that's way beyond wherever you're at he's like you know ever since i was young this is like one of the smart things i did i just said five thousand dollars an hour some like really aspirational hourly rate he's like if my friends used to laugh and joke like dude you bought this blender you're not even using it go return it and he's like no i'm not gonna go return it i don't i don't enjoy it and it's gonna get me back 30 for the hour round trip you know going and returning this thing at target so like i will throw it away i'll give it away what i will not do is i will not give my time back into that because the hourly rate just doesn't make sense i love that so i've done a similar thing and it's kind of funny to like pick that hourly mark um because it sounds crazy like i my mom will get mad at me she'll come to my house and she'll see the way i'm living and she's like oh my god like this this bill is late they're gonna there's a 75 fee if you don't do it and i'm like i'm not calling them and they can charge me the 75 fee they could charge it to me 10 times like i'm not gonna use this hour like and i'll tell her like look literally my hourly rate is x right it's like thousands of dollars so so are you that's my hourly rate so i'm not going to trade that hour to go do this thing i don't enjoy um because her other argument is well you go watch tv and i'm like well that i enjoy so that that i'm actually spending the money um but sam i know you're a little bit different like when i went to go visit sam in austin he had like cvs receipts that he had been saving in his like glove compartment of his super fancy car uh like he's a dichotomy right he's got he's got well he likes to spend some things but he's also enjoys being frugal it's like that makes me yeah that makes me feel good about myself right like i guess the question i have for you is do you also have an hourly rate do you think about that or you don't do that that framework sam is for you oh for me um yeah i have that framework yeah so like uh yeah i mean it makes me feel good not to waste stuff like i feel good about myself and i feel guilty if i waste it so i feel i feel happy when i do that and i feel it's hard for me to go to bed at night if i if i waste something or i don't return it um yeah i have that hour i mean i mean i have that rate like i just assume that i'm gonna make um i i assume that i'm gonna make three million dollars a year so whatever that hourly rate is but i i think i'm gonna make three million dollars a year and um anything that like will make less than that i don't want to do it but that said like mowing the lawn i get joy from that so i have no problem i don't like put a money thing on anything but like if someone's like hey will you uh in fact sean someone asked us to fly to london to come speak at some event or something and i um i'll afford it to you but they're like yeah it's october and i'm like i don't want to go there i'm like how much money would they have to pay me to go and do this i'm like they have to pay me a lot like right because you'll say yeah yeah excited i just don't they just that just as a payment they'd have to pay me a hundred thousand dollars to do that and like that does not make any sense but i just hate i just hate it and uh so darmesh a couple more uh rich guy questions and we like these because honestly um you never get to ask these even if we were just hanging out personally i could never ask you this but for the for some reason with the podcast it's like sort of okay for me to just like ask you random questions like this and i told him when he wanted to come on or i asked him to come on i go i'm going to ask you this stuff and we gave him an easy out i said if you don't want to answer anything just say you don't want to answer it right and i'm sort of projecting here where um you know i guess like i think i put myself in your shoes what if i had more money that i could ever spend what would i do and so my question to you is um what whether you did it or did or you just considered it what's a sort of outlandish use of funds that you've either considered or done like so for example you know some people are like yeah you know like some people like jets that's not i'm not buying a private jet i'm but what i really care about is i love this sock so i bought every i love jordan's sneakers so i bought every pair of jordans i have this closet in my house just full of these things because i always wanted it when i was a kid right or if they overspend in some area and they they're just happy to have done it or like um it could be like philanthropic like i think if i had a billion dollars i think like two days a year i would just wire somebody like a million dollars i would literally just wire a random person a million dollars and i would just see how that plays out and i think it would bring me like tons of joy and entertainment to do that and see how they react and what happens and what do they what do they do with it like maybe some kid who's working on something interesting i would just be like look here check your account it's there uh you know so give me something that is there anything that's sort of non-standard that you either have done or considered doing yeah the thing that i do is i like those kind of um kind of micro acts of kind of spontaneity that says oh like someone is wants to go to this event or something like that and can't afford it or whatever it's like i'll be a sponsor like if you can find people that want to do this go do this um i'll do that relatively regularly i've taken this the sound so i've taken my average tip amount up to between 50 and 100 percent um everywhere i go and this is partly because i want to make up for all the time when i was younger that probably did not dip well so i'm trying to average it out and that's as long as i can do it without like drawing too much attention because i don't want to be that weirdo guy it's like okay knows like right send some time the wrong signals i want to do it um i do that by the way modesty um it's okay it's just i typically tip 50 it makes me feel good yeah um it's it's yeah and i've worked in the service industry before i know that those kinds of things matter um so i'm a cheap bastard so i'll stay silent here in terms of like you know large things so flying through me the running joke inside the house is uh my wife and i and so she's not from the tech world at all but um so i'm really so i want to like own the world and she wants to save it right like so i will make the money yeah that's something i've uh been relatively good at and she will be able to channel it to good causes and the film for epic effort so she'll be able to do that um so i don't have any like particular specific things um i will say like i am a so i'm the guy that's like jacked with a matrix so if there was a world it's like oh it's like this is um you know like i live a virtual world so there's no not a lot of physical things uh that i crave or desire other than a piano which i've wanted for a while and i have now a piano but it doesn't excite me all that much right it's like it's and because atoms there's a maintenance to atoms right like atoms versus bits like if you have whether it's a yacht or whatever it is a plane like that takes calories i could take i don't care how much you've delegated whatever that's something in your life that's kind of attached to you somehow and i just don't like that i don't like that idea it feels more weighty to me than uh kind of joyful but yes so speaking of time we um so hubspot 15 years old i don't know how many people are here 2 500 3 000 whatever um it seems like you guys like grew pretty fast early on but has it always felt like a grind or i mean like when i when i see you i'm like well you don't have to do this um like you could delegate this you don't have to work here you're set you're good why are you still doing this and does it still feel like a grind and when has it stopped feeling like a grain one of the reasons why i wanted to sell to you um i was like if i don't sell like in this cycle i'll probably have to wait another five years am i do i want to put that work in or do i want to sell now like what like that's a hard challenge did you face that and just walk me through that yeah so a couple things um it's not widely known but um so brian is co-founders we had a kind of heart-to-heart co-founder chat which i encourage all founders to have and we have this list of questions we're going to go through and i've published this on my uh on my own startups blog but one of the things was around um who's going to be ceo and we decided he's gonna be ceo because i suck at being ceo i you know i did that with my first startup for 10 years i'm just not that good at it so that was kind of decision one but decision two which is much um much more unconventional is that i have no direct reports so what my agreement with brian was i'm not going to have any management responsibilities in this company i'm going to be in it 100 but i'm not a good manager now i'm reasonably smart guy if i spent a bunch of time i could probably with some coaching get passively okay at management like i think i could get there i don't want to spend 10 20 30 years of my life getting passively good at something i'm a big believer in take your strengths whatever they are and put like all your energy into kind of amplifying those strengths and getting really really good at that thing and don't worry about your weaknesses all that much so i don't want to worry about my weakness managing people and so we have over 4 000 people at hubspot i have zero direct reports i've never had direct reports in the 15 years and that is partly what makes it much i don't think of it as a grind at all like it's completely discretionary and optional for me uh obviously i have a lot of kind of vested interest in the company but in terms of the work that i do and i've sort of whittled down my life at a hubspot um this has been the this way for better part of a decade um is is like i get it down to like three things i'm gonna work on and that i will change those every few years um so for a long time it was like brand uh culture and what i call boldness which is is the organization taking on enough risk because the temptation is always like once you start having customers and the revenues are growing things like that is just the kind of what we call drag the spreadsheets like oh like here's the numbers this is how it's growing we're just going to drag the spreadsheet and the numbers will flow basically um is to push the organization so we don't do that um so what i do is i will maniacally focus on whatever those three things are and say no to pretty much everything else and and things will swap in and out so i've had you know product in there i've had platform in there um but on that thing whatever it is i'm working on so when i had culture on my list it's like i spent 300 hours you know in the on the culture code deck at hubspot like i'm going to uh do everything i can to learn everything i can to try and get culture to be a thing an upspot um and yeah so it's i find it enjoyable i get to kind of pick the things so my three things are different um you know from year to year i like to dig into the details i don't like kind of floating at 50 000 feet in lofty ivory towers i like to like if i'm going to work on brand i'm in there with the marketing team like reviewing copy and uh going through the and this is why i'm taking sean's uh copywriting or like i i obsess over details um so anyway yep did you see sean that he's in your power writing course yeah i saw that i was like how does this guy have time to do this this is amazing well have you how's it been so far he talks to me all the time that's why i'm like what do you do all day um i i found it very useful i'll say that it's uh and i think copywriting overall is one of the most underrated skills uh in entrepreneurship generally like if people do not realize the amount of leverage you get by just spending 10 20 50 hours and you can learn a lot of what you need just by like reading the top three books on it and just practicing the craft right it's a doable thing and the nice thing about it and one thing i love about it it's like measurable you can objectively measure whether you got better at copywriting or not you can look at your conversion rates to whatever numbers you're trying to to move as a result of your words uh and it's a it's a learnable skill um that's yeah one more question and we can move on but when and the reason why you were able to do those no direct reports is i think that you were the first investor and so like was this was hubspot your idea or was it brian's idea but i think you invested like half a million dollars of your own money to like get it started and aren't aren't you the largest shareholder of the company i am um and so so the idea of hubspot is that you have to decouple the two things um so hubspot was not supposed to happen and here's what i mean by that when i sold my last company and i had been running it for 10 hours uh 10 years and working the proverbial entrepreneurial hours as one would expect right it was self-funded uh bootstrapped and i promised my wife um that i would not do another startup it's like okay well you know the one i'm doing i'm in i can't not be in uh the analogy um you know i use this it's a little bit like being at um like a a gaming table in las vegas right and it's like and you don't know the rules of the game this is how startup entrepreneurship works up here if you're self-funded it's like you're at the table and the only real feedback you get is like sometimes the chips go down sometimes if they go up you're playing you're trying to figure out the rules as you go you don't know but there's one like cardinal rule is that if you leave the table whatever chips you have on the table they're gone every now and then the house will come up to you and say hey would you like to cash into your chips they're worth x dollars and this is the position you were in so i was like okay would you like to sell your company here's what someone's willing to pay for it and if you miss that opportunity you have no idea when the next opportunity to cash out your chips and again so you keep playing right it's like and so the thing i told my wife is like i have to keep playing i did like if i chose to get off the table it's like yeah a lot of lessons this 100 of our net worth was invested in this um and so then eventually when i sold um that was a decision it's like okay i'm i'm leaving the table cashing in my chips i don't have to do this anymore so that's why i went to grad school and my plan was go to grad school um i didn't really get a chance to uh enjoy undergrad because i was working the whole time through and i'm gonna actually go to grad school be a real student apply myself and not go do anything how old are you i was 35 36 somewhere in that range um yep so like a 36 year old college kid living the dream i had a great time it was awesome one of the best things i did um is go back to grad school for a variety of reasons but anyway so i had not planned enough so my plan was go to grad school then maybe get like a phd and then go teach that was my kind of path uh my kind of chosen path uh and then i met brian in grad school and we both have this kind of shared passion for smb we both come from tech different backgrounds and so the first decision we made uh before we even decided what hubspot was going to be was that the two of us should do a company together and if like brian was not going to do a company there would be no hubspot right like i so i had registered the domain name i had kind of noodled on kind of variety of things but then we kind of came together and said let's do this and by the way all through grad school um we were dueling on ideas right we're like okay well we'll do this and we had house five we went to the business plan competition wrote a business plan for early versions of upspot which is fun to look at um but the idea came after like we had kind of narrowed it down to two companies um two past one was in marketing which is what we ended up doing the other one was like a oracle for small business like an erp similar to netsuite which you folks were talking about in the last episode uh all right so let's do some ideas because i think you know one of the cool things what i love about any technically minded person who has business success is typically when when people who are non-technical get into business they go in one of two paths they um they sort of become a financier they're like great still love business but i don't want to sweat anymore so i'll invest and uh and lots of people invest but they make investing the main thing and um what i found is that a lot of people who are technical that end up being successful um they never stop loving kind of what's new where technology is going how behaviors are changing that sort of thing and whether they start a new company or not um they sort of live as a user at the edge and so um so tell me like i guess what's what maybe one or two kind of technologies or ideas right now spaces that are most exciting to you at the moment uh two one is around kind of broadly defined cryptocurrency um and we haven't talked about big cloud yet but i'll bring that out is a cryptocurrencies as applied to other kind of mainstream things so the i if i we're not doing hubspot which i have no plans of doing anything else but um this is the idea of i'm gonna i'm gonna give you my pitch sean yeah what you should do since now you're out of twitch um you should do a professional network um that's powered by the blockchain that i'm going to say this is kindly that uh people love uh because the people don't love the incumbent right now can i can i say my opinion you know you know my opinion can you cool if i say it yeah yeah good linkedin sucks how about this a lot of people say linkedin sucks and um you're suggesting bill that building a different one um i even have a seven figure domain name picked out for you i will write the five million dollar check for you to go do it as far as a seed round uh or up to five million if you want to let other people in that's amazing this just got spicy okay oh my god what's the domain name that you have i am i am dead serious i have uh and you yeah um so and here here's why it needs to wait let's play this out yeah keep going so the issue right now is that you know linkedin yes people don't like it it was a product that was great for its time uh and times have changed now there's a different kind of need and the thing i'm excited about is the intersection of a couple of things one is um you know we didn't have things like big cloud or cryptocurrency before now we do right one of the issues with linkedin is like okay well you've got the kind of spam issue you've got all this like okay well how do i separate all the noise from the signal that's just it's just a pain in the ass over time right the acne tonic move for linkedin is like diminishing utility right it's like it's just going to become painful and then there's there's a cap on where you can go with it so imagine uh that you and so big cloud ended up doing twitter with the blockchain imagine if there was something else that did linkedin on the blockchain and you have your own kind of currency and then you could say hey you know what i'm afraid i'm an engineer that's a free agent or whatever and for 500 i will look at your company and apply for it i'll do a reasonably good job or for ten dollars i'll open your email or for x i'll do this it's like okay there's a right now there's an inherent uh so the thing the cool thing about big cloud is everybody's got a price right everybody's got every coin has a certain value and so the beauty of uh of a professional one would be right now when you go on linkedin um it is not obvious the level of hierarchy right and so you always have people who are uh either recruiters or people who are at the bottom of the career ladder trying to keep connecting and reaching out to the people at the top of the career ladder and they have no real incentive to to to do it so they just sort of ignore linkedin all together why would i even go to this site i'm just going to get inundated with crap that i don't really want and so the beauty of this is that because everybody has a coin value you sort of inherently have baked in this sort of like career worth career value that this person is bringing to the table into the network and so you know um hey somebody has a way to buy attention so they buy your coin which increases your price so it's a mutual beneficialness right now if i go pay linkedin i can send you spam inmail you do not receive any of the revenue from me paying linkedin for the right to spam you right in this case i could say hey if you want to spam me if you want me to read your thing and you want me to to respond to it here's my prices so it becomes revenue generating for me the second thing is that when somebody reaches out i can quickly assess their value in the network based on how how much other people believe in this person how much other people weight this person and so now it's not this kind of like every node kind of looks the same on the surface no they would not look the same on the surface which is really cool correct and just one more thing yeah so yes so that there's a kind of crypto angle where everyone's got a price the other angle is uh is we'll call it page rank for the professional graph right so right now the professional that's cool it's all uh it's all symmetric right so every person you follow gets an equal number of follow value whatever their account goes up by exactly one it's not weighted in any single uh any anyway explain page rank a little bit so the kind of the beauty behind google the original idea that made it um the powerhouse is today is they said okay well how do we determine what the best set of results are to show for a keyword search right and it came down to two things one is like the overall context of the page so if you're searching for uh real estate boston or something like that it'll look at all the pages that's indexed it's like okay well this these set of pages are about real estate in boston to varying degrees that's kind of factor one in the function so which people also just say good content yeah exactly we'll just call it quality like the context content yeah which is a whole round whole thing authority right and the authority is the where page rank comes in though they say okay here's this individual web page that's sitting on the internet we're going to measure its authority by how many links are coming into that page because that's a that's this endorsement of effect and the value of those links passed to that individual page the page rank value of it the authority that gets passed through is based on the page rank of those pages right so it's a recursive function to say oh well if the new york times links to you that's much more valuable than if dharmesh's blog links to you because new york times has more pagerank last piece of the pagerank thing which is super important to know is that the amount of page rank you pass across the links from your page are proportional to your page rank so let's say i have two units of page rank i'm making the number up and if i link to just one person it's your blog sam all the page rank i have on that page accrues to you by transference if i link to 10 different people it gets distributed across those ten links yeah it's a weighted graph versus just a symmetrical graph where we're not so now if you imagine a professional network graph where everything was graphed was like okay well you know i endorse sam and i have a certain authority i have a certain currency if we've got a cryptocurrency underneath it as a result of which sam's currency goes up by x amount so it's not just me buying shares it's just by that so i think the the notion of a follow should go away it's like if you really really like that person buy a dollar buy five dollars or something like that right like that's the one kind of so so what you're saying is just to make sure i understand so what you were saying is instead of just following sam which you have an infinite supply and um you know sort of this is a pretty light signal you're saying in this case you would be able to own some of sam's coin that'd be a pretty strong endorsement and secondly the fact that your coin is worth a lot would mean that because you a valuable person owns sam's coin sam's coin goes up not just by the five dollars you paid but buy some multiple of that in terms of the overall algorithm the way the algorithm weights sam's value now correct so for instance if you raise money if you're a startup and you raise money from uh and recent or sequoia like a million dollars is nine million dollars yeah exactly has an impact the same thing like you know follow shouldn't matter the fact that you know that you follow me should matter more than someone that doesn't hasn't that just joined twitter or big cloud or whatever yesterday right like that's the doesn't make it this is a tremendous idea i'm having trouble containing myself at the moment this is this is one of the more exciting ideas because people don't know exactly what i came here for is to put you on the spot uh he was like okay listen to this idea that's insane you know because i got excited about big clout and i got excited about it because i think that we do want a social network that's inverted so instead of one platform controlled by one company that owns all the data it's inverted it's inside out it's basically no company uh all the data is free and you own you own your own business on top of it and so i think that you know i don't want to say how do i say decentralized without saying decentralized that's my way of saying it okay so i think that's exciting and then a whole bunch of people were like i can't believe you're endorsing the scam project and blah blah blah blah is this is this going to make me rich or is this not going to make me rich i'm sort of like well it's besides the point it might but uh it's besides the point um it's more like this is what the the next twitter linkedin facebooks are gonna look like um in either one or ten years i'm not sure and if big cloud or the next thing i'm not sure but i'm gonna play with this one and i'm gonna like give it a ride so that when the right one does arrive whether it's this one or the next one i've i've no i know what i'm looking at i know what's real and what's not and that's why i recommended people go play with it just to see um just just be on the forefront of it something like it needs to exist right whether it'll be the one or not i don't know and so i've been spending a fair amount of calories trying to kind of understand the mechanics of big cloud itself um money did you do on the uh top creators uh list so i've been kind of moving up the up the curve so to speak yeah dude the thing about how much have you put into big clout uh it's gotta be a million dollars yeah i mean the thing that pissed me off about big clout was i got into this like i had i didn't get into it because i had to i knew i was gonna get into this thing i'm about to say but i i was getting too i want to get into a pissing match real fast about building clout and because there was money on the line and yeah i just like oh i don't actually want to get in this race um i don't want to play that game and that so that i i kind of had a little like i one part of me is i actually fundamentally agree with most everything you're saying on the other part i'm like oh if this exists i'm going to be getting in a lot of like pissing matches or whatever and i'm going to be playing more games and that kind of freaks me out a little bit yeah and this is one of the issues with big clout right now right you have a bunch of like founder rewards games and things like that and this is this is what happens this is why we can't have nice things partly right like anytime something new comes along there will be people that are trying to game the system whatever so even back in the early days of google's like the internet wasn't a scam and google wasn't a scam but there were a bunch of people trying to scan google to kind of show up in the results and doing kind of spammy seo kind of stuff you see the same thing on big cloud right you have to sort of kind of separate that from the platform it's like okay fundamentally the idea does not feel like a scam to me yes they needed to open it up and have it listed on exchange so you can actually take money out you know minor details but um it but they're fixing those i talked to the uh to the founder like in like one of the few calls i've had in the last 12 months because i don't do phone calls um but it feels legit to me and that's not to say it's going to succeed but it's i'm relatively confident it's not a scam that like this reason for being is not a scam so one of the things that happens with like a google or facebook is you know like you said there's a big honey pot either of users or money on the line and so then you get good people excited about it you got technologies out of it but you also get these sort of scammers and not even scammers but i'll call them schemers people who are not doing anything illegal but they're thinking oh this is a game how do i play it so that i get the highest score and the score is either money or followers or whatever they're trying to game yeah and uh whether this is like you know buzzfeed and upworthy saying oh newsfeed how do i game news feed to get all this monthly traffic or you know um zynga doing this with games on facebook or whatever with a company you sort of have the like you know for as much as people hate that facebook and google can sort of censor and pull the rug out from under you they are able to like swat down these schemers and scammers so that um you know they don't ruin the experience for everybody and one thing that's interesting with decentralized platforms is that there's nobody in there's no ceo there's nobody in charge to to do that and so i think it's gonna be very interesting how that plays out do you have a sense of if that's going to be a problem or do you think that there's a solution to that with the the governance i'm a believer in kind of self-governance over time like and it all depends on the time horizon will it fix itself in a year or two years maybe not i think there's still going to be this kind of dark parts of big cloud that people don't want to tread into but over time i think um once bitcoin kind of figures out what it wants to be when it grows up um like what's the actual right now you know the way i think of it is like the kind of twitter use case is just a way to kind of prove out the protocol it just so happens they picked that one they could have picked any number of other ones um but as people kind of build real things using that underlying kind of technology because it's um an open protocol i think things will settle down people will find a way that they can implement use cases that concretely solve a particular problem and stay away from some of the kind of dark issues right now which is yeah um what's the name that you bought for for sean you said you bought a seven-figure domain name for this idea i have one in i'm in the midst of negotiating the price on it i'm not gonna reveal it uh i don't wanna be outbid how many how many letters is it seven hmm okay i'll be very curious to hear this going to be you you had said two spaces so the one one is the crypto crypto social network yeah what was the other space you're excited about the other one um is some broadly defined uh natural language processing uh in terms of okay so let me i'll do a try to keep this a quick rant so every software company that ever was has always said our product is intuitive and easy to use like okay well and the reality is every one of them lies because here's what happens in order for a human to use software it's like here's the thing i want to do and i have some amount of training and things whatever and i'm going to translate the thing my intent i'm going to translate into a series of drags and clicks and swipes and touches to make the software do the thing that i intended to do right now imagine uh if you know if i were eli i'd be like okay well you should be able to think the thought but let's put that aside for now let's just say you were like you're in photoshop it's like i want to remove the background you should just be able to say well i will remove the background if you're in hubspot you should i want you to it's like you know how many new people signed up for our service hub product in the last 90 days you should just be able to type that question in because that's your intent not like oh go to hubspot reporting tool build this dashboard pull in here the three columns you want or whatever and get to the thing you want you should just be able to say the thing you want express the thing you want a better way to state it and the software should figure it out like we have the technology now on the language side to be able to understand natural language in english and other languages and all we really need is a translation layer and so this is a broad based in my mind um a mega trend to be which is in my mind bigger than mobile so mobile was a oh we're good the thing that mobile added for us which is like oh well the thing that you used to do on your desktop now you can do it from anywhere and enabled a bunch of different use cases this thing is like okay well the thing that now you've been trying to learn you're trying to use the software whatever that you never really got good at you never had the time now like a billion people can use that piece of software that wasn't even possible before because they don't have to learn the clicks and drags and things they can express something they want and the software can do it and then what i would do if i were an enterprising vc is like okay look so pick the categories where this thing will have the biggest impact uh like you know business intelligence reporting kind of stuff b2b software is a natural fit uh but i think can go elsewhere yeah and uh we've seen the beginnings of this on the consumer side with things like alexa but like the b2b world i think is open for just make the software actually intuitive they could do what i want have you seen anyone besides i was gonna say besides alexa have you seen any hints of what i call a magic trick it's when you see somebody build a piece of software and then they're like yeah so you just do xyz and boom it's done and you're like holy [ __ ] you got that you know you just wove your magic wand and got that and it's like when you see a magic trick you it's very hard to unsee and you kind of can't look at the old software the same way anymore it's like instagram filters or something like that it's like oh wait your photo looks like that oh [ __ ] okay well now all my photos in my camera look like [ __ ] in comparison like i can't even look at these anymore um so have you seen any cool magic tricks with conversational uh or natural language classes closely i've gotten so i built something myself called growthbot uh a few years ago uh i remember that i remember growing up type and it was for it was built for marketers to be able to get marketing data out both of your kind of marketing systems something like a hubspot or a mailchimp but also just other data sources like oh what are the top three keywords that uber buys on ppc like that data's out there right like we already know to kind of ask that and so uh or like when was this domain registered or like just a bunch of and i would go through every night and look at all the questions people asked of these things there was a blank canvas they had no idea what the thing was capable of and then i would go back and it's like okay well here are the repeating patterns wouldn't it be nice if i could go update the software to kind of do that thing so that's it came close it was i think a little early i think we're further along now people are more used to that notion right um of being able to express equipment that's so funny that you do these i'm looking at the girl i i remember growth bot uh like people were sharing it and i just you just made this did you so you just whipped up this landing page and you made this i made the whole thing yeah like i spent a bunch of like time just learning about what's possible coded the whole thing myself um god that's so funny can you um gosh this is so funny uh you see that sean yeah yeah i'm on it it's great right like it's just cool that you do this stuff and you have uh within like everything you do is kind of related to hubspot right it's all in the same world you also like you're you're it seems like you're really into website graders is that right that business or what so i was talking to a heaton shod the other day he shot um um he did everything he's starting up near yeah nera he's got uh which crazy egg crazy egg uh quick sprout all types of [ __ ] i mean he's like you you just [ __ ] has his hands and everything but he uh and his partner neil have neil patel.com uber suggests and then they also had neilpatel.com like rate your website or something like that why are you so into these website rating businesses and products what what the hell is going on with that well i'm into so the original thing was called website grader it's actually a funny story so back when we first started hubspot uh it was just brian my co-founder and i and we would go look at people's websites and to see if they would be a good fit for hubspot to software or not right and so we would go and i would look at their age like i'd do a view source in chrome and then look at their source codes like okay do these they do they have the right meta tags or do they seem clueful right there's a bunch of signals you can look and look alexa ranking stuff that you do you folks do all day long right now when you research companies like like a similar web type of thing yeah yeah and this is you know 15 years ago and so we so it's like okay well when we were all doing it we were doing it manually there were no tools it's like okay so i built something that's what i do it's like oh i'm going to write this tool that does the automatically those looks and brings the apis we'll bring down the source code for the html and see if they're the tags are right and kind of give it a for us give it a score and then i had this and had not planned it this way was you know built as a tool for just the two of us um and it's like oh i'm going to put this on the web because i think this is useful and so like okay well what name can i give it well at grades website i'm going to call it websitegrader.com the domain was available 15 years ago um and so i put that out there and it like it was on fire like that like all the early leads like tens of thousands of people right would and and then we like so they had a desire to kind of grade their website and so for your list for the listening audience one thing i will say is um the power of building a diagnostic tool for your industry is immense right this is the thing that so website greater was not the solution so it's not like a freemium thing it's like oh we're giving you a lightweight version of hubspot it was a thing that made you realize you needed hubspot and that was super valuable and that can be done in any industry whether you're in software or not it's like okay i'm going to help you determine whether you have a problem or not because the natural thing when you do a website where it's like oh i got a 23 out of 100. that sucks right i can help like here's what we do um or even just like read these blog posts and you can watch these videos uh it's so it's it's work so i'm obsessed with kind of grading an assessment um and you folks you guys had a an episode like 10 20 episodes ago um around like quizzes and things like that so one thing people are so if you do build a diagnostic tool the one thing and this is i've learned several lessons but one of the key ones is that relative scores work so website grader from its early days like okay so if i give you an 87 with that 87 actually means is that whatever calculations we're doing behind the scenes this particular score you rated better than 87 oh 87 of the 800 000 or whatever the number was websites we've graded people love that it's like oh that's just that kind of relative score versus an absolute one makes a big difference a percentile score matters a lot to people it's like oh right like i [ __ ] i'm in the bottom ten percent or the top ten percent of them are awesome anyway are you uh sean do you see his list of ideas let's just start banging them out i to i like it so this is two things so first i think the thing you just described is like a growth hack without saying uh yeah i did it to grow thank you like solved your own itch but like that's just we've talked about it for quizzes quizzes the same thing lead gen this is an amazing lead gen tool where you basically got a bunch of qualified leads uh people who self you know they self assess i have might have a problem they go get it checked up your digital doctor said yep you indeed do have a problem and then all you had to do is prescribe a solution called hubspot you know here's a little i've got a little bottle for you yeah tell you how clueless i was back then so i put this thing up there um and at the time uh we we had a meeting set up with gail goodman who was the ceo of constant contact at that time and she later joined up spot board but we met with her we're like oh we're working on this company called hubspot it's kind of related to constant contact space um we want to get her advice and i showed her website graders like oh here's what we do and we can kind of look at websites whatever and and she loved it and then she's you know you might consider putting like an email address box because we had no way of knowing who these people were they were not they were not linked for us we had like a hundred thousand people like use the tools unintentionally i never thought to collect an email address like oh wouldn't it be nice to anyway let me obviously fix that uh but so i like that and then also for this uh conversational thing i think what you just said like we kind of it's kind of like sometimes guests on this podcast say something in passing that i'm like whoa whoa whoa that's actually a really big idea uh and i think you actually said two i think that the crypto linkedin one is a big idea and i think the second one is this idea that if you think about one of the biggest and what some people say is the best business they've ever seen is google right people come in there it's just a search box it's magic genie if you go ask a question and it tries to give you some answers and um the way i view this is if somebody could actually do this this is sort of like next level google where uh i ask it any question and it and it doesn't just give me like a list of pages where the answer might be it's like it actually gives me the answer and so um this might be you know in the business context might be like a business google but there's many versions of this uh i don't know if you've seen this have you ever seen uh d build we've checked out this website yeah we talked about d building my friend sharif uh there's a perfect example of a magic trick thing he um was messing around with gpt3 so gp3 new technology comes out he gets access right away he drops his whole startup starts just hacking on this thing at night right and uh he throws up this he has this idea of like dude uh you know squarespace wix this website builder's been around forever um great everybody wants to be able to code without having to code but like even now it's still so complicated even after webflow after all this stuff and um so he's like why can't you just describe like you know i want a website that's got like kind of like two columns and on the left i want pictures of like places you can stay and on the right i want the price of the other thing and you could literally just type that in and it'll build you a website that looks like airbnb like it'll build a website that does that he posted on twitter a gift he's like you know i'm messing around with gpt3 and watch this like um you know build a website with a photo and then add a paypal button but then make it where the paypal button can only take five dollars uh max and like that's it and then send send the payments to this and then it like spit out a website that was that did that like the html and the css that did that and he posted that gif and i think off basically one tweet with one gif he raised like two million dollars instantly from like really smart people when that tweet went viral because they were like oh you just showed me a magic trick and uh i don't know what the company is here and i think he still doesn't know what the company is but um go go down this path and uh see what you can find it was pretty amazing i remember when that tweet went live i mean i i i i it went viral right away yeah right i played with gpt3 uh played with it for a while across multiple things it's it's like the closest thing to like magic that in turn it's weird because it's it's kind of a different vector right because it originally is like a text generation mechanism to be able to write you know pros based on because it's got this corpus of of data behind the scenes um and it's and i talked to sal malton the ceo brian i had a he's gracious enough to give us some time to it's like okay well like where is this headed what's going on to see the impacts on hubspot um in the world in general and it's like that's one of those things that i right now i don't think quite there to be able to like implement like practical use cases to actually do the thing that uh people are trying to do and i've played with it on kind of multiple fronts but it's one of those that it's going to go from a peter like from a zero to a one very very quickly it's like all of a sudden that wasn't really possible and didn't really quite work well enough and then it's gonna be like holy crap then there's like the uh kind of post gpt3 world what's that phrase where it's like you know slowly slowly then all of a sudden or something like that yeah it looks like it's gonna be that uh sam you said you liked some of the ideas on this list or some of the topics let's just we just talked about something huge that was a huge idea let's talk about something small but still cool so it looks like did you buy remoteculture.com i did okay so that's a no-brainer there's a business that will make a million dollars a year remote culture online community for those building remote cultures easy right that's a no-brainer what would you do there i would start a community uh for remoteculture.com this is okay i'm gonna do a blog i'm gonna do a paid community and it's going to be targeted at people ops and hr people around the world that need to kind of figure out the new kind of new world order right we're not going to try and sell them software we're just going to connect them to each other and you and i'm a big big believer in these kind of communities and network-based businesses um because they're efficient in terms of take that much you gotta get to critical mass that's fine but um i think this one would work it's it's uh it's a community that's necessary at this moment in time that hasn't existed because it hasn't needed to now it does um and i'm sure there's people out there doing it but money helps you can actually build something yeah there's one on here that i really like uh speed round so uh so by the way this is these are what these are domains that like you don't have uh by the way when i have like a an idea that's enough in my head that's like okay well this is kind of cool i don't like write it down a notebook i go find a related domain um it's like it costs 15 if it hasn't been taken yet or right or maybe i'll spend more if it's you know um something really kind of strikes my fancy what's what's the most expensive ideas what's the most expensive domain you own well um i haven't had them valued i don't really sell domains i own birmingham alabama.com i live there i think that's probably the seven figure uh domain just bought humanism.com and humanism.org you also bought bought one for me bought one for you i bought the hustle.com for you as a gift that i'm gonna give to you on the podcast so you don't care about domain names all that much no hold on a deal trophy right uh whenever you get acquired they have this little tro i don't know sam did you know about this deal trophies no i want a deal trophy so when we got acquired they gave us like it took like a few months but it was like hey uh sorry i meant to give this to you like you know when the deal closed but i guess it's like in the deal-making world i'm not i'm not like a mover and shaker of biz dev and like corp dev and things like that but i guess it is sort of a tradition of when the deals close it's sort of like the the champagne what you do is you you get sort of like a little ornament that has some meaning to the deal like in our case our code name uh was like project whatever it was like let's just call it uh um project sharp it wasn't we were i think we were project h or something and so then they got like this like kind of like cool looking knife uh you know because it's like project sharp whatever here's the here's the the deal trophy so i think your deal trophy is this domain here well and and for the record darmesh if you like gift that to the hustle company we would love it and i actually do like domain names my whole point about domain names was it's don't let it stop you 99 of people are not like you are not like me like we do [ __ ] like you're killing it and you just made this little rinky ding project called growth bot like that done we do [ __ ] 99 of people don't do [ __ ] and they have stupid excuses like well i don't have the domain name it's taken or i do have the domain name therefore i should do that my point is don't let it stop you but i still think it's sick and it's awesome and i love it it's like saying like just because you don't just because you don't have a sick gym doesn't mean you can't go out there and walk and lose weight i think uh you know like justin was on the podcast last time and he was like um there should be a dating app that matches you on like kind of your credit card spending history or something like that uh for me that's what it's like with this podcast where it's like if i just if you just tell me how many domains you own that you actually you bought but you you don't have like a live project on if that number is you know greater than 10 we're gonna be we're gonna be thick as thieves and like you know how many tabs do you have open right now if i just knew those two things i can kind of tell you if this podcast is a fit for you or not if you're somebody who owns zero domains then you probably aren't gonna you know really connect with this podcast in a major way i don't think one and i'd like i'm going to pull a biology here as uh i'm going to push that conversation on stack but one thing i want to make sure i get out there because it's on the list of things just you're talking about ideas um it's like how do you assess ideas how do you think about ideas i know sean you love frameworks and you do too sam um here's a simple one in terms of like assessing whether you're doing it for yourself or you're investing whatever it is and i'll tell you the common mistake um so the three things i look at are like profit potential like if this thing went exactly as planned as the founders envisioned what could it be like let's just assume all things like all the stars align everything works the way you expect it to and it goes what could it be what's the overall potential for the project uh what kind of like passion do you have around it it's like okay are you excited about it or not excited about it um and the third one is uh around the probability of that success that you that you want right and i i'm a quant based guy so i'll take each of those factors with 0 10 square and multiply them together and i'll get a score out of a thousand right and you can put the weighting differently it's like oh i care more about passion than you know uh the profit potential or something else but the common mistake people make is that they will look at the probability of success first and almost exclusively as the high order bit filter it's like oh i had this idea but the likelihood is like 0.01 that that's actually going to work and so i'm not even going to think about what the potential could have been or how passionate i may or may not be about it and then they just kind of discard the idea i think that is statistically unwise and an impractical move and here's why is that the way you should be looking at ideas is you kind of take the profit potential like here's the possible outcome multiply this it's the ev the expected value statistically of this thing it's like oh i have a one percent chance at a billion dollars the expected value is one percent of a billion dollars that's the value of that particular thing um and so you shouldn't discard something just because the probability is low because it may have a disproportionately high potential that makes it more interesting than it would otherwise um so that's the like be a little bit more structured about how you assess things that people throw things away too easily because in the second note hard one lessons good ideas are dangerous and they're dangerous because what you want to find are the great ideas uh right that's the thing you can kind of get behind you don't have to find them before you start the company we can talk about that um so bad ideas are easy to find that's just a bad idea good idea masquerade is great ideas and it's hard to tell them apart and they're the ones that end up kind of spinning a bunch of cycles for you and it's like okay well it ended up being good but just it's um yeah failure's not a problem like mediocrity is a thing everybody should be fearful of it's like just get it out there try and see what happens but uh anyway and but the big problem because it wastes the most valuable resource it wastes time right because it's not gonna die quickly nor is it gonna take off so it is a slow long burn uh at a mediocre level and so you're sort of locking in over a period of time a mediocre outcome and that's what mediocrity is the biggest difference i think the hardest about bootstrap companies especially uh tech companies that have a low kind of capital need is they can actually live forever and not go anywhere right because it doesn't take that much stuff it's like okay you've got an aws instance somewhere that's costing you it doesn't really cost that much um and you don't have investors pushing on you to say oh we need some sort of outcome and so you can run that company indefinitely and waste a bunch of your time when the next idea that you could have done was sitting right behind it right like i have i've talked to hundreds of entrepreneurs by this point i have never ever in my entire life met an entrepreneur that had just one idea so i go you will have more dude it's like okay and you know try the thing if you can sell the thing sell the thing if you're not that excited about it or or you just want to cash out take some chips off the table there's uh no harm and no shame um but yeah did you do but you guys didn't raise a significant amount at hubspot did you uh 105 million money before in public yeah i'm supposed to say classic venture-backed playbook company it's like there's nothing and intentionally so that seems interesting to me because you don't see you seem like a guy who likes freedom and um knows that he's knows what he is and knows that he's a little bootstrapper that's what he's trying to do i'll i'll tell you the exact conversation we had so when brian i started this one things we were firmly agreed on is that we didn't want i'm not a baseball or a sports person but like we didn't want a single or a double hit right like we wanted to like swing for the fences and either this we we do this and we're good at every point that we have a decision to make a fork in the road we are going to take the one that gives us a higher chance of being the spectacular outcome even if that means we're possibly going to go down and crashing burning flames right and so was was was brian uh was he successful like you were or was he he hadn't had like an exit because he was uh he hadn't done a startup before this was his first one um but he also was like okay this is my last swing at bat right this is the i'm not this is it this is the one that's either gonna do it or not gonna do it um and so that that was the reason it's like we weren't worried about diluting we negotiate the fairest value we could we made sure the terms were meaningful had good investors but we were not worried about what our percentage taken the company was and how that moved over time we're like okay if this thing does what it needs to do uh the valuation and all that and the equity dilution will not matter like on the margin it just it it's we want it to be a binary outcome either it's going to be this huge massive thing which um will change our lives uh and have a massive impact or it goes down and crashing burning flames which is highly likely but um we weren't looking to hold on to control we weren't looking at this like we wanted to be we didn't want to be king we want to be rich i guess when you're doing like ideation and stuff though you you either i think you wrote you wrote it here you're down with starting some a project with a bad idea because you're quite confident that you'll you can figure out you can make it great as you get into it right my general advice is and this is not just you know my personal kind of uh lived experience as the new folks would say having talked to entrepreneurs and kind of looking at the history of them so many of them the thing that we know them for now is not the the idea they originally started with like there are a handful of cases where yeah when exactly the plan this is what it was and and often the case is that you will not find the great idea until after you start your company until after you start having contact with customers and actually trying to do the thing if you sit on the sidelines trying to assess ideas and look at market metrics and things like that and it's like you're just never going to get started that's the kind of wannabe entrepreneurs that will kind of analyze it to death it's like you wouldn't even know what a good idea was it's hard to tell these things until you actually try something it's uh just yeah it and try it um where do we go from here sean we got uh i think we think we got a rap but here there's this i think we have to have you on again if you're down because here's five topics i want to hear about uh why i don't play golf and what i do instead uh i want that one why i hate inefficiency in markets uh why i don't believe in karma but i believe in extended feedback loops uh sometimes faking it is making it uh introverted engineers guide for public speaking like i need i need all of these so we may have to do another one um i have one question i want to wrap with in this one uh which is you seem like a a pretty astute guy like you're very very good observations and i think you you you know kind of who we are and what we care about and that we would value honestly so i'm curious you can ask me the intro question aren't you you can ask me the intro question no no not the intro question that that sam sam's trying to get all the interest he can ask you that one i want to know i'm i'm trying to make the content great so what would be the most uh fair criticism you could give us on the podcast what's your critique of the podcast um for you as a listener and there's like you can offend you can exactly that's kind of what i'm taking you up for say whatever it is whatever you truly feel all right um so partly i think you have to recognize that you guys are multi-channel so you're kind of solving for the audio format i know you have the youtube videos and things like that but the one tactical thing that you should fix like next week or the week after is you should apply the sean 25 headlines thing for headlines for every podcast episode like what's the one nugget that's going to cause people to want to listen to that episode even if they're not subscribed when they see it in their youtube feed and youtube recommends it's like oh right why this successful entrepreneur never played golf and you shouldn't either whatever it is right exactly i'm on uh i'm i'm taking notes keep going if you do that my my guess is that the click-through rate goes up because you can't not um right now you just kind of identify the episode number and who the guest is or whatever there's no real maybe the topic area but right now me and sam don't even want people to click me and sam don't even touch the headlines when dan does it i don't even know i see a notification it goes out and i think i judge the headline myself i'm like ah that's not gonna give very many clicks or oh that's a juicy one that'll work i i say give dan a free pass to the um the sean copyright report of course yesterday that's awesome okay what else you got anything else of course you have more who me yeah yeah what about more that was a weak criticism yeah that was an easy one okay um this is a hard one right um is around he's gonna say like just change your voice like your face is great but i suppose it's yours so it's around the it's around the brand and this is the hardest thing for an entrepreneur to kind of reconcile with so a couple of issues that i have as a amateur branding person is that anything that can be reduced an acronym will be which my first million is often reduced to that uh and then you kind of lose the punch because when it comes down to an acronym anyone that comes like immediately they're not going to know what it is if they don't know what it is and there's some value to that but it doesn't compensate for the kind of opportunity you have so that's one thing is acronyms not good uh but the other one is that the kind of my first million there is a cadre caterer however that word is pronounced of people that will directly res that topic will resonate with like oh i want to learn about that but i think your reach is much wider now and there are people there are probably more people outside that fear that that particular like okay well it's fine that it's about that but really the reason i'm here is to hear folks like biology right like that and that episode which is i think one of the best epos episodes you've had had nothing to do with the first million anything it had to do with big ideas we i actually agree with you and we've had this conversation the problem that we had was like [ __ ] we're pretty deep into it we can't change yep yep i i for what it's worth i think we should change just because i hate the name so i don't really care about the brand equity i'm just sort of like i don't want to have a thing i don't yeah i don't i don't love it i really don't it's i don't i don't love the name i don't like the name of the hustle either if you believe that this thing is going to get 10 times bigger in the future which i do then 90 of our future listeners haven't even heard about us yet and so uh we're we're only offending a very small we're only changing on a very small population of people for the good of the long run that would be my my and by the way if you think it's hard now you realize the direction you're headed it does not get easier right it's going to get harder and harder like a year from now two years from now five years from now it's like ah like should we have changed this like what would have been it's like not that it's gonna have a dramatic impact on the numbers or anything but on the margin these things matter and they kind of uh accrue to accumulate time and here's what i would do to make life easier for yourselves um don't decide to change the name decide to come up with alternatives and then objectively measure those alternatives like okay am i willing to give up the brand equity and go through the the pain of changing a name because this one is just so much better if something clicks for you great but make an honest concerted effort to come up with those alternatives and options and then you can still decide like yeah these are better but they're just marginally better they're not better enough to go through the headache of trying to change it right that would be my advice okay that's great uh sam you want anything else before we go we're going to follow up with some intros my man we got dan dan do we have an update are we reaching out to guests can we we got to use darmesh she knows everyone well i'm curious actually you do know everybody who's awesome who's like particularly awesome that you're just like either kind of underrated or you're just like so you know what i don't know as many people as you think like i'm kind of on the internet did i do things but i you know i don't like i don't leave my house right it's like it's like you have to in order to kind of be that person you have to sort of like interact with carbon based life forms in real life right like i don't do that that's not a thing i do so it's hard to kind of build those kinds of relationships but i would on your list i would have um so i'm not going to be good at intros but i like naval would be awesome to have on the podcast uh he's like a like that kind of biology level uh thinker i think he'd be awesome the audience would love him so that would be great great we'll take that intro thank you yeah he doesn't know me i mean he knows me like loosely i'm gonna start calling you uh we'll call you uncle darmesh you gotta pick it up i'm willing to try it don't don't get me wrong those qualms about trying to make the intro just don't uh demand your expectations it's like well i thought like darmesh actually could like swing things and make [ __ ] happen anyone else someone i do know that i think would be good on the podcast drew from dropbox i know really well so that's an intro i could make um what's up yeah that would be a good one i heard he's an amazing singer is that true he's he's uh he's a good singer for a founder amazing founder is what i mean legit

if you told me that it makes him personally 30 million dollars spread evenly over the next 10 years i wouldn't be surprised i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back all right what up uh sean here we got sam and then we got special guest dan held the dan held from the bitcoin space and on twitter you've probably seen him around i told my brother-in-law um that you were on the podium he was very excited i've told him about every guest so far and you got one of the biggest reactions he was a i think he's a paid subscriber to your newsletter or something like that so he's he's very into you and on the other hand i think sam has no [ __ ] clue who you are so i think it's the perfect mix i know some stuff about you sam knows nothing about you and i think it'll be fun i only know that sean says that you're cool and you're in bitcoin i know nothing about you um we got an hour to figure it out whenever one of us proposes a guest it's like you put that guest it's like you have to go take the stand and have an oath that this person's gonna be good and then you better be able to lawyer up and defend why this person's a guest and so he'll every time any time he mentions the name to me i'm like why the [ __ ] are we having that person on and then he'll like defend it and then same here i was like no no this is gonna be gonna be interesting because couple i think a couple reasons we should talk about crypto and then we should talk about i think like kind of like building your personal brand because you've done a really good job of that and so we'll we'll do both of those during this during this convo but i want to start with like give people the like what's the one minute story of who the heck you are and yeah yeah and i don't know like give us the one-minute story of dan held yeah the elevator pitch yeah so i from texas originally i grew up in dallas 25 years in dallas i studied finance and undergrad stumbled and bumbled my way into tech i didn't know what i was doing when i first built my my first software product in the space it was successful from there learned how to formalize some of my skills around product management and marketing um worked at a couple different early stage crypto companies so i was at some of the first crypto companies i worked at like blockchain.com i've had two exits in the crypto space so i've sold two of my products and then i've also worked at uber where i was on writer growth led by andrew chen so one of his directs and the growth marketing team so i've had big company classic uh tech experience but also a lot of kind of that startup hustle and early stage crypto which early stage crypto is kind of wild west um yeah which i guess fits my my texas attitude so and so tell people the source you got into crypto bitcoin uh bitcoin specifically you're a bitcoin guy i should i shouldn't keep saying crypto too much um bitcoin back in i think 2012 or so bitcoin was maybe 10 bucks back then um what you know what caught your interest how did you hear about it what's the origin story for you yeah so i got back in 2012 uh my buddy paid me back for a beer with something called a cassatious coin a cassatious coin are those gold coins that you see in all those news articles where they talk about bitcoin they were physical bitcoins essentially and that was a good time and in that 2012 era bitcoin is so new and weird and different that that was like a good bridge from the physical fiat paper money world to the to the digital bitcoin world uh from there my background is in finance i really dug the 21 million hard cap as a solution to bad central banking policies i i mean i was in undergrad during the 2008 financial crisis studying finance and i'm like my professors don't know [ __ ] right either to the people on tv and neither do these books that i'm reading and that's what kind of kind of shook my foundational uh trust and belief in the existing financial system and that's when bitcoin came around when i saw that i was like this is a good new way to be rebuild the financial system without having to trust these institutions and sam i don't know if you know this sam do you know when uh satoshi signed the first block he put a he put a message in there do you know do you have you ever heard what this is no but i i love that guy's stories i mean the the myth or if it's real i don't know what the truth is but i love the story behind it and dan i don't know if you know it off top of your head but but do you know what it is yeah so satoshi was a really crazy character in terms of his expertise i mean he understood like human game he understood game theory encryption all sorts of different other topics and wove this all together to build bitcoin bitcoin isn't just software it it wraps itself around understanding human lovers to press like greed of how the price cycles as the price goes up people become more aware of it and by an expectation of the price going higher um so satoshi you know really understood humans intimately and part of this that he wove into the first block was the genesis block message and it said uk chancellor on the verge of second bailout for banks so that was the only message that satoshi ever put into the bitcoin blockchain and so it's a very clear signal that bitcoin wasn't here to disrupt a visa or paypal bitcoin is here to disrupt the existing financial system in central banking right and so there's like a the mission the mission was sort of like i don't know cleverly baked in which i just i just love i'm like you sam where i'm like the more i learn about the origins the more this [ __ ] seems like it's out of a movie uh it doesn't seem like real life it's like oh this anonymous creator is like how's anything anonymous nowadays right like there's there's like way you know like the way they caught the silk road guy was like his the way he was typing or whatever matched some review he left on a movie message board or so you know there's always something like that there's always a breadcrumb trail actually is it still anonymous i mean obviously no one's come out could it been the the the guy who had als and died i mean what what's what do you what do smart people who know what's dancing what's dan's theory uh the uh everyone's got their own favorite satoshi tale all right so one is hell fenny the one that you just described he had als and died i think in 2012 or 2013. uh hal finney is a classic favorite because he ghost wrote pgp encryption and bitcoin's proof of work system is based on his early reusable proof-of-work system that he created earlier bitcoin wasn't a new innovation it just kind of frankenstein all these other innovations together and that's how satoshi built bitcoin hal finney has the demeanor of bitcoin he was also the first recipient of a bitcoin transaction or he was sending it to himself right which is what by the way if you ever work with developers that's what they do when they're testing [ __ ] out the first thing they do is they send it to my account a to my account to sean sean but the ghost writing pgp encryption back in that era with phil zimmerman pgp encryption was considered a weapon by the defense uh by by the department of defense so when he goes through pgp he knew that he was potentially going to be convicted for like illegal uh arms trafficking wow so he understood what it meant to take on a government at this scale and so he and when he when i say ghost wrote he goes toward it because his name isn't officially on it so same with bitcoin he was one of the few people to that would have built bitcoin in that fashion uh you know hiding behind a pseudonym of satoshi and using that because that was critical that the project had no face to it had no central weak point because if you could find satoshi and he's sort of a weak point in the governance structure and in the ownership structure that could undermine the the the long-term success of the protocol so yeah hal is a classic favorite died around the same time that satoshi stopped doing anything we haven't seen a mess a flare from satoshi's sense right that's right satoshi hasn't signed a message with his private key which would concretely determine that that is satoshi or give us a strong determination that that is satoshi so so that timeline makes sense that's theory one what's the two 32 is the nsa so 32 is that it's the nsa because the nsa builds weapons and bitcoin is a financial weapon it could destabilize countries and destabilize their currencies and so this is just a more fun i mean totally off the wall sort of thinking but so let's say a group of cryptographers which some of the best in the world work at the nsa come up with bitcoin because they're tasked with building a weapon and after they build it they go wait a second maybe we should just release this into the wild because we do believe that this is good for humankind right and they release it as kind of like it's like a frankenstein experiment let out of the lab uh so i think that one's kind of fun i mean there's no there's no facts behind that where would you put your lab leak hypothesis for for the pandemic basically that's that's what you're saying i think one's more realistic than the other maybe what uh would you bet your money on one of those dan probably more of the health anyone i feel that it's an individual so that's always a question too is it an individual or a group of people i cube more individual designed by committee is really hard to do with something as niche and like incredible like an incredible breakthrough like bitcoin right so i think that one person just had that genius to take all these elements and put them together to create bitcoin versus a group of developers trying to figure out how to build this thing and and there's also the other thing which is like it's just somebody else so if you were gonna apply your percentages what percent is half any nsa or other uh this is super tough but maybe like 50 hellfini uh 30 nixabo and 20 nsa [Laughter] all right i like that um okay so you discover bitcoin because some guy gives you a coin uh and you don't you're not just like dude what is this like can i have my 10 bucks please and and so you go you read about it uh what happens that night so you go and you what you read the white paper you join the forums you just start reading about it online and then like i guess like take us through the thought process of you going from where you were then to like where you are now where bitcoin is like you know a pretty major part of your life yeah and i can kind of weave in my early entrepreneurship like in tech part of that too because it's all kind of intertwined together so i start to read about it the 21 million hardcap the monetary policy i see this as a huge breakthrough because if you remove the subjectivity of choosing what an appropriate rate of inflation is you've solved the problem of monetary theory so like satoshi solved the problem of like going hey we shouldn't constantly figure out what the rate of inflation should be we should fix it and the economy can reorient around that genius breakthrough so that got me really hooked um i worked at a small investment firm in dallas nothing anyone would know it's a really tiny one wasn't prestigious or anything like that they relocated me to san francisco to open up their west coast portfolio out in san francisco i during the uh it was the april bitcoin run up from 10 to 260 back down to 100. i was going to the bitcoin meetups in san francisco this is where like brian and fred from coinbase were hanging out and same with jared kenneth from trade hill and jesse powell from kraken mike the company now i mean there's only what were those like because we were just in miami uh when the bitcoin conference was happening and it was kind of like a like a bunch of fools act in the fool i thought i didn't attend but just through what you what was coming out on social media i guess and everything every community changes from like when it's the outsiders and um you know just the true believers to like you know 10 years later 11 years later what what it looks like is is very very different every community changes all of my friend my roommate was buying i was mining in 11 and 12. and they were just hardcore devs and nerds so what were those like so i remember i was still working at a small investment firm so i'm rolling up in [ __ ] business casual to a developer intuitive bitcoin there's only a dozen of us i mean it was tiny and actually i put pictures on twitter where you can see pictures from the old meetup i mean it's just a it's a cooler of pbrs and a bunch of people kind of geeking out on this thing called bitcoin right march april 2013 hit price goes to 260. boom you've got like vcs slanging out business cards everyone's excited there's 150 people that come to the meetup you know there's this energy this palpable energy and then the may 2013 conference happens the winklevi announced they've been they've been they've bought bitcoin they're involved the the conference had like a few hundred people which was kind of wild if you see coinbase's booth from videos from back then they printed out like an eight and a half by eleven that just had coinbase on it like they just printed it off their computer in the office or their printer in the office and taped it on their booth and brian and fred were the guys manning the booth so like that's how early it was super super early in the space and during that moment that's when i found a problem a problem that needed to be solved which was finding the real-time price of bitcoin on your mobile device at that time there was no app in the app store that gave you real-time market data which is crazy because bitcoin fluctuates a lot and people you know were constantly opening up their phone to check the price of bitcoin all the other developers before then just refresh the price every 15 minutes or so so me and a buddy put it together now i didn't know what i was doing i was a finance guy you know trying to figure out how to make a product and so i just became really obsessed with solving this problem and so i knew enough in photoshop to where i could design the app so i just looked at apps that i liked took elements from that to design zeroblock which was this product and designed it and we designed it really really simply because i couldn't design anything more complex back in that day skeuomorphism was the popular design aesthetic and we did flat ui because i couldn't design bevels and stuff so i just became obsessed with solving this problem for myself turns out a lot of other people had that problem too and that's where it kind of like stumbled my way into some product fundamentals of like it's all about solving a problem for your customer and then i got into a tinge of growth marketing where i found how to hack my way to the number two spot for the word bitcoin in the app store so we got most of our installs you know how did you do that what was the hack yeah so apple at the time when they really originally built the app store they forked it from itunes and so there's an old character limit that they had for titles of songs which is 255 characters but they also allowed that character limit for app titles it was truncated after 60 words basically but you can fill it in words in the top in the core title old school keyword stuffing yeah i learned old school growth hacking technique of just keyword stuffing but it worked now it was sort of a crapshoot to see if the app store reviewers would approve it but one out of five would and if you did you could clinch that spot right so that kind of started my fascination with both products and with growth marketing kind of on the more hacky side of things and yeah that was my that was my initial foray into tech and then we sold serial block at the end of the year to blockchain.com uh blockchain.com is still around today it's a really popular wallet i was the first product manager there and so kind of that's what i mean by stumbled and bumbled my way into tech is specific yeah i didn't have any formal background i just kind of was really empathetic with solving a problem for my customer wanted to propagate the the message of my product and that's how i learned those two skills all right let's talk about some ideas sean shall we yeah so dan i don't know if you know but this is the ideas podcast where we basically say okay that like i'm interested in the past but to the extent that i learned cool things and then i'm like all right let's get to the future what's the future look like so so idea so i think there's really like i guess like let's start in the bitcoin crypto space what problems do you see today that you think somebody needs to solve like back then there was no real-time price data that was a problem that needed solving sure what are you seeing today as a problem that needs solving yeah there's one idea that's particularly fascinating but it's not very sexy now there's a lot of really good intersections there where you find value and like this new idea because not a lot of people are looking at it it's around private wealth management for crypto holders imagine a current crypto billionaire walks into a family office multi-family office and they're like hey i'd like you to help manage my portfolio and they sit down five suits in front of this guy with a hoodie and they say hey well uh first of all we'd like to take you know a two percent management fee of all your holdings and they're like well i said i self-custody my coin right and they'd be like i don't even know what that means right you know and then they would go well how much how much of your net worth is in crypto and they would say 90 and the first thing they would say is diversify right the existing uh private wealth managers and multi-family offices have no idea of how to service crypto wealthy crypto folks i mean you can't even you can i i told mike at the bank today let's buy some ethereum and they were like oh we we can't it's ridiculous i mean it's absolutely ridiculous it's it's so antiquated they just don't talk don't even talk the same language as all these crypto folks right like i'm a more bitcoin guy but if you go down like the ethereum rabbit hole there's a whole i mean there's so much complexity and how those defy and smart contracts work it's where you need like a full tax team to solve that problem too but these i mean i've been in this space for almost nine years i know more billionaires on this planet than probably anyone else because of because of crypto because crypto has created so many and not institutions but individuals who have billions to where bitcoin is probably bitcoin plus ethereum has probably created more individual billionaires than any other project right exactly i think that's got to be true which is kind of insane like more than microsoft more than amazon more more than any of those projects how many crypto billionaires do you know how many billionaires do you know um i would say off the top my head at least at least ten ten how many crypto how about um a hundred million on up oh man i mean i would assume i at least know 100 or so folks that probably have that much doubt look bitcoin people don't tell you how much they have right but you can kind of assume based on how long they've been in this space and what companies they worked at and how much their net worth was back then and probably yeah i mean it's a general assumption but how much of your personal money were you putting into this before your bitcoin started like making sense like were you putting like a hundred grand into this in 2012 when it was like who the [ __ ] knows if this is gonna work because 100 grand to you at you're like i wish well you could do it i wish you were really young that would have been a lot of money yeah i didn't have that much money man i mean look i was like uh 25 26 just out of co and i was in i you know my first job was in dallas i was making 45k a year it wasn't like a ton of money yeah and then i got into tech eventually and of course that went up quite a bit but that was in 2013 2014. now um my average cost basis was 10 to 100 but there's a bunch of coins i got from in the hundreds to thousands right so i think a lot of people look at like crypto ogs like myself and they assume we had like a million dollars sitting around that we all dumped in at five dollars a bitcoin and also i wasn't a perfect toddler i day traded i traded litecoin i traded a bunch of other stuff just for fun i even mined primecoin so i'm not you know on my bitcoin journey i've touched a bunch of other coins as well um so no one's a perfect toddler psychologically are you able to buy the dip when the dip is like 30 000 and it's like well my cost basis is 192 and uh you know or like whatever it's five even even if it's three thousand even my cost basis is three thousand buying at thirty so buy the dip great so are you able to psychologically do that or are you just like hey my position is set i hope the rest of you suckers by the dip so that uh you know we keep this upward momentum yeah so technically i'm over 100 of my net worth in bitcoin because i took a small levered position back when bitcoin was seven thousand dollars at the bottom of the cycle uh because i believe that bitcoin you know in a bull run obviously appreciates so right i uh technically over 100 my net worth is in bitcoin uh also i do something where i lend out my bitcoin to earn a yield yeah that yield is like kind of a day-to-day stacking mechanism to add more sats to add more bitcoin and you're using what like uh kraken block file would you use them so crack it doesn't have you're at cracker now so i put them first but i don't think they offer this as a service i appreciate the shout out but no we don't offer that yet yeah so we've got like block five let in and uh genesis trading agendas is trading you have to have like a minimum of 20 bitcoin to be a customer so by the way i bought some secondary and kraken so i'm i'm with you on on the christmas train let's go all the way to the top how the hell when you're so kraken how many people at kraken do you think have more than 15 million dollars how do you employ people when they're all [ __ ] yeah that's what i want to know like how often they tell you like you know what dad go [ __ ] yourself i'm out next week it's like dan i'm bored you got a spot for me yeah you know it's a particular challenge for crypto i mean crypto it's the hardest industry to build a business in think about it this way too like you've got monsoon seas in the bull run and you want to capture all of that revenue potential but if you start to spend and deploy capital through hiring and building offices and whatnot by the time that the bull runs over like when do you turn off the spigot like when you turn off all that cash flow going out and then how much do you cut back and i think that's really really tricky like how do you predict these cycles no one knows if we did we'd all be trillionaires and so i think like that's the most difficult part of this is like how do you build a business with those fluctuations in demand and how do you match expenses to meet that but yeah i mean you know in terms of in terms of employee churn it's super tricky i actually put in my job descriptions for my growth marketing team no crypto experience required i first find it really refreshing when folks come in and challenge language that we use in our ads home page app store page etc on how we describe crypto because i'm i've been in too long it's hard for me to zoom all the way out and see what it looks like from a newbie right and so one i like that perspective and two to the motivational issue i think um you know folks who are new to crypto are much hungrier uh than ones who haven't been there um okay so let's do this private wealth manager so what would you actually build here would it be a services company would it be a software company what would be the how would you attack this problem yeah it's a services company and you can't take bips on aum that's like an old way to do it you'd have to figure out some sort of new model that's maybe more subscription or something like that the first and foremost problems you're tackling taxes taxes are incredibly complicated for crypto trades especially if you're going to defy things yeah one would be taxes two uh so taxes not only cover trades but also covers future tax minimization strategies for example there's a trust called a grat a grat is a great way to pass on your crypto to your son daughter et cetera a partner without any taxable events occurring so there's all sorts of very advanced structures that exist for very wealthy folks that most crypto people have no idea you know that there was it wasn't institutional wealth they didn't they didn't work at goldman they were in their basement mining bitcoin or mining ethereum you know like it's a whole different world right right and that's we're going to trust different things in fact i think yeah what you did where you built your brand and you're like oh build a big audience i think you have a few hundred thousand followers on twitter for bitcoin i think that's what you would do if you come out and you're like hey i'm the bitcoin tax guy and i'm gonna talk every day about how to like deal with the tax problem of bitcoin and wealth management for wealthy bitcoiners and i'm gonna my sales is all gonna happen through content and then whoever and then you'll probably get billionaires coming inbound saying hey will you manage my stuff um that's how you would do this i've known these billionaires personally for eight years so i actually dm'd a bunch of them and asked them if they used multi-family offices and no i did right i already know that it's a problem that they're not currently solving uh they went they went to some traditional financial folks and they talked to me about their experiences and i was like wow that sounds terrible right so for me i'm very happy at kraken i love the team i'm working with i love the team i've built um also they acquired my company so i'm very incentivized to stick around but i couldn't be more excited in terms of a rocket ship in this space kraken's a great spot to be at and i'm a growth guy so it's all about that like hyper growth and kraken's like a perfect perfect spot but this is more for fun on the side of thinking like what we're all we're all tinker tinker with stuff and think through stuff and this is kind of my recent fascination so sam do you know about the like the tether uh question mark have you heard this sam no okay so uh i'll i'll ask dan to kind of explain it so dan i'm gonna ask you to do two things one is explain what people are what some people are afraid of with tether and why that might be like you know people call it oh is this the black swan that's gonna crash all of crypto et cetera et cetera and then how you sleep at night being 100 of your net worth in bitcoin knowing that this potential question mark exists with tether so so explain the potential problem and then how you think about it sure so tether is called a stable coin a stable coin is a representation of a fiat currency so tether represents us dollars and it's called usdt so usdt is created by companies wiring money in to a cayman island entity and they wire it in there and then tethers are minted and created and those are put on blockchains uh tether has existed on the bitcoin blockchain ethereum blockchain and tron blockchain amongst others i think as well so what that tether represents is a one-to-one backing of a dollar now the company that issues these uh which is like tether united like tether limited plus uh bitfinex which is an exchange there were concerns over if they were truly backed one to one and there were moments when it wasn't but they've recently reached a settlement with a believe the new york district attorney i think is who they i forget exactly who they settled with this attorney general new york attorney general i think there's so many regulators i forget who who settled with who but um yeah they essentially settled and agreed to do audited to perform audits and come out with exactly how much they had in reserve so the controversy and the worry is that tethers are i so there's a couple worries one is that tethers um you know first and foremost aren't backed and that could lead to a kind of like a classic run on the bank situation where more people try to redeem tethers and that there's none of tet there's not enough dollars in the bank to be able to redeem to be able to be redeemed and that would cause structural problems at the crypto ecosystem number two i think is like the idea that usdt is being used in smart contracts and defy and it's completely centralized because usdt like usdc these stable coins that are centrally issued by companies like tether and circle they can be reversed or or frozen or paused and that truly decentralized and a lot of this a lot of the defy space i think a lot of the contracts for example like maker dao so so maker dow is like a uh like an algorithmic stable coin almost 50 percent of its collateral is centralized stable coins so it represents a systemic risk to defy and centralized finance aka the exchange base so the fear is basically if the tether people are not being on the up and up so you have to trust people which is like kind of the anti-crypto way um if they're ju they could just be printing tethers um or be holding not one to one dollar assets so they could be like a bank fractionally reserving saying oh for every dollar we have we have five tethers um and basically using that to buy and that's being used by bitcoin so it's like artificially it's not that bitcoin has any issue with it but that's what's driving up run-ups in price is there's a huge amount of bitcoin that's bought with tether and so that's the question the concern now how legitimate is the concern so if we dig into it i wrote about this uh and the held report my newsletter if you dig into this there it isn't as bad as people say um there's all sorts of moments when tether wasn't fully collateralized as in there wasn't enough tether to be redeemed to dollars and the industry was fine um also we're talking about exchanges don't hold tethers the users hold tethers so tether is just like any other crypto asset so there's been tons of times when multi-billion dollar crypto assets have gone to zero and the structural problems in the space have been okay we've also suffered much more egregious moments in the crypto space like malcox now gox represented 90 of trading volume this would be like binance coinbase and kraken all going down at the same time you know these are hugely stressful moments for the um for the marketplace and so bitcoin has been through a lot worse bitcoin inherently doesn't need tether tethers being used to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but for example like um different other government fiat currencies are used to buy bitcoin but that doesn't mean that bitcoin is dependent on the dollar it's not dependent on usdt and then i think you know another concern that i forgot to bring up earlier people hypothesize like tether is being used to pump bitcoin i think that's completely unfounded it was based on a university of texas research report which i don't even know if you could call it [ __ ] research but it was like a research report where they basically said that correlation is causation right which is absurd it's like saying that like you know uh umbrellas cause rain because they're correlated so it's really ridiculous that's where the core root of some of the concerns that like others being used to pump bitcoin come from completely unfounded there's no data that supports that and also there's moments when tethers are printed when bitcoin goes down but of course the people who buy into this whole theory ignore those moments right and uh okay so so that's a great answer so you um i want to switch to basically talking about uh other bitcoin or other other let's say crypto ideas that you see that uh the average person is either not knowing about you know it's an interesting idea that you're not that that's not as well known yet or you see the opportunity for somebody to go build do you see any other opportunities besides the private wealth management space the private wealth management one for me is one that's just really sticky that one's like super interesting other ones that would be good as well i just think simplicity is the ultimate way to go build product it means that folks find value in your product much more quickly you can convey the value prop people discover the value prop they could activate it at a higher rate so i think like simplistic a very very simple very very simple mobile experience for wallets i think is still like very underappreciated i think the wallet spaces still has horrid user experience like for example let's say when you send a bitcoin transaction bitcoin transactions have two states unconfirmed and confirmed and to a lame a layperson like what does that even mean yeah you know and all wallets default to this language and i would disagree that they should even default to that language i mean you should add a layer in the layer above that and the gui of something much more understandable wallets are kind of fundamental the core ethos of the system and there's a lot of things you can do now where you layer in trading capabilities built in there etc so i think that what the space still doesn't have great great to use wallets i think like exodus wallet is really good but other than them i haven't seen like an experience around the core experience of holding your crypto that was just mind-blowingly amazing do you have a security team like a physical security team do we like guards and [ __ ] no you um well i'm in texas so obviously i own a few guns um so it's a come and take it sort of attitude at conferences i do have security who do you hire um it's it's uh you know provided to me by uh through the company how much do they spend each year on on these security security guards you know i'm not sure but uh but kraken is constantly focused about security they're kind of nuts when it comes to security at crack and it's in terms of like how you control like where your laptop is and everything else they're in exchange right kraken's been around for 10 years and has never been hacked so for us like they're constantly paranoid about that and the human attack vector is the weak point in any text system so they're very conscious about like different executives and high-profile individuals like where they are um you know if they're at events with a lot of people they got to think about physical security so it's something that they think they think about all the time i have no idea how much that cost though i would be curious to hear about that because whenever i see i mean i i don't have i i'm in a different friend group as you maybe i've got a few friends that have tens of millions of bitcoin but um i am always curious as to how like the the actual security because i would think that when it comes to hacking i would think it would be just like stealing like kidnapping someone stealing stealing the person as opposed to trying to break into the thing totally yeah and that's actually classically called the wrench attack in the bitcoin world is that someone could come to you and just crack you over the head with the wrench right now at the same time you know sam you've done very well and st michonne like you guys have both done very well and we see you guys know billionaires that walk around the streets of san francisco and they're not getting mugged and and kidnapped for ransom so in in with bitcoin yeah bitcoin is easily transferable but let's say that let's say this person is not into bitcoin at all they can easily take their liquid assets buy bitcoin and then transfer it to the kidnapper so whether or not you hold bitcoin if that makes you more or less susceptible to getting attacked i don't think it does well that doesn't necessarily seem fair like but that said i'm not uh i'm not entirely educated on it so i'm not sticking by this quite hardly or i'm not sticking to this entirely but like when i when i have money in a variety of different places there's a pretty large amount of checks and balances that go into transferring it so i just try to transfer money to a another bank today and there was like a hard cut off whereas with a lot of crypto stuff you can literally have it in a uh in like a store like some type of store like physical i could fat finger the number i'm putting in and i could transfer you know instead of five i could transfer five thousand you know yeah and i also and there's no getting it back and like credit cards do a pretty good job of doing fraud protection um um usually is it what's it called what's the the 250 000 of checking accounts are uh our insurer fda yeah it's also a big problem of like death right so uh so i think there's a startup opportunity here too which is what happens to your bitcoin when you die and um and and how do you how do you manage that so on one hand you can leave instructions to your spouse or whatever which is like hey to get all to get access to all of our private keys here's what you do but now you have instructions to get all your private keys that's you know somewhere uh you have to protect that and so you have to have multiple layers you're starting to go down the rabbit hole you're starting to yeah yeah you get you kind of get in the circular logic loop of like well i can't trust anyone else with my money so i need to manage my private key and it's like well if i want to pass it on i have to trust with them yeah exactly and then actually and then you also have the like i do the problem of like actually like property uh you know property transfer when you die is like it goes through either probate or you have a will and i just think that there's probably a lot there that if you if you look at this group of crypto wealthy as just a new customer that exists and they're gonna it's i have this framework this two by two which is like you know um is it an old problem or a new problem and then is there an old solution or new solution right and so this is a case where it's it's a bunch of old problems but we need a new solution because it's a new type of customer it goes back to the private wealth management exactly there's actually a way to solve this too it's called multi-signature which means that your bitcoin isn't controlled by one key that opens up the vault there's three keys and you need two out of three keys to open up the vault and there's all sorts of like there's three out of five key structures so those would be how you do this through time as you give like your your your cpa one your wife wife or husband one day yeah and then you give the other two to whomever else or you keep three on your own so there's a lot of elegant ways to do that multisig i think is the only way that's like but the thing is now you have to educate your there's no cpa in the world that knows private key management well right that's where this entity would for example be one of the key holders they would know very good private key management practices and only sign as for under certain conditions which would also help against the kidnapping vector and where they would have like a velocity limit you've dm me before about stuff that's in the creator kind of like audience space um i don't know where you want to go with that i'll kind of leave it open but uh you seem to have like a theory or a framework of like where the puck is going when it comes to the creator thing or like i don't know you've successfully built your personal brand and you know like i don't know how many years ago nobody knew who the [ __ ] dan hell is and today you're known by a bunch of you know crypto nerds so like what is the what is you you give me your thought process around either one of those two like generally where it's going are for you specifically how you think about it yeah so i'm like i'm a growth product growth marketing guy so when i find like a vein of gold where i find like engagement or i find user acquisition it just fascinates me right so the creator economy is about you know for the i think or most folks on the show i'd say up to speed with creator economy stuff okay cool so um you know i built an audience in the crypto space in the bitcoin space my main message is just bitcoin though so i'm straight to the bitcoin ethos i've been in a long time so and my last name is a pun on the favorite meme hoddle right so my last name actually is real though my last name truly is hell it's actually a german last name um which and so uh with that i decided to lean into that and i just started to write i wrote long form articles i started to tweet and those got traction and i found over time that there's a certain way that these gain traction it's it's not it's not by random circumstance there are ways to understand the engagement algorithm and use that to propagate your message for me i really love bitcoin what's an example well it's an example of something you saw that was working sure well you can do twitter advanced search and search for the most popular tweets from any account filter though but filter those by the most popular and then actually take a format of what they've tweeted and just take an iteration of that right you already know it's probably going to work and you just take a small tweak and that's that almost always works yep you could also do a quote tweet where like let's say let's say like a novel tweet you can just copy paste neval's quote with quotes and tag neval and you'll get almost as much engagement of all those yeah even if you're a really tiny account so little things like that there's a whole bunch of those that are discovered um because yeah again i'm a growth marketing guy so i'm digging in and i'm like oh man this this engagement tactic really worked i've done some things like if you see auto playing videos you can build those in the media center in twitter which you have to have an ads account to do those but they're not an ad it's organic so little little tips and tricks like that um consistency i think is the number one thing that people forget i have not missed tweeting a day in three years if you do you lose your spot in the relevancy engine with twitter so twitter every day uh there's there's like 90 of consumers and 10 of us creators well the creators create content for the board consumers the consumer session and the product and twitter needs to figure out how to hook them immediately and so twitter goes to all their previous engaged content and they go well who do they engage with every day and if they've built up a habit of engaging with myself then they're like well let's give them a damn hell tweet but if i don't tweet that day then there may be like oh let's give them a chris tweet or someone else's tweet because they need to go hook them immediately and then if that engagement loop gets built with them over time then also slowly start to lose relevancy with them so consistency is absolutely the most important thing on twitter and most of these channels i think that was like the really big breakthroughs for me it's not quality it's quantity it's about always having content there for them to consume and building that habit and then you over time you focus on quality where i think i've gotten a little bit more high quality over time especially like i've stood up a youtube channel i've got 25 000 subs in six months and i just shoot one continuous shot i don't i don't even edit it i just do one continuous shot even if i like sneeze or something i just kind of like keep going because i don't have enough time to spend in post-production and doing cuts you guys have great video content i just don't have time to go do that how they're doing it's all about like does my audience does my audience like will they engage with the content well it's an mvp right it's an mvp if people like it then you go spend time you you pay for an editor or something to go help out um but yeah it's been a it's been an incredible journey going down this rabbit hole and then you know monetization-wise too just seeing all the different ways that folks you know tipping on on twitch you've got like tipping on twitter now you've got subscription products you've got swag three years from now audience keeps growing and the money the monetization things get more baked out for you how much do you think an individual creator in your niche like how much do you think you can make three years from now just on the personal brand side of things forget the job and investigating and other stuff have you guys talked to pomp yet yeah we've heard a couple times yeah and we both know him well i don't we i mean i mean ask him that but that question yeah but if i if i have we i can but we can guess okay so out not let's not include investment revenue which i think investment revenue in the next uh so we're talking about like paid newsletter sponsorships uh recurring revenue i think we should throw in there because that's kind of like part of the personal brand stuff courses now courses yeah but let's just say though his his investment revenue if you told me that it makes him personally 30 million dollars spread evenly over the next 10 years i wouldn't be surprised is that crazy john did you hear are you talking about 30 total sorry 30 total spread out evenly over 10 years yeah i don't know how big this fund is so i'm just going to take that out for a second i think yeah just the personal brand which is two and a half to an hour i would say three and a half what would you have guessed dan two to four million is my best guess as of how much revenue he's making and that's based on like my best knowledge right maybe five people on staff so maybe half a million in costs yeah very very little overhead so very high margins right um these are all value of creative too like if someone gets gets a job through pomp they might be really inclined to sign up to his newsletter right these are like mutually exclusive sales right um but by far i think like so he he's got the so pomp is the biggest pomp is so this is our upper bound limit and that's why i chose pomp right is the biggest what about uh in the bitcoin in the crypto space you're talking about what about uh my guy uh ralph powell or is that his name brow power yeah ralph powell he's more of like uh macro finally i mean i guess we could call him krypto now because he's like there are these even though like let's say like a guy who's kind of a troll even though i love him like a james dalton like a james altucher i bet you makes 30 million dollars a year in crypto newsletters dude i don't i don't think james i'll teach you that guys from like 2017 era he's a friend of mine dude he sold his new new his crypto newsletter for 60 million dollars wow wow yes holy [ __ ] i didn't even know that you know motley fool yeah motley fool does close to 100 million a month in revenue um so i i think that pomp is the popular poppy one but i think they're i bet you i guarantee you there's guys who have newsletters that they charge 20 000 a year well you guys have uh you guys did the breakdown of agora right that like crazy newsletter thing they bought james yeah oh okay yeah i mean i got the i got the you know after you guys did the breakdown of it i actually talked to someone who worked there yeah and got the breakdown so like that back-end newsletter the one that's a really high markup like the thousand dollars a month that's where they make all the money yeah it's like you got your twenty thirty dollar a month up front one and you get the thousand dollar back and one i couldn't personally do it i just feel kind of weird doing it personally were we wrong by the way were we wrong on our guesses for agora in terms of like uh the revenue i didn't do any revenue back at the envelope revenue stuff i just want to know tactically like how do they think about it i'm with you dan there is something to that like oh this like weird slippery slope where you end up with these like you know this small one percent of these like whales who you've just milked their whole life savings because they think they're getting this thing no no thanks i'd rather build longer term value to like deliver something i think is truly worth that amount of money that's where i've experimented with courses so i've got my newsletter i've got my newsletter i've got ads which one is the best the best combination of like effort fun and money like if you combine those right you want a low effort high five high money like what is the best one so far you've experimented as a creator of these tools in your tool belt probably youtube because i it's kind of fun showing a product that you really so i only represent products that i personally use right it's an ethical standard that i have for myself so which means that i have eliminated a lot of the potential advertisers that would pay me a lot more right for me it's the only way that i feel like it'd be appropriate for me to you know represent this product um then the youtube is fun because i get to like have like a little skit with it where i like i bring it up i talk about it i represent it the newsletter it's a lot of work um that i mean writing an article a week doesn't sound like a lot it's a ton of work and you take pride in it but when it's paid there's a bar of these people paid for this information so the information that better be different and unique and awesome everybody i know i'm a i'm a you know classic growth guy so i have a survey at the end of each one to get like a raw mps score i get feedback on what the next article they want written that way i write the best most relevant content which means that they're satisfied but it's tough you know like it it's really hard to where i don't know how pomp does it daily i think he's got a guy i i would bet that he's got about two young guys he says he doesn't he says he sits down he writes it in one take um well i i went out to me and my wife and him and his wife all went out to lunch one day and just hung out and uh paulina his wife was teasing him like like she was like it takes me forever to wipe write my weekly thing he just sits down and he does it in 15 minutes and he's done i mean i've i've had some that have like cruised through like a straight like stream of consciousness but it's tough some of them i do a lot of research for like i wrote one on bitcoin defy and that was a ton of like actually i tried to try out a couple different apps it was a lot of work so fun and roi would be youtube channel where like i do these pre-world mid-roll ads they're kind of fun to do i can visually show off the product in a more fun compelling way like the products i'm representing uh versus like the newsletter which i have to sit down really think through hard and it's something that you know i want to make sure i represent really really well by the way your growth guy um i've said that this bitcoin laser eyes thing is one of the most genius kind of like decentralized marketing tactics i've ever seen um what is the origin story is there an organization i'm saying do you know he knows more people than i do where did this come from and who are the geniuses that came up with this yeah so i wrote about bitcoin's decentralized marketing team before where like bitcoin has no central marketing org there's no propaganda arm of bitcoin it's like me and pomp and everyone else who talks about bitcoin i don't know who originated it it's like the origin of memes i mean sometimes you can find where a meme came from but sometimes it just kind of like it came from nowhere i'm not sure who the first person was and no one i know has claimed it which is insane because somebody should and uh and you could you could be the first person who did this right that's not like uh that's not like a wild thing and but it's genius it is like bitcoin in so many ways is a religion and um and this is just yet another like you know religious mark basically you know this is the yamaka this is this is the thing you wear that that says hey i'm a part of this religion and um you know putting it in the profile picture having it be slightly mysterious so people don't know what it's for and then they ask and then making it memeable where we can all do it i think is it was just brilliant brilliant brilliant really yeah this basis i mean memes are such an incredible part of how stuff is communicated nowadays right like i mean we saw like elections that can people can be elected based on memes like memes aren't just these funny things on like 4chan or reddit anymore like memes are the memes are like the main trend like my mom uses memes now she does it on my facebook but you know it's it's crazy like it's narrative compression at its finest it's taking a whole narrative and compressing it into one image and i think that's why it's so powerful as a transmission it's the most shareable viral thing you can do right on the internet and so it's like what you know memes are the packaging for ideas if you want to most efficiently package an idea a meme is the best way so i've joked about uh we saw this thing called i think was called like meme university or lol university or something like that and basically they took the website of lambda school and they just remade it for a school that would teach you how to do memes it was a joke website that was not like a real course behind it but i was like you know if there really should be a course that somebody should take this is it um people but people if you could learn this it's learning you know the native tongue of the internet um and and you know it's pretty important to be fluent in internet nowadays and so i think i think that's one where i'm like if somebody really should create this i have this slack channel that me and ben do where we basically put out a challenge where we said every day for 50 days we're gonna make a new meme um because you know it's easy to spread these but the act of actually making one is hard it's telling it you know telling a story telling a joke in the most efficient form and it's been so challenging to just do this every day for 50 days well what's kind of fun is um my buddies over at etoro brad mitchelson really really smart marketing guy him and i buddies and what they did is they started to create gifs on so on giphy and giphy like that that's a good that gets pulled into like facebook messenger search engine twitter gifs so i started to make i saw their strategy for etoro and i made that for myself so i took like the most popular bitcoin memes and then wrapped it in my own black and white design to where you could search like dan held and you'd see a bunch of black and white gifs and have my my logo watermarked on there so like you can kind of create meme factories is what i learned from that like you can create like a meme factory to use that to propagate content and giphy was a really great way of doing it because it's plugged into so many different platforms versus like if you you know each one individually like trying to create like an emoji with each social platform would be tough but like giphy gets pulled into all of them yeah that's smart i like that all right we're about at the top of the hour uh do we want to go over one more idea or what sean um i don't know if you have if you have one that's burning you can do it otherwise i think we should uh wrap it up cool well yeah i mean just my i think like closing thought on like the creator economy stuff um i've been in bitcoin for nine years and that has been a huge fascination for me i would say the creator economy is not an equal fascination but quickly becoming something very interesting um i think about it as like the monetization of all and human information right like creators are just taking whatever knowledge they have locally putting that on the internet distributing it and then monetizing that and what is the value of all of that combined i mean it's tens of trillions 100 trillion i don't know what it's worth but like for me i just kind of see this huge i mean there's so many niche things that someone could write about like there's a million things and it's very low very low effort to find your mvp versus before you had to go buy a warehouse and start producing things you just produce content and if that content resonates and people click and want to figure out what products you'd recommend for them then you can go build your own products so i see kind of like a whole the economy kind of reorienting around content marketing and that being the top of funnel in in like idea generation for all future products great well what do you think sean yeah let's wrap it up i like that one that that's uh i like the way you explained that because i think it it aligns with something i believe which is when when there's never been more information it's all about who actually has attention and the person who's gonna have attention is whoever is putting out great content consistently so great content once we'll get your attention once and then great content consistently will build trust which just says look it's too noisy i'm just gonna go to my sources i like and um and then those people then hold the keys and you know up till now that's been captured by the platform so that's been true but youtube still captured way more value and twitch captured way more value and twitter captured way more value than the people on it and that seems to be flipping uh where where either new platforms are going to come out where the creators own it or the the value is going to accrue off platform in a bigger way than it did originally when it was like i think the value accrued like 99 1. um 99 to the platform 1 to the creators and i think that's that's gonna flip uh closer to 50 50 over time i think twitter has recognized this right with the super follows where you can have like subscription followers where people subscribe to like a premium set of tweets you have i mean twitter i think sees this coming they see the exodus of folks building an audience on twitter and then the exodus of all that monetization going to sub stack you're trying to bring that back in yeah i think that's sort of just trading one master for another though in a way where it's like as long as twitter will put super follows there and then they'll take the cut they want and then as long as they're they're the button to pay for stuff they can they'll just inch that cut from 10 to 15 to 20 to 50 over time and um and so i think you know the real answer here is is how do you build this independently and i think basically that that's the part of crypto i'm most excited about is people who are building uh you know a social network that is open source um that if it can get adoption and this is why i was interested in big cloud is if it can get adoption then uh that ratio will flip the the all the value will accrue to the creators and not to the core platform or protocol underneath um so so that's what i'm excited about is like that's the real disruption there well we appreciate you coming on dan um it's uh i've been following you on twitter now for a couple weeks since uh uh sean's been talking about you and he's been saying that you were the guy to speak to and and we appreciate it yeah so go go give him a follow he's at dan held on twitter and uh yeah all right we'll see you we'll see you later i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to never looking back

i feel like there's a world where this like let's be conservative i feel like there's a like this is very clearly a 10 million a year thing that makes 2 million in profit i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to dude there's like a picture in the background that is just getting my attention so much that crooked there's like a crooked picture you see it yeah yeah there's a whole subreddit called like uh i forget what it's exactly called but it's about like minor things that are just slightly off like what were they thinking it's like mildly like there's mildly interesting that's probably mildly irritating or something like that no it's called mildly infuriating did you did you just guess that well i know about mildly interesting so yeah uh anyway what's going on justin um do you know you know what you're getting into like do you know what we're what we do yeah no i know a good bet all right good so you uh we'll just do like a really quick intro but you uh you've done a bunch of stuff i've known you since 2013 i think right yeah i think actually a little earlier when you were doing the room we both had roommate businesses and he we just became friends he moved to sam you you moved to san francisco i ended up introducing him or no he met one of the girls a girl he dated for a long time in the elevator on his way up to our meeting who was my co-worker and so we just ran in like the circle of friends for years that's pretty good so you get the number in the elevator or what was the elevators not it's only a two floor you're on the second floor right so that's not too long it was a fast it was a fast close yeah how'd that happen tell me about it yeah do you want me to share this thing i'm happy yeah yeah i mean we met and this girl walked into an elevator and i was like just making a joke she was i think like maybe a tiny bit drunk and tried to hit a button but there were no buttons in the elevator it's one of those fancy ones that like you walk into and the attendant sends you somewhere and so i just started sort of making fun of her for that and in the several story ride with like two other stops um i was like hey we should hang out and then we hung out at um at sam's apartment list party and shane numbers and have been friends hence amazing uh okay and sam did you did you know that justin was going to go on to do great things at the time did you spot that early or no was he just another dude yeah well we were both schemin we were only 22 i think when we met that was a while ago and he um he had this roommate thing and i had a roommate thing and i think anyone who ever started that's like there's like three things that you start right when you graduate college and that like that's like one of them and so they never work out well like they're never that good so anyway by the way there's three are like music discovery uh why is it so hard to find new music that we could solve that problem uh it's roommate roommate discovery is another one and then food delivery it depends who you're and then like or like college craigslist yeah exactly local local craigslist sometimes it's to-do list or sometimes if it's like your first time commuting you're like if you're i know this for engineers i've met like 10 engineers that all made the same thing first which was basically like a bus tracking software that tells them when the bus is coming because they're just like you're so tired of the unpredictable like is it seven minutes more or less and they're like i need to make an app for this well so yeah we were both doing that and i knew i mean whatever we that was a stepping stone for both of us and then he started um you co-wrote a book with a guy or no you you sold a company or you joined a company somehow you were working with my friend terry and their whole business was buying and selling stuff and that was like pretty successful i believe and then you also started working on writing this book called traction with this duckduckgo guy gabe is his name right yep exactly and then it was and then he was doing udemy courses and i was like yeah i mean we're all like schemers he had like airbnbs and i think you did you buy cars and rent them to uber people uh no my roommate was doing that i was looking at doing it but decided it was a miserable business so didn't end up doing it and we were so we were always doing stuff we had you had a udemy course i probably was selling some type of information stuff and then he started this thing called kettle and fire which first of all like i thought it was so stupid on so many capacities or so many uh places so first i was like he was like i want to start like selling like this uh like hard good i'm like bro like we work in the internet why would you ever want to like start like a goods thing then he was like it's gonna be food and i'm like your kid like why would you ever do that then he said it was bone broth and i was like bone broth people drink bone broth and then this was like before like this whole like i don't even think the word d to c was a was a thing and so obvi i mean i thought it was the dumbest thing ever and i was wrong right like it's been it's been a smashing success and he started this kettle and fire thing and it's quite big you've also started uh my neighbor sean is this guy named anthony i don't know who did it first one of you guys like had this thing called uh perfect keto where you're selling keto products and then you guys like combine you so we we partnered up on it basically we i was like running kettle and fire and as i do sometimes looking for like another side hustle thing to start on the side uh and he had another business that was in the supplement space but the two of us were just like hey we should work on a small side project together make something that does 20 grand a month and like once we hit that threshold we'll like blow it all on a ridiculous trip to japan and that was like the whole goal of the business uh pretty big right yeah i mean we we thought it would take like a year or two to get to 20 grand a month and we did it in the first like 45 days it was insane and then kettle and fire is like a big thing too you guys like i think you raised money or did you sell a portion of it yeah so kettle and fire we uh we raised money we bootstrapped for the first 18 months raised a tiny bit of money less than a million dollars ran in another like 16 months and then decided that the the opportunity was big enough that it made sense for us to raise so we raised 16 million dollars in 2018 about half of that went to secondary and the other half went to like actually putting money into the business so i've heard a number that either kettle and fire or perfecto or both did a hundred million in revenue i don't know if that's a cumulative lifetime number i don't know if that's an annual number is this a public number or is this what can you tell me about this because that was a big number i was yesterday and i'm a customer yeah like six of your bone broths uh you know sitting in my pantry right now yeah i really like it i love that there's one flavor i really like and i feel like i never get it in any store and then i'm like all right let me try these other five and see if any of them can match that one i really love what's the one that you're super into uh i don't know which one it's it's like the top it's like i think it's like one of the thai lime yeah i think it's either the tom yum or one of the other ones like it's like this like a thai curry type flavor and yeah yeah yeah that's one of my favorites yeah and some of those by the way are nasty but some of them are really good and so i'm like it's like you know those like when you get a pack of cards you're like looking for a hologram like a holographic charizard inside and then you get a squirtle that's how i feel about kettle and fire i know this is not common but that's just my personal experience with so far thanks man i'll take that as a compliment okay but back back to the business side so uh i was a customer but i was shocked when i heard that 100 million number what is that number yeah so that's not cumulative uh you know we we stopped sort of disclosing revenue numbers recently but i can say in 2019 like the two businesses combined did north of 100. gotcha and it's what is perfect keto so i know kettle and fire what's perfect keto yeah so perfect keto is a line of supplements and food products for people interested in lowering their carb and sugar intake and so we we have like a clean label line of foods and supplements for people on a ketogenic diet or who just like want to eat fewer carbs and no sugars gotcha and are you keto and sean the guy who started it by or his partner is literally my next-door neighbor yeah but you also say everyone's your neighbor so i never know what to believe and then i came to visit you and you drove me around you're like that's where this guy lives that's where this person lives that's where this person lives and now i now i believe you but if somebody's listening literally like wait he said his neighbor is neville then he said his neighbor is the guy who made the ice barrel thing that we talked about last time then he said his neighbor's the student loan guy then he said it's this other thing and student student loan hero guy and i are the same guy so they live like he lives like 20 houses down anthony literally lives direct like uh like 30 feet from me right uh yeah like literally right so the con i guess the context here is you knew justin lucy um and i've never met justin no i did not not lose well okay and um intimately and you've done two things i think that are really interesting one is the perfect keto stuff and carolyn fire basically building a brand that's been pretty damn successful and then the other is you write content and i want to actually talk about some of the content stuff you write so you have the book traction that's a good book but on your blog there's one blog post that i remember it's been sent to me several times so i know other people like it too so let's start there if you're cool with it which is you have this side hustle post on on your blog and i'm assuming this is probably one of your more popular blog posts is that right yeah definitely and you basically outline that you've done a bunch of side hustles and then you have like kind of like you break it down as like there's these four types of side hustles so can you give us kind of like give us the side hustle bit uh here which is like and if you scroll all the way down to that sheet you're on you'll see your yeah which is basically like what are the side hustles you've done all right kind of how do you think about side hustles and then break people break those four down for people totally yeah so the reason that i got into this is uh when sam and i met you know the two of us were like we want to do this entrepreneurship thing but in in many ways it's actually a lot easier and like emotionally uh bearable to start a company if you have just like income coming in that's covering your expenses and so when i moved to san francisco you know this the city is super expensive and so i started like doing a bunch of side hustles just to try and make income that would give me the freedom to like spend my time trying to launch a company that would really create a lot of like equity value and sort of like life-changing um you know financial freedom and so when i what i did when i moved to sf i like started airbnb our place we at one point yeah this was 2013. we had like the number third like the third ranked airbnb in san francisco and so we were uh we were like renting out either our living room most nights or uh you know over summers we'd rent it out for like 15 18 grand a month and then we just and we were paying three grand a month for the spot so like that was incredible at the time and we'd just travel and then launched like udemy courses there was a period where i was buying motorcycles that were on craigslist in oakland and selling them in san francisco because there was like an arbitrage there so i was just doing a bunch of random random stuff and so when i wrote this article so many people that i've talked to were like you know i want to understand how to make side income and how to think about this stuff um and so i just kind of like broke down like the the different sorts in my mind like the four kinds of businesses that you can start as a side hustle um you know some of these that i've done actually ended up being more more real businesses but like do you want me to talk through the categories and kind of whatever you also had a good disclaimer which is like look first things first accept that what you're doing is not meant to be the next facebook it's not meant to be a startup it's like you're trying to make money you're trying to get some profitable cash flow from a business quickly without a ton of like you know without waiting seven years for this thing to pay off so like first let's call it what it is all right let's call a spade a spade is i thought an important disclaimer and then you had these four four groups uh so let's run through them and then sam you tell me if you've also done any in these categories yeah totally yeah i mean i think truly if you're mark zuckerberg or like a collison brother like [ __ ] raise money do like the the massive thing that you're working on i just think for most people entrepreneurship is a means to an end and that end is like a lifestyle that people are trying to create and so the more that you can like create that and the faster you get financial freedom i just think that's a useful thing for more people to have in general um so the the four like kinds of side hustles that that i talked about in my blog post um the first one that i talk about is like buying an existing asset basically you can look at like what's an existing asset that you could try and purchase leverage your skills connections resources whatever to upgrade that you know make it more cash flow positive make it do better whatever and then you get to capture the value created by upgrading that asset i did this with like sam i'm sure you guys could do this if you bought an email newsletter you know you know how to run that better buy it for a million bucks improve it you could probably sell it for you know three to five a couple years later yeah i was um my friend ramone bought something that i had a small part of and it was a software very small software app that when we bought it maybe it was doing 20 000 a month and all we did was we doubled the price of the product and it doubled the revenue amazing and you did that too didn't you own a or you bought a thing called fomo right yeah yeah so a partner and i bought a shopify app called fomo uh it was doing 14k a month at the time we bought it uh you know we bought it uh we paid less than 400 i'll say that less than 400 000. yeah which was like a super good multiple yeah you didn't roll some equity down right so you get seller financing or what you do yeah so we had a really like the guy basically wanted out it was a single founder and we were like hey we know how to market we have connections we can like really help grow this thing and so we bought 85 percent of the business uh we bought it and then we were basically like we're gonna buy this and pay you in monthly chunks for the next 20 months um and so every like month for 20 months we use the revenue that we were making from fomo to make our payment to him and like my partner and i basically came out of pocket zero dollars to acquire this asset we were obviously working on running it we like had to throw in i think it ended up being five grand each to pay the developers the first couple months but um but yeah i mean it was like an incredible acquisition how big is it now now it does about 95 grand a month sounds like a good deal to me yeah it's a good deal i mean it's good deal for everyone the guy like has gotten his time back he's started other companies in the interim and like when we exit this thing he'll make probably more than he would have made on the exit than you know had he continued to run this for the last three years and with no headache it's like a nice thing so you're talking about buy so category one buying an asset this can be uh a house that you airbnb it can be a internet company that you just you know you do what sam did you go in the code you push you know control f you find the price and then you change the number to double which is like sam's genius or what you did was you know who i learned that from was terry you're i don't know if she was your boss or what but she taught me how to do it how to find the price point well she was like she was like look the whole thing is that engineer-led businesses typically are priced poorly and if you just double the price uh it works right and she was like double the price and then find out which emails uh urls are being used a bunch of times so for example if you have like 18 people using uber.com contact the hr department or whoever the procurement and like sell enterprise she kind of like taught me the stuff that uh justin's old company was doing yeah exactly so i so i ended up i really like this buy an asset thing i think sometimes you have to have money other times you can sell our finance but we ended up doing this too with an apartment building in in vegas where we bought a 14 unit apartment building could put it all on airbnb uh basically like tripled the cash flow and then sold it 18 months later for you know 70 more than what we paid by the way in the blog post you had a couple examples i think are useful we don't have to go too much into them but you were like uh you talked about this thing which is like okay if you know you have the skills to like improve the value of the asset so for airbnb you were like all right to get more airbnb bookings like you know first if it's not on airbnb we should put it on airbnb if it is on ibb we can like boost the bookings by like these three things right uh put more and better photos up okay easy anybody could do that but most people haven't optimized that second like instantly respond to every inquiry so that we get a fast response rate the algorithm likes that and then the last thing is like whatever like five star reviews at the end or something like that and so you're like i can just take those three levers and i can apply it to any property now that isn't optimized for airbnb so if they think it's worth a hundred i already know it's worth 120 because i know i can just do that playbook again on uh on on any property yeah exactly and that's like that actually leads to the sort of like the second bucket of side hustles that i talk about which is basically look at what is a marketplace with existing demand where you don't have to go out and find the customer you just provide the supply side stuff like buying you know putting a property on airbnb all i have to do is understand how does the property like or how does airbnb uh dictate where i rank you know and what does it want from me as a supplier and then my [ __ ] is gonna get booked up uh like i don't actually have to go find every individual customer that's traveling to san francisco that can rent our apartment because like airbnb is doing that for me and you did that with like uh was you used to have a thing it was called uh sql for programmers or what was it called yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so basically exactly so so i've done this on a couple platforms like amazon is a big one like a bunch of people are starting fba businesses but i sort of think that focusing on up-and-coming platforms where the supply side isn't crazy competitive is actually a really good place to start where you could like when i when i was um when i launched my first udemy course you know i filmed it literally over five days in my bedroom in san francisco no like good quality no good editing it was just like it candidly like was not an amazing course from a like student experience standpoint but the content was good uh but udemy was such an early platform that i put it up there and just by being literally the first guy to talk about here's how to learn sql as a marketer like that course sold i think like 60 grand over the next couple years um and to this day i still get like a thousand dollars a month from that course from udemy which is absurd um and you know that was all because like here's an emerging platform they want people creating stuff on the supply side how do i create a course or whatever uh that just like can reach people who are already looking for something on a platform um and focus on that and i don't know if you did this for that but uh there's ways to basically figure out what are people searching for so there's like tools like ahrefs or whatever you can figure out what what google searches are are people doing and in what volume but uh even on individual platforms there's ways to figure it out like i know i looked at this business to buy and it was this girl selling a waist trainer you know what a waste trainer is yeah it's basically do you know what this thing is it's like i had no idea what this was before um so it's basically like you know like okay i'm gonna here's the here's the mansplain to there's three dudes talking about way strainers all right so you know like if you watch like pirates of the caribbean or some any movie or show that's like based in kind of like olden times girls wear that like corset it's like this super tight thing that you're like you squeeze into this and then you wear your dress on top so your finger gets like your stomach gets squeezed out and your boobs get squeezed out like spanx or something it's like old-school spanx and so uh what waste trainers are are that it's basically like a cinch you wear around your stomach constantly and it makes you look good in the moment but also the idea is that it trains your your muscles or your body to like to to tighten up um because you kind of have to keep it flexed in a way for it to not like kind of be uncomfortable i guess i don't know what the theory is but that's my guess and like the kardashians kind of like you know talk about the stuff and it kind of got a little more popular so this girl who was building this business i was like cool so like what do you spend every month in marketing she's like oh like we don't spend anything in marketing like so how do you how are you growing so fast she's like oh i just saw that on youtube nobody was owning the keyword for waste trainers and like how to size one how to wear one do they work so she just created like the youtube channel to be the answer to every search question about waste trainers on youtube and you can go if you go search wasters right now on youtube you'll find all her videos amazing and so all her sales just come just from that and she was doing a few million dollars a year of a revenue a million dollars of profit per year just through that one channel alone amazing yeah good for her but yeah i i think exactly what you're talking about it's like find where people are searching for something and there's no supply there and that's a really good place to focus like when i launched sql for marketers there was literally almost nothing under the like marketing like the technical marketing or like the data analytics data driven marketing section for udemy and so it's like cool if i put that up there that seems like it'll it'll resonate and do well uh which ended up being correct and what are the third and fourth ones yeah so the the third one is uh basically like launch a unique product in an area where you can buy customers via paid acquisition and again i think all of this is like super important to remember that you're not building facebook you're just like if you look at google adwords or waste trainers as you're saying and there's a gap there you can figure out how to make a product and your goal is not like make a hundred million dollar business but make one that does a million dollars a year like there are almost infinite niches on the internet where you can just make a product buy some rough keywords and just sell through in a category that you know where you're like the first to market or the first to do a really good job what's an exam market that's what's an example in that category that you've seen either from yourself or a friend or someone you've seen recently that's doing that that model yeah so there there's a company actually that is doing um that's like vests for dogs but the vests are spiky so that coyotes don't attack your dog so you can turn the dog into a pool yeah exactly like you could put this vest on a dog and then it won't get eaten by coyotes because it's got like spikes all over it um so i mean what an incredible niche product uh you know that's definitely not gonna like go public but that could be an incredible business uh and so that stuff like that i mean honestly that's what um that's what kettle and fire was going to be when we first launched it i had no idea that bone broth would be such a compelling category and and the trend would take off like it has like our plan was basically we looked at we looked at google searches and we were like i think we can build a like 20 to 40 grand a month business so when you say we looked at google searches what does that mean in practical terms most people have never done that so what what what yeah fair so we we use like google adwords keyword tool just to say like which is that's like discontinued now yeah i know now you'd have to use uh a refs or some hdm rush or something um but at the time we used a tool that was basically like there's 2 000 people a month looking for like buy bone broth online and so if we can be the supplier that will sell you bone broth online like you know assuming we convert like even 10 of those people 200 orders 50 a month like you know that that's a pretty material uh side hustle and so that was like the reason that we launched kettlebell yeah google is like you know it's like a magic lamp and on one side you have all the aladdin's out there making wishes and then you just get to be the genie so it's like there are these tools that tell you here's the wishes people are entering into this magic box they're just hoping for something and if you notice that exactly that's more people than i would have expected saying this thing or asking this question or wanting this thing and you go search for it and you're like wow these results suck uh okay how do i just become the top result for that thing and so you thought you thought kettle and fire would do that so give me a sense of how long did it take for you to get from idea like seeing that keyword and being like oh maybe we could do this to actually making like i don't know a thousand dollars a month how long was that process for you yeah so the process took about a year most of it was because i'd never done a physical product before and so it was like just bumbling around in the dark like trying to find someone that could make this stuff had a bunch of false starts but it took us basically 12 months to uh to go from like hey i think this is an opportunity to actually having product in box but once we had product in box you know we did over 20 grand our first month that we were live so and you um you are you the ceo of cattle and fire i am yeah you've got like three we're gonna talk about this other thing that you're thinking about doing how are you balancing all this time it's a good question uh i i honestly i've never had a good answer for this i just like balancing it well uh okay i mean some of these things like perfect keto like i don't have a day-to-day role in it anymore you know so i like co-founded it but i've completely stepped away uh one of the things that at kettle and fire that i think i'm proud of that we've done really well is like we have a phenomenal team and so to that to that extent i get to work on stuff that only i can do uniquely well like writing long 15 page posts about how beef is actually like not bad for the environment and [ __ ] like this that i'm kind of interested in but a lot of the day to day is handled by like the team that we've built over the last you know five five plus years so i really like am in control of my time in general partner with a guy like anthony or whoever you're partnering with and you aren't doing how many of these things do you have right now where you have your hands in roughly right now like five probably okay and so but there's one that's your day job right yeah okay so for the other four when you make these structures with people so a guy like anthony or it doesn't have to be him but the representative that represents him are you taking a draw from that business at all or are you just only going to pay yourself if it sells yeah so at this point i'm pretty focused on like creating equity value and so you know for an example like a company i incubated uh shirley wines it's like a non-alcoholic wine company we launched earlier this year i recruited i like basically had the idea tested it validated it lined up supply chain hired in the operator um the operator and ceo he's taking a salary and like i probably won't get a dollar out of that business uh for until we eventually sell that business or whatever happens with it like i put in a bunch of my own money to capitalize it and get it up and running but i'm just like i'm not gonna suck money out of that thing until uh you know until we have a good outcome so then really the only thing you are not the only thing i mean the thing you're bringing the table is you are bringing a little bit of cash and also you're bringing some expertise in your guide yeah totally but it also like incubated the whole idea that in that one yeah yeah i mean i think it's basically like trying to create a a compelling opportunity for someone where you know someone can go instead of going if someone wants to be a founder ceo today their options are like jump take no salary for 12 to 18 months hope they can figure out an idea and raise money and do all that kind of stuff or like build a side hustle which is again like a totally different skill set that we're kind of talking about and so with this one specifically like i incubated the idea had everything lined up validated that it was big brought investors and basically was like hey man if you want to be a founder and ceo you can just walk into this role you take zero health care zero salary risk uh and you're you're good like you're a founder you have a ton of upside you're this operating ceo we have investors lined up it's a big opportunity like it sort of works for both parties uh you know when you um are you do you regret or are you thankful that you raised money for kettle and fire oh definitely thankful i mean really with yeah for sure i mean with with kettle and fire in particular like the business had grown to a really meaningful amount and i still had like most of my net worth wrapped up in that and so i think getting some secondary was like personally really meaningful um and it also meant that like i felt more okay pushing for a bigger outcome it also meant like i think i will probably raise for most things that i do going forward or invest my own money just because the caliber of the team that we were able to hire around us like what we were doing on a shoestring budget versus what we could do after was just night and day like we have an amazing team but amazing people are expensive and so it's definitely like made my life 100 times easier and more enjoyable getting to spend other people's money to increase the value of my equity by hiring amazing people it's like that seems like a no-brainer to me in a lot of ways uh yeah when you explain that way it does but if i was one of your investors and i and you're doing all this other stuff i'd be like what the [ __ ] dude only do this thing i just gave you money yeah yeah i mean look it's it's something that i had to work through with our investors for sure i was very upfront with it with them about it was like look this is my main focus um you know which was very true and it was definitely something to manage around i also think though that like it's one of those things where as long as the business is going well no one's going to complain you know what i mean but certainly if things went sideways then it's then it's like okay this is an easy area to point for it's like elon can run tesla and spacex and everyone's like wow he's amazing and those businesses are amazing and then jack does the same thing with twitter and square and if twitter misses its earnings it's like off with his head how dare he you know yeah he's a part-time ceo what the hell were we thinking and uh and so it's you know people are pretty they do uh what's called resulting pretty hard in in that case uh and you also did yeah yeah yeah you also did a pretty fun experiment i i don't know if this was a side hustle or what would you call this where me and sam were both guinea pigs in your uh your continuous glucose monitoring trial so you basically tweeted out yeah i was sending them like i was sending them like shirtless pics of myself like every week yeah typically that would include one photo just him in his boxer's photo and there's just a little p-spot to show his body fat and so you were doing this thing where you were like hey i need like 20 people or i don't know how many maybe it's 40 people that you ended up using yeah 50 people you were like hey uh we're gonna do this experiment and what you did was you sent us all a levels uh glucose monitor and then um continuous glucose monitor that we just you know punctured into our arm basically now okay that's measuring and then you put us all in like a whatsapp group and you're like hey here's the idea and it was like financial incentive i think it was like you would pay us out every day that we stayed in range and if we missed it like you kept our money or something like that uh what was that experiment and what'd you learn out of it man it was awesome like that that experiment was uh kind of like many things in my life i just had the idea tweeted it immediately and got such a strong response from people we had like a wait list yeah totally uh where i was like okay now i gotta figure this out um you know sam was texting me every day being like this is sweet like i'm i'm gonna get all my [ __ ] money back like you're very into it i loved it i was into it yeah it was super yes awesome but yeah so learned a ton man i mean one of the craziest things i think was just how well that incentive of like 25 a day really worked for people to keep them keep them honest like you go through you know pay 950 bucks for 30 days every day that you stay under a barrier i like give you 25 bucks back and just that tiny little behavior like incentive where that brownie or whatever is not four dollars but it's 29 dollars like that uh i think that little incentive goes a really long way and it's somewhat competitive and all this and so we have had with literally no marketing you know we've we've filled up 50 person cohorts every month since launching that in february uh live yeah yeah people can still sign up it's wearablechallenge.com we've had one person go through it seven times they've lost about 50 pounds it's like unbelievable who to see the results of this who's who's running that yeah so one of the guys in the first cohort aaron got so excited about the idea i was like hey do you want to run with this and so he uh he's been running it it's amazing and is that a business to you or what is that not really i mean we're kind of thinking about like how to make it a business but uh but it's actually a perfect example of a side hustle like i will probably make you know somewhere between 20 and 30 grand this year from doing right uh yeah when i fall maybe more if sam joins and blows a bunch of his glucose levels when i saw that i was like hey this is fun and uh it's kind of like on brand for you because of the stuff you talk about in your businesses but then i was also like oh this is a great business because everybody wants the outcome everybody wants to eat right lose weight and the biggest hack is not knowledge but accountability and i liked that you were coming at it from an accountability point of view and i actually think like you know the company levels could do something like this or there's going to be a company that does this right whatever weight watchers is as a business model like i haven't studied it i'm assuming you have given what you do and what this business is but could this not be like weight watchers 2.0 i think it could be i mean it just it would need someone to like run at it really full time but i do think that there's something here i mean there's a couple companies like stick and like one other that i'm forgetting where you can sort of like bet money on um on different outcomes and you know i think that that sort of works i actually think the really powerful part of this is like it's a cohort it's a challenge for a set period of time and you lose money only for that set period right uh and so like i would love to expand this and we're sort of have some ideas in the in the hopper about like what expanding it might look like but it's definitely not my like full-time thing at all have you heard of stick shawn that's actually an interesting company to buy i haven't been there in years but when i used to go there it was even when i went there like years ago it was considered like old so it's stick it's spelled stick but i think there's two k's at the end right yep and it's like a physical place no it's a web stick.com but two k's at the end and uh is the website still all old and janky looking yeah okay so it was like old back then when or in 2013 or 14 when i used to use it and what you do is you enlist a friend uh to be the referee and then you create i believe an anti-charity where you uh select something that you hate and then you upload money to it and then if you fail at your challenge your friend clicks a button and it automatically goes to that place that you hate and i i think you can you there's a varieties of the tim ferriss but talked about this i think in four hour work week and i think it got popular from that yeah yeah it it did you think this company makes money justin i would imagine so i don't know how much but it could be it would it could be an interesting thing to buy i mean it's actually not that hard to replicate but like if they already get traffic it could be an interesting it would be an interesting this would be an interesting thing to buy and uh revamp and make a little bit better because i think they get a lot of traffic when i um when we owned toodledo there was this one guy an author uh i think he wrote a book uh getting things done what's called uh yeah and he mentioned toodle-doo this app that me and uh ramon bought um and most of our customers came to us because they read about toodle-do like it just mentioned them in like a sentence or something in the book and that's where most of the customers came from and just because tim ferriss mentioned stick i bet that's where the the vast majority of their customers come from for sure yeah that's funny there was a thing called jim pact too i don't know if you guys have seen that i don't know if it made it it was like it came out five years ago or something like that but it was you would basically pledge that you're gonna go to the gym with some some frequency and other people would too and it basically i think what they were doing was like in your case you're the house you're like the bank it's like i give you the money then you pay me back and in this case it was like it would match you with somebody else and uh if you ever didn't do your thing your money would go to that person uh if they did it and you didn't go your money would go to them and if you both went your money would be safe and um and so you're like making a pact that you would go to the gym for you know some amount of frequency but i do think there is something to this like kind of financial incentive accountability you know betting betting on yourself betting on your habit uh model that i think it's pretty cool yeah i totally agree i mean we're actually looking now at like could you apply this to run little you know health boot camps in like la or austin or something like that where you have 30 people 50 people opt in will handle your meals we'll you know we'll give you levels like we'll do all this sort of stuff and a more like premium offering that um where it's like hey you're almost guaranteed to lose weight or get in better shape at the end of this month that would for sure work that's a little bit better than my weight loss idea which is called kidnap where you just go and you take a person and you bring them to the desert uh in like vegas and you just kidnap with two peas at the end yeah kidnap sf or we'll call it hostage and we just bring you to like a farm and we just like it's like look you only 1500 calories a day do whatever you want all day but like this is it i love that um can i imagine the refund rates would be high on that well you know it'll be guaranteed success um so i want to get to some of these ideas but i first want to ask you about duckduckgo so you're friends with that guy gabe right the guy who started it or owns it and are you bullish on that business because you're one of the few people i know that has insight onto it and i'm bit i look at their traffic monthly like because they give out these monthly updates uh that does that is that business like uh like kind of like an under the radar thing do you think this is gonna take over the world because that's kind of how i feel yeah i mean i i think it's it's crushing like i think that you always see like there's always like a counterpoint to some massive trend or massive amount of success like you have like amazon taking over the world but then you have shopify which is crushing it and i think that duckduckgo is like the counterpoint to uh to like google and you know privacy eroding across the board all this sort of stuff like i do think there's an opportunity to be a big tech company but with privates like privacy is a core value rather than uh you know selling ads to everyone and so i think duckduckgo really has that the opportunity to like be that company and they have a lot of tailwinds that are working in their favor at this point um it's also crazy like gabe he's been working on that company for like 12 years five of those years yeah i feel like it might be actually um but like for a large chunk of that time he was just a solo founder building a search engine to compete with google it's like wow so they do north of 100 million in revenue i believe yeah i i believe do you i mean how like i don't know if you i don't know if you knew him during those early years but like did you know him at the beginning or now not not the very very beginning but i knew him when it was like him and one other person working on duckduck and so i'm guessing at that point it wasn't it wasn't a case where tim and one other person and man it's crushing it it's him and one other person and it's sort of crawling forward um yeah what were those kind like what were your conversations like what was the outlook i mean i find it fascinating when people work on these businesses that don't take off right away and they stick with it and then they need to either like the world just changes or they figure something out or just compound slow slowly but then all of a sudden it starts to take off like what was that like they're the flat part and then what do you think caused it to grow yeah i think that he was he was just getting like small bits of positive feedback from communities like hacker news community was like duckduckgo is amazing for like stack overflow searches or you know x y and z very specific niche sorts of searches and then as you got good feedback from those groups it's like okay let's invest in product to make this a little better a little better and i think that after you know let's call it 12 14 years he's been working on this the product has gotten a lot better but also the like sort of trend line of where big tech is going has it's just gotten like way more way more invasive and way more like privacy is way more of a concern for people today especially as you're seeing a lot of the censorship stuff and you know some of this that's that's happening in the big tech world right now i think that duckduckgo is like one of the few companies that for over a decade now has been like privacy is one of our like core things and they've built an incredibly complex product uh to compete with google that's just not easy to spin up overnight you know it's not a side hustle it's not like the type of thing you or i can build with a couple hours a week uh over you know a weekend can we talk about can we go through some of these ideas you want to start with airbnb camping because i uh you were texting me about this i uh and i want to learn about it i just looked at a house the other day by the way uh down the street from my house to buy for airbnb i'll have to send you the numbers i don't know if it it seems like a lot of work for not a lot of output we'll see yeah i think that's probably true for a lot of airbnb right now i think the thing that is compelling to me is like we talked earlier about new platform stuff like hip camp and some of these other like camping platforms are exploding and again i think if you could like leverage capital build up the supply side and provide like you know water toiletries like all the basics um in locations that people actually want to camp at you could build a pretty material business and it again it like may not be a 10 billion dollar business but i think it would be a really solid side hustle and cash flow asset and it would require a lot less um a lot less like management and work than airbnb because at the end of the day you're [ __ ] camping like sorry you know it's not like the the stove burner doesn't work or the ac is off it's like a lot of [Laughter] when you were doing this what numbers were you bottling out yeah so i was mainly modeling it from like a noi basis which is net operating income which is like a term that's used a lot in real estate but basically i think that you could get like 30 to 40 percent cash on cash returns by following this strategy that sounds like the greatest thing ever why why haven't you done it because i am getting higher returns from my time elsewhere you know so whatever is this i would love to find someone to run somebody who's listening to this is like oh i'm the perfect guy for this i i i love camping i know i have camper i have a camper myself i'm in an area that's like a high demand thing for hip camp or auto camp or whatever um yeah great you be the operator we'll put up the cash we'll buy the rvs for you and you run the thing and let's split it so uh email me sean seanpury.com and then i'll loop in these guys and we will uh we will fund your we'll fund a a small rental business of of campers if anybody's in the location that does this because that's a great that's a great idea you're absolutely right they're basically tons of demand and they're supply constrained and so if you just build out more supply you're gonna get bookings and you're gonna get great returns off something yeah exactly and it's one of those things that's like that can scale really nicely these platforms are here to stay like there's a lot of venture dollars going into making these more of a thing i think that you could crush it on these platforms is it something i want to do full-time at this point in my career no but do i think someone younger who like cares about camping more than i do could really do well here like absolutely right um okay great that's a great idea what else you got uh alcohol baby let's talk about that yeah so near to my heart as a as a as a non-alcoholic beer drinker yeah so you know a couple uh earlier this year launched a company that i talked about shirley highshirtley.com s-u-r-e-l-y um but we're basically like we saw so much interest going into the non-alcohor space bud light bought three spots of the super bowl one was the seltzer spot the other was for bud light the other was for bud zero which is like the non elk thing is so interesting and like there's so much attention going towards it and we saw like a ton of really good non-elk beers with some really good like non-alex spirits options and nothing in the wine category and so we decided to build the first clean label really high quality non-alcoholic wine brand and wine company uh hired like real wine making talent and the like and we launched earlier this year and it's going uh going super well so how much did you uh by the way i want to brag i've been talking about this [ __ ] for like four years now have a nice shawn i don't know if that's a brag or really it's a it's a knock on you you had the inside he took the action he well i don't know i don't that's true that's true i mean yeah uh i'm just talking [ __ ] but so i think you were going to kind of ask him something like how much did you put in to start this basically how much of your money did you did you have to cede into making a venture like this happen yeah so i put in close to 100k to make this happen um and some portion of that was a loan that that i got out uh just as like revenue started to come in but yeah it was about 100k has been up not a lot that's great no yeah it's not a crazy thing that's a weekend for sam thank you um i feel i feel like um i feel like uh like it okay so if you're telling me you could start this with a hundred grand and how many hours a week are you working on this uh to get it spun up i mean it was much more like hiring the right contractors and people so it was five ten maybe okay i feel like there's a world where this like let's be conservative i feel like there's a like this is very clearly a 10 million a year thing that makes 2 million in profit right like like it could definitely be way bigger but i feel like that's a relatively light i'd be disappointed forward and hit that mark right that's kind of what you're saying yeah yeah that would happen expectations at least yeah so right like and let's give me let's give it six years to do that let's go let's grow slow uh i feel like that's like a it's pretty sure fire away you're going to get that would you you agree uh yeah i certainly do and so if that was the case right a dc brand like that can sell for like 1x revenue let's say so you could turn 100k investment and let's call it even 20 hours a week for for a year to spin it up to you you turned 100k into basically you know 10 million bucks worth of of total equity value in term in terms of the company in that case i don't even think it'll take six years i think that's two two years yeah i'm being like ultra yeah i agree um but yeah i mean that's the basic thing where are the other opportunities in the space that you when you're researching yeah i mean i there's a ton right like i think that we're at this generational shift where people you know 10 years ago everyone was like let's go out maybe this is just me getting older i don't know but all of my friends were like let's go out to the bars and get really drunk now all my friends are like let's have one glass of wine and then like have a great long dinner and or try you know or not drink it all right and instead young people i don't young people i don't think drink yeah it's it's becoming much more common shockingly that's what i'm saying like the gen z is like like uh it's not as common like when the second i could drive have you heard sam's gen z analysis that he does is his trends analysis on gen z he's like they don't have sex they don't drink it they're depressed but they're really cool looking what do you see what do you call them yeah they're really cool they got they got nice teeth they always wear vans and they like they always have like proper fittings what color do they like what do i say like red or millennials you can have like a really sweeping generalization for that it's like the truth like they all have like sick ass haircuts um it's true they all got like amazing i mean cut right now he's looking he's looking gen z dude the young people i'm saying they they don't they don't have they don't have a lot of sex not nearly as much as before and they just even with all that teeth and hair they can't they're not having sex what's going on dude i don't know well testosterone is down 50 over the last like 40 years that's right yeah maybe that's it it's like this is something there's something going on here and they also don't like alcohol like it's a health thing or i don't know what it is but they don't drink yeah i mean i i honestly think one of the reasons i'm bullish on the non-ox space is like we're getting to the point where they're just better drugs like if people want to you know alter their state of consciousness i'm seeing a lot more friends that are like opting into cannabis or ketamine or some of the you know psychedelics or some of these other things that don't give you the hangover don't give you the 30 extra pounds over a year of heavy drinking like i just think people are opting for for different sorts of compounds different heights to give them the experience they want yeah exactly i tried that recess drink you guys tried that the yeah kind of like carbonated drink great branding amazing branding i would say drink tastes like [ __ ] and didn't do anything so i was like well i'm out on that one but i love the idea of it i kind of wish it if we just if they just put lacroix in that can i'd feel amazing i'd be like yeah this is the best this is the future uh but instead you know they tried their own thing um what are some businesses that you're like you mentioned testosterone we invested in this testosterone replacement company because we were like that same which one uh it's called peak or they're just rebranding to hone but basically it's at home direct consumer you know testing for your t levels and then when you get tested and it's if it's low you're they'll there's like a telemedicine doctor who will be like hey by the way if you want this to go up you know like there are some solutions that we can offer you basically they have their own you've not heard of that justin i've heard of trt i didn't i didn't heard of like peak or home it's basically right it's like trt i'm ready to throw six letters yeah you don't believe in it it's real yeah yeah maybe that's not a well said thing but i tend to think that some of these things it's like you know your testosterone levels are low it's like okay the reason that they're low is some inputs from your environment are not healthy and so rather than trying to fix the symptom like you should try and fix the environment but what are the biggest inputs you can change to to boost testosterone from your opinion i i think diet sleep uh in like inflammation and then also trying to cut out like endocrine disrupting hormones uh which are i think like a horrifying thing that not a lot of people are talking about what does that talk about so different uh plastics compounds like you've heard of like bpa-free and all these sorts of things um the whole class of something called phthalates which is p h t p t h l a t e s um that effectively have like a really strong negative impact on one's testosterone ones like endocrine and hormonal systems and they're that are in like everything they're so avoiding like or they're from something else uh yeah a lot of plastics yeah um so these are like synthetic materials that are just in like water plastics food packaging uh creams that you use like they're all they're they're everywhere so what's something you do lifestyle wise that i'd be like dude why are you doing that um like i went to my friend's house one time and he instead of using toothpaste he was like he dipped his toothbrush in like this powder and started brushing his teeth i was like hey man what the [ __ ] is that because he's always like three steps ahead in health and like products and so any at first i used to judge him and now i'm like oh am i killing myself by using toothpaste should i be using this powder [ __ ] and like you know what are those what would yours be can i guess justin can i get yeah i guess um do you use a microwave no no i didn't think okay um yeah but like you go out of your way to not use a microwave right yeah yeah okay do you um you definitely only have glass tupperware correct yeah for sure um what else is there uh um do you uh i i've got a few more i i've got a few more i can peg you but you're telling me i got this like 19 step home water filtration thing installed at my house that's like the metal one it's like 25 feet tall and in this outside it's insane it's outdoors uh the plumbers yeah yeah they they're at every step so there's one other sink there's one outside that like filtered all the home water the guys came in to install it they're like we have never seen anyone install something like this um but yeah so i have that set up that i just recently got the tupperware stuff uh pretty diet cautious in general um are you super ripped i can't see your neck up here are you like okay no he's lean yeah you're lean you're like ten percent body fat right i'll send you a p-spot photo yeah i need it i need to pee well i've seen you without a shirt like you're not like uh like huge but you're like you look like a like a soccer player right who's more fit you're a justin uh it depends on what we're talking about who is do you aspire more for your body or for his body go uh i would pref right now i prefer to be leaner and skinnier so i'm trying to lose fat and look a little bit more like his body all right great all right so you have the insane water filtration system and what is that by the way what's the name of it uh it is called the radiant life i think but there's another one john do you saw the people i i do i have a song do you like a definite song in my backyard is it infrared or is it uh no it's the uh yeah it's like the the hot stone one and like red lights on your toes or something in the morning what do you what do you do anything with any kind of light uv anything no i try to get outside i mean it this is one of those things that i think is like there's some people that i think over optimize where they're like oh i need more light exposure so i'm going to stay inside and like shine red light on my stuff and i'm like just outside do you only use zero drop shoes no what is that i did for a while i just didn't really what is a zero drop shoe basically shoes with no heel yeah most shoes have some type of uh like yeah but like a lot of people believe that that ruins your achilles and hurts your calves um and a bunch and ruins your posture um do you um uh do you only eat meat from salt and thyme i try to when i can it's the best meat in austin for sure where do you get your meat from uh so i now i eat most of my meat is from salt and time or stuff that i've hunted or a friend has hunted i love it this is awesome okay great did we miss any other ones any other good uh like sort of self i don't what do we even call these uh well look i i think what we're teasing but there is truth in this like guys who are on the cutting edge and things that we joke and laugh at i believe that's going to be normal uh you know like totally like i remember like years ago i i got into this hobby uh about raw denim which is like a at the time it was like super nerdy and everyone made fun of me and it didn't get entirely mainstream but a little bit mainstream it got quite uh popular um and and that was um that's kind of like what we're talking about here so like i remember years ago people were talking about ayahuasca and i was like what the [ __ ] is that and now like i know so many people that are doing this stuff so totally uh oh and dan said you use non-stick pans you definitely you don't use non-stick pans for sure i could tell that yeah i use a ceramic set or cast iron yeah yeah that that's an easy one but anyway go ahead what was the answer were you gonna are there any other things that we can learn from how you live yeah i mean i i think that like cutting out things that are causes of inflammation or the obvious ones it's like don't microwave stuff in plastic try and like buy stuff that is overly not overly processed and packaged uh and i think actually like avoiding vegetable oils is a tremendous tremendous thing that like you said about raw denim or ayahuasca um you know five years from now 10 years from now a lot of people are going to be way more conscious about vegetable oils and the damage that they specifically like compound called linoleic acid in there um that the damage that does to like your inflammation what will they use instead olive oil or peanut oil or yeah i mean hopefully olive oil avocado oil animal fats lard ghee butter stuff like that coconut oil do you want to talk about uh you wanna talk about one or two more of these sean or what uh yeah let's do let's do you pick you pick the topic let's do one more topic oh i know i was going to ask you really quick all these things that you're doing there's like no microwave all this stuff do you actually feel a difference or um is it is it like these all long term or is there any short term pleasure and that i can get out of these like do you feel different yeah so i the way that i think about this is like from a baseline standpoint uh you know if you if you have a pretty high baseline like imagine you're super strong it's going to be really hard for you to notice if you're a bodybuilder if you're putting on like one percent you know two pounds of muscle or something if you already if you're already like weighing 225 um so i think that i have a pretty high like health baseline and so a lot of these things are more preventative and not like oh my god i feel amazing uh you know whereas i felt like [ __ ] the other day but for i think the average person like if your baseline is relatively low you want to lose like or average you want to lose weight you're not sleeping well um you know your stress hormones are all over the place a lot of these interventions like you'll feel a material difference after like 20 or 30 days i think there's a world to build like a wire cutter version of this so for example like you're saying a lot of stuff and my friend my best friend jack is into all this stuff and and when i stay at his house and i visit him and so that's how i like i see how he lives and jack's really honest and i'll say he takes all these supplements i go do any of these do anything and he goes no like i don't feel any different um and like a guy like you i imagine you actually care about longevity and also you just like to tinker and you like trying gadgets you know i like training gadgets as well i just want to like see the latest and greatest it's fun to experiment i would love but but the issue is is that someone like you like or not you but some of the folks in your world like they can get a little woo-woo and i'm like i don't know if they're like talking about [ __ ] crystals or if this is actually gonna make a difference in my life it's really hard to know like uh if like this actually truly is meaningful i wish and i went to peter peter atiya's blog about this as well to learn about fitness and he talks about so much stuff about fitness and diet and i'm like just give me the if you just do this life will be a little bit better and you're 80 there yeah i think there's a big opportunity for that i think that one of the problems is like if you're an influencer you're going to get way more attention and interest from people when you talk about butthole sunning than you are about like eat a healthy diet you know what i mean like yeah totally like i think that's the point what's that mean same thing you've never seen this article the same it went like super viral basically i'll send you a bunch of naked people we're going out like they're tanning but then they raise their legs above their heads so that the sun goes directly into their butt and they're like you know never felt better you know the sun's energy right into your fourth eye do we want to go over one more thing or two more things what do you want to do it's your call well we can't end on butthole somebody's yeah i guess i guess that will probably leave for bad taste so i've got an interesting you you have something interesting and i want to so i've got a friend named nick you know nick ray i bet and nick um he he jokes about it but he's being serious he matches with girls on tinder or whatever app he uses and he calls them for a pre-screening for a date he's like let's just talk to each other because he's nick's uh he just wants to get down to business like do we want to date or not and he calls them and one of the questions he asks sean right away is what's your credit history or uh like do you have debt um and odd here justin has he goes i think i could create a dating app that based off your credit card history um but this wasn't just to be clear it's not your credit rating he's talking about not like i only want a very rich credit worthy people it's more like if i know what you're going to be rich or whatever what he's saying is i want to look at your purchase history basically the stuff you buy if you shop at whole foods if you go to the gym if you don't whatever you go to the bar you ring up a bill that'll tell us how compatible we are that was your idea yeah exactly and are you dating right now are you single uh i am recently engaged personally and if you matched you and your fiancee's bills up before you got engaged would would you have been a good match great fit great fit yeah for sure i think that like where you spend your resources tells a lot about someone that a hinge profile doesn't and so i suspect if like you were to say hey we are matching the two of you up because you spend an absurd amount of your income at this like weird butcher shop in austin or at whole foods like we're probably going to get along you know or at least have a higher odds of doing that from a lifestyle compatibility standpoint than than hinge does you know sam what do you think all right let's do yeah i mean i mean i i think no this would work i think this is one of those things that people say i think we're gonna give that one a no but i enjoy that you said it yeah like i think my opinion is like when it comes to dating um you really just like you want to optimize for getting laid quickly i think like regardless if that's what people admit or not but like they just want to get to like date one so they can get in bed uh for step two and i think that really people like they say they like so um uh when we had our roommate matching app i don't know if you could actually vouch for if you saw this on your end people said they wanted this they wanted that they wanted this and then they would meet someone and they're like nah [ __ ] it like i'll just do it uh right like and so i think the same with dating you say you want to do this you want to do that but then if i show you like a person who you just think is attractive even though you had all these rules uh you're gonna say ah all right whatever let's just do it yeah yeah no i think that's probably true i think this probably would be better as a like matchmaking service than a broad-based dating app right and and then we'll let's let's wrap up with the one that we've actually talked about before about this automation officer yeah let's do it um basically i think with the rise of no code tools virtual assistants all this sort of stuff like i think the average company and we do this at my company could just be 30 more productive like we we have basically one virtual assistant hire for every two people that we have that are on the team and we give them like a training that's like here's how to use virtual assistants get all of the repetitive stuff off your plate and i just wish i could hire someone to do that as a service where like he or she sits in product meetings or marketing or logistics team [ __ ] and it's just like we're gonna automate these five pieces and just continually does that across the company where did you learn that from who that's so so interesting to give va's to every two people yeah uh i just started doing it when we started the company i think that's pretty amazing right how did you learn the how to how to manage a va what you can use them for what you can where did you learn that part obviously but like what was the spark yeah when i when i left um when i left like the company i was working with terry at we got acquired and then i was kind of like starting to do my own stuff on the side and was like okay i want to try and scale myself uh to do more stuff on the side so like originally hired va is to help with responding to airbnb requests and then view me requests and then like slowly got them more integrated into my life i love it and did you take a course or something like where did you this training that you have for for your employees is that modeled off something or what uh no we we basically like we have some internal documents that myself and other people on the team have written up around how to leverage virtual assistants and we just do that you should uh publish this yeah i feel like that's i think you're kind of like this you're not dismissing this but you're kind of like brushing over this i feel like that's actually one of the more interesting things that i've learned today i think that's actually pretty amazing i've had a lot of people ask me for this and i actually suck at using va's and don't really use them but i know i should uh and could do more and this is one of if i kind of like pinged the audience i was like all right if i could teach you anything that you think like what do you think i could teach you that i know that that you want to know and surprisingly this was like number five on that list and so i plan to eventually a learn it myself and better so that i can like offer this others but i was very surprised to see that on the top list of things people wanted to learn that they felt like they were just curious about and they felt that there was value there but they didn't know how to unlock it that's interesting yeah i mean maybe this is something that i should publish at some point and i don't know how much do you what what how much budget do you allocate is it like two grand a month per two people or what we yeah we probably about that like call it like 10-ish grand across like the whole company so you what do you guys have you have 20 people we have 33. dude that's pretty sick how you've kept it like relatively small for i yeah i have no intel i would imagine your revenue is in the 60 million range if i had to guess um and that's pretty a lean mean team for how value how much value that is definitely and i think the va piece is a big part of it like we just have a very efficient team that's pretty focused on getting stuff done that they uniquely can do and the va's are super helpful with the rest well dude this is sick man i i can't see sean's face i can't see where he's going yeah my camera overheats uh this is a recurring problem i moved it all i moved my whole setup inside for this but then i also got two babies inside so i thought all right do i want to risk babies crying or my camera over here guaranteed camera overheat and i chose the camera justin do you want to promote yourself where do you want where do you want people to go to i a lot of people are gonna listen to this so uh what your.com your twitter where are you gonna what are you gonna pin yeah so probably my twitter i'm at jw mares uh or you know my website justinmers.com i have a monthly newsletter that i send out where i talk about various things i think about health business and whatever else is kind of on my mind um that seems like people like i think sam you like it too right yeah i'm looking at your stuff now i'm a subscriber i get your it's not a sub stack it's just a blog right uh yeah but i have a monthly newsletter that is on substance but yeah that's right i i get your emails in my uh thing or in my email and i i message you about it i'm like oh i just saw your airbnb thing i'm because i actually want to do that i think that's sick i think that'd be a great way to finance uh like a a pretty large bit of land i think that's fun i went go i went shooting i went to this place out in texas where you shoot guns and then afterwards you go and ride atvs and it was like i was in heaven i was like this is just the most fun i could possibly have i have to go and buy a place so i can do this all the time it's awesome uh what are you gonna say sean uh i was gonna say justin i gotta give you the compliment i'll give your blog is that your your content is so good it made me question i was like is this guy really like a good entrepreneur or is this like because like usually like there's some people who are truly great at putting out content and truly great at doing actually like walking the walk and doing the doing the business side have actually done it themselves they're not just like studying others and writing content but often what you'll find is that people are good at one i know a bunch of amazing business people who don't want to or suck at creating content and i know some great content people that i'm like once i meet them i'm like oh you've this is what this is your business you've never done a business outside of this content business and uh so then when i found out that you were good at both i was like okay you know props to you for both but that's how good the content was that it made me made me do the research and say is this is this guy legit or what i appreciate that i'm definitely not good at like the content business side of things or posting frequently but i i like really enjoy putting it out gonna do this yeah you've been doing it for years i'm looking at your site now i'm reading your 2020 review i just clicked off central athlete because you talked about central athlete i mean it seems like you've been doing this for years so i mean that's consistent definitely i like it but in small doses not as a full-time thing all right great we should wrap it up um dude thanks for coming on this was fun yeah you're like a perfect fit for like the type of audience that we have they're going to love i think the content that you uh the ideas and stuff you shared so that was great thank you thanks for having me on guys this is fun i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to never looking back

he's ever heard of second we break down the sweepstake business if you want to make a company that makes like half a million dollars a month in profit and you want to have it start and launch inside the next probably two years like uh or sorry two months and then grow in the next one two three years to half a million dollars a month and profit i think this is an interesting idea we break it down and then we talk about sean's prediction so he predicts what's going to be the next apple facebook amazon 711 netflix pornhub dominoes those are all separate predictions not one company can do all of

yeah i don't know who style this is but that's the style we got today have you ever thought about creating a uh brick and mortar business by the way oh wait actually first two things two things before we get into anything everybody like and subscribe and tell a friend tell five friends yes but um wednesday do we have a guest on wednesday i don't think so okay uh yes we do oh okay damn it okay not this wednesday on monday after that let's do the investor episode we have another yes we have a guest on monday too yeah dan held is coming out on monday all right so we got two guests okay then we're gonna do it fine didn't forget that second thing i have this episode coming out you know i've been doing these monday things yeah so what i'm doing is i'm splicing together clips i'm gonna splice together like five to ten and i'm gonna talk in between each one and each clip is gonna be from a youtube video or from a podcast and the topic is uh i'm i'm i'm obsessed with time right now because i'm quite impatient and i'm trying to work on it and the topic is on actually patience and how like great things that i admire actually took much longer than i thought right and so you so what what is okay so if i listen to this episode what am i gonna get i'm gonna get sam talking about time yeah and you gotta turn your mic down a little bit um no so what you're gonna get is you're going to get me um so you all right so uh travis kalanick before he started uber he had this thing called red swoosh you know what that was uh i don't even know what it did but i've heard the story i don't even know what it did either to be honest it was a peer-to-peer it was like it's not relevant anymore because it was like napster but it was like napster but different and he sold it for like 20 million dollars but it took like eight years or something like that like crazy and i and i found that i have this amazing youtube um video of him giving a talk like a 40-minute talk but like the first like three minutes is about red swoosh and it's like he explains how hard it was i'm like oh my god that took forever and i've got like eight or nine of those clips that i've saved of people admire saying they're gonna take a lot it's taking a long time and i'm putting them together so it's a however long the podcast is going to be with like two to three minute clips with me like making it give you the background of each story right okay uh i like it so we'll see if it's interesting so have you ever seen um the joe rogan thing where it's like joe joe rogan watches the internet or something like that have you ever seen these youtube videos no but is it good yeah they're funny it's like it's a compilation of basically joe watching youtube videos and just reacting to them uh but all the videos are really interesting kind of like random ass stuff from the internet and then his reaction is like good he's not trying to be like super over the top it's like his genuine genuine reaction to it so i kind of see this as like the business version of that where you're taking one theme and then you see what a bunch of different interesting people have said about that theme and it's sort of like sam surfs the internet where you're gonna like kind of go into and out of each of those clips and just be talking we'll see if it's any good so in in over the next couple days if you have an example of a talk that you've listened to or a story that amazed you send it to me okay sounds good by the way you said something about travis atlantic have you ever read this blog post he did called like um how to do south by southwest on a budget or something like that you know what i'm talking about yeah so he had this old c yes maybe which i do which i don't even think you could find in a blog anymore and he basically wrote like uh you know if you show up at this time you can get free this uh you can get a discounted cab if you do x y and z right yeah like he was like being pretty scrappy and like saving like pitching pennies right yeah exactly it was i think it was like ces or south by southwest and he was basically like yo if you're going to these things here's how to do it like here's how to ball out on a budget and then he had all those little like tips and tricks of like you don't need to get vip pass to go here just wear like an orange vest and then you could walk through you know that type of thing yeah he was like scrappy yeah so i was just listening to this podcast uh theo von the theo von podcast i don't even know what it's called and he had the founder of raising canes on there do you know what raising canes is yeah dude i've met the founder of raisin canes at a random i was at a table i was eating lunch one day and the founder was was right next to me and you just said uh what's up or i mean yeah i was like hey well you know this is kind of like this old it was a it was a restaurant conference so it wasn't like super random uh but there's just kind of this nice all nice you know like slightly older southern guy uh i think he was the owner of the fountain of the ceo um well there's two guys who started it one of them is about 50 but he looks quite young maybe it's the other guy and i was listening to this podcast with him he's southern lives in louisiana and they have hundreds of restaurants at this point and north of a billion dollars in sales and he the way that he makes makes it sound he's like i just loved running the fryer i loved being at the place it sounds so much and the grass is always greener it sounds so much more fun than sitting behind a computer have you ever thought about doing this what way well how is that more fun sitting have you ever been in a restaurant back you know like the back that kitchen of a restaurant next to the family i was i was like shitty i was a bus boy i was a bus boy and i i i was never old enough to be a waiter but yeah i worked in the service industry it is fun just like being in the being being in the action it just sounded cool so would you ever do a brick and mortar or like a i did and i regretted every second of it um you know the the part that is fun actually is the camaraderie because that's what i'm saying the kitchen crew this the bond is different than like just your normal friends or like your co-workers like if you go to your office today and you have a co-worker who sits you know three desks down and both you have your headphones on and you're typing on your mac you know you have and you go to you go get your free lunch together at the cafeteria like this is the tech industry right it's like totally different vibe than you're in the restaurant it's friday night the restaurant's rocking you're banging out orders as fast as you can and you um you know it's 1am when you're finally done cleaning up and it's like all right now let's go eat and then you know you go to some restaurant and the restaurants close but they let you in because you're from the restaurant industry and you get to go eat with them like that's just a different level of comrade yeah that's what i'm saying it's exciting it's fun you're in the thick of it i love it yeah but i would never want to do it again it's like it's like you know when people are like yeah going to the army was one of my most uh you know formidable times it's like would you ever want to go back again through that boot camp through hell week again like just so you know i've i read this book called tribe and it's all the because i was curious about what type of neighborhood would be best to live in and like what makes what makes you happy when finding a place to live and it's a it's you know i don't know this i've never been in the military but so i know from like an academic story point of view that when you're in the military a lot of guys a huge amount of guys when they get out they miss it like crazy because they're like all right it was hard i was risking my life yeah that's true but i felt like i had a crew of guys we were always doing something i had a mission and i and life is so lame and boring without it yeah i i could see that but um also there's a lot of people when you talk to him it's like man that was the best and hardest time my life would i go back and do it again no i don't want to do it again but it was an amazing time at that time and uh you know this sort of like when astronauts come back from space is what you're describing it's like yeah they're kind of like well now what i you know i freaking went to the moon that was my life mission and now every day seems quite boring and like you know uneventful and not not really having a purpose as i did before um but anyways i guess like brick and mortar so what you know what would you want to do if you were doing brick and mortar i think i could crush a i think i could i could i could operate a hotel or a restaurant really well hospitality yeah i think i could crush that and i and maybe i will want to do that one day i but i think i can kill it i'm looking at buying another house and turning it into a rental um because i already did it with this one um and i'm seeing one later today but i think i could crush it and what uh okay okay uh so i was gonna say what was theo vaughn talk about so theo von was just he just interviewed the guy okay gotcha um all right yeah i wouldn't uh i'm more like even with e-commerce i'm like ah this business is great except for all the physical products like you know right now there's a situation going on where um i think i forgot what the exact tweet is but it's sort of like the there's boats or you know everyone saw that that one boat got stuck in the canal yeah like feeling you're like feeling the the pain now well it's not really that there's just like another situation where the biggest port in china is backed up and uh they're just like there was a covet outbreak and so for a week they were operating at 30 capacity and this is like the biggest throughput uh like logistics place in um in the world and so the knock-on effects of that are gonna like last i don't know like months basically and so basically what you're seeing now is that boats couldn't get out on time they were just idling in the water and uh brian peterson who we're gonna have on the pod because he tweeted this out he goes you know it's crazy the average you know wait time now or the average number of boats that's waiting is blah blah and i asked him i go i tweeted back i said what's the cost per day of that boat just sitting idle right with all this cargo on top and just sitting in the water not being unloaded and he did the math he's like it's about a million dollars a day that the shipping company is losing just by being stuck and then for all the downstream people like you know if i have my goods on a [ __ ] on a boat that's not here well now i'm delayed now i'm out of inventory and because i'm out of inventory i'm out of sales and there's just one after another sort of like knock-on effects of this and so for me even e-commerce which is pretty pretty like internety is uh like the you know the only bad part about it is all these physical goods like oh you had a product but then uh the wheels are broken or the zippers are the customer's understanding of that at all like like when i like i'm so now i do amazon you know two day delivery one day delivery whatever it is but if something it comes like in seven or ten days i think i'm mostly cool with it right um maybe uh during covid people were understanding because it was just like dude it's covered like everything is backed up and if this is not like a mission critical thing then uh you know then i understand but like people's kind of covered patients wore off i think and um and also if not everything is backed up it's just your stuff then you look really bad and you know business even if it's not even if they understand like you lose sales and losing like two weeks of sales is like pretty devastating for your month's revenue which is like you know uh pretty bad for your your annual revenue when you're operating on like 10 15 percent ebitda and so so yeah by the way the tweet was five and a half percent of the world's container fleet is waiting outside of a port and then he said i asked what is the cost per day to be waiting idle he goes one trip round trip from asia on one of these shipping boats is 50 million of profit so every every day that they're sitting out you know sitting sitting idle and it's a 30 day trip and so you know so that's about a million dollars per day per ship that's idle and then i was like holy [ __ ] these ships make 50 million in profit for a single round trip from asia and uh and then you know people are replying people who know about the shipping industry they're like yeah it's crazy like the top um the top 10 shipping companies will make like 100 billion in profit this year um but like in the last 10 years they've lost 100 billion in profit like it's it's a very volatile volatile funnel space based on you know volumes and costs and all the stuff like right now a shipping container is twice as much as it was last year just because supply demand is so out of whack that's crazy i'm excited to have him on and so we'll nerd out with him about that so you want to talk about some ideas we have a bunch here we where where do you want to start so some of the some of the ideas that i wrote down so i wrote down two i think i said i have i have three one is oasis which i think is one of the biggest startup ideas most most interesting startup ideas out there uh nuggs which isn't the fake chicken nugget market and i have some thoughts around that and then i have a prediction section where i'm gonna predict what the next facebook amazon google and netflix will look like and so uh those are my uh actually i have another one but maybe we'll save that one for the next pod so those are my three you could do today let's do oasis carp oasis giveaway business and predictions all right sounds good so oasis so you know what this is but i think most almost everybody 99 of people listening to this have no idea what this is so let me explain the the concept i um i'll tell the story of how i bumped into this guy i was on twitter and i saw this guy matt and he was teasing kind of like you know people do this on twitter where they have like my stealth thing is kind of coming or they post a screenshot or like a gif it's kind of ambiguous but it looks interesting it looks provocative or they're just retweeting people i think this is what i saw he had retweeted our mutual friend sikhi who was like dude just got an oasis demo mind blown this is the future and so he retweeted that and i'm like okay hook line and sinker like tell me about like how do i get that demo i also would like my mind blown and he's like all right yeah hop into zoom so i hopped into a zoom and he showed me something that was honestly pretty mind blowing and what it was was he was like okay so i'm talking to you on zoom right now here's my face and um but you know the problem with zoom is that you always got to look good uh and people get you know people get um nervous about that and so you know over 60 of people don't actually turn their camera on in north america because they're self-conscious of how they look and um that kind of sucks so now we're video calling without the video right and he's like so what if instead you could have a representation of you that wasn't like cartoony it's not like an emoji or an animoji or whatever the apple thing is it literally looks like you and we'll show a screenshot of this um on the screen if you're watching on our youtube channel which is just youtube.com hustlecon you'll see the video of this it's kind of amazing so the video the gift that i want to show is it says never worry about how you look on camera again and it's a video of the founder matt he's in the shower holding up his phone and on the left side is what he actually looks like it's a dude in the shower um and on the right side is like the digital representation of it it's him but he doesn't look like he's in the shower he looks like him like in front of a perfect backdrop just talking and it's tracking his mouth perfectly and um so i thought oh this is kind of amazing like if i could be on video without actually having to be on video if i could kind of like a filter but if i could just automatically have the best looking version of myself on camera god that would save me a lot of time and energy and thought around how i look and he's like it gets even better so not only does it let you do that you could also show up as a different person so say you're you know a minority you don't want to be discriminated against you could you could show yourself as you know a tall white male and nobody would ever know what you actually look like so this empowers like working synonymously which is something we've talked about the last thing is he's like here's the best bit this works on like the worst connections uh worst connection phones in the world i said well how do you do that it seems like pretty high powered he goes there's no video being transferred i said what he goes yeah it's like a video game the screen on my side is tracking my face every pixel of my face how my lips are moving my nose my eyes etc and then instead of sending my video across the internet it just sends how those pixels are moving like a video game and so then on the other side it recreates the video just using those pixel coordinates and so the idea here is that even on really shitty internet low bandwidth scenarios you could have awesome looking video and without you having to like you you could be rolling out of bed and you look like a million bucks so what do you think of this idea i think i was pitched this as well and i passed did you did you pass or no uh yeah i didn't even really get i i have a call schedule with the guy i just saw the demo this was months and months ago it wasn't like in an investable spot at that moment um or like they weren't raising or something like that but i'm looking at it now you know it does have a higher valuation and you know it's pretty it's got a very high valuation i i don't know are we is i don't let's not say okay um it's got a high valuation um and it's like six guys working on this it's pretty wild and i so here's what here's what i think about this i think the way the way that it's set up now is not the way that it could be a huge thing okay and what you mean so a lot of times when i either invest in stuff or i want to get involved in a project whether i'm starting it or not i'm very comfortable taking the leap of faith of saying this is just how i'm gonna start and i'm very comfortable in saying one of two things i know how it's going to end or rather like i want to create a massive media company that covers this this and this i'm going to start with an email i don't know the middle ground but i'm i'm pretty confident i'm going to figure it out or i'm also okay with not even having an ending point of like i created something cool it feels powerful and strong yeah i think i could figure it out where to go and this business i think was that second one so i saw the technology i played with it i got the demo and he basically was talking to me and i i got it i was like oh okay so like to me this is like pretty like unlimited unlimited on what the options are and so the bet i'm having to make is is this founder great and can they figure out exactly how to deploy this technology and i wasn't sure if i i wasn't sure if it was worth trying to figure out if they could get it yeah well also the price matters right so like that's why i'm saying you don't want to pay a i figured it out price when they haven't figured it out yet right you want to pay the oh this is cool and promising price which should be like 10 times lower uh but i get why this has a high valuation because to me you see something like zoom zoom is a 100 billion dollar company zoom is letting you call um you know do do video calls with people all around the internet for business purposes i think that the future zoom like the leapfrog of zoom is not zoom with slightly better features or the recording is better the audio quality is a little better it's this is a video call where i don't actually have to be on video but it looks like i'm on video everybody looks great everybody's presenting their professional self regardless of how they actually look at home and secondly this works on extremely low bandwidth shitty internet uh circumstances because it's not even transferring video it's just transferring pixel coordinates that to me is like a leapfrog and that means what does if zooms 100 billion today and somebody built what i believe if you did this it would be a better zoom um obviously doesn't have the network effects doesn't have the brand doesn't have many things that you need to do to get it big but it has the magic trick and i think when you have a magic trick you can get a lot of users pretty quickly and the magic trick here is pretty impressive we were both pretty impressed with the magic but it sounds like we're saying the same thing but i guess my difference would be i think i know what the endpoint looks like the endpoint looks like this is how business calls are done you have your dude that's not that big is that that big of a market i don't i disagree with you i don't know man if i was this i'd be using this for movies or for you know i actually don't even know what i would use it for but i can't imagine business calls would be the number one thing dude zoom is massive zoom is like humongous right 100 billion dollar company how much bigger do you want right one trillion okay you can get to a trillion but this you're not making zoom this is a plug-in for zoom i think you could make the new zoom using this right why would i use zoom when instead i could use this where i always look like a million bucks already it's better than zoom and the second thing is it works better on any internet conditions because it's not transferring heavy video across the wire regardless i'm into this i'm into this i just was unwilling to bet my own money at that high of evaluation yeah i think that's totally fair uh the the reason this stuck out to me was i was like i had this doc i've talked about before which is called the biggest idea in my head right now which is basically if i was totally free i could drop everything i was doing and i was going to work on the biggest startup idea in my head at any given month what is it and i just keep track month by month and sometimes it's the same for two months straight three months straight and sometimes it changes this became the biggest startup idea in my head because i think it's basically taking novel technology going after a really big market and it's doing it in a way that is like complete like the incumbents would have to sort of re-architect their whole [ __ ] to be able to do this i think i don't think you could just make a plug-in to do this and so um so anyways i thought this was like one of the bigger ideas so i just wanted to bring it up i don't really have any more besides that all right let's move on then you want to talk about something that's way less of a big idea but a surefire way to make a lot of money yes okay let's talk about the giveaway business also known as the sweepstake business and i'm interested in this business because well because i've used it a lot because it seems easy and awesome and you've done it you've dabbled yeah so with the hustle one way that we we grew we grew in a bunch of ways but we did two things that are related to this the first we would pay companies or i'll start with this one the first we would give stuff away we would give a tesla away we would give a 3d printer away which we're giving now and if you share an email or you get other people to join like and they use your unique url you get more entries and if a car costs us 30 000 and we acquire 30 000 emails that's a dollar to acquire an email that's a really good deal for us because we make let's say 10 off every email no brainer the second thing that we did is we paid some of these companies and i want to explain how they work so do me a favor and go to bold.org can you do that right now okay i'm on it what's this fighting student debt that's it yeah and how does it say it does it um let's see so scholarships philanthropy i don't know it just looks like donations or something like that right so what you do and because they may get all click um scholarships for uh nursing or something okay uh scholarship for nursing students i'm there five great scholarships for future nurses great all right so bold.org what they do is they go and they get they they either create scholarships or they find people uh who uh have scholarships and they aggregate it into one area into one platform not that hard to do and it's in itself then what they do is they go get loads of people to sign up for the scholarship so they advertise to nurses and nursing facebook groups on google and they get people to sign up and and enter all this information um and here's how they make money when you are a nurse or let's say you're uh applying to get your mba if you have tens of thousands of people apply to get their an mba scholarship that's a pretty cool pretty high qualified lead list right right same with nurses same with i mean pretty much any of these niches and what they do is as you sign up for this thing at the end they go also do you want to opt in for this this or this or this and companies like the hustle i would pay them money i think at one point we were paying them maybe 50 to 100 a month and that's how many leads that they were getting us that's amazing so so basically they go they pay for so they they go and they spend money to get people to apply for a scholarship and people are like oh fantastic thank you so much and then when they're applying they're basically like hey would you like to opt in now why does a person want to opt in or is it like hey do this and you get some increased odds of the scholarship or how does it work i believe both yeah so like they just like show offers that are interesting and also uh i believe it's just like it's you're automatically in unless you opt out in the flow and you get more likelihood if you opt into stuff dude how did you even find this how did you think oh you know what i'm gonna go like when you you were trying to make the connection between sweepstakes and giveaways and you're like go to bull.org this like non-profit looking you know scholarships for nurses in africa i was like what does this have to do with how did you even figure out this is how you grow an email so i'll there's a bunch of ways that i know how to do this the first there's this guy named dennis gross who we're gonna have to get on this podcast so dennis started wisegeek which you and i are both probably too young to have used it but it was like a web 1.0 thing it made a lot of money and then he started loads of other things including uh investing into lots of different startups like thumbtack but then he started bestreviews.com do you remember that or do you know what best reviews.com is it sold for 160 million dollars the tribune like three or four years ago so this guy named dennis he's very very wealthy and he started loads of companies and he stays way below the radar and he created this thing called mechanism which is like an idea lab except he's like an seo guru and like a lead gen guru so he's launched all these companies and the co-founder of mechanism is brendan who's the founder of toptal and i'm friends with both of those guys and i saw what they're getting into and he pitched me and sold me on using bold.org and it was pretty good right so that's first i can't find this guy dennis gross is that his name go to bold.org about he spells his name d-i-n-i-s space g-r-o-s-z gotcha okay so he's oh he actually did bold okay so that's how you found out so here's where here's here's what i'm getting at here so this got me interested into giveaways actually you have to call them sweepstakes there's a lot of legality around this and so what what i learned was you and we when we did sweepstakes we would have to call it sweepstakes you have to have rules that are approved by your lawyer and i got kind of interesting it's like uh you could buy entries or if you just mail us this form we have to let you apply we have to give you the equivalent entry right so it's like there's all types of technicalities here you can't make it but pay to play otherwise it's like a lottery or and you can't uh yeah it can't be a lottery you can't now i don't this is just an example i don't know if this is actually the rule you can't use the word like free or you can't do like there's a bunch of like technicality stuff that you have to follow but i got in uh very interested in giveaways and so i did some research on a bunch of them so there's loads of giveaway businesses the there's uh three ways that i've seen it work the first you buy entries so i've seen um like buythishouse.com i believe it's called or buy buy san francisco home.com where a company buys a san francisco house then they put ads all over the subway they put ads all over the billboard and they sell entries for a hundred dollars and it's a raffle the second way that this business works is you do it bold bold did which is the audience is the product and you sell their information uh you know those cars that are at malls yeah okay so what happens at those businesses is they they pay them all the uh a marketing part company pays the mall a rental fee to use that real estate space right yeah then loads of people enter their information to join and buy that car they look at the all the leads and names now that they have the birth date things like that and they categorize them and then they sell them to different companies and those companies cold call those people to sell them x y and z right okay so the third way that you make money off of this is you can sell merch and when you sell merch you get x more entries into the giveaway and i found this one company that's doing car giveaways and i got a hold of these financials and if you're listening to this actually there's a the takeaway here is that this about this business but the second takeaway is sign up for brokerage website that that sell that's amazing yeah an amazing way to learn you go to quiet light brokerage you go to what's the name of this one yeah you go to flippa empire flippers you quiet light brokerage you can go to like one of many uh oh you know fe international or whatever there's a whole bunch of places where you can go and you can basically look at internet businesses the beauty of it is if you want to if you're on the outside you're like dude i've never actually been inside of a successful business i've never run one never owned one never sold one you can go on here and it's a great way to get business ideas because you're just going to see a bunch of business you never thought about like oh these guys sell you know you know it's a d2c diabetes brand they sell you know products for diabetic diabetic patients and they're doing 8 million a year of revenue 4 million of profit and here's their top three skus and here's how they grow and here's their p l because they're trying to sell their business so they had to package everything up and make it a book that you can go look at as a buyer the beauty of the online ones is they don't know if you're a serious buyer or if you're a 21 year old kid just trying to learn about business and so i've looked through probably hundreds of these at this point um just to learn right so that's like how i feed my business brain is is one of these one of the tactics is to go look at businesses that are for sale and read their books so i was interested in sweepstakes and just so happened i saw one for sale and i went and found this one so here's the sweepstakes and what they do if you google car sweepstakes i'm not going to say the name of the company very likely they come up on the top 10 of google on the front page so i am just off that i imagine they're one of the big dogs did you go uh google card right now yep i see them okay um and the last 12 months revenue was 26 million seven hundred thousand dollars the last 12 months of net profit was 5.8 million dollars and in this document that i have there's like a q a where someone's just asking them questions and they explain how it works and what it works is they have a warehouse and they have like 30 employees all warehouse workers mostly and you they run ads on let's just say let's say this is for a car one they run ads and sponsored videos on youtube car chat car youtube channels and before the guy shows off his car he goes by the way this one is sponsored by blank company they're giving away a car if you want the car click the link below you go to that link and it says great you're gonna be entered to win this car by the way if you buy this sweatshirt for forty dollars you're gonna get ten more entries if you buy this hat you're gonna get x amount more entries and so they make a profit off of it's just an e-commerce store basically right and it's amazing i mean i don't i don't think it's actually sketchy i think that's a you're kind of preying on vulnerable people a bit and they said that in this document that the person one time or first of all the repeat customer rate is 50 so 50 of people who sign up for one eventually do another and they have guys that will spend eight thousand dollars on merch in order to get more entries into these cars wow yeah it's it's this is definitely one of those where it's pretty polarizing you know some people will say this is this is shady this is messed up um i find it fascinating that a business like this even exists 25 million a year in revenue 5 million a year in profit and uh very very simple business you know what i mean like and if this is what i call like you got to know how internet plumbing works they're like oh okay i can plug a pipe into youtube and uh that gives me a lead and then with the lead i plug that into an e-commerce store and that gives me this and then i'll plug into this like sweepstakes law that will allow me to do this legally and i've seen the same thing by the way in the gun space so people do this for guns giveaway giveaway for guns um there's a lot of people who are like really passionate about guns and ammunition and things like that there's also ones that are so car is probably the biggest one there's houses when i was gonna sell my house it was right when covid hit and it was like the worst time to sell a house and so i looked into could i raffle my house off and actually could i get a better price raffling my house and then there's all these rules against it like you gotta like basically like churches can do it and not a lot of other people are allowed to do this um so yeah so basically there's there's a lot of these that you wouldn't otherwise expect and uh yeah i've seen i've seen somebody doing this with cars at a pretty big scale and i'm looking at this company now and just i should say by the way i have a friend or a friend of a friend who's doing this with cars and like there was three months where they were just like oh my god this is printing money this is the best business in the world and then we checked back in six months later and they're like this is such a hard business dude it's like you know and so i think that it's not um it's like many things where it's not as easy as it sounds and there's also like a thin line of like at some point you you can fatigue out your customers right you can fatigue out the buyers who get disillusioned that they're not gonna win or you um the ad costs go up and then the business all of a sudden went from working beautifully to kind of upside down yeah okay so this business they're doing five sorry six million nearly in profit and they're only selling the asking price was 24 million dollars right so there's so they're asking five times profit one times revenue and there's a reason for that five times profit to me is actually quite good for this kind of business i would think they would want to get way less and it looks like the only true asset they have is the website which anyone could copy probably with 10 grand maybe 40 grand then they have a 300 000 email list and then they have 300 000 sms subscribers which is baller so is that good yeah that's huge and i bet that works extremely well for this because if it's like basically hey look at this amazing car do you want it and you're just sitting there on the bus it's like well i'm not doing anything else right now click and you go enter the enter the giveaway each time i could see how that hook would work because sms you know sms gets like an 80 open rate and email gets like an eight percent open rate so it's like it's you know 10 times better so i similar to your thing i don't really have any ideas for this because i think they're kind of limitless but i thought it was interesting and i wanted to bring it up because i think this is like a little bit on like the dark side of the internet that not a lot of people know about and i thought it was crazy fascinating i don't think it has to be like bold.org incredibly ethical uh straightforward there's no tricks i know the guys who run it it's i'm a customer of theirs it's it's how was we like okay so somebody's there for bold they're trying to get a scholarship right they're not thinking about the hustle maybe hustle's like auto checked in something which is like share share your information with our marketing partners who make this possible you know and you're like great now you got their email on a list did you see that they performed yeah they were okay yeah yeah yeah so okay so let's do the math here so let's just say that and all these numbers are i'm making up hypothetical let's just say that i acquire a user from facebook for two thousand or two two dollars and they have a fifty percent open rate that means i'm spending four times four dollars for a fifty percent open rate or sorry for a it works for a reader yeah for a reader and and let's just say that like the way that we used to track it is that we we knew right away if they read the first five the likelihood that they're gonna stay for 18 months or whatever it is was very high yeah okay so i paid four dollars for that 50 person we'll call it we call we have a gold silver bronze that's like we we internally so a gold user just cost us four dollars right okay now let's just say that on bold.org i've got to get 10 people but i get those 10 people for a dollar and one of them becomes a gold reader so i just paid one dollar for a gold reader so you get a lot of volume but you make up for it because it's cheap right right and um and you basically just set your rate with them or they they just have a rate and you have to figure it out like do you say this much per lead or how does it work a lot of these companies are the smart guys they don't have a set rate they give you a ballpark and then they but they first want to hear what's it worth to you yeah of course and then they try to sell you uh they're like oh okay these are worth this to you okay we're gonna set it at this budget and then what you do is you go out and do it for a month and then you renegotiate yeah i think this is a fascinating business i also think that giveaways and sweepstakes are just a useful marketing tool so even if this is not your business oh by the way i just went i just went through it i just went through the funnel while we were talking yeah so by getting halfway through the scholarship flow i earned 50 bold points and then you can get five more bullet points for signing up for this you can get 10 more bold points for doing this and how big is this bold thing bold.org like the like how big is this business well i don't know i i mean they never told me the revenue i think are pretty baller business i imagine it's very very very pr if you told me it made half a million to a million a month in profit i wouldn't be surprised this is like somebody who has a black belt in the internet they're like ah here's what that's this guy dennis man this guy feel good feel good story on the front end dope lucrative business model on the back end right i love i love this this is clear this is an internet black belt yeah it's it's amazing this is a it's an amazing thing and i wanted to i just had to bring this up because this is one that like this doesn't sound sexy right um this doesn't sound like like oh i i want to do this when i get older but it just makes loads and loads of money another one is omaze o-m-a-z-e have you heard of that yeah that's like it's like a platform to do raffles and whatnot right yes but they act like it's a charity thing so it's like like snoop dogg's going to give away a car and all the money or like some of the money goes to charity or something like that in reality omaze gets their cut in the same way that i've just outlined the three business models yeah uh that's fascinating i feel like we could do an even deeper dive on this because i feel like you just touched on like 10 interesting things that uh that we should probably like i feel like we should do a separate episode all like kind of like the deep dive into this sweepstakes giveaways thing i bet that would go pretty viral honestly and i'm going through the the the bold flow they asked so many questions like what's your estimated current annual income what's your dream like what job do you want to have how much money do you want to make uh how many how i mean they asked so many questions so i asked you for money right now would you say yes yes okay great so like basically what they're doing is they're getting like crazy amounts of qual it's all about enriched enriched lists basically yes and it this is crazy uh all right i got another one have you seen this company nugs yeah they changed their name though yeah they well i think they have like a parent company and then the product is called nugs so the product parent company's called simulate i think um and that's because they're basically simulating real meat and so nugs is one it fits into this category of like alt alt meats or fake meats so you have beyond meat you have the impossible burger and what nuggs is doing is nugs is chicken no by the way they changed the product's name is different what's it called now oh really it's not called i just googled nugs i can't even find it uh i think it's still called that it's nugs with two g's no if you go to simulate.com you'll see the uh the product and basically it says the tesla of chicken um oh my god and so so you can see that the like if you go to their pro go to simulate.com nugs so it says the original nugs forty five dollars for a box and there's fifty people for two boxes and there's 50 pieces of brew box so basically 45 bucks for 100 nuggets and they have two flavors there's original and spicy and and their landing page is like kind of like cheeky like the instead of saying it's good for you it says kills you slower this is higher in protein and lower in fat than animal based nuggets um you know you can get this fast here you go blah blah so they started as a kind of like a d2c brand type of thing but i think either during covet or or before right before covered they switched to basically just selling to retail and so i saw them because they raised 50 million dollars recently like a month ago or something like that and um the guy who's behind this is this guy uh he's a young guy ben pasternak and um this guy's pretty clever so he's he was really young he i think when he was 18 or 19 he had built this app called monkey i don't know if you ever saw it it like it was kind of chat roulette foot for your iphone so you'd get on there you'd randomly match you in a video chat with somebody else and then you could like skip to somebody else and um i saw this because i was like oh that's kind of clever like i don't think it's gonna work but like i like the branding um i like that this guy was able to like kind of game the app store chart so he was climbing the charts but you could tell this wasn't a sticky product uh so i you know reached out to him had a chat super smart guy how long ago was this maybe five six years ago wow so he might be 20 i don't know he might be 21 22 now he was like 17 at the time something like that i don't know somewhere around that range he was like 17 or 18. and um i remember just thinking wow this kid's like a superstar or the future superstar i think i gave him the highest compliment i could give him which is i didn't even recruit him i was like you know what you're ready to just do this on your own like don't don't even waste the time coming and working inside my thing like if we work together we build one company if we're a part you're going to build two companies since but i really like the guide and remind me of this question so i actually don't even really want to talk about the fake chicken nuggets thing although good market to be in i would say um the part that i think was interesting is like i meet a lot of people like this who are like clearly special gonna do big things it it's probably not their first app like it's probably not monkey but it's probably nugs it's probably their second or third attempt that's gonna hit and it got me thinking like could you basically as a founder like buy an option could you buy options could you buy future contracts on founders and what does this mean so most people when they think of this they think isas oh it's an income share agreement i'm not even saying that i'm saying there's a it's it's that juicy of a market of founders like this that you could actually just sell the right to invest in my next thing yeah because because otherwise it's hard to even just keep tabs on people you don't know when they're pivoting you don't know when they have a new idea you don't know when they're launching and you're like dude i believe in you if you were just gonna start a new startup i'm in for 25k like no questions asked just put me in the precede round so it's like the lower valuation of the of the others so i think i would have paid 10 grand just for the option to invest in this guy's next company over the next five years right so i think you know 10 grand 25 grand dude i think you could tell to investors just the right of first refusal basically to invest in my future company it's not equity it's not an income share agreement i don't even have to start another company but i think i think real investors would basically have a budget of maybe single digit millions of dollars where they're just placing options there's buying option contracts on like high performers they see in in the tech industry to say hey next time you start your thing i get the first dibs at investing so this is something i'm i'm looking this up so i i think it was it was either jerry seinfeld or joe rogan was talking about the 90s in tv and i believe they were telling a story about roseanne um and how basically they're like it was the golden age of tv because even though the content nowadays is probably better but basically if you wrote like an okay script or just a pilot or a screenplay a a company would pay you a quarter of a million dollars a year and the only thing that you had to do was not do it like they bought the option and they'd be like yeah sometimes we would they would just buy the option and we would never even do it so i was just getting like a quarter of a million dollar a year salary for three years and i didn't have all the rules just don't do anything right it's like a retainer or like kind of like a it's like a it's almost like an advance on a book deal in a way and i don't actually know i i know nothing about hollywood and i don't know if that still exists of course it does but i think it was more common then when cable company or when cable's crushing but i think this is actually a fantastic idea and basically would be like i have the option let's see how would it work anytime you raise money or anytime you own more than 50 of a entity i get i get the i get first round refusal i think it's a really really great idea yeah like i don't know how the math works exactly but i can sort of see like it turns entrepreneurship into a job um and it gives you a floor so let's say like i think if i did this i think if i went and i said hey um you know hey i left my job at twitch by the way i as of today officially am no longer no longer employed i'm a free free man um congratulations i wasn't sure when we were gonna bring that up thank you yeah yeah so if i was basically like hey i don't know when i'm going to start my next company but um you know if anybody's interested here's a place where you could go here's a website you can go to and you can basically buy a future option on being in the precede round so let's say um i'm selling slots for i don't know 15k a pop so 15k for your right to invest in my next round and i basically sent that to every vc or every seed fund i know i think i could probably get 10 people to opt into that they'd say cool i'll give you 10k right i'll give you 15k right now easy and um in the next 18 months i'm going to be thinking about a business and then when i'm ready you get the first dips and you know the round might be like a three million dollar round and you get to invest in this and so i get 150k floor to go do my search for my next business and they get they get the guaranteed locked in deal flow and i don't know maybe i'm maybe i'm underpricing it maybe it could be more or maybe it's an annual thing i'm not sure but like i'm pretty sure out of a fund you know they would allocate a few hundred thousand dollars to placing bets on 25 founders that they're like yeah i'll i'll be in your next round can you also do this so uh did you pay attention to what happened with the ncaa today no what happened so i i wish that you would have because i don't actually know the full details uh but yeah me neither um the the supreme court basically well i know what happened so the supreme court here's the headline the supreme court unanimous unanimously sides with former college players in dispute with ncaa about compensation so basically i i don't know if there was any firm rules but basically um the doors now open for how ncaa athletes can make money and when i think of options i mean i definitely think uh athletes are the best yes definitely so yes so basically the thing here's what i'm reading here it says the unanimously ruled that the current cap on education-related benefits such as scholarships graduate school musical instruments tutoring violates federal anti-trust laws and must be lifted so that means that this is just for uh there was limits on how much you'd be compensated for you know tuition room and board stuff like that um so that's lifted but it's not yet salaries for athletes but that's coming because they've also passed there's also been a rule passed around the athlete themselves being able to monetize their name and likeness you know like i'm in a i'm in a college town in north carolina well the local car dealership can like use my name and face on their ads and i can make money from it um you know things like that that's that's what's coming so i think there's definitely a big opportunity there uh just in general yeah so here we are future contracts yeah i'm on board i think it's great okay cool i don't have anything else to say except great last topic i want to give you some predictions um so i've been thinking about this and i think you're bold for doing this by the way you're making it very easy to look stupid well that's the beauty of predictions it's like a you know the best predictions i think most predictions when you're wrong people forget unless you're scott galloway uh you know when you're small when you're small you should make predictions because uh the cost of being wrong is very low but the cost of being right all of a sudden you're the guy who called it um you know like it's like my clubhouse thread like as that gets proven right then it'll be like oh he called it but if i was already big then if i was wrong it would be like kind of like everybody would be waiting to rub it in my face um okay so let me let me run you through what i think the next um when did you come up with these is this like some twitter thread you're going to do yeah i'm going to do it as a thread but i was just one day so i could see the timestamp on this 11 27 pm so this is the type of [ __ ] i think about at midnight um and i started typing on my phone i said i said okay what's apple becoming because i see apple apple's shifting into like health in a pretty big way with these like wearable devices and so let's just say apple which today the core benefit is they give you this ultra personal device you're a little personal super computer that's going to help you with life so i don't think the next apple is a phone company i think the next apple the next apple which is gonna be a trillion dollar company that has uh that gives you kind of like a a consumer device i think it's gonna be a healthcare monitor i think it's gonna be something that is gonna be measuring what's going on inside your body and feeding that data back to you and so that's my that's my prediction the next what the next apple looks like not a phone company healthcare monitoring device next facebook okay facebook today people think facebook is an app it's a social network it's where you go right on a news feed or you post photos i think facebook the core of facebook the guts of facebook is basically cameras it's content sharing so it's basically photo taking or video taking and sharing with people who you care who you want to share that stuff with and that's why instagram is something they own whatsapp et cetera et cetera and so i think the next facebook is not gonna be an app it's not gonna be another social network it's gonna be some kind of hands-free always-on camera so it's gonna be something you wear either glasses or a lapel or something a [ __ ] drone that's floating above you at all times i don't know what it is probably glasses because it's at your eye level and it's going to be basically like a super memory so it's going to let you capture photos and videos of whatever you're looking at hands-free and instantaneously and then once you've captured it be able to share that or save that as like a super memory for yourself or with any friends and so i think anybody's trying to create the next facebook you're not creating an app where you add friends you should be creating a hands-free camera that makes it way easier to capture content and it'll bypass facebook altogether because that cat that place where you capture content will just be for sharing similar to a snapchat attacked facebook snapchat made an app that when you open it the camera's on right away and you take the photo first and then you just share that photo with somebody so they skipped the whole facebook process so i think that's what the next facebook is a hands-free always on camera next amazon this one's stolen from mark laurie next amazon so amazon a place to shop it's not going to be a website where you uh where you type in a word and then you get 5000 images as a result and then you got to sort through them the next amazon is conversational shopping in your house it's just saying what you need and having something go get it for you um so basically it's just saying hey uh we need more pee pads for the dog and it says you want the same ones as last time i say yes and then it's boom it's ordered right i didn't have to type anything in didn't have to enter a credit card it's all on file and this is a hands-free voice assistant that helps me shop for things and when i don't know what it is it could say i could say hey um i need a you know the best camera for my webcam and it could say something like do you want the ones that most of the youtubers use do you want the ones your friends bought the most or do you want the one that's the best value or the highest price and i'm like ah what do my friends have sam has this one would you like to ask him how it is yes it asks sam and then sam says it's amazing and then i buy the thing right conversational commerce something like that that's the future that's the next amazon next netflix okay next wait you skipped over 7-eleven oh i'm going to do 7-eleven two okay 7-eleven the next 7-eleven what is 7-eleven it's a corner store that has like it's a little local convenience store this one's easy this one is it's a cloud corner store so you don't need a real location it's just going to be 500 square feet that's within one mile of you it might be in this back alley place it doesn't need a good location and it's going to deliver to you with small lightweight drones so small little pass a small little carrier drone gonna bring you something within 15 minutes of ordering no human being involved and the whole the whole 500 square foot place doesn't need good real estate and is going to be automated so that um you know when i push the button to order it there's no human being in the place it just pops out like a vending machine the drone takes it straight to me and it lands on a little landing pad that i have in my front lawn for uh drone deliveries and as soon as it's there i go outside i pick it up okay and then uh keep going i'm just listening i think this is fascinating i'm i'm taking notes i'm going to tweet those just like as you're talking so i'm going to steal your cloud you're still my thread okay great um all right the next netflix net next netflix i think is going to be um one of two things one is it's either in vr and it's more like it's a hybrid it feels like a game so you put the headset on you enter the world and then you walk around and you sort of experience a movie um so it's either vr or or because i think i'm not sure about that one or it's machine generated movies which is basically something personalized to you so right now a movie is like a really specific story that gets filmed edited produced has actors blah blah i think you might be able to just sit down and be like i want something that's like breaking bad but with casinos and then it just generates it just machine generates a movie for you uh based off of basically it's like a mashup and you've seen this with music so google released this thing called composer or whatever it's like this ai that basically writes classical music that sounds like it's made by bach and mozart and um and it's basically just it's just taking all the stuff that exists out there it studies it and then it creates remixes and mashups of all those things in a way that's maybe it could be one time it's like i get this thing and it's like a one-time movie for me um that could be kind of crazy remember that remember that band girl talk yeah mashups yeah yeah i used to love those things man i still work out to that that's my go-to for working same i love that too it was like feed the animal or something like that that's yeah that's a great track yeah i love that [ __ ] i'm on board so similarly uh the next pornhub is not a website you go to and you see a bunch of like pre-made porn movies i think it's all deep fakes so i think you just go in there and you just have a fantasy so you put on your vr device and you just think of something you want to see you think oh uh mila kunis um she's my waitress go and like it basically deep fakes a porno uh for you with mila kunis's face on it if you don't know what a deep fake is it's a um it's a computer generated movie where the like the actor on the screen was never there like it'll make obama look like obama's you can make obama go to a baseball game and pee in the crowd right because uh it could just take any which by the way like that put obama's head on it it looks real that that's why it's scary it's yeah fakes are scary uh for many reasons you're not gonna be able to trust video anymore because i agree video can be faked just like any photo can be photoshopped any video can be video shopped now um all right last one uh the next dominoes so the next pizza company is going to be a fleet of self-driving cars that are just going around that have an oven baked in the in the trunk so um your food is going to be baked fresh it's going to arrive to you with a driverless car and you're going to hop out uh you're going to come out to the front you're going to meet the car uh and it's going to pop up with the trunk and there's going to be a pizza that was baked during the drive time for you basically like like like a mobile food truck type or like a food truck that which by the way when our friend our our friend gagan launched this company called sprig i think it was only in san francisco or maybe san francisco in chicago and he raised 60 million dollars all this money he launched it early though 2014 and that was what he goes he goes i want to have ovens in the car that's the future and i actually think he was right i just think that it was a little early totally true uh this guy david langer he started zesty it was like a food catering company that was like super fast growing at a time and i asked him i go oh yeah what do you think of what do you think food delivery seems hot he goes he just jumps straight to the end he goes yeah the the end answer is cars with ovens in the trunk um it's really the only solution that's going to work like at mass that will replace like kind of like the whole uh infrastructure that exists today is when you can get the food to be baked in the car and kept hot in the car and ready hot coming out of the car and when you do that there's it also reduces the delivery time because you're not going to a brick and mortar place loading the food into the car and then driving to a place you're just constantly circling around an area and as you get in order you pop the thing into bake and then when it's ready you're at the door so there was zero lag time so deliveries get faster and fresher so this is my segment of basically sean time travels to the future because if you think about it right i'm born in 1988 not that long ago 88 to like 96 there's 97 like i remember that time michael jordan was like winning championships during that time there was for the average person there was no internet or we were just just getting like aol chat rooms and [ __ ] like that right i was putting aol cds into the computer that was in my computer room because the house had one computer right yeah we all had computer rooms remember we had computer rooms exactly and so then like that sort of changed over time it's like oh computer rooms become laptops laptops become phones phones have freaking like hd video streaming live you know basketball games from the internet now to my phone and i'm watching that while i'm in my car like that seemed absurd i remember actually even the first time i saw someone reading on their phone and i used to have like a nokia you know like the old phone that had snake on it and i was just like what reading on your phone who would want to do that like the text is so small and so shitty like who would ever watch a video on their phone or who could type who could like because this is when they just had nine ten ten ten buttons and you had to like click three times to get another letter yeah what was that thing called or you had to like uh it's like smarter text or some [ __ ] like that yeah yeah yeah and it would autofill yeah i was like but that seemed so far-fetched and that was in that was not that long ago like i was like that was like 20 years ago and so in 20 years like kind of some amazing things have happened so if i fast forward 20 years these things that today sound far-fetched it's like that's gonna happen because it's the consumer benefit is there you know if the delivery is faster and fresher people are gonna do that right if if shopping gets easier i don't have to search and read and be at a computer i just say what i want when i want it and i get it like you know i get it in less than an hour that was the part i forgot to say it was that prime two day delivery is gonna seem like incredibly slow like ordering everything from amazon is going to be just as fast today as today ordering doordash is going to be it'll be here in 45 minutes oh you need a hdmi cable here push this button it's here in 40 minutes delivered via drone and so um yeah i think that's what the future looks like so that's my time traveler section what do you think which one did you think i was most on or off about you're i think you're most on about apple i think you're most off on so i gave you facebook the hands-free camera always i'm looking at it now yeah i have all the notes i think you're on about apple i think amazon you're not totally right facebook was um what was facebook the hands-free always on camera instant capture of anything that's going on in your world you don't need yeah i think you're wrong actually about that capture i think there's a world where we go in reverse and we get less tech driven and people want less contact with people i think i think it could go the other way so i think you're wrong about that i think you're totally right about apple uh 7-eleven i think you're right netflix i actually think you're right pornhub i think you're right domino's i think you're right i think i'm right on all of them bro i think i got them all right it's just a question the the great quote is don't confuse a clear view for a short distance i love that quote that's like one of my what's that mean like imagine you see something on the driving you see something on the horizon it's like oh there it is it's just because you see it doesn't mean you're near it right objects in the front view are maybe further than they than they appear and that's what often happens with the future is you can kind of see what the world's going to do and what it's going to look like but you overestimate how soon it's going to come and then you get sort of disillusioned and then eventually it does show up you know i think i think it will be capable of that i think the thing is is what i've learned reading history is that it typically repeats itself or like what's what's old becomes new and what's new becomes old and it goes back and forth and when we were now that you know people our age and young a little bit younger are always connected i think it's going to go the opposite that they're going to be one they're going to want a less connection right you know that's why motels like motels in america are booming right now because it's like nostalgia and it's interesting again and so i i do think that the pendulum does swing but um i don't know i think both happen at the same time i think that um the world i agree with on-demand and more digital and then people crave physical experiences and both exist at the same time uh it's sort of like the clear view short distance thing a great example of this is like webvan you know year 2000 it's like oh grocery delivery online what if you could buy your groceries online instead of through a store and then it gets all this hype then it crashes and then for like 20 years nobody nobody really touches this nobody really tries this again and then um and then here we are with instacart is a multi-billion dollar company taking that same idea but putting it in a fresh way with new tech tools and technology like mobile phones yeah i i i'm on board with a lot of that all right um we should call it here and uh yeah all right that's the end of the episode i feel like i can rule the world i know i could be what i want to i put my all in it like no days off on the road let's travel never looking back
