[Music] all right so Moy is here and so I guess if people don't know so you started um you actually started a couple businesses people mostly know you from native so you created native which has the popular deodorant brand you sold it to Proctor and Gamble for a reported $100 million which I think is uh one of the better DTC exits cuz you only raised like $4 million I want to say less than that even we raised $500,000 actually oh my God okay so you raised $500,000 and by the way I don't know if you know this I remember I was in a a mastermind group with your brother and I was like and he was like in between he he already sold his company so he's kind of floating in between things it's like why do you show show up to the Mastermind if you don't really have a business that you're working on so I think he was kind of like fishing he was like you know my brother's got this interesting business and I was like I was like oh I didn't you know I didn't even know I didn't know him very well at the time I was like didn't even know you had a brother he's like and I was ready for this like big Tech idea and he's like yeah he's like selling like this uh natural deodorant like and he made it sound like you're like sitting at home packing the deodorant like containers by hand and he's like he kind of was underplaying he's like it's really cool you know it's paraben free I didn't know what a paraben was and he's like it's aluminum free or whatever and he's like yeah it's doing pretty well and then he started to say the numbers and I was like whoa um that's actually like really good I was like so how much is he raised he's like I don't know if he's he's like he's raised like nothing and so that's when you got on my ra radar and you I feel like you operated very quietly you're kind of like me where when you're doing something that's working you shut the hell up and when when you're not when you're just thinking about ideas you're like super loud to bounce them around off people is that your strategy that's exactly right in fact uh we done no PR for Native until after we sold the business I remember we had all these news Publications reaching out to us and I took one interview with I think it was like retail dive or somebody and they were like we want to talk about this deodorant company because we haven't heard it and you know they're like who are you guys what are you doing um and we sort of uh talked about the business and they wrote an article and after that I was like I'm never talking about the business again uh when we went to go fund ra like we talked to a few people we talked to um Simon Equity Partners which is basically uh the family office of like you know the Simon Property Group which owns a bunch of malls across the United States and uh we opened up our books to them and we're like here's our business and they're like our job is to find businesses like you and you know you're down the street from us you're based in San Francisco your headquarters is three blocks away from ours we've never heard of this business and we should have heard of it by now how come and we're like you know we're not talking about our business like no one walked around with Native t-shirts until after we made an until after we made an exit then I was like okay now the brand can exist and be we can be loud in public about it is that what is that is that paranoia is it just focus is it strategy what what why why do it that way yeah yeah I think it's two things um I think one is uh fear which is like um fear of embarrassment okay my business failed and I was super public about it and now it crashed and everybody's going to think of me as a failure so I was like we're not going to fail publicly if we fail it'll be really quietly um and then two was like we fail the Indian way silently in personal shame yeah that's right uh that's right no one will be able to Google me and be like okay Mo Ali is a failure um and then the other one was things were working so well we're like okay we don't know how this is working so well or why this is working so well but we better not go around thumping our chest saying this is working really well because one I believe it'll jinx us and I believe in Jinx and two other people just start copying us and doing exactly what we're doing and like you know is so is so native in November 2017 we had a competitor sell their business in December 2017 a month a month after at us and you know they in 2018 2019 60 competitors in the natural deodorant bace popped up and every brand that didn't have a natural deodorant was like we should create a natural deodorant um and then 60 Brands were like hey we want to create natural deodorant as our Flagship or our hero product and so by like not thumping our chest and not talking about our business we were able to keep the category a little bit quieter before we came out and said hey this is a massive category and it's really working right and I I I appreciate that about you guys I've actually learned a little bit in that regard and that I I don't talk about my e-commerce business on here ever um or I'll reference it but I'll never say the name or the brand or whatever someone text you I also have a business partner yeah I have a business partner and they don't want me to talk about it so I'm also like okay cool you know I'll honor that wish but I I kind of came up with this term because you and your brother are the same in that normally you guys are all the info flows one way and and this podcast is like the rare exception where I get to ask you questions normally whenever I've seen your brother or you in any social setting it's a technique I call Ali boarding and it's like water boarding but just with questions where you just dump someone's head into a vat of your a Non-Stop flow of questions and by the end they're like wait so what's your name and what do you do and you're like by then you're like H I have your p&l and like I have your whole family's backstory and it's not like in an evil way it's like genuine curiosity I think is what I've come to see but it's also very effective um a is that true do you do you believe that do am I characterizing it right and then B is that like conscious or un did you ever like develop that as a skill or was that a choice you made or it's just natural yeah I think um a is it's partially right it's more true with Solomon with my brother than it is with me and he does that to me as well where like I'll tell him about you know a meeting I had or a deal that I'm looking at and he'll be he'll ask me ridiculous questions he'll be like what uh what did the lunch what did the founder have for lunch on Saturday three months ago and I'm like I didn't get into that level detail you got to stop asking those types of questions uh but I do think we have genuine curiosity of like what are what's making other businesses work and what isn't I remember we went to the Super Bowl um you know four years ago or something like that in Atlanta and we were at the Super Bowl party like the night before the game and there were these two old Daisy uncles that were there as well and uh they were there because they had they owned Marriott hotels and Marriott had invited them to the game in like their private suite and you know they were probably in their fifth and we asked them so many qu I was like you know how much you have to pay Marriott and they also own like Hilton Hotels I was like how much you have to pay Hilton per year Marriott per year you do you have debt on the building you do what's your debt like you know how often do you have to renovate how much those Renovations cost uh how much like you know what does your average occupancy look like and they answered all these questions and they like didn't seem excited to answer them but they didn't seem cautious like they didn't seem like they were hesitant either and at the end of all of these questions where we literally did have their p&l you know we're like okay well you know they didn't ask a single question they were just like okay well great meeting you guys and we're like all right I Now understand the hotel business from two operators that have eight businesses around the Dallas Fort Worth area and they didn't want to know anything about us like why were we at the Super Bowl party how did we get here how did we make our money they didn't ask a single question so I think there is a genuine curiosity that we have that sometimes is lost on other people that that's that's exactly how it goes I've seen it and then also you had like a brunch I saw you tweet out like oh inviting some D Toc friends over like who wants to have a brunch of D Toc people and I was like oh what a nice guy just being social or whatever I had a friend who went to your brunch and he's like yeah the brunch is basically boy sits at the head of the table and he's like all right what's your CAC what's your you were like asking a bunch of questions and I was like that sounds about right and I learned this from your brother I was like cuz I watched him one time and I was like and first when I talk to your brother now I'm like it's like a duel like he doesn't know this but in my head I'm like I'm going to ask whatever n number of questions you ask n Plus One will be asked back to you um like you know because I will not be out questioned cuz I know the technique but I start I started watching him when he talked to other people and I was like how does he get them to divulge so much information and again not in a bad way but just like what gets people in the flow of talking I'm like okay so first he's genuinely curious like he's super engaged he's not looking around he's not looking at his phone he's actually looking them in the eye and he's asking them a bunch of questions I've noticed he does two things when they're saying something he uh likes or is like a smart thing he gives them tons of like you know nodding yep that makes total sense got it love it and then when they say something really stupid or weird or tell makes no sense I notice that when somebody does that to me I'm like but that makes I like kind of start judging them a little bit and they can tell that I'm judging them and that makes them clam up whereas he'll just go he'll just laugh and be like amazing and then he he says the word amazing and then moves on and amazing really means like wow it's amazing you're so stupid or it's amazing you think that or it's amazing that you don't even know that but like he never makes them feel bad he'll just be like like amazing and then he'll just go on to the next question and I realize that that is how he keeps the constant flow going so I'm studying this olly boarding technique and I think I'm gonna be pretty good at I'm gonna be like you know a franchisee of your of your question I love that yeah first we have to charge you per question then uh but really he's like um I think the other thing that he does really good or really well is that he's like how do you think about something he never ask like you know uh what's your CAC he'll be like how do you think about growth when it comes to social ads and like you know can you spend more there and the question is really open-ended but he's like aiming for some he really wants a response and people uh like you know subconsciously get to it and I've started asking how do you think about that all the time now because it really gets people to open up and tell me about how they're how they view their business and not just like a standard number um and I really like that question and I've also franchised that from him when I started my business the Ecom one he I told him about it and he had like you know some good questions and then like you know the way y'all's brains work it's just like you know it non-stop so I think at like 2: in the morning that same night he just sent or like actually it was like five nights later it was like completely unrelated it's like five night later 2 in the morning I get this email it's one line from him and he just says he says like with our business I knew we just it was this we just needed to do this one thing and it would work like he explained like the competitive like the the positioning like what we were going to do different that was going to cause it to work it was going to be X but with Y difference what's that going to be for your business and I was like that sent me into like a 3-we spiral of being like Oh my God I need to know this answer that is the important question as I'm starting this business I really do need to have like a very strong point of view on what's going to be the one thing that we're going to do that's going to make this business work better than all the others that are out there or better than you know how can we compete given that we're years late to the party and whatever else but it was such an important question and I was like man um and like I ended up bringing him on as kind of like an adviser but I was like man this is the value of an adviser is not the answer but the question the question that's going to make you like think about your business in a way or like reveal a shortcoming in your own thinking that you then get to go fill in that gap for yourself yeah I think there's a lot of Truth to that the one thing I would say is that like um you know I've started an e-commerce business and if someone asked me that about Native uh when I launched the business I'd say I've got no idea we're aluminum free there are a bunch of aluminum free deodorant right now we're selling online is that better is that better than selling in store I've got no clue and so I think those questions are really helpful but I think the fear that some of those questions can cause in terms of people being like I need to figure out this answer before I can do X or Y before I can launch my product before I can start spending marketing dollars like you can figure out that answer uh well after your business is launched and I think for Native that really changed like you know we were an aluminum free deodorant and selling it on the internet and I was like that's going to be our competitive advantage and then it became a little bit of like sense uh you know like fragrance as we have a strategy of launching new fragrances frequently and those fragrances are different and people are going to Pantry load and buy a bunch of deant so it's not just buying one until you run out but I've got seven because this is going to be your fragrance rather than your perfume perfumer cologne uh and then it was like different marketing ideas and bundling products and launching new categories like there are very few brands that can expand from deodorant to body wash to uh toothpaste like you know old spites could never make a toothpaste we're like we're going to create a brand that can do all of those and it stands for better for you ingredients rather than one single thing and I I think that question the answer to that question evolved and change and I think that question is great and people should think about that in the back of their minds but it shouldn't prevent them from actually taking the first step to launching their business totally totally agree also about the like Progressive like iteration of that question of the of the answer but also um I also learned what a good answer to that is a good answer is not we're doing this magical thing that nobody's doing because usually that just doesn't exist like realistically like that's probably a signal that it's a bad idea not that it's a great idea um and also not that like we are going to jump through these 14 really hard to jump through hoops like I'm going to crack I'm going to be viral all the time it's like oh God like that seems like a bad strategy to back instead it was like actually there's a category that people want and what we're going to do is like people don't don't like this one thing about the main competitor we're going to do that one thing like it's just common sense but we're going to do that one thing differently and like I'm just going to obsess over Facebook ads in a way that they're not like or just in a way that will work like Facebook ads are just working for businesses like these so I'm going to do Facebook ads it's like almost the stupid the answer the better but like the clearer the answer the better too like if do you even know what you're betting on that's like what do you think is going to work here and like can you back that up as to why you think that's going to work but you don't want it to be a genius magical like ma magical Silver Bullet solution that like nobody has ever thought of and nobody has ever pulled off cuz that's usually just a sign of like weakness actually in the plan especially if you talk about like Partnerships or collaborations where people are like I'm betting my future on the ability to get other people to do X Y and Z like that's never going to work I couldn't agree more it could be we're look we're going to create a digital first brand that looks better uh we're gonna have a better user interface and we're going to have more uh better colors and it's going to look better on your countertop like native deodorant or your bathroom you know shelf like like native deodorant and that was it like that was the that's that's an entire plan and that's perfectly fine and the one thing here yeah goad go okay so so the idea is um example of doing that so you know the the so most people who listen to this are probably not not not brown or Daisy don't know this brand but like if you've ever been to like an Indian grocer which there's you know all around the country there's a bunch of things like you know you go buy go buy you know sort of like the ethnic foods there's this brand called hyam which is basically they make like just like this like super addictive salty little snack um it's like fried it's like equivalent of chips it's like fried salty kind of spicy you just buy this thing it's like it's like a trail mix basically that's that's salty and um and so it's been around forever they do like 500 million a year in sales they're like like a juggernaut of of a of a consumer package good brand they're like super profitable don't do any like advertising and like they're just like they're massive and so like I think one idea is like holdy ROM but with like packaging that's just different like different packaging slightly better for you like maybe it's baked and not fried and like that's the whole business plan like I don't need to know more to start than just that and I think that that's a plan somebody could take today and go start like okay so then what are you going to do for this like I don't know or the same as everybody else like you can do I don't know or the same as everybody else for all other questions as long as you just had that one thing which is like these guys do like 500 million in sales and they sell mostly through these like inan Grocers I'm going to do that but with better packaging cuz their packaging looks like my mom's packaging I'm just going to make it look like my packaging like you know the stuff I'm used to buying yeah and I can cater to Caucasians as a result of that like you know packaging that the entire world is going to understand it's not available only at ethnic grow service there is that's our business model cing their product in a better bag or like 23ds of Indians have diabetes and I'm just going to make mine like better for people with diabetes and I'm just like it's baked not fried and like it's better for you because of that yeah you know the guys who started nature nature box was this company based in San Francisco that uh like sold you uh snacks like trail mix basically and shipped it either to your home or your office their original business model was we're going to go buy this at Whole Foods put it in different size packaging and just ship it to your house like you know what's the difference between this and Whole Foods trail mix literally not no packaging difference no uh ingredient difference they literally go and buy it and you know ship it to your house and that was it and instacart like started and they're like what are we going to do you have a grocery list you just email it to us and we're going to go shopping for it like really simple ideas that were not like you know groundbreaking by any stretch of imagination that built huge businesses and you invested in manscaped pretty early on I think right yeah yeah I invested in manscaped probably three or four years ago now and so um you invest in manscaped and it's been one of your I think you tweeted out one of your best performing Investments um what did they do like what's their version of this like the stupid Simple Plan that like just makes sense and it doesn't have to be right ET science but like a simple plan executed well what was their version of that yeah I think two things I think one was they're like look we've created a product specifically for your balls even though the razor that works on your face works on your like you know if you got an electric trimmer for your face works on your balls as well it's not like it's different hair it's possibly more coarse but like that trimmer is going to work there and so they're like look we've created an electric trimmer specifically for your balls and like you know that might appeal to people who don't have electric trimmers for their face like I imagine you do it's hard to keep these beards trimmed well but like you know if you've got it for your face you can probably use the same thing for your balls if you're comfortable with that they're like hey you're using a Gillette razor blade because you're clean shaven we've got something specific for your ball so I think that was really smart they're like hey use this product for a category that you probably aren't using it for uh and then two was like branding and name they're like you know they got the name right they got the trademark right I think those were probably really hard for them to get although I'm not like involved enough to know that um and and like you know they've done a good job with like unique and differentiated branding look they had um they had a barge sale up and down um uh South Beach in Miami and they had a big billboard on it and it said got Bush uh use manscaped uh like they've done really unique things in order to get their name out there in a way that I think a lot of other directed consumer businesses have failed where we're like you know native would run bail boards and we're like yours an aluminum free deodorant please come buy it it really didn't get your attention these guys have done a good job of that um and like you know today they posted on they have a billboard in New York City right now instead of the hard Emoji it's an upside down hard Emoji so it looks like a you know testicle sack basically that's really clever branding and like really clever thinking and so they're fantastic at that and I think what's really difficult is that stuff doesn't scale it's not like if the guy who's like you know if there's two guys thinking about this kind of stuff and they retire you're not going to be able to hire or teach that skill to somebody else you've got to find two rock stars that are able to pull that off otherwise and I think that's going to be difficult for them but so far they're just knocking it out of the park and you see a ton of Brands a ton of DDC Brands you're probably like you know one of when somebody has a DDC company you're probably one of the most I don't know desired like investor advisor type dudes like that's your Authority right people want to do what you've done and then you've also invested in so many that now you have that portfolio and experience as well but you also see a bunch of DDC brands do stupid [ __ ] so what are some of the like kind of like give me your rant on the things you see DDC Brands doing wrong what are some of the common mistakes you see that drive you nuts cuz I know that like both you and your brother it's like operational like um you know operational excellence is what turns you on and operational like you know uh ignorance or whatever you know is what like you know drives you nuts and so give me some of the things you see DDC Brands doing wrong or or stupidly yeah over hiring and like um spending money on dumb things like you know uh was doing uh probably we were at a 50 million run rate or close to a $50 million run rate um when we sold the business uh and we had eight people at the time and when I left you know was certainly doing north of 100 million a year and you know we probably had 30 30 or so people on the team like there were not that many people for a brand that was doing a lot of Revenue you know I've walked into offices where people have 20 you know there'll be 20 people doing $2 million or $4 million in revenue and I'm like what are all these human beings doing like if there're if you got this many people here send them to the subway handing out free like coupon cards to people who are getting off the subway this is too many people inside your office to be working on a $4 million a year brand and so I think that's a that's a real like you're burning way too much money if you have that many people um you know Goldman Sachs had the standard of like we want to do 1 million in Revenue per employee that we have that should be something that's rather easy to do for um for direct consumer businesses I sit on the board of company called brewmate which makes like um like you know drink wear uh think like you know um uh like hydration kits or or can coolers for slim cans the they had one employee and they were doing $30 million a year like only the founder Dylan was at the company and he was doing $30 million a year now he had some outsourced agencies that he was working with to help him run to help him run Facebook ads and to help him do customer service stuff but like you had one guy and one guy in the payroll so you could easily Flex up up and down with those agencies depending on how the business was going uh so I think uh hiring uh over hiring is a real problem uh the other thing I think is like when another way to spend money poorly is like a beautiful office I remember walking into some director consumer Founders businesses when I was running native and I was like wow this brand is super successful look at how nice this office is they have a big they have a logo on their uh you know on the wall right when you walk in after we sold our business the first time PNG came to our office because you know we had been doing it offsite so as not to tell everyone you know if if 13 people from Proctor and Gamble walk into our office with eight people people are going to be like hey what's going on here so we kept meeting offsite and finally when they walked in they you know there was a sticker on the door that said native like it was a it was a sheet of paper I had written out native by uh with a sharpie marker and taped it on the door and that was our office it was like you know done with one penny uh and they were like is this seriously your office I was like yeah of course this is our office and they're like this is the cheapest office I could possibly imagin and I was like hey we care about dollars and so you know I used to be afraid of being Frugal and I'd be like wow I'm so embarrassed now I'm like it's a real badge of honor we're running a fiscally cons like you know we're fiscally conservative when it comes to this business and we care about dollars and they're my dollars I want to spend them well uh so I think that's the second thing and I think the third thing is really poor marketing a lot of founder like if I could if I ask a Founder hey what is your CAC last month and you don't know that is a terrible sign if you're doing under $40 million a year in revenue and you don't know what CAC was last month that's crazy if you don't know what your CAC was yesterday that's okay but like you should know what it pro you probably should know and if like you know you know if I ask you at 10: am and you don't know that's okay if I ask you at 2 pm and you still don't know where your CAC is yesterday that's a real problem you're just not involved in the numbers enough like this is how you grow these businesses it's paid ads or uh some sort some sort of advertising spend uh versus a return on that investment and if you're not familiar with those numbers you're you know being grossly negligent with your business and you you used to do a bunch of like kind of like Hands-On unscalable stuff like this so I think you know I don't know to this day but like you I showed you what we do as far this morning we were talking and I showed you what we do as far as like every day in Excel we handw write here's how much we spend here's the here's the new customers we got here's the Blended Ras here's the CAC here's how much from email and we write that every single day into this like spreadsheet and I'm sure there's like more automated ways to do it but it's not perfect and the practice of doing it by hand makes you think about each of these numbers because you're like why is this number always 52 and like I need to get this number to not be 52 I'm tired of writing effing 52 on this spreadsheet like I just if this business if this number was 42 we would be making so much more money okay that becomes my daily Focus um what are some and I I've seen you tweet out about like people going and like like go they go to Target they like watch the aisles themselves to see how people are buying their brand or what they're not you know what what they're doing when they choose the brands what are some of those unscalable things you've done yourself or what are your favorite kind of like give me some Scrappy stories of like stuff that that like you did as an operator or your favorite operators have done sure um you know I used to email every single customer native and I was like hey what um you know you bought our deodorant uh do you like it or do you not like it if you like it leave a review and if you don't like it email me back and tell me why you don't like this and you know we were doing 300,000 $250,000 in Revenue before before we heard our first customer service uh rep like I was looking at every single one of those emails being like what's working here and what isn't and that's how we got our product better we' listen to Consumer feedback and you know we sent out you know we were doing 500 600 orders a day probably more than that so we're getting a lot of customer service responses to that type of inquiry but literally every single customer who ever purchased from us I would wait like you know five days until it was too late for you to return the product because if you emailed us and you're like I hate this thing can I return it I want to be like no you're we're past the return deadline you can't do that any longer so I literally had it scheduled for like you know a native you could return a product for 30 days I had it scheduled to go out day 40 because I was like you know it's going to take five days in shipping and so day 40 we would email you and be like tell us what you like and what you don't like and uh you know we're going to go and try and fix these things we once had we invited a bunch of consumers to a location and then started grilling them with questions hey you you know they were consumers that had purchased from us a bunch they lived in San Francisco and like why do you like native deodorant why do you think it works better than other deodorants in the market because uh and you know people would be like it has probiotics that's why it works better than uh than other deodorants and I was like what makes you like it does have probiotics but you have no idea whether that's effective or not but I was like no matter what we do with our formula we have to keep some level of probiotic in there because people think probiotic means efficacy whether it does or not and so those were the types of things that were really interesting and fun and um you know non-scalable you know I also you were talking about um Solon was talking about my business and how I pack boxes I did pack boxes I packed boxes until we were probably doing about $8,000 in Revenue a month like you know Monday Wednesday and Friday I would go home after working put on Star Trek and start packing boxes and you know I was like okay I I knew how much a box weighed I knew how much filler paper to put in there I knew how much a box weighed when like you know with de over and without deodorant um I knew how to optimize those price I I I knew when we were creating custom boxes I was like I want our box away 1 oun and not 1.3 ounces because at 1.3 ounces it tips us over this level and at 1 ounce it doesn't uh I'd go to our contract manufacturer all the time be like hey we're seeing these types of fuckups what's going on here and so I was like intimately familiar with the formula I knew the steps to how to pour the a formula what what temperature we poured out at and like native was being hand poured we were making 20,000 units of native at degr a day and we were hand pouring each single bar so there was there were about a hundred people working in Austin Texas hand pouring deodorants and um you know the best person could handp about a th000 deodorants a day and a new person could handp about 75 deodorant a day and we had to train these people to go from 75 to a couple hundred or 500 and that was really interesting as well and so there was a and I mean that's not scalable certainly handing deodorant isn't scalable but we went from 500 units of deodorant a week to 21,000 a day still handp pouring so it was more scalable than I thought it was going to be and how much of that is you being a maniac versus like good strategy right so like if somebody in my company was doing that be like why are you doing this you need to hire somebody so you could do something higher leverage but clearly it kind of worked for you to be like a maniac and doing all the things yourself so like you know what's the line what's the right way to think about that uh yeah that's a great question I think if you're in completely divorced from customer feedback you're setting yourself up for disaster unless you've created you know a flywheel that you know exactly how it works like you know when native was doing $100 million of sales a year I probably wasn't in customer service any longer but when it was doing 50 million in sales a year I was in you know I was probably the number one if not the number two customer service agent and so like you know you need that feedback to understand what's working and what's not where are their problems in my business and where they're not and so uh like I don't know what the right line is but divorcing yourself from customer feedback at under $25 million a year is bananas to me you're not going to know what people love about your product and what they don't love and you're not going to know like you know we'd have operational issues I wasn't aware of we'd be like shipping is taking an extra 3 days when it go when it's going to California what's going on here like is there a problem in California is there a problem with our Shipping Company sometimes we'd run out of things and no one would know until a customer emailed us being like hey I'm waiting four days and we're like we're out of this we're out of coconut and vanilla I don't believe and then we check our inventory and we're like how did we run out like we did such a poor not only did we do a poor job of inventory forecasting we weren't even aware of that we ran out when we ran out and so uh those were a couple of the ridic ridiculous things that would happen uh but like you know because you're intimately involved you're able to like you know understand the business at a deeper level and I think like really being engaged at you know what does my shipping look like you know how can I make shipping faster so I can reduce costs is the weight of the box or the weight of the filler or the size different there was a company that I knew that I was friends with the CEO in San Francisco his he was shipping through Amazon and his box uh that he was shipping in was about a half inch too large and it went from being extra like it went from being like a large box to a custom large box and so his shipping rate went up like $70 a box because of this half inch he had and like you know when people discovered it or when he discovered it he's like I can't believe we've been shipping like this for so long you know if you're intimately involved you're probably going to catch those things a little bit earlier right and so you let's zoom out so you um you've seen D Toc change you uh you also have seen you know you also invest in the stock market and so you've seen Shopify Amazon Facebook give me on each of those three stocks give me your lay of the land on like what you think has happened and where you think that those are going are they trending are they rightly priced are they underpriced are they overpriced you know give me give me sh let's do Shopify first and then uh we'll do Facebook and then Amazon sure okay and for context I've lost millions of dollars in Shopify stock in the last six months uh and you know I wrote this Twitter Thread about it as well and I was like uh Shopify keeps uh their their motto is To arm the rebels and I I said they keep giving us muskets in a war that's being fought with like nuclear weapons and you when you put out tweets like this and you you basically say hey here's what I think you should do with your strategy or if I was CEO here's what I'd be doing or like as somebody who's lost millions of dollars on your stock here's some things that I think could help do you ever hear back is it crickets do you get other interesting inbound what what happens after you put that out there cuz I've done that a few times and I've gotten very interesting uh situations occur from my my my tweets like that what's happened for you definitely interesting situations uh Toby who's the CEO of Shopify respond and he's like these are great points so did Harvey who's the president and definitely had some more interesting calls and I'm not sure if that TW that Twitter thread which was a couple months ago now you know inform them and help them create this lookalike audience system that they're creating at Shopify but that's wonderful I don't want any credit just go do it so that we can go get cheaper you know cost customers so that we can acquire customers at a cheaper rate and build better businesses like you know go build out these products and make the platform fantastic you know a bunch of people pay clavio more than they pay Shopify a bunch of people pay recharge more than they pay Shopify like these are Shopify apps that provide you with a small segment of like or a small thing compared to what Shopify uh enables you to do you know provide some of these services at cheaper costs or build in some of these services to make the platform better like you know triple will is doing a fantastic job at analytics why doesn't Shopify build their own subscription platform instead of Outsourcing it to recharge which everybody hates and which charges a fortune like what's going on there it's been you've been publicly traded for years this this is arming us with uh this is arming the rebels and so let's let's shift away from D Toc let's do other types of investing because you do real estate um you've tried to buy pieces of sports teams you've tried a bunch of different things so let's just start with the big picture so give me a a pie chart percentage wise of what do you do with your money so you you you came to a bunch of money you what's in cash what's in real estate what's in stocks what what are you doing percentage wise roughly for those great question um great question and I think the answer is I should know the answer I I know my CAC from yesterday that yeah and this is me not knowing my CAC which is embarrassing um the V like uh probably around 10 million in private Equity um probably around 40 million or 50 million in cash uh which is a lot and not like cash cash where I'm like literally holding it in cash but like really short-term bonds waiting for bond prices to go up and so now I'm starting to leg into positions where I feel like interest rates are getting more more exciting and so I'll put my money there um so you know I've been investing in really short-term bonds that you know aren't really subject to much interest interest rate risk because they've got six-month maturities and not fiveyear you know uh bonds that are more subject to interest rate risk and you know since interest rates have gone up over the last last four months I've started to deploy more capital in that respect uh but a lot of cash um probably 25 million in real estate 30 million in real estate that I'm like you know that I or you know my family owns and we're operating ourselves and then probably another 10 million in real estate as LP somewhere uh here or there um I don't know how much money that is uh but then there's like you know I don't know then there's like random probably another 10 million in um startup invest ments um so maybe more than 10 million in start Investments good question probably around 10 million in the stock market uh maybe a little bit less now that Shopify and Facebook have gotten cremated uh so maybe less than that now but I'm not exactly sure what the amount is there and why such a big cash position is that to be conservative is that just I'm so busy I haven't figured out how I'm going to deploy all this or is it like intentional like no I want to have let's say 50% 40 50% cash and kind of bonds it's more reactive than it is proactive like I'd love to be more invested and part of it was actually like you know proactive in terms of waiting for interest rates for to go up again because you know if you invested two years ago or three years ago you've barely gotten any return on your dollar so I like we can sit on cash and not be subject to so much interest rate risk now I'm getting more excited about that but a lot of it is um you know when you get to a certain scale of wealth you hire professionals who are like private wealth managers to help you deploy your capital in a way that's really intelligent and a way that's unique and um you know supposedly gives you a Competitive Edge because you have more Capital to deploy so you're able to hire smarter people to deploy that and you know earn a greater return that's the shtick that they sell you I'm not sure that stick Is Real at all like uh private wealth managers have been really disappointing like no one is doing anything unique in this industry you know if you ask two private wealth managers what's the difference between you and this other person they'll just [ __ ] on the other person and you'll be like what are you going to get me like what are you going to invest me in that this person isn't like what's your competitive Advantage do you have access to deals that this person doesn't have access to uh they're like no we're both managing the same amount of money we've been around the same amount of time and they're like you know have you heard of Elliott I'm like yeah I've heard of Elliott it's the Wall Street Journal every [ __ ] day I'm pretty sure everyone could get me in there like you know their fund is20 billion dollar I'm sure anyone could get me in there and they're like yeah anyone could get you in there but we know them really well I'm like okay I don't know what that means um and so like I guess where I've been disappointed and where I've been lost in this world uh is how do I deploy my capital in a really effective way and you know every like you know if I tweet something about this I tweet tweeted like hey if you've got $300,000 if you're earning $300,000 a year it's really hard to know what to do with your money you're not rich enough for the private wealth manager and you're too um Rich for the Bank of America person who sits at the retail branch and you know I got a bunch of um people who are like I do this for 300 thou people who earn about $300,000 a year I didn't bet any of them but like they were aggressive and like you know these private wealth managers if you sell a business they just reach out to you and they're like help us let us manage your money and you're like what are you going to put me in and literally none of them say anything unique none of them have their own things they're just like we're going to invest you in this other guy's uh fund and every private wealth manager can get you in there for instance with public equities they all tell you go invest with parametric they do tax loss harvesting so you'll get an extra 0.25% to 0.5% return over the S&P 500 if you invest with parametric as opposed to doing this as just investing in a Vanguard ETF but they all tell you to do that why would like you know why use Goldman Sachs instead of First Republic instead of a smaller Boutique fund if you're all just going to invest with this dollars with parametric you're all the same at that point it's like you know it's like buying an airline ticket from kayak or Expedia but riding on American Airlines and getting the exact same C ultimately you're getting the same product and so I haven't been smart enough and spent enough time figuring this stuff out gotcha and then what about uh crypto you don't do anything crypto and is there like a strong opinion like oh it's all you know bazy or or or or you just haven't had time uh very little with crypto I'm like an investor in a couple fund of funds that have made a fortune in crypto so these funds have returned a significant amount and it wasn't in their sort of like fun Charter to go invest in crypto but they did it anyway and they're like look we're up you know 10,000% so you can't complain you know they're like look we turned your dollar into $10,000 you can't be you can't be an [ __ ] LP and be like what the [ __ ] you can't do this they're like here's $10,000 shut the [ __ ] up so you know they can do it um generally I just don't understand the value yet and um so I've been hesitant to get in there I'm I'm not opposed to it you know everyone says invest 5% of your net wealth in it I wouldn't invest 5% of my net wealth in it um you know it's hard because uh the SARS of the world are like Bo you're not investing in crypto what the [ __ ] are you doing and the waren buffets of the world are like if you offered me all the crypto in the world for $20 I would not buy it and so um I guess I've just been sitting on the sidelines I don't know if it's good or bad uh but if someone has a strong opinion can convince me please do so okay I'm gonna resist the urge to do that now because people have heard rant too many times on it um all right so let's let's do a little bit like uh let's do a little touch on a real little real estate then we'll do the personal stuff so real estate yeah you've been deploying but now it feels like the landscape has changed I think you kind of have an opinion on what's changed give me your current take on like what do you see and what are you doing yeah so uh I left a native in uh February 2020 and um right when Co was gonna hit like I was like I'm gonna go to Europe and I'm GNA I'm gonna go to France I'm gonna try and drink all of the wine they produced in 2019 in February 2020 in France and uh then Co hit and instead I was stuck with my parents like you know all day uh and it was a very different experience than I suspected it was going to be um and so I started buying real estate and so from like January or from February 2020 to probably the end of 2021 I bought about 50 or so units um generally single family home some duplexes some fourplexes uh two units in uh you know all and aside from those 50 units two units in like uh California where uh they're like old apartment buildings that are really small and were renovating and then I was an LP in a bunch of different funds um you know everyone who bought in 2019 you look like a [ __ ] genius like people are like wow you're such a a Savvy real estate investor I was like I I started buying because I had nothing else to do you know if they were going to return money they're going to return 5% they're returning 12 14% now and that's fantastic but I'm not sure I was very Savvy about it um I I haven't used leverage which is really stupid of me and you know uh it's really stupid today because if I borrowed you know a year ago I would have gotten two and a half percent interest I could have just invested a 10-year bond and made money I just haven't used leverage in part because I'm too lazy to try and get it in part because I'm like you know I've got enough Capital to deploy already um and the returns have been fantastic you know I I bought homes and I was underwriting for 6% returns that are 12 14% returns they're crazy I bought a fourplex for $600,000 I thought each unit would rent out for like $800 they're each renting out for about $1,400 now so it's I'm making a fortune uh people are struggling with rents and so state governments are often stepping in and providing rents to landlords like you know we get a call being like hey joh C pay's rent we're going to cover the rent for the next 18 months and you know they'll cut you a check for 18 months of rent and late fees which is bananas um and so it's been a fantastic investment but yeah I am slowing down now and uh do you think where do you think this goes are you gonna you're slowing down but is are you slowing down because you sort of are like okay I'm allocated how much I want to be allocated or you're slowing down because like wait this no longer these prices no longer make sense uh it's not even the prices don't make any sense any longer because I have this this is the one asset class where I'm like I have a really long-term view you know stocks I look I've been in shop if I never sold a share Facebook I've been in I've never sold a chare have had them both for five years if not longer uh Microsoft I've been in for more than a decade I remember buying it while I was in my admin Law class in law school and I've still held every one of those shares so like you know generally I I like I I'm a pretty good long-term investor real estate I think of myself as a like you know I will never sell any unit uh in in real estate like my children will inherit this um or you know natural disasters will take these things uh into the ocean I'm okay with either of those but I will not sell one under any circumstance so I'm not really worried about prices uh you know in terms of cap right longterm but I do think there'll be a small Market correction so I I guess I've slowed down my purchasing I'm still uh under contract to buy two or three units in the next couple months but I'm not like before I was trying to buy you know a unit a week or you know two units a month and now I'm sort of like let me buy a unit a month or less just to see what happens to the market as interest rates go up I think these prices will come down a little bit but I like you know I a lot of my cash is in real estate you know 25 $30 million uh I I'm not scared like you know if the market crashes no nobody will be more excited than me I will deploy all the cash I'm sitting on for this I have no problem if that $30 million goes down to five I will not get like this is the one asset class where I will not get scared I will double triple or quadruple down as opposed to being like oh my God I got to sell what I've got and that's just because you're like this is a concrete assets there's limited Supply there's always GNA be demand it's such a daisy mentality you know it's like my parents mentality of like it cash flows it's immune to Facebook ad prices it's immune to the stock market it's like generally uh like it's real diversification for my e-commerce and startup Investments like these things they exist um they're generally they're primarily in the South with the exception of a few in California and a few in Colorado they're places where people are moving to and not moving from um and so I'm excited about them and uh yeah so I would never I I have no desire to sell them get emails and calls all the time no excitement whatsoever to sell love holding this stuff and generates a ton of cash and you know the other way I think about it is um and this is also pretty Daisy mentality is like okay I've got all these expenses per year and no job I need something to make up for that like these expenses like I don't want to dip into capital I don't believe in like like the balance never goes down and the balance always go up that's right I'm terrified of the balance going down and so I'm like I need something to afford my lifestyle and this real estate helps me afford my lifestyle how do you think about that that's uh I'm I don't know if I'm just too dumb or too lazy but it's one of the two where I'm like um I basically picked two lanes to think about and I was like I don't really have the like mind share to be able to think about like if I go into real estate today I'm the dumbest guy in the room okay well it doesn't take a genius to do real estate so that's okay I think if I put my mind to it I could do that but that's now mental cycles that are not going towards my business or the stuff I'm more interested in where I think I can have a bigger Edge where I think I can be more like the top 1% rather than like the 60 you know 60 percentile or whatever sure and so that that's the first part is like do I want to try to learn this game from scratch if I'm going to do anything direct or even if I'm going to invest in funds I got to have some ability to vet these funds and pick but okay they're they're all pretty safe you can get your 5 six% it seems like you know without it's not totally variable like that um the other thing is like in direct I'm just like who is going to have the time to manage all this like I did one transaction buying my house that I was going to buy I was going to live in in San Francisco and just the process of the dealing with the bank to get the loan and then the closing the escrow and then the inspections and it was like um I couldn't do anything else I was like paralyzed from from like actually doing stuff I liked cuz I was constantly having to nurse this project and I I was like I can't imagine buying 50 units in a year um or you know 20 units in a year and like the amount of just transactional like Logistics that I would have to go through it's such a turnoff from I'm like for what is the return basically the same average as the stock market in long term okay like I don't have to diversification is not that important to me to like do both of those things like the mental Cycles Plus the physical energy it would take to do the transactions and then manage them and then like you know my my tenant calls you know my property manager calls me about the tenant that's calling me about whatever I don't actually even know what goes into it but I know it's not nothing and right now my tolerance is nothing for like for like headache yeah and this isn't like you know someone calls you on a Monday being like my AC is broken and it's in San Antonio Texas you can't be like okay I'm gonna get back to you Thursday like you know it's 110 degrees outside you need to get that fixed in the next 12 hours so you're right there is a lot of pain there when I was purchasing manager I rent the current place that I live in and I called him I was like hey there's like a weird smell he's like okay so like where's it coming from I was like I don't know it's a smell I can't see it he's like okay like what kind of smell like I don't know it's just like bad it's like smells really bad he's just like you got to give me something and I was like and it's Sunday and like you need to send someone here because I can't have a house with a bad smell like and I'm just like I got kids you know that that's the card and I'm like you got to send somebody now to figure out this mystery thing and then the the guy comes over he's like where's the crawl space I'm like I don't know it's not my house I don't know go ask this guy in Arizona who owns this house who's 90 years old go ask him where the crawl space is of this property because it's his problem to like fix this for me and I'm just going to be a baby about it and then I think about what it's like to be on the other side of that and I'm like is that worth the like $500 like net that he's making per month on my on my rent it's like probably not for me definitely not yeah yeah yeah you're absolutely right about that and what was in the crawl space was like a I don't know we never found it the guy didn't get back to me and now I'm pissed we have no idea where where it is the guy like sealed up one hole so he's like maybe this will help the smell go away that was it I was like okay well we still don't know what's causing the smell you just bottled it up like whatever's in the wall that's dead or whatever's going on here is like you know he's like he the guy came over and on Google translate he typed out he's like if the smell's still here tomorrow I'll come undo the whole wall thing I just did and I'll go find what's in there I was like bro can't you just do that now can we not go into the wall now why do we gotta do that put that on Google translate that's hilarious um yeah a bunch of a bunch of the real estate I bought is like an auction and so um when you walk like they're very there's no inspection there's no financing ability like you know you bid on an auction you you write you know you wire the money the next day and then you open the house and you're like what did I just get into and so um sometimes you'll walk in like there was one house I I purchased and the guy passed away not in the house but like everything was still inside of his house forks and knives spoons his cars were in the garage get a safe in there we had to empty the entire house out before we could rent it out and you know you have no idea and like that was a mediocre situation because like you know everything was still in okay shape he used to live there there was another house I got that was in perfect shape like you couldn't like you know you go into the house and you like try and look through the blinds to find out what the condition is going to be inside this one you couldn't see at all it's the only house I've been to where I was like I couldn't see it all and I opened up the lock when after bought it and it's in perfect condition there have been houses that I bought I walk in I'm like [ __ ] I ju you know I'm going to have to spend $40,000 that I didn't underrate for replacing the roof or changing the tile or putting in a new kitchen and so it is a lot of like rolling the dice uh at least in the the way that I've purchased and sort of U using you know the law of large numbers to be like this is going to make sense at some point and sometimes it does and sometimes you get screwed and you know you just eat the ones that got screwed like there have been two that I've purchased in two years ago that are still not rented because I haven't done the work to go and fix the houses to make them habitable um and that's you know that's a lot of capital being that was deployed and nothing's happening with right now that yeah you need to just like get some YouTuber who does like he's trying to make content about like renovating home be like hey you can use my home and like you get you know x% and you get to use all the content this is your home sir go ahead and make and flip this thing definitely be great you and your brother both do this which is I think you treat business like a like a like business is your fun like your adventure I I feel the same way and I asked him cuz I he he gave me money and he he was like I'm going to advise your your company and I was like cool but like just so you know like why are you doing this like I want you to do this but like as your friend I'm like why are you doing this this is a waste of your time like this is never going to make enough money to move the needle like your share of this is never going to make enough money to justify the time and energy and like it's not going to move the needle for you so like really this makes no sense why are you doing this and he goes he said something he goes um he goes like I am not happy unless I am like um entrapped in you know in a business and he's like but as he's like as long as I get to create the I want to live in a prison of my own making and like as long as I get to choose I'm good but like I'm also not like I can't be content and fulfilled unless I'm like unless I'm locked into like a raging battle with like you know some like business thing and I was like wow that's crazy but it also makes sense to me and you're the same way when you're like how do I do real estate on hard mode like you could just LP a bunch of funds and you're like no I'm GNA go buy stuff I'm not just going to buy good stuff I'm gonna buy stuff at auctions that I'm going to go have to take like a you know 2x4 and break off a lock and then like walk in and see what I got and then like figure out how to turn this into like $1,400 a month of rent and you're like yes sign me up whereas I'm like that's like that's what you do to get to your your spot you got there and then went back back to the beginning and like I'm now going to call you I don't even know this analogy but like I always heard my Engineers talk about servers that run on bare metal like I don't know enough about servers to know what the [ __ ] that means but it was always like what's the most like hardcore way this server can run it's like optimized for performance and like just the just the term bare metal like just told me everything I needed to know about what the hell they were talking about it's like this kind of waste of time hard mode way of doing something that does yield like the best return and like satisfaction of like optimizing the I was like squeezing the juice out of the fruit and like to me it's like Mo you're like you like to operate on bare metal it's like you're choosing to like play this game on like you're like how do I handwrite my UTM parameters on my ads and then like how do I you know stock my deodorant sticks myself and answer every customer service question and then how do I like buy real estate at a foreclosed auction with no financing and no diligence and then like figure out how to make that work you're bare metal you know there is like um first the I learned how to break into houses like I learned how to pick locks because of real estate like I can walk into a house now and like open it up pretty much because and like I I carry tools with me when I'm traveling to these houses to be able to like open up homes so that I can go inside which is a little bit crazy um in fact I saw my parents my parents are you know two old like an older uh Indian couple obviously that are like infirm and walk you know my mom will be like my knee hurts and she walks with a limp and then when she's trying to break into a house with me she'll turn into like Yoda where and she can do spins she's like what if I climb up to the top of the ceiling and like go CH you know Jimmy down the chimney I think I can get us in there and I'm like I thought your knee hurt but now now you're perfectly fine you can like climb this wall and like you know go up the uh go up the into the chimney and she's like yeah I got it for this uh but I think that really I think there's a lot of um in my family there's just a lot of interest in business and so being an LP is a ton of fun and I'm an in a bunch of these uh real estate funds and I'm like looking at the numbers and some are making good money and some aren't but like you know there's no um sexiness to it it's a it's a paper money like you know bring me the sexy problems like oh your toilet is broken what the [ __ ] are you doing here why is there toilet break every day uh oh the government is going to write me a check for 18 months this is crazy the government is going to pay me late fees the government is going to call me and be like hey Moyes You' got a house here this guy can't pay his rent we're going to pay you $8 months of future rent and the last two months and late fee for the last two months tell me why you're doing this how did you get to this uh who thought this was a good idea uh you know does Greg Abbott think this is a good idea because that's a lot of money you're GNA give me and so um you know business is great and making money is great but it's a lot more fun to be an active participant rather than a Sidelines part participant like I don't want to I don't want to read what's in the Wall Street Journal and be like okay that's great I want to be like a part of that system that's going on there's a great like analogy where this guy who's a partner at a big law fir his name was Joe Flom he worked at scad Arps uh this was back in like the 80s and 90s where there were all these mergers happening um he he was like 80 years old and he slipped and fell in his bathroom and his head was bleeding and uh he walked into this board meeting because he was part of this board that needed to bend off a hospital acquirer and he had paper towels on his head because he was bleeding and he was 80 years old and people were like what the [ __ ] is going on you're bleeding profusely in your 80s like I slipped and F like go to the hospital and he's like no I want to be here and they're like what what's going on he's like I don't care if I'm you know acquiring a company or fighting off an acquirer I just want to be in the game and nothing is going to stop me and this guy was 80 and bleeding and had paper towels on his head but he wanted to be in the game and I really respect that like I want to be in the game that's the where there's uh a lot of fun in life you um you watch basketball right yeah do you which like athlete or in any sport it doesn't matter which athlete are you like I admire their like the way they do their thing is how I do my thing or how I want to do my thing yeah Tom Brady Tom Brady for two like I remember he won a Super Bowl and there was a 60 Minutes like uh interview with him at 27 he was this was not as like you know seventh Super Bowl this is like his second and they're like so what do you you know you're a Super Bowl champion uh NFL MVP what do you think and he's like is this all there is to life like that's what he said at the end he's like is this all there is and you know then he retired after after two weeks he's like I got to get back in the game I had two weeks off this is boring I need to be back in the game and he's just like an ultimate competitor and I really admire that about it but I'm sorry that was the answer to the question that's that's great uh I don't do you have five five more minutes I want to do personal stuff all right so so what were you gonna ask about the athlete stuff though I didn't mean to interrupt you no that's what I was asking I just wanted to know who you who you admire I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so but shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better you we had a little dock I said put down some bullet points I said you don't have to explain what they mean but uh give me some nuggets that we could go off of on it you had a section personal stuff and you go you have two that are really interesting to me you go I don't know how to spend money what does that mean yeah um you know I'm living in airbnbs that are like five grand a month uh I don't have a car I don't have a house uh I live out of a suitcase um and like you know when expensive things are like nice I'm like can I afford like I still do the math of being like this seems too expensive for the value I'm getting even though that like you know at this point $1,000 do probably has no value to me not like no value but like it it's not going to materially change my life and I'm still so cautious when I'm spending $20 I don't know what the I don't know how to get this out of my system do you know how to get it out of your system um I don't know how to get it out of my system I have no problem spending money um SP too much money but like I've seen this and I think you know the one of the main things is I see my dad and my dad has done really well right like for he's got the same immigrant story that like everybody has which is you come to the country he had I think $91 that was starting point right so that's the before and then like you know he's made good money in his lifetime uh nothing like you know crazy to write home about but like especially from a $91 starting point like they they have my parents have enough money to do whatever they want they really don't need a penny pinch but like you know if we go to Starbucks and it's like you know would you like the he's like can I have the small they're like okay it's called tall he's like no but what's a smaller than tall because I feel like tall is going to be overprice he's like you know this is $3 like I I can make this it's mostly water like he'll be talking to the people about it right I'm just like oh my God like not only is this embarrassing but like it's embarrassing in the moment cuz he'll just be like let me clarify you're saying the thing that's mostly water is $380 sense like hold on hold on stop the line what's going on here or like you know you know he'll pack seven people into a hotel room cuz like you know we can make it work it's like yeah do we have to um like we're on vacation here why does it have to be a struggle and like and so you know I just saw he could never get it out of his system like those those the scarcity mindset was just so like ingrained in him because and it's like all right I get it like he had no safety net he had $91 like every dollar counted and like it wasn't about spending it was about like saving to get to build a safety net cuz you're in this new you're in a foreign country your parents can't help you nobody can help you like and so I get that but I saw that like oh wow you know actually the money come it wasn't logical like once the money was there that didn't change the mindset didn't change so it's like I had to separate out there's a mindset around money and then there's like The Logical like situation about the money and like there's actually like they're unrelated you would think once The Logical situation changed the mindset will change and it's like no it doesn't so it's like an active thing and so then I just started to like one of the reasons I ask you who you admire and you're like I admire this guy who's got like a bloody head going into the board meeting because he wants to do business that bad I would view that as a failure and you view that as a success and like because I have this belief which is you become what you admire like like fundamentally yeah if you admire something you're going to strive to it so it makes a lot of sense to really pick and choose what you admire like I'll give you an example A lot of people admire Elon Musk and I think Elon Musk is obviously super incredible in a couple of ways like he is one the greatest inventor and businessman of our time and like you know the greatest since Steve Jobs I would say but like you know I think he's like an Edison of our time great sure um but he's also had I think like you know I don't know four failed marriages and like that's not something I want for myself so like I got to be careful to admire the like the the all-encompassing person because I don't want the all the full result of that like the you know and so you kind of gota like so I got I got really specific about what I admired and once I admired certain things and I started to live life like those people I was like well this guy's really really happy and like wow he's like pretty generous and he's not generous based off of having this like huge amount of wealth he's generous because like he doesn't feel super scarce about money he doesn't feel this lack of money um and so he's like willing to give and like he's willing to give freely and he doesn't think twice about it and then he doesn't Pat himself on the back about it either like oh wow I really admire that about him like I want to be more like that and so to me the only thing that got me to change my mindset was knowing that it's not going to change based on how much money is in the bank and B like I have to change who I admire if I'm going to like change who I become right because like I will naturally start to follow those blueprints uh and observe people doing those things and be like Oh downloaded that like I will um I will make that H I will make that happen like I'll give you a little small win for me on this front like uh I was just on vacation I was in Hawaii last week and like uh my parent my dad is like I said like a horrible Tipper and like so my whole life I basically saw my mom being like tip him and my dad being like you don't have to and like you don't have to or like I did and I'm like he handed him like a one like one one was his tip and like the absolute minimum and I just saw the look in the valet guy's face or whatever like it it wasn't even valet like he wouldn't do valet it's like the face of the guy who you're mandatory he's standing there you got to give him something the Bell hop right and it's like so this time um we get to the place the bellhop takes up our bags you know to the hotel room or whatever and um I felt all those same urges of like my upbringing which was like we can just take the bags oursel it's like yeah but like that's this guy's job and like it's not about being lazy it's like that's how this economy works that's how this ecosystem works if I don't like you got to feed the whole food chain otherwise somebody's not going to eat right so it's like yeah okay I'm going to let him do that then we got to the room was like we have no cash cuz I don't carry any c a dollar bills like I only have cards and so I've been in this situation like five times before and I'm not I'm not proud of it but like I would just like dude sorry I don't like I don't have anything I don't have any cash we just got here I didn't bring cash or I would like you know let the guy leave it at the door and then I'd be like you know not there to like tip the guy and uh at this time I was like I was like hey man like I'm so sorry I don't have any cash on me what's your name and like I made sure I went and got him later and it was like again whatever 10 bucks but those 10 bucks meant a lot to to me and like yeah okay that's a step in the direction of the guy who's not like has this lack mindset or scarce mindset about money and is looking to like hold on tightly to everything or like avoid paying things it's like no no no um like you know make it happen I actually had like a a pretty comical series of events where on even on this trip where I like my kid is two and a half but it but I don't know if you know kids fly free under two um and so I bought first class tickets cuz I'm trying to be a baller shot caller but then I do the laptop I lie about her age to make sure she's under two and like I knew in the moment I was like this feels wrong but I was also like the logic was like well it's like couple thousand bucks to buy this 2-year-old kid a seat like am I really going to do that and then everybody told me they don't check so I'm like I'm going to get away with it and I got penalized so bad for this cheapness that like it was just Karma teaching me this wonderful lesson because we get to the plane and they're like oh you guys can't sit like sorry you can't board the plane I'm like what do you mean like not only can I not board the plane I'm first class I get to board first and they were like no actually you have like two lap infants cuz you got two little babies there's only like X number of masks in the top thing so like there's three masks and there's four of you we can't let you board This Plane we're going to have to ask to see if somebody wants to switch seats with you for you to get on this plane and I was like what and I was like nobody's going to want to switch seats with the people with the baby like have us sit next to them like this not gonna so sure enough they go on nobody wants to switch I'm like all right we'll we'll take uh like we'll buy another seat like it's too late sir they flight's full I'm like all right we'll we'll go to Coach we'll we'll we'll move back they're like coach is full and I was like all right what's the next flight they're like it's tomorrow I'm like oh [ __ ] I knew this little cheap move on my part of lying about the four months of my kids's age would come back to bite me and it did and so then like we my wife and we had this horrible flight over where like one my wife is on the last row of the plane with a baby in the middle row between two people and like cuz some guy was like I'll give up my middle seat in the back like to and now I'm sitting next to this dude and so instead of having this awesome family experience we're having this terrible one because I cheaped out and so I just started to pay attention to all the ways that saving money was costing me money and costing me like Joy uh rather than like how much it's saving me and like what I what I keep and so then who do you admire then is it is it somebody who's made that mind like who is that yeah like my trainer so like I talk about him a lot it's probably like I roll at this point but like uh the happiest person I know not happy in like a Cheesy way like but in a damn I've never seen this dude not in a good mood and like I've seen him stuck in traffic for three hours I've been late super [ __ ] late and inconsiderate and like you know like but he greets me like he's he's just been having a party he's like dude where you been because his life is a traveling party and so I saw that and I was like man on every conventional metric that like I was raised like you you came from Brown fam it's like he's uh I think he's like 41 42 years old he's not married that's that's a like household disaster if you're like a brown person it's like you know we're having interventions you know if that happens um you know he does well for himself as a personal trainer but he's not like the most successful guy I know like I I'm surrounded by people with more quote unquote success than him um in terms of financial success um you know so like you know just in terms of like the kind of conventional metrics the things I thought were most important you know his scoreboard it wasn't like wow this guy I admire him because he's successful it's like he's successful at the game of life because this dude's never in a bad mood and like because of that everybody wants to be around him he's the most loved guy I know because of that he has these like magical experiences where it's like you go to a coffee shop with this guy and like you're going to have like something if you just hang out with him for three hours like something awesome is going to happen because his mood he's going to make a joke and then that person's going to say this thing then they're going to take us to the back room and hook us up because they just got liked our Vibe and like I tell the story like he goes to the DMV and like he you know he goes to the DMV and it's like DMV is like the classic like worst place on Earth to be and like he went in being like nah dude he looked up the DMV on Yelp it had two stars and he's like I'm gonna have a five star experience because I'm gonna be a five star DMV participant uh you know and just watch what happened so he like walked in with a little pep in his step he's smiling and he makes a joke to somebody and he realiz and somebody's like oh you could I'll just help you out over here and everybody else is grumbling in line like why is this guy getting to go up front she's like don't mind them and then she flirts with him and like she she Hooks and he's supposed to take the test and she's like you know what like it's fine you've been driving for a long time and she just gives him the thing and he's like walks out he's like damn if I could do it at the DMV I can do it anywhere right like awes he's like he's like I wasn't always this way he's like dude I was depressed for a while my dad died and I used to be bitter about him for XYZ and he's like he's like you know I used to be the guy like I didn't want to come out from the covers cuz I just wasn't looking forward to my day like you know you if you looked at me You' just see like a blanket and two eyeballs cuz I just didn't want to get out of bed and he's not saying this as a motivational talk cuz he doesn't he's not a motivational speaker it's just like he's my personal trainer I just happen to hear these stories so when I heard this I was like okay this dude is winning the reason I want this money this family this all these things because I want to feel good this dude just feels good on auto like he feels good no matter what situation you put him in so that's like an invincibility right like he is unconditionally feeling good so that's the guy I started to admire and then I started to pattern myself after things that he was anytime I noticed he did something different than me or my friends or the people around me I like took special note of that and like would lean into trying that out as a new experience to see you know is that part of what makes him him that's really interesting uh and a great story and um you know for a long I feel like everyone I've admired I've just been it's almost like uh sex where I'm just automatically attracted to that person and it's not even conscious like I just get an erection when uh you know I hear about Tom Brady because I'm like wow guy is awesome and really good at what he does and he's this ultimate competitor and wants to win um and I never real I never even thought that you could choose who you admire I just assumed it was like you know your sexuality where you're like are you attracted to this person it's like comes from here and not here yeah actually maybe that is true I think there's some truth to what you said uh but like in the same way that like we don't all go try to marry porn stars like there's a certain point where you're like yeah what really matters to what what do I actually want and it's like well there's this initial thing this physical attraction which is important uh but then like actually I now know it feels really good have somebody who's caring and thoughtful and like whatever like I can trust and and the the things that are like slightly below the surface that like you're like oh I actually now that I know about it now that I felt it I'm like those are super important I just you know it's just less Primal than like the physical attraction I guess yeah yeah that's a great Point um I've not done a good job of admiring people that I know really well I've only know like you know I admire people that I just hear about their competitiveness and their instinct to win and I'm going to think about that and try to do a better job that your brother's like this your brother's another person I chose to like admire because I was like he's also your brother's also like in a good mood pretty much all the time I I've I've never seen him like I've never seen him either like in low energy like I've never seen him just kind of like on autopilot the switches off and I've also like even when he's like like I've never seen him defeated either um so so you know those are so so you know when I've seen him I'm like he walks into like when your brother walks into the room like he sub he unconsciously goes all right and it's like he's expecting like the parade to start and I'm like bro this is just a bakery but he's like all right what are you doing what are you eating oh is that good all right and like it's not that he's he's not like Mr Smooth socially but his like will to have a good time or like to have the experience like in its fullest actually like imposes its will on everybody else everybody has to participate at that point cuz they're like uh yeah it's a croissant you want to try it oh you know what you should actually do this and it's like he forces the good time out of the the average because he just literally walks in he's like all right what are we doing or he'll be like let's win and I'm like let's win what we're not even like playing any like okay I have to like rise to your level or I have to stop being friends with you because uh that's just the way you're approaching things and like either that's just I'm out or I got to figure out how to be in and being in kind of means like being on and not just being like ho about about life you know yeah yeah I've chosen to stop being friends with him as a result of that no in reality I actually envire him as well and uh I know we're you know we were at uh we were in Texas uh for like Mother's Day and was my father's birthday two weeks ago and um someone had gone to co I think my sister had gone to Costco and bought like you know some Tes of water and like watermelons and I got home and she's like hey Moyes can you get this stuff out of the car it's like heavy and like you know uh I don't want to do it and I like why do you ask Solomon he's been at home all day and she's like he never does anything like he will not lift a finger for this kind of stuff and I was like this is why this guy's always in a good mood no one asks him anything that like you know is uh not enjoyable because they know he's already said no to it so often that it's not like you know it's not something that it's asked or expected of any longer that's why he's always in a good mood but it is a lot of fun to hang out with him like I and you know I've hung out with him often enough to see both sides of that when he like excited and like the energy comes and you know certainly lifts me up and times where he's like more analytical and he's like let's look into this and does this make sense or more like you know um I remember one time when tinyo was struggling I was in San Francisco and he's like we have a new strategy the whole business where instead of creating our own iPhone games we're going to license the intellectual property of others what do you think of this this is like a bet the company move and you know I had no idea I was a lawyer and 22 and didn't know anything um but I was like I could I could get the real sense of like it's not just pure optimism there is a sense of reality there and that also like helped me understand him a lot more too yeah he said something about you that I thought was a baller line that I've I've reused many times which was uh I I don't even know if this is the real thing but this is now the The Legend of it which was when you went to the deodorant business somebody was like Hey Moy like do you even know anything about the deodorant business or like about deodorant and you were like no I know nothing about deodorant but in six months I'm going to know everything there is to know about deodorant and like that's that's enough for me to go like I can start this I don't need to like think of myself as some expert I've used that so many times is that a yeah that's true yeah that was definitely true I remember who it was too actually it was the husband of one of my close friends who's like you don't know anything I was like I use it and I'll be an expert in six months give me six months that's an amazing attitude to have about anything it's like yeah of course I I don't know anything and like give me 6 months I could be pretty like I can be pretty much an expert at anything if you give me six months of obsession and I think it's true with everyone sorry go ahead your brother had some that were like this because I started writing down these traits I was like there's a um what I call is like you know sometimes you have a speaker system you turn it up to level 10 and you're like oh that's pretty loud it's bumping and then you like get in someone's car and it's almost like they got they theirs goes to 14 you're like God I can't hear anything I'm deaf out of two like out of my right ear because like why is your [ __ ] so loud but you're like okay at least I know what loud is now I have experienced loud even if I don't ever want my speaker to be this intense like I now know the level of intensity that exists because I just thought 10 was the max before and like that's what your brother did like we invested in a company together and they were kind of [ __ ] up and I was like dude can you I've been trying to help these guys can you help me help them like he's like yeah great let's like all right let's win and he gets on the call he does his clap and he's like and they're you know they're kind of defeated and he's like okay so well let's raise all this money trying to raise money let's raise the money like let's look at the deck and they like put out the deck and it was like awful and he's like okay so this is bad um but let's fix it like okay so he he he rattled off he's like slide three and he's like super detailed right it's not just like General Rah R he's like slide three that chart it makes me think this you need to flip the numbers to be like visualize it this way like this example here on Google Images and he did that for like this super detailed thing right away and I was like whoa and then he was like all right um they're like wow thank you so much this feedback has been so helpful he's like great um how long do you think it'll take you to to do this like to make these changes and they're like uh I don't know hope I'm gonna work on it today like you know I know it's super important so I'm gonna work on it today he's like great it's to noon now let's talk at 5 and then hey can you just he's like send me a standing calendar invite for 5:00 pm every day for the next seven days until this deck is amazing and he's like let's just keep doing this right like you said it was super helpful right so let's just keep doing this and I was like dude I wouldn't have had the balls tell any company I invest in like let's meet again in 3 hours and it wasn't like forced it like I can't even now when I'm saying it it's not coming out the same way where it was like great let's do this and like let's just shorten the time span right like let's just cut all the fluff okay so you'll make these changes I'll take you a couple hours let's meet again and I was like I've never done two meetings with the same person in one day so then I I was like oh [ __ ] I just found out my knob wasn't even at 10 it was at 7 and like this is what 12 feels like and he we did it every day for 5 days straight until the deck was amazing we would meet twice a day with these people by the end of it they hated us but like the deck was so much like the whole pitch was like the whole business was different basically by the end cuz like usually when a pitch is bad it's like actually the business is kind of bad and um and so once I saw that I was like whoa the Oli Brothers they function at like a different like they have a different level 12 that like uh I like to see and I'm sharing this on the Pod because there's people out there who all the people around them they've never seen like what 12 looks like and I think you guys do this and that's like my favorite thing about you guys that's awesome I'm glad that that worked out and yeah he like he has this insane ability to get the most out of people and like uh without them feeling like it's an ex like without without him forcing it upon you like he would do this when I was running native he'd be like how can you make this deodorant better than Dove and secret and I'm like this guy's an eight billion doll R&D budget I've got 80 bucks I can't do this and he's like here are five things that you can do that like you know and he'll just even though the like three of those things will be outrageous um he'll be like go find a new ingredient that'll work and I'm like what am I supposed to you know dig and find a new element in the periodic table of elements but like two of those things will open up my mind in a way to be like you know what I'm not trying I'm not focusing on the right problem here and I got to stop thinking about retention and customer service and all this other stuff that matters but will matter later on more right now this is my problem and forget everything else and um it's really humbling to be around that like whenever I'm around him I'm always more jazzed about business and my business um and like you know I think we've seen enough where we understand what the problems are right away like I'm in some of these board meetings and I'm like why are we talking about like you know I was in a board meeting a couple weeks ago all we did was talk about fundraising and I'm like this is a waste of my time and your time either you're GNA get this check or you're not going to get this check from this one guy stop begging him like move on why don't we talk about the business and see hey what's working and what's not make a Better Business and the dollars will follow stop wasting time here and and that's like so much of this is experience and I had no idea that it would be experience and I think about this all the time I remember when I was at n when I was at PNG my boss who ran deodorant quit and I was like oh he's quitting I hope he does better and I didn't realize all of the things that would happen to me that um you know now were super clear like he had made all these promises about keeping native independent and amazing and you know not not like forcing his will upon the company and he had protected me from PNG the next guy never made any of those promises and so he didn't really feel like he had to do any of those things and I completely respect that but I didn't even understand what was going to happen when the guy told me he was quitting and now I'm like okay when you know headcount changes this is what's going to happen a new sheriff is going to come in into town he's going to bring in his own minions to working the places that he likes and you either fall into line or fall out like you know leave the group and uh I didn't understand that so much of this is experienced and once you go through those go through these things it's super helpful and you know he's had thought he's had so much more experience than I have and he's been he's a little bit older than me and so he's had it earlier than I have and so he's been this great sounding board for this kind of stuff you uh you tweeted something out that was great you were like here's my uh my project status like uh here's like my my my Excel sheet I use for all my real estate deals and it was just like status of it it's like you know um I I don't remember what it was exactly but it was like sent um reply received waiting for uh paperwork um follow-up needed and then there was one that was just like I'm unsure I don't know what the hell's going like I don't know what the I don't know what's going on I don't know where it's at like I don't know why it's not moving and I was like that's the status that I've needed in every project I've ever done because my I always have you know a tracker for anything I'm doing I'm like all right it's either like I sent it I'm waiting for a reply I got the reply now I need to like reply to them I need to analyze it I need to sign I need to wire the money I need to do whatever but like so often after like 24 hours every whatever status it was in it's now slipping towards the black hole of I don't know what's holding it back from just finishing now and I think that's what you guys do really well which is actually any initiative in any project it's like all right we're trying to you know like get more profitable it's like well we have this big plan and we're doing it and then like surely but slowly but surely like a month in it's like what happened to that whole profab ility thing are we doing it or we not like and it's like yeah everything has slipped into I'm unsure what the [ __ ] going on and I need this like piercing Clarity back and so a I think that was an amazing little tidbit in there of like I need that need that status cuz most things are actually in that that bucket and I need to get them the hell out of that bucket but I had to name it that to like acknowledge what the heck was going on yeah the second is uh another example of the relentlessness thing uh level 12 level 14 on the volume scale like I showed your brother this deal that I was in I wanted to invest in and he was like oh this is like looks great let's like let's do it and I was like okay cool and he's like then every day he would text me like what's going on with that deal and I was like oh yeah like uh no change like I emailed the guy he said he's just he said he's finalizing stuff he'll get back to me by Friday it's like Tuesday so Wednesday he's like yo what's up with the deal and I'm like uh I think it's still the Friday thing I haven't emailed him again you think I should he's like yeah let's email him again and tell him we love this and we want to be involved I was like oh is that like a thing people do like that's just let's kind of fluff him up a bit he's like yeah let's just keep it hot and I was like okay cool then Wednesday Thursday he's like I just feel like we need to do something he's like eventually got to the point where he's like uh what's the guy's Bank let's just wire him a million dollars and I was like we haven't sign anything he's like well once we wire him the money he's not going to wire wire it back so like we're going to secure our allocation in this deal just like let's just send him a million dollars and then he'll kind of be forced to like finalize things with us rather than keep us in this like limbo stage and maybe in the end he'll say hey I can't do the full amount you can only do a quarter of the amount because I got all this other investor interest because we know that's what's going on here and again I was like whoa didn't know that's an option of like you can just wire the guy the money I guess that kind of makes sense and like these are very very valuable uh little tidbits of like yeah to like another example somebody gave us they were like I was like what's your open rate on your push notifications for your app I was like oh it's like 30% I think that's pretty good it's like 20% like I think that's really good industry average like eight we're at 20 I was patting myself out the back I was feeling happy and he's like what do you think the theoretical Max is I was like what he's like what do you think like theor okay he's like it's not literally 100 you're not going to get 100% people some people have uninstalled your app and they have notifications off like what do you think is like like and I was like I don't know what you mean he's like I think I could get 50% of people to open a push notification let me just like see so he sent a push for his app and his app was like it was like a social app like you post photos and he just sent a post notification that said um your Uber is arriving outside um like please like open this to to meet it at the like whatever he like sent a thing that was like your Uber is arriving with your package swiped to like open it up he saw like 55% of people open that thing he's like okay that's like the juice I have to know what's in this push notification he's like that's now the max he's like anything we want's now we know so actually our 20% is not on 100 it's on like 55% is and so everything we do is from here and I remember thinking wow some people in silica Valley are like maniacs like they will push the boundaries in ways that I just really haven't thought of and every time I saw someone break like an invisible wall that I had just had up I'm like oh [ __ ] the game is so much more interesting than I realized and like these people play without the walls oh this is awesome like what what else can I do it's so refreshing to see that kind of stuff when you're like I don't know why I thought this wall existed and now that it doesn't it makes so much sense that it doesn't exist like just break through some it required some genius to break through it and now that he's done it it seems so obvious uh whatever Sal and I look at like deals we're like one of if our investments are like uh you know raising a new round we're always like we want to either uh buy the business I want to buy the whole business run the business or sell my shares all of my shares I want some action so I can't look these are the three options I'll buy the whole thing I'll run the business you quit or get take all my shares and get out of here but I don't want nothing I can't do nothing here and uh it's a lot of fun to like it's a lot of fun to be involved and have that action um uh but you know it makes it so that you admire a certain group of people certainly yeah exactly for better worse and by the way this is a good example I admire that Uber push notific some people like how unethical and weird and like um you know why would you do that and like you know if I told that and I have done this many times like I've told my designer hey let's try this and he looks at me like I'm Bernie maid off saying let's take all their money and run away like you know they think I'm evil when I'm actually just running an exper to me this is like an awesome experiment and it's because I admire people who did some of these different growth hacky things that are like just unusual thought experiments that I'm like oh you the way you think is I want to think uh but not everybody not everybody wants that or even thinks it's good like they think it's bad which is like but knowing that is also where you figure out your lane you're like oh that's my Lane these things I think are easy and fun and good other people think are hard boring or like are like evil and I'm like oh okay cool I I now know what differentiates me versus anybody else there was this one great story at um when I was a native we had we had these uh endc caps for Target like basically like shelving that was going to sit at the end of an aisle and they come in filled with all the deodorant like you know we ship them and all they have to do is take the box off and it's builded and uh so we sent them to Target and uh nobody could find them like you know there were a bunch of targets that were like we don't have this and so we're like okay what should we do and so some PNG person was like okay what we have to do is we need to call up the PNG Target team in Minneapolis they're going to call up Target Target's going to call the distribution facility and then we're going to go all the way back around and we'll find out where they are because we've already shipped them and so um someone on our team was like this doesn't make any sense this is 15 phone calls this is what you guys ordinarily do and they're like this is the only way to do it so we googled Target distribution facility in like New England found their phone number randomly cold call them and we're like hey we work in Native uh I think you've got a bunch of these end caps a bunch of stores don't have it we shipped them to you do you know where they are and they're like give us 20 minutes to look in the facility they called us back and they're like yeah we got them we're going to ship them out in the next truck and that's how we solve the problem and like you know to to the P Anders it had never occurred to directly call the facility and to Google for that number they're like we have to make 15 phone calls and play secretary on the way back and like you know their their mind was blown and for us we're like this is the most obvious thing to do call the person where the problem lies and um it's it's it's crazy to see where those walls are and it's so amazing to break through them and be like this is the way things should be done moving forward can I give you one of those as well when I was when we got by twitch twitch is an Amazon unowned company so it had like the twitch bureaucracy plus the Amazon bureaucracy like there's layers you know and it wasn't all bad but there was certain things you'd run into it's like this pocket it's like oh no I'm stuck in molasses what is that where did I step that like got me stuck and one of them was for a period of time I believe there was something with the Performance Marketing where it's like so how much are we spending on like you know getting like installs and they're like uh you know this amount like cool like what's the cost they're like well we don't really have the tracking I'm like we don't have tracking that's like you know the basic they're like well we don't want to install the Facebook pixel because Amazon doesn't really necessarily want like we have to get approval before Facebook because when Facebook pixel is in your app they have your data they're kind of a competitor to Twitch and to Amazon so like you know there's some sensitivity you have to get that done like so we just spend we don't know any we don't know the we don't have the pixel installed like you I don't even know you can run an ad without the pixel and they're like right and I was like how long's it they're like yeah it's been on legal's desk for like a year and I was like oh my God and so I was like oh wow so it's like we can and so my job was at that time I was like oh dude we're getting our ass kicked in Brazil and like nobody in the company's even paying attention like we need to we need to like win in Brazil and like what happened we used to be number one and we're slipping because like Mobile gaming took off and we don't do Mobile gaming so I was like we need to win and um and so we built a scraper first to like see how fast the competitors were growing because nobody in the company would do anything unless you had a case for how like much how big the market was so I was like well look at the competitors they're like yeah but like we don't know and I'm like all right we we'll build a scraper which is is like startups do this all the time but in a big company it wasn't like super super kosher to do that but I was like all right whatever we'll do it till they tell us to stop and the second thing was I was like oh we don't have this pixel so we can't like run these ads so I was talking I just went on a phone call with this guy who was the number one streamer in Brazil that we had just like paid a bunch of money to like come onto our platform and I was like how would you get a bunch of people to download our app uh if I can't do Facebook I can't do marketing like paid ads and he was like um he's like oh easy boss and he's saying this the translator like he's saying H it's easy boss you know here's what you need to do he's like give me 10 iPhones I was like what he's like buy me 10 iPhones I was like what for I you know like I don't know how to do that he's like I'm gonna give away iPhones iPhones are like gold bars in Brazil if I just say I'm giving away iPhones on my twitch stream everybody download twitch and you know sure enough I get the I just like kind of like bootleg away to get the guy gift card so he could buy iPhones and um he buys 10 iPhones he does a stream where he's like I'm giving away iPhones he's like I'm not giving away the first one until we have a like we have 10,000 people watching my stream go share this text your cousin text your mom tell them to get on this I'm not giving it away until then and then uh and he drum up he had he broke he like had he was the number one streamer on Twitch that day he brought in himself like hundreds of thousands of downloads like the biggest download spike that we had had just by giving away like you know we ended up giving away like five iPhones and like so for five grand basically we did like more installs in a proven way because they were all coming directly off his link to his channel and I was like and people and that's when I knew like twitch might not be the place cuz like I told this story and I'm like I feel like I slayed the dragon and I'm dragging his carcass into the boardroom like in the ninth floor the top floor the mega boardroom are all the the exact S I feel like I'm dragging this carcass in being like you know are you not entertained you know and uh people were like oh like you know that's interesting uh and they just sort of moved on and I was like wait we just discovered this like incredible growth hack to like get a bunch of downloads if we did this thing out of the ordinary like you know can we get a little love here and when I got no love I was like okay um this is not the place for me because if this was my company and somebody did this I'd be like look I don't know if this is good strategy longterm or a bad one it's really irrelevant the fact that you did this we need to tell every team in the company that like something like this is possible in your department like don't get stuck in the masses like find something and try something that works and like these guys have tried nine things that failed tell them tell them about all nine and then tell them the one that worked and like I would have gone on a road show for that and that's how I knew like okay what type of company do I need to be at is one that like celebrates that type of thing that's a pretty amazing story and like really amazing that this guy who's in Brazil is like I know how to get downloads from this street like give away iPhones and get people to download it that's brilliant of him and Brilliant that you found him and like harnessed it and we were like [ __ ] all this red tape I'm gonna figure it out that's awesome what an incredible story finally I'm get finally I'm getting the love I needed I've been waiting two years to just get the daddy I'm proud of you son I'm proud of you moment but I got it now all right man sorry I took you so far over the time limit thank you for coming on yeah appreciate much for a champ yeah where should people find you your Twitter is probably the best spot right yeah Twitter I'm at Mo Al at Mo Ali all right perfect thanks man perfect thanks John talk you soon [Music] n [Music]

larry's page is one of the most impressive individuals you'll ever meet it's really sad he's not more public because i think larry could offer a lot to the world in the way he thinks and the way he talks about things he always takes a bigger point of view and a bigger picture perspective on things when people would suggest products or ideas he wouldn't get into the technical details of the near-term roadmaps he would always zoom out 100x and be like why can't we do x and why don't we search all the world's books was one of the things they proposed doing in 2003 which was a crazy concept but they actually went and then did it right and no one would have done that if not for that suggestion that that audacity of perspective and so they always pushed and challenged every team to think bigger to think more grand to think um more aggressively

[Music] another great opportunity right now is uh free so i look at the whole software market as really backwards okay in which right now it doesn't matter if you're a hubspot or canva eventually someone can just create a me too company and just undercut you on pricing and what i've learned is if you can create a software company that already has a brand that has a free product and you just make it really good for free and you just keep adding more and more to it a great example of this is photo p so there's this company called photo p it's uh uh we love it photoshop and it's like they make very little to no money so i hit up one of my buddies who uh is great at outreaching and i told him i want photo fee i offered him 10 million he said no offered him 20 million he said no i can take photo p make it a really good canva competitor undercut him on pricing whatever be worth 10 20 40 billion whatever they are no but i probably can cashflow that thing to like four or five million a month in ebitda right it's like who cares what it sells for what it's worth you're saying make it free and you're saying a cash flow is like a [ __ ] so what how do you take a free product in cash like how would you explain that well he said he said a canva a canva knockoff canva knockoff so you make you make almost 99 of it for free you charge for one percent but that one percent is enough where you can drive in the revenue so you don't ever make as much as like a canva or like a mailchimp or a hubspot but hey if you can make millions a month in profit it's still good what's your math there so when what's the calculus when you were thinking so like let's say photo p according to similar web has 10 million uniques a month or something what was your math is that right yeah it is right we researched it yeah so like what was your calculus to get to uh four million and even a month like what would how many people would you need to run it and what was the what's the calculus there sure so i can probably get the thing from 10 million visitors i can so let's say i bought it for 20 right he wouldn't sell it to me for 20. um i've never outreached him but i had a buddy outreach to him for me who just does all my outreach so let's say i bought it for 20 i'd put another 10 into it so now i'm out 30 million dollars i'm really good at growing traffic and i know i can grow the team to roughly 40 million uniques a month i just have a i don't know how but for some weird reason i know traffic really well and how to calculate what i can get it to and all this kind of stuff right and i've done enough research and competitors of what features drive x amount of traffic just looking at so many competitors in the space so let's say if i get it to 40 um what is it called 40 million and what what are the one or two things that you'd get at the 40 million like seo basically so uh more seo more virality uh increasing the quality of the templates increasing features uh adding ai in there like click a button we can automatically detect backgrounds remove it filters for social media because a lot of people use them for social media logo generator website as a lead gen [ __ ] like that right so then so let's say you got up to 40 million right at 40 million i can easily monetize let's call it like one percent of the traffic or let's get even more conservative like a half a percent 200 000 people if i have 200 000 people hypothetically paying three dollars a month okay that's 600 000 the reason i give you on average three dollars in certain countries you may want to charge different pricing like india and stuff like that so it's more affordable so three dollars a month and at three dollars a month if a customer stays for 10 months that's 6 million dollars you can probably run the thing with less than a million million and a half and burn each month so then you think oh so then for a million and a half burn you would need once you have tons of revenue right when you don't have tons of revenue your burn is much lower on a monthly basis yeah but so then how many people then if it's you're looking at 30 people you need to run that operation i i don't even think 30 but let's say 30 total so i think i can actually run the thing for under a million dollars a month right so i'm just trying to do the math in my head but i mean the revenue was like 100 million to two there it was like 600 000 or something right 600 000 a month but if a customer stays for 10 months you're looking at 6 million dollars [Music] okay if they're paying three dollars a month if you have 4 40 million not 4 million but 40 million you're converting a half a percent that's 200 000 paying customers a month if they pay you three dollars a month that's 600 000 they last for 10 months that's six million dollars a month in mrr over a year you're making 72 million dollars in revenue that's crazy [Music] wasn't that long ago that this whole operation was just the captain me and a couple of parents but hubspot helped us grow our business across all seven seats hey celebratory cannons hubspot grow better

thinking big that sounds easy enough to understand sounds fun to do why do you think that's hard advice to follow in practice you are inclined naturally as a smart person as a successful person to only do things that you know what you're gonna get as an outcome and guess what that does that limits your horizon and i see this all the time where the teams end up compromising on their big vision and they compromise on the moonshot because they're more likely to succeed and they feel more comfortable taking a shorter range narrower horizon and minimizing the opportunity set significantly and saying i'm just going to go do this because i know if i do x i'm going to get y and that feels comfortable and i know it's going to happen

so i have a friend who's part of it and he's an he runs an agency and i'm pretty sure it's 60 000 a year so quite expensive i think it's only two events a year that they do so it's almost it's basically an events business and they sold for hundreds of millions of dollars recently to uh pe just like i think a pe company and then another one is uh aventa have you heard of aventa i haven't heard of aventa okay so it's e-v-a-n-t-a aventa was sold to gartner for like 250 million dollars and it was almost like the same thing but it was worse because it was advertising driven the reason why we asked you to come on is because chief is awesome and we love community-based businesses and most community-based businesses have horrible business models and from the outside it appears as though you have from the press and whatever i can just read about the internet it seems like you've got a really good business model and that's what i wanted to talk to you about today was that business model because we've talked a lot about tiger21 and uh ypo is kind of interesting but uh you guys are like the next kind of person attempting this and it seems like it's working really well and that's what i wanted to ask about yeah awesome well uh congratulations on on the podcast and uh and was excited to come on and chat because there's been a lot happening for us at the beginning of this year so yeah and before this where were you casper no that was my co-founder so uh we both have been in kind of the new york city ecosystem for a while um i actually i started the startup scene at hannah i launched i launched and ran soap.com uh under mark lore quincy got acquired by amazon then went over to south korea and worked on kupang which is the amazon of south korea and then most recently right before chief i was at handy running operations for them and my co-founder was at casper so yeah and when did you decide when did you go all in full-time on chief uh i probably went full in 2018 is when uh officially left uh other positions and dedicated myself full-time to this and uh it was one of those things that i felt like i had to do the full commit and actually like put everything behind it or else it would just like keep that slow crawl of kind of an idea um because uh without pulling putting everything in it it just you know wasn't making the same progress that they really needed to make i do the same thing and i that's what i tell people uh what what's i think the phrase is uh i used to say it was burning your bridges but it's not it's burning the ship so like there was this like kind quesador i forget who his name was but it's like where he like landed in america or somewhere like that and they're like look we have to succeed now because i just burned the boats so like we ain't going home and uh i guess that's the story i don't know if that's real or not but i i totally believe that that's the uh that's the the the way to go about this and what chief what did what how would you describe chief as it is now yeah so chief is really focused on senior executive women uh it's you know under the phrase that we hear so often of it gets very lonely at the top um but it gets lonely at the top for women a lot more and our mission is really to drive more women into positions of leadership and keep them there and and by focusing on that kind of senior executive woman you know our belief is just getting more of them in true positions of influence the ripple effect that that could have across all different companies and organizations is is really where we wanted to go and kind of tackle this first and i kind of call it like a ypo above her vps which is basically like and this is all from the outside obviously i'm not a member but this is you basically it looks like what you get you pay like some sum of like five to eight thousand dollars a year-ish and you get and the company pays for it and you get to meet up with like a core group of like five or ten different women or it's the same women um and then you have like a coach and then you have the ability to like chat with the entire group whenever you want online and then i imagine you have some type of like programming throughout the month that you can join as well right is that is that basically the model it's it's very very close um so i would uh ypo definitely was a inspiration for us for sure um where they only focus on ceos and presidents um that is their entire focus and as a result not surprisingly it's largely men that are a part of ypo since that is what the makeup of a ceo and president when i think of ypo i think like old white dudes it's it's not far off um and it was just an inspiration for us to say wouldn't it be great to have an organization like this focused on women so we're vp level and above we we also have a lot of ceos and presidents who are women that are a part of the organization but we focus on vp and above and as you mentioned probably the heart of what we do is what we call our core groups it is this group of ten individuals we go through a very curated process of finding the right group of ten to come together they meet every month there's an executive coach in the room and that's called core for a reason um it is the heart of the service that we provide but around that we have all sorts of different services and and and resources that you can tap into so we have our own programming that you can attend as much or as little as you would want to you can tap into the whole network through our community product we even have clubhouses in three cities across the u.s that you can that you can use so lots of things that are kind of around the around the core experience but that truly is the heart of what we do what was the original idea how was it different than how it evolved into into what it is today what was the original premise i as we did this last fundraise it was funny we pulled out our seed deck of you know what we were showing when we were raising and it didn't change that much which is kind of phenomenal you always hear so many stories of you know we tried this we needed to pivot because this wasn't working or that wasn't working and the heart of what we wanted to do was always very much what it is today i think the biggest change that we've undergone is most of our services were all happening in person when we launched that's the reason why we had kind of these physical spaces we had the clubhouses we were doing core in person um but with the pandemic everything moved over to virtual uh which has you know in some ways been a small silver lining for us and that we've been able to you know extend to more cities faster because we don't have to do big build-outs and it's actually even more powerful and engaging for our members because this truly is like the movie trope of the busy woman and now instead of having to you know trek across a city to get to a clubhouse to get the benefit of chief it's now in your pocket wherever you go and at this point did i see 15 000 members is that right it's close to 15 000 members yes wow or maybe it's a third i forget what the pr the you you guys you whatever you what is that 13 or 12 whatever it said recently because you raised 100 million in funding at a 1.1 billion valuation so it's like it's a pretty huge business and you only launched what three years ago like launched uh live uh publicly three years ago three years ago yes that's crazy right it is it is i can remember back when we were launching and we're like we're going to have just a hundred great members as we launch and we're really excited and um even from the very beginning and the launch that we had um we had thousands of people sign up for a wait list for chief and now yes we're close to 15 000 members um but we have a wait list of close to 60 000 which is kind of incredible and i think it just really shows how much a community like this is truly needed um and the value that it's that it's really creating for our members so let's say you're at 15 000. let's just say the average price is 6 000. that's 90 million in revenue i imagine the truth is like give or take 20 maybe and i don't know if you say that or not what it is but regardless if it's in that ballpark it's a pretty substantial business in a and such a that's let's say 60 to 100 million in recurring revenue in three years that's wild right it is it is and i think what's really what i feel so much privilege of on in any given day when people hear about chief because it's such a mission oriented business um that's what they think of they're like oh it seems like such a good business but great mission and i don't think that people realize that it's both like a great mission and a great business and i think you know we live in a capitalist society and being able to have both of those things come together idiot would say that you just do the math like it makes sense like this like if you scale to like 50 million in recurring revenue in three years that's a great company you're probably a lot higher than that i mean what uh do they know how to do math do they can they use a calculator i don't know i've talked to a lot of vcs so there still needed to be a lot of convincing so when i started the hustle um so the hustle was my company we sold it to hubspot when i started the hustle it was just it was basically just a daily email and it was relatively easy compared to what you have started because the person receiving the email had no idea if there was a million people or one people getting it like that didn't impact their experience so then we started trends which is like our subscription business and that had a paid community and that sucked because i had to make it cool before i thought it was going to be cool so like i had to like convince my friends to like join and post in it and like make it seem like a you know it's like a restaurant that already has customers before you actually know like if it's any good when you so i know these businesses can be tough for that reason how were you able to get your first let's say 10 or even 100 people because it's like you're selling them something that isn't real but it only becomes real when they're sold and bought in and like commit to it yeah i mean i think that there um was a lot of small tactics that all bubbled up to you know a a meaningful investment in the brand that allowed for people to understand what we were trying to build and who we were trying to build it for um and i think we were really fortunate in having just some really amazing early members that kind of kept that ball rolling but it was everything from you know one of the things that we did was have a physical space at the onset and the physical space in some ways was like marketing for us to kind of show a brand that we were trying to develop and um uh and and really bring that to life uh we that was a conscious decision and investment into the brand things like we didn't have a social media presence at all um because uh we felt like what were you gonna say how would it be meaningful and it actually helped to create like this really interesting tightness of people that were in the community versus trying to you know shout it out into all of the different social media areas um so there were a lot of things that i think we did and ultimately like uh word of mouth was by far our entire acquisition uh strategy um which was pretty amazing um you just emailed like your 10 or 20 closest friends and they probably told a handful of people and you just said like hey we're launching this in like 60 days apply and we'll let you know if this is a good fit yeah i mean it was not just our closest friends we definitely sent some cold emails out to people that we had never met before and i remember even some early vc conversations where we were showing you know here's our first members and they were like oh so are these just all your friends and lindsay's friends my co-founder were like actually no that's not the case um it was it was amazing a cold email to sea sweet executives at fortune 500 companies and people were excited to join i think being able to also reference the ypo model which a lot of people understood um helped to create some of that traction um and even the companies themselves so our model is one where you know sell directly to her she then goes and gets it sponsored within within her company um and we didn't know how well or how easily that sponsorship would go and companies signed up really quickly i think for them they look at you know one-on-one executive coaching can be thirty thousand dollars for a six-month engagement so uh relative to that this was a great way for them to invest in some of their top talent and you got to like i was like reading i think so you launched i'm looking at my notes you launched like around december 2018 within like a month or two you're you passed seven figures in recurring or like a run rate right but you had that cash in and then by the end of the year you're nearing 10 million in revenue i mean that's pretty wild yeah um we started to sell at the end of 2018 we didn't officially launch services until 2019 in february of 2019 and we were just in new york city so we were continuing to add members in new york city until around you know mid 2019 we went and raised our series a largely to expand into new cities um which at the time was a more capital intensive way of of expanding because we were in person we had to make investments into clubhouses and so we were in the midst of those build-outs when the pandemic happened um and uh that's when we made the full pivot over to virtual and as we did that engagement actually went up across every every one of our services definitely it was a time where something like chief was needed more than ever and it allowed us to expand in a much different way how did you know what to tell the coaches like what what to tell them how to run their group or ypo they've got facilitators uh i don't know what you call your uh folks but basically like it's i've i've done a couple of these things and they're pretty amazing it's basically like and some people get insulted when i say this but it's basically group therapy and it's awesome and it's incredibly necessary but a good facilitator therapist like makes or break it a little bit they do they do and and we do a lot of vetting to make sure that we have the right coaches that are coming on that act as we call them guides on our platform um and they're just fabulous we have close to 400 executive coaches that act as guides for us now and for us i think there's you know a little bit of a beginning introduction into core that is very similar for all core groups in the first few sessions there's you know a very prescribed way of bringing the group together making sure that everybody creates um a deep sense of of community even within that group and then from there a lot of it really is for the coach to decide the right path for that group because every group is different of what they need and what they're looking for so we have created a lot of content but it's to the coach and the group to really decide which direction they want to take a lot of those conversations and you know a vast majority of those conversations are real time dependent on what's happening with the people in the room of you know if somebody's about to go through a massive recon uh you know restructuring within their company they're going to want to have a little bit more air time in that session of people helping them work through some of those things so it's uh it's heavily structured and guided but with a lot of flexibility depending on what is needed for each group so i want to kind of nerd out a little bit on this on these models on this business this community business model i think it's awesome and i actually think that like it's with the remote or whatever we are in now i think it's you're going to see a lot more of these pop up and i think you're the first of this like new age ones but i want to talk about some old school ones i want to tell you about my research and you tell me if you've heard about any of these have you heard of world 50 i have yes what do you know about world 50 so you're gonna know of all the ones that i know plus more and you're the only person that is able to nerd out with me on this stuff so that's why i like you yeah i mean they're all what i have what i have generally found is that most of the communities that existed before now we're all very focused on the the most senior people for ceos like the you know uh and a lot of what i'm guessing you're about to list are all that they're all that i think yeah no no one isn't i have one that isn't okay what's the one that isn't on deck a lot of people know what on deck is i don't even think on deck knows what on deck is i think they're still trying to figure out like their existence or like you know their identity but they are attempting to do something it seems as though they've i have no inside information this is all just looking at their website it seems like they're they're they're pivoting into kind of what you're doing yeah i mean i think i have deep respect for them as a company um i think a lot of times what you often find is there's this what leads does like community lead or does like curriculum and professional development lead um and i think for them when it's education i think i think it's hard it's hard it is it is um and for us community has always led um and even you know you could extend that to many other paradigms of like just community lean lead or to space lead like what is the actual service that you were providing and for us we knew that community had to be the thing that always led um and even if you think about some of the you know kind of analogies that you could make like business school as a as an analogy like yes a lot of people think you're going back for curriculum i don't think you do i think you go back through the network and the people um and so uh for us that has always been the the major uh thing that we knew we had to focus in on and i think you know for on deck i'm not sure that they lead with community as much as they do kind of the programming um and uh that i think is kind of the difference that i would see there so here's a few of businesses in the space that might like surprise the the listener so we talked about world 50 so as i know it world 50 it's basically uh for cmos i think just cmos right i thought it was broader than cmos i thought it was actually more of like ceo uh individuals it started as cmos but yeah i think it's expanded beyond that but basically i think they were sold so in the cmo or whoever it is and there's like agency owners so i have a friend who's part of it and he's he runs an agency and i'm pretty sure it's 60 000 a year so quite expensive i think it's only two events a year that they do so it's almost it's basically an events business and they sold for hundreds of millions of dollars recently to uh pe just like i think a pe company and then another one is aventa have you heard of aventa i haven't heard of eventa okay so it's e v a and a aventa was sold to gartner for like 250 million dollars and it was almost like the same thing but it was worse because it was advertising driven so the attendees would like log on like it would be like this chief information officer which frankly i don't even companies that are i've never worked at a really big company like in order to have a chief information officer you're gonna be a pretty huge company so i don't even entirely know what a chief information officer is but they would host these like webinars pretty much where like a chief information officer a bunch of would come and like you know do like the group therapy thing and explain pros and cons and like you know how are we supposed to work from remote and do all this whatever they just complain and improve with one another and all that type of thing and they would charge like bank of america or some big sponsor money to be there and they sold the company to gartner for like 300 million dollars it's pretty wild yeah yeah yeah i mean event businesses in general is a type of business model that i didn't really have much familiarity with until chief and i would never consider ourselves an event company um but uh it's been pretty interesting to see the opportunities that exist for for people in that space for sure what are the i used to own an event business and we like did like seven figures in a year on it and it was a pain in the ass it was so hard it's so stressful it just like because like there's not many businesses where like if it rains you're screwed like if it rains one day out of 365 days like you're you're poor yeah what what opportunities you see with events well i mean i think that there's all sorts of different um angles that people have created in in that world and you know i think a lot of the content businesses have even started to you know try to extend into that a little bit more but you know like summit series i think was just like a really interesting model of what they were trying to create had a lot of community within it um but you know again it was more events-led than i think community-led um so it's been an area that uh we definitely pay attention to um because it feels related but uh not in our exact wheelhouse for sure have you heard of um vistage this is just is an interesting one too right yeah yeah vistage is basically like ypo um they focus specifically again on that ceo and president profile um i think they're close to like a 200 million dollar business uh i heard that they're doing 100 million in profit a year that's what i heard from a relatively trusted source but i i don't have proof uh of that would that would that surprise you um i think that if if you look at some of those business models so let's take visage or you take ypo um you know why po is a non-profit um and yet uh might be one of the most profitable non-profits i would imagine um because what we have is our biggest expenses you know we have these spaces we invest heavily into our coaches we do a lot of that stuff for ypo they actually don't have paid facilitators they train members to be the facilitators of a lot of those groups um so it's an interesting model to to think about and uh what are you imagining that as a as a part of that they they do pretty well um but i've never seen their financials so i cannot speak with authority on either of those businesses wait why po you've never seen no no i've never seen it's public isn't it can't you just log in and because it's a non-profit yeah they bucket things in ways that i think makes it pretty difficult to really discern what's underneath each thing um so uh not fully able to break that down right are you guys as chief were you able to run it mostly break even or will you lose it a lot in order to get big fast because it seems like it worked um i would reframe the the latter statement to say uh we were spending to make the experience as strong as possible i wouldn't say that we were spending to grow faster like i said most of what we and how we have grown has been through word of mouth so we haven't had to you know continue to just pour money into a marketing cycle um but for us particularly over the pandemic and everything else we wanted to make sure that we were really investing in the member experience and and continuing to do that and we're continuing to do that and that's why we wanted to raise more capital to continue to do that um and you know i i think about when brands are are made and yeah and it's in those tough times and for us being able to be there for our members through the pandemic when a lot of them at the very beginning of the pandemic there were furloughs there were all of those things like how do we invest in that experience over that period of time was really important to us if an employee if one of your members quits or leaves their job do you just have a team that will just like holler at their new employer and be like hey uh you know ashley was a member of chief her you know ibm no longer pays for it and then you like you know somehow like get in with that company a little bit yeah i mean i think that is actually one of the other reasons that we wanted to go and raise this money is that right now it is a b to c to b business right like we develop the relationship with her she then goes and gets it sponsored and what we have found is that when she asks the sponsorship has actually been pretty easy to get um yeah it's a no-brainer but the barrier is her asking um and so us going and actually building more of those relationships directly with the company it seems like a no-brainer for them to proactively do more of this instead of reactively approve um and so i think that's a an opportunity for us to explore to really take that burden off of her to to have to go and get that sponsorship um but uh you know we we definitely you know 20 of the workforce changes jobs in any given year so there's definitely a lot of new relationships for us to help both the companies and the members navigate we're talking about tiger 21 and it's cool so tiger 21 is basically uh you know a community for people who have i think above 10 million liquid net worth and that's cool that's pretty sexy just hanging around rich folks all the time that's great but it's actually kind of a tough sell i would imagine because it's the person paying for it and when i heard about chief um i was like oh my gosh this is like you know when i our company when i sold we were only 40 employees and so we were probably just crossing that threshold where we could afford to send only a couple employees to like things like this and i was thinking about like my leadership team like man if one of them come came to me and asking for this like this would just be like the easiest of like yeah yeah totally i would probably make them sign like a deal like it says like all right but if you quit within a year like you owe us like some you have to reimburse us but uh i was like yeah this is this is just an easy sell for chief i understand why this company's going to get so big yeah yeah i mean i think we've definitely heard stories where when there has been like that the there's some companies who i think are like well you're going to go in and you're going to meet new people and that could actually open up new opportunities for you that you may not otherwise have and it's actually the exact opposite what we have found is when a company says no on on the sponsorship it is a really clear signal to a lot of these people that okay you're not investing in me you're you're you're you don't value me and so that is actually the trigger of somebody thinking about going and leaving and finding other opportunities and so they will self-sponsor and go and find something versus be sponsored be happy in the job that they are and continue to grow as a leader for that company what other uh you know you're focused on your thing but a lot of times what we do here is talk about ideas so things that we may or may not do but it's interesting based off the intel that i know what other niches or opportunities do you like this business model for yeah i mean i think that uh this business model in particular is one that i think will have a really interesting next few years as people are still working from home and still in this hybrid world but wanting that community and those connections and so i think in those in any area where that feeling of loneliness is is still really present coming out of the pandemic i think there's some really interesting opportunities i think the hard part is the the nice the really nice aspect of chief is that ultimately it's the company that can sponsor it and so how do you find those areas and those demographics and those people who need that community who will crave that community but have somebody like the company that's willing to make that investment in those people and that's the one-two punch that i think makes chief really interesting and harder to find outside of like the professional sphere our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better yeah well i was thinking about this model and i was like it makes perfect sense for this group because i was like uh you know we have a problem with uh women not there's you know it's not equal in terms of like the representation so like of course i would invest in this in order to uh help my folks and in doing so like whenever you have a group that feels like they're like disrespected or like they're they don't like how they're being treated they bond together in a great way it's like us versus the world like you know that like mobilizes them and that type of every great community is based on that and i was thinking about like well if you just did this for like just anyone like let's say like i think there's a company called ven wise have you heard of ven wise yeah yeah and i think it's basically just what you're doing but for everyone and i'm like well that's why is that succeeding and why is chief succeeding and not been wise and those or they are probably succeeding but they're probably no nowhere as big and impactful as you guys um it's because that like this idea of like it's us versus the world that type of you need that in any type of community i think to in order to mobilize one another and to feel bonded yeah i then wise i think focuses in on um senior executives probably like c-suite executives and high-growth startups that's like their their focus so um and uh i think a lot of what they do uh really focuses in on that peer group model solely and doesn't have a lot of the community the broader community around it it doesn't have that shared mission um and i i would potentially reframe what you said just a tad to say like i don't know that it's as us versus them as much as like a galvanizing mission that brings you together that just makes you feel really bonded um and it doesn't have to be at somebody else's expense but it is a a feeling of togetherness that is created and i think that is what um you know the the mission of chief really does allow for is that that broader connect connectedness within the community yeah that's what i did i didn't mean like uh i said us versus the world but it was it's definitely it's not like we're trying to kick anyone's ass it's like uh you know not everyone can identify with how we feel finally i'm i'm amongst my tribe and others don't exactly understand uh yeah you know vistage could be cool i think vistage is i think vistage i think their whole like shtick is uh la it's kind of like blue calories so like someone who owns like a moving or plumbing company that does like 10 or 20 million in revenue and and that person to themselves probably says like i feel alone like you know i don't i don't hang out with people like me i need to find like my people um and so like it's like that uh finding your your tribe maybe is a little bit better than us versus the world yes exactly um it is that feeling of um if i don't have a group of people that understand my context easily and finding that being able to be able to tap into that and to be able to have the confidentiality that goes with some of that too because a lot of what happens in these peer groups is you know pretty raw honest authentic conversations that is is hard to have with just anyone how are you as a founder able to get intel and insight into your customers and your product because i bet you're you don't go to some of these groups i mean you don't go that would that wouldn't be great to have you uh you know like the big boss and a bunch of these groups so like how are you able to learn quickly and figure out what's working and what's not yeah i mean i we do not it's a it's a confidential space for them to have their conversation so we're not able to you know watch what is happening in each of these sessions but i think you know even going back to what we were just talking about of there being a galvanizing feeling around this mission our members are just so passionate about this mission that they are not shy to give us feedback on anything and everything um so uh we it is truly been kind of a an amazing experience to be able to get all of that feedback and be able to create some of this in partnership and we have some amazing members who have stepped forward and you know we have one member who's like i'm going to just run a sub board services community group within chief and bring in speakers and help each other find opportunities and so you've just seen such a uprising of both feedback but also really big interest in in stepping forward and helping to create stuff together so for one of our communities we have like 15 000-ish paying members sort of like you have but like not even close to the the the amount of revenue but a lot of people but we um and like the hardest part in terms of like tactics for starting a community is that i found is getting people to participate online and it's like literally like just the friction and so a lot of the things that i've done i've built stuff like so many things so many i've built a bunch of different communities on facebook groups because i have never seen a platform get or a community platform get as much engagement in terms of um people it people in the group uh the ratio of people in the group to the ratio of uh people in the group to people who participate in the group but then a lot of people i've seen like i've got a couple friends that have huge blogs and they just go you know let's just say like one of these blogs is financial samurai financial samurai.com personal finance blog it's awesome he was like oh i'm just going to create a forum on my website financial samurai.com forum and even though he's got this huge audience the forum is crickets and it's because like literally going to that website and posting on a forum is in like it's like a .01 percent like ratio of people in the community and readers to participating whereas facebook i've found it to be like if you have 100 people in the group like 10 or 20 people will actually participate which is pretty astounding have you been able to crack that code with getting people to log in and go to your website and making it all happen and participating yeah yeah absolutely so um we we started early days in a pretty similar tactic um candidly of where are they already and how do we you know not create that additional friction of needing to go to our proprietary you know app website etc um and so we actually started early days on slack and it was amazing to see the amount of interaction that was happening there and and how much uh people were you know stepping forward to help each other to connect to all do all sorts of different things the problem is that like slack is definitely not built for a community of oh man sucks i hate it you can't you don't even know who you're talking to unless they properly filled out their pro like it's just not the the forum and so we switched over to ours our own in in 2020 um and it has sustained um and i think for us a lot of it is around you know there's like these known touch points that are going to come up you're going to every month you're going to have a core meeting that's going to pull you into the product in order for you to go and get what you need to get to go and have that conversation um and there's many of those types of things that you know there's there's many utilities that exist within the platform that pull you in and then once you're in draw you into a lot of the community aspects um so it's been really great to see um and it's everything from you know i it i'm looking to hire somebody to i need an employment lawyer like there's just so much need and for you to have a vetted network to be able to tap in to do that you can't really do that on a linkedin um at this point because if your linkedin is like mine i know like 20 of the people that i'm connected to at this point um and so it's a really valuable utility and resource that we've been really excited about how much people have engaged in it and it's not just to go on and doom scroll and you know look at our content it's actual utility for them what i'm about to say kind of sounds like a backhanded compliment but it's not it's it's very much a compliment but basically you guys have created this brand the reason it sounds bad is because i was gonna use the word like elitist but that's not fair i don't mean like elitist in the bad way maybe elite like just like badasses you know like it's it's like harvard or something where it's like it's hard to get into there's not much on the internet about it you guys i don't think you have a twitter or a facebook or an instagram you only have linkedin and so like there's this thing where it's like i don't know if you like to admit it but it's like fomo where it's like oh man like the cool peop the people who i want to be are part of this thing uh i want to be part of it but i can't you know i got to get accepted how do you how do you go about creating a brand like that on purpose is this something that came natural to you like how how do you make this where it's like uh so i mean you just executed that strategy well yeah yeah i mean we uh we like to think of ourselves as vetted we are a vetted community we're not an exclusive community we're not an elite community but we are vetted because um so many of the people that are members de facto fall into the mentor position or you know the manager and so really for it to be a beneficial community for her it has to be vetted for people that are more her peers um and you know i think that there is a level of aspirational branding that we wanted to to create with chief because candidly if you think about even like three years ago as we were building this if you heard the term a women's professional network you would not think of something aspirational it would be like warm white wine name tags and pantsuits like that is what would be like in your mind of what a women's professional network was and so it was really important for us to create something that felt um like we were celebrating our members instead of what so often a women's professional network gets created into and that was why you know we talked about that at the beginning of this that was why we wanted to have a space that felt um that that brought that brand to life that helped to showcase what we meant by that and um and the space really allowed that brand to come through it's why we didn't want to be on a lot of those social networks i think my my co-founder and i were talking about like a social media strategy we're like what are we gonna do just put inspirational quotes out there like every week um like we've seen that like how do we make this feel different um and so it was very important for us to really create a brand that we thought our members deserved how do you think this story is going to earn uh end in terms of like uh are you gonna is someone gonna buy you do you think that like a linkedin would buy you you think you want to go public what do you what's gonna happen five or ten years down the line you think uh i think that we are excited to keep any and all option open um but at the end of the day um the entire value of this organization is our members um and so and it's our members are here because they are they need the value that we create but they also care deeply about our mission and so anything that we do any partner that we you know want to um talk to any strategy that we go and enact has to be very much in line with that mission and i've been very fortunate in going the vc route that we've been able to find the right partners who can come on as those vcs that understand that that leads everything and anything for us would you want to be ceo of a public company [Laughter] uh it has never been on my bucket list of things that i feel like i'm craving to do um but i want chief to be as successful as it ever could possibly be and i want there to be a great outcome for our members our team etc um and that leads more than anything well this is awesome um this is this is really intriguing you've you haven't done a ton of podcasts i think right no we have we have our own the new rules of business by chief but uh i've not been uh on many podcasts as a as a guest do you think uh good and i noticed that and that's why i wanted to talk to you do you think that um you're just so under the radar for i think how the the the uh there are so many other businesses in our little circle jerk startup world it's kind of full of stupid hype and there's so many of them that are we talk about so much but they're like kind of [ __ ] like not good companies and they're gonna go nowhere but then you folks are the exact opposite where you're like seeing like you actually have a pretty substantial business i think it's going to be actually incredibly big very few people are talking about you you know what i mean and i i find that i i kind of think that's actually cool and i want to know how do you how does that make you feel i'm right where i want to be i i i think that there's actually something really amazing about um being under you know uh hyped um i i really like kind of making sure that we are focused on the most important thing which is like building a great business and not like and even for lindsay and i you know uh as co-founders um part of the reason why we don't do a lot of you know publicity and other things is because we are actually trying to showcase our members more than ourselves like they're actually a hell of a lot more impressive than either of us are um and so it feels it feels right for what we are creating um to be heads down and focus on building a great business versus you know uh building hype yeah well it's awesome where are you from where were you raised i uh grew up in ithaca new york area okay so you so and where's your co-founder from also upstate new york but like new york city upstate new york like an hour not my true upstate new york well that's badass i'm uh i'm i'm happy we got to talk i think it's amazing what you guys have accomplished you're you're under the radar i think and the reason i wanted to talk to you was i noticed not a lot of people had talked to you and it i don't know i feel like maybe uh i could like uh i take a little bit of pride in like we spotted this winner not quite early on he already raised money at a billion dollar evaluation but like uh maybe maybe maybe a billion will be considered quite early for how the story ends though so uh uh i'm really appreciative that you guys uh that you decided to come on and give me a give me a shot yeah no i was excited to come on and and have the conversation and um like i said i think a lot of people i remember very early days of even just trying to get a lawyer to like help us establish the company and like yeah was talking about wanting to be vc funded and i literally could not get a lawyer to work with me because they were like this should not be a vc funded business this is a very nice you know lifestyle business so like i can't even get a lawyer hey do this so it's it is nice to be able to you know celebrate some of these wins and um and for people to know that we have a deep mission but it is a great business too the lawyers wouldn't talk to you and you're happy that you're able to like celebrate this win yeah uh so yeah we i couldn't even pay lawyers to to represent us um so it's nice to have these wins and be able to you know not only show that we're a really mission oriented business but we're a great business too and i think that's first of all i hate when people say it when they say oh this is a knife this is a nice lifestyle business i hate that for a they're they're trying to insult you and be insulting a little bit and b they're wrong because lifestyle businesses are like what what does that mean it's a lifestyle business oh like it's just a company that can make like 20 or 30 million dollars a year in profit and i could just own it all yeah then it is a life like yeah like a lifestyle but what's that mean like like like i don't i don't know like mars candy like a family-owned business that's like the largest company in the world yeah sick lifestyle so i i cannot stand when they say that i think that's really stupid but with your with your business i do think i'm like man i would want to be greedy and own the whole thing i wouldn't want to raise money and so is there any do you think do you think you'll have regret about raising money or at least about raising as much money as you have because the business model is pretty freaking perfect like it's like a pretty efficient amazing model i think yeah i mean i think that there is a a definite strategy that businesses like ours could have of going very slowly and using proceeds from the the business to feedback into the services that you want to create that's definitely one way that the strategy could go um i think i i do not think that i would have any regret with the the way in which we are going um because i think we're impatient of trying to build a really meaningful powerful network for badass women that that that need this um and you know at the heart of the mission is like to drive more women into positions of leadership and keep them there it's over 200 years before we get to gender parity in senior executive positions and if a little bit of dilution means that we can go and execute on that mission faster i'm game i understand why people invested you're very good at your pitch you've have it honed in you you seem like a force to be reckoned with congratulations on everything uh i'm happy i got to speak with you thank you uh for coming on do you do you use social is there any is there any uh thing that you want to plug like you're you're i don't even think i saw you using social did i yeah i'm not i'm not as much of a social media person as my co-founder uh i'm on linkedin but um yeah i think the thing i would plug is is our podcast as well the new rules of business by chief which we just launched last year and so people want to check that out they they can see us there how's it going podcasts are pain in the ass to grow aren't they it's fun though i actually like i every single uh podcast episode i'm kind of like this is like a nice little learning experience for me too you're just talking with like experts in their fields and learning a ton through it that i'm really enjoying it i think it's fun to do so at the hustle when we so we are required by hubspot so we don't have advertising anymore but before we were advertising berta make money and when that was the case it was very tough it was very hard and because it was like all right how do we get downloads up how do we get downloads up for you folks like maybe because you're not making money directly from it it's still important to get big or whatever but it's not like you know you're not gonna go hungry uh and so yeah if i was in your position i would think it's awesome as well yeah that is true that we are not a advertising led podcast business i appreciate it thank you yeah thank you this was fun [Music] you

owning a hundred percent or owning majority in your business it's like a dictatorship and dictatorships can be very good like lee kuan yew from singapore or they can go terribly like kim jong-un and the question is what's your personality and what's gonna work for you i mean you can move insanely fast there's no board there's no committee you don't owe anyone anything you don't have an outcome you know you don't have to ipo you don't have to sell and you have total integrity on the cons i mean you're on an island you don't have anyone to really who's aligned and cares and can tell you you're being an idiot and so you can really drive your business off the rails and then you also think in a limited way i know so many entrepreneurs who could 10x their business but they're so addicted to their dividends or they're conservative and so they don't

A podcast where we brainstorm new business ideas based on trends & opportunities we see in the market. Sometimes we have famous guests, and they do it with us.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] why did you do an agency so me and sam always talk about like uh we have many mottos on this podcast for example we don't do public math for example you don't say you're rich you say you're post-economic uh these are things we've picked up from from guests along the way and one of the one of the model one of the mottos that we say is uh you know agencies suck and uh it's like and and the reason we say is not because they uh like they do well that's not that they suck it's like they suck as a business choice like if i could i've always thought if i could choose between software or an agency i'd do software because it's like oh it's not a services business it's going to work while i sleep and it can scale up and i don't have to open up offices in poland and brazil and all these other places but you chose that you did software and you chose agency now why'd you make that choice and what's great about agencies that i'm kind of like not giving enough credit for so you're looking at business as in software is more scalable it's more desirable by public market ex hubspot versus accenture etc has way worse multiples than hubspot accenture is a bigger company from a revenue even a standpoint but now take a different approach okay i hope publicly traded companies you guys are both hubspot employees i'm assuming still is that correct kinda sure whatever your guys's deal is right but you guys are pretty much at hubspot now imagine creating a business and you don't plan on going public you don't care for the limelight you don't care for any of that in business what's a successful business good revenue growth and good revenue and profitability right all that really matters at the end of the day whether you grow or not grow is how profitable are you would you guys agree with that statement assuming you're doing something that's ethical and you're not selling drugs no i wouldn't agree with that i would say there's a third thing which is like is this enjoyable and like do i like my day-to-day and with the more people you have most people would say that's just a little bit more headache uh than than but that's not software or consulting anytime you build a big company you tend to have a large amount of people whether it's hubspot or whether it's accenture everyone has yeah but you can have you can probably have a much higher revenue per employee with software versus let's say you own a massive landscaping business you're gonna have to have tens of thousands of people but what's the difference from dealing with how many people does hubspot have like six thousand i don't know five thousand six thousand is probably a lot i'm guessing on the number but what's the difference of dealing with five thousand or six thousand people and twenty thousand people there's a point where it doesn't matter and it's a lot of people either way like it's not like you're at 50 people you still have thousands of employees to deal with and you need managers and layers and all that kind of stuff yeah but you're hiring at some good or bad you're hiring a different type of person so for example if you're vaynermedia they're based in new york they can probably only afford to pay some of their lower level employees 70 or 80 000 a year and so you just have to get a ton of people like that and have to have higher churn versus say a bigger company where you're able to pay a significantly higher salary because the revenue per employee is much higher so perhaps there's a slightly different day-to-day with because of that not necessarily let's say you're a vaynermedia he could be doing it to optimize for profit ones if i told you his ltv was six seven eight years right and you know that's great then at that point you can still hire high quality people and pay my arm and a leg you got what i mean right like you look at the accent they're charging accounts so much money and their contracts are long and i don't know what vaynermedia's ltv is but there's a lot of consulting companies that have ltvs of six seven years for clients and their clients are spending you know a hubspot yes there's more revenue per you can say potentially in software you can get to more revenue per employee but i know consulting companies that only take on contracts that are like five six million dollars and upwards so you have high margins and you can have a high revenue per employee but either way no matter what as you build a big business you're going to need more people and it's a headache to manage whether you pay them 70 000 or whether you pay them 150 000 it's still more of a headache and the notion that if you hire someone for 150 000 i'm not saying you're saying this it doesn't necessarily mean they're a better employee right and you know it just means different types of headaches correct exactly engineers for example are very expensive in this economy right so the point i'm getting at is a consulting company i had the demand for it a lot of people want to pay me for marketing and there was just so much demand it would have been silly not to do and if i'm not trying to go public or i'm not trying to sell money is money green is green as long as you're happy doing what you're doing take the cash will you ever sell the company i wouldn't say i would never sell the company but i don't care to ever sell the company because i love what i'm doing we also have good growth too right like i don't know what will grow this year 60 something percent which isn't bad you know with the market going up and down and fluctuating 60 something percent is my guess at our size is decent yeah the part i was actually talking about was a little bit more like i think you're you're totally right that like if you're gonna win big you're gonna end up with a bunch of employees and like you know it might look like 150 might look like a thousand it might look like 10 000 but like you know in either case you're gonna have managerial work and headaches and it's just different types the part i was really talking about is like you know i've now built let's say a media company content and then it's like um done educational stuff so courses which are like you know a different thing and then there's like a built software company and you know we ended up selling that one and then it's like and then there's um uh services which is like client services like like consulting or agency model and what i hate what i what i love about content media is it's actually pretty fun to create and it's cool because a lot of people consume it so they kind of you know you get that like hit um but you got to like you got to bake the cake every day right so like you know the hustle or like the milk road or this podcast like we have to come on and create the content again uh you know for the most part we we're not doing like super long evergreen stuff uh so you know like with the hustles the daily news that our milk roads a daily newsletter it's we gotta bake that cake every day whereas software it was like we built one product and yes we might we will improve it over the course of a year you know every year we're gonna improve it but like fundamentally um we didn't have to like recreate the product come up with a new viral story or a new great content segment uh that would like require like a new genius uh with software it's like you come up with one genius moment and then you sort of refine it make it work better over time and get rid of bugs and things like that so i prefer that part of software which was like making a product rather than making kind of like a disposable uh you know consumable piece of content or like i have an e-commerce company and like it's the pain in the ass to have supply physical products that are supply chain constrained and like we have a warehouse we got warehouse problems with our e-commerce business and so i'm like man digital was sweet compared to e-commerce but e-commerce is quite profitable that kicks off a bunch of profits that's nice so every business has these pros and cons and i always thought agency was like um the part i always thought was a pain in the ass was like the client services you are reinventing the next campaign and the next winning marketing you know formula for them and you have to keep clients happy all the time and clients are sort of like never satisfied in a way that like they if software is like you can have nameless faceless customers that like yeah some percentage of them will go right into your help desk that's in the philippines or whatever but like you're not having to like you know send account reports to your you know your your big clients and keep them happy yeah but you everyone has their own problems and software a lot of people have turned this issue and they can't figure it out or they have competitors who come into the marketplace and just undercut them on pricing for the same features because it's cheaper and cheaper to build software these days right so they all have their own problem to me i look at it as if you can find the right people so every time i start a company i find in people to put in place that have already done it multiple times before because your risk of failure are lower and they already know everything to do so i don't have to deal with client relationships i don't have to deal with customer service or anything like that i get to do what i enjoy doing which is go and create content be the face etc and uh my wife enjoys what she gets to do right she gets to donate the money although we don't really consider it as donations we look at as investing we're investing in people although we really don't ever collect any money back it's more so you're investing into making the world a better place for people's lives a better place or whatever it may be what's uh who were who were your first three clients at this at this agent because i don't know they were small companies and right now who's an example client like a fortune 100 software company like that is a typical company think of any big large corporation in b2b that's a great example of one of our customers or even b2c actually think of any fortune 500 company that's a prime example of a customer what's uh and who's the ceo of your agency are you no i'm never the ceo i'm a terrible manager i'm one of the worst managers ever uh his name is mike gullickson he was the ceo no he was the president of iprospect which is an ad agency owned by uh densu i believe in i prospect maybe they have four or five thousand people is my guess and what when you how early into the business did you have a hired ceo or hired leader day one i won't start a business without a ceo from daylight and what did you pay them in the first year first year was my co-founder for like a hundred grand and that's because you basically went and drummed up 100 grand worth of business and you're like hey mike uh i got i got those clients to give a hundred grand do you wanna run this thing for me and help it get deployed no uh our business didn't start off that way i probably put a total of five million bucks into the business and my own money so it was bootstrap but not really bootstrapped if that makes sense it's kind of cheating and it gets easier and easier as your entrepreneur right the more the more successes you have and i'm not saying i'm successful by any means the more capital you have to deploy into the next thing so reduces chances of failure and when it's your own money this is just my thesis and i could be wrong on this i have no data points when it's your own money you're much more careful than when if you raise like 15 20 30 million dollars of venture capital right you really look at every single dollar uh but mike was the ceo from day one he's a great operator has no agency experience eventually we got in a president and then eventually from there we got in a ceo and have you guys crossed a hundred million in revenue yet yeah we do nine figures that's crazy man so what i mean that's just pretty wild that you're able to like parlay this blog that was already always kind of a juggernaut but this blog into a nine figure a year business i mean that's amazing yeah it's been a good run i hope it i'm knocking on wood although you probably can't hear because of chris but uh i hope it keeps going and more so we're just having fun like for me what i enjoy doing is building a business um i know i have an expensive lifestyle i generally don't do stuff for the money like i overpay like house staff like nannies and stuff like that when i say overpay i drastically overpaid not by like 10 20 30 40 like i really mean drastically over pay because i look at people i'm like if you're cleaning the house how are you gonna live on this like i'll give someone six figures to do that i know that sounds kind of crazy or stupid but like i'm not giving my kids money so might as well take care of other people in this world who need it more than um but we do [Music] in the pirate business it's easy to fall into forcing sales but hubspot helps us treat our valued customers like people not conquests how's your tailbird i brought you a case of rob hubspot grow better

[Music] is it easy for you to keep your burn rate down because like uh i i was telling sam this i spend like i don't know 25 000 a month now just like and i'm not i don't even feel like i'm dude i think sean you might spend i think you might spend more than that now if i bet you add it up because i know how you spend i bet you it's more than 25. it might be it might be a little more uh but it's not more than 30 i would say i don't think it's more than 30. so i but like it's yeah i got two little kids but i got two little kids but they're like babies like like you know like they don't they don't eat food you know so so you know there's diapers sure but like it's not them it's meat so you said it's a steep burn rate or it's a good burn rate i would take it i'll trade with you okay gotcha so when you say you don't spend much what do you say is your monthly burner because i think for most people listening right they like most people don't talk about how much they make or how much they spend all right how much you make sometimes that's sensitive how much you spend how much well but but neil you actually wrote this in a blog post you said uh you said i spend this is i don't know if you're i actually i have no idea if you're single or if you have a family and you can avoid that right now but you used to say in your blog post that you go 15 000 a month is all i need i'm happy that was like 10 years ago i think but that's but you used to say 15 000. single and no kids is easy right now if i had a guess on my burn rate 120 to 180 a month what that's insane so what is how does that break down so what what's the like what's the bulk of it whether so house probably is the biggest one no i have no mortgage okay so you're spending 120 180 k without spending anything on your home uh property tax property tax uh for both my homes and hoa dues is probably close to 200 a year okay great so [Music] we've got 12 000 of the way there where all right yeah yeah so there's okay life insurance is 25 grand a month what my whole life policy yeah that's 25 to 300 a year uh no no wait wait what what the hell is a 25 000 a month life insurance policy what can you explain that this is just a benefit like if i die my wife and kids get money like a life insurance policy yeah well i get that but is that normal i've never heard uh like either i'm dumb or you're dumb who's dumb here am i dumb because i've never heard of anybody spending that much on their life insurance it's like an investment account it builds over time so it's not like it goes away right most life insurance policies are for call it 10 years then you buy another one mine just keep going and you can borrow against it just think of it as like a investment vehicle so that's 25 a month okay now i understand staff cleaners nannies driver we have a full-time driver i think that ends up being around 57 a month um fifty seven hundred fifty seven thousand thousand uh you know a driver uber what why are you more affordable so i optimize for convenience in vegas i go through this company they charge a hefty premium i go through this company and i have decals on my car so if i do a meeting in front of a casino the car can just stay in front of the casino it doesn't have to move if i'm going to the airport you can straight up pull up into the plane or whatever you want to do and you don't have to go through terminals or anything like that so that makes it like so part of your strategy as i'm picking this up is that you live the best lifestyle you want and it's all expensible the way you do it uh i don't know if it's all expensive isn't that what you meant with the decal like it's a company it's like marketing it's like a like a marketing vehicle for you so there there's a limo company if i have their own windows i pay them i can end up parking wherever i want in theory not literally wherever i want but in most cases i can park wherever i want the car can just sit there and wait for me so all right so what else anything else do you fly private he's like i buy a daily disneyland fast pass just in case i decide to go that day yeah yeah that's like you have a convenience of time um what's been what's been the number one uh like kind of like where you feel like most people don't most people think this is too expensive and not worth it but for me i get way more value i'll give you an example in my life right so i i thought i had burned right till we started talking so this is great i'm feeling so much better about myself but the one thing i did was i hired a private chef so i was like all right that i think i i always thought that's the lifestyle of the rich and famous and i thought wow that's cool cause you eat healthy and it tastes great you don't have to fuss with time and you know cooking and dishes and groceries and all that stuff and so to me it's like a no-brainer i'm like dude anybody with any kind of money you should be like that should be one of the first like fancy car later private chef now like because i'm like to me the value the reward way outweigh the cost i think most people don't typically make that trade sounds like you've experimented with many ways of spending money what has been a good reward for for cost uh trade that you're like this one is is great that most people don't do i i don't know i mean i'm in a bubble because i have a lot of friends who are like me sadly uh in which we spend a lot we don't know what's reality i know that sounds bad to say but it's true right uh cook is not bad uh housekeepers and best you don't have to do your own dishes and stuff although funny enough i enjoy doing that and ironing because it's uh it's kind of like meditative for me it's relaxing i don't know why watching tv and ironing um nanny's help so you get the freedom and you can watch your kids when you want to but you can also do meetings and stuff like that um probably the the best expense i ever spend on is private planes not because i like it it's uh i don't mind playing commercial not really any difference for me but it helps me optimize for time so that way i can see my kids more i have to sometimes do a lot of meetings for work and just going and coming back the same day just really in and out really quickly like sometimes i'll be home quick enough like go from vegas to utah for a conference speak come back and i'll be home quick enough to pick up my kid from school i like to meet really well valuable that's worth money are you saving any money then or i mean are you just taking a fat draw from the agency in order to pay for this or are you able to expense a lot of it to the agency how does that work i don't expense any of it to my company i just personally paid so you're just the agency's just that profitable of a business it's doing that well or investments or savings i've done well enough in life where i'm okay [Music] can we turn the ship around we need to circle back business term

to say in your blog post that you go fifteen thousand dollars a month is all i need i'm happy that was like ten years ago i think but uh that's but you used to say fifteen thousand single and no kids is easy right now if i had a guess on my burn rate 120 to 180 a month what that's insane so what is how does that break down so what what's the like what's the bulk of it whether so house probably is the biggest one no i have no mortgage okay so you're spending 120 180k without spending anything on your home [Music] so neil i i was telling you a little bit about what you're getting into we record everything by the way so like we just hop into it but sean kind of knows who you are i've been a fan of yours for like 10 years can i tell sean and the audience who i think you are and you could tell me if i'm wrong and like what i'm missing sure go for it all right so you're neil patel so i know you because you used to have this blog called quick sprout i read it maybe 10 years ago it's probably a 15 year old blog if i remember correctly at first it was mostly about like seo but eventually it kind of like warped into being about seo about content but just about business in general and you would do like crazy stuff like you would build a business that made a hundred thousand dollars a month in revenue by like you just picked like a random niche and i think it ended up being supplements and you like blogged every month about how that was going and you used to blog about all types of crazy stuff but then eventually you also started a company called crazy egg which i heard was doing many millions of dollars a year in revenue and it was a bootstrap and you own the whole thing then you and heaton started kissmetrics and raised a bunch of money it didn't end up working out wonderfully but it was like uh it could have been actually quite huge heaton wrote a great blog post about like where uh you know where a couple errors were made but now you've got like a seven or eight hundred person agency that is also a bootstrap like the rest of your stuff and you've just kind of been balling out like for like 15 years in the world of business just killing it with agencies is that right did i get everything mostly right mostly closed so crazy came first uh heathen's a co-founder on that he has it all or uh you know he owns uh crazy egg um as well so it's not just me anymore and then there's another guy named john butler who was also part of crazy egg at the beginning and then quick sprout came later i started blogging on about business and stuff like that uh kissmetrics then came kissmetrics didn't work out quick sprout started to have a big audience related to marketing we tried to create seo software on there i did that with my co-founder heathen at the time he's like all right how about we create a company out of this i'll do the software that didn't work out i didn't want to be part of it anymore he took it over and he ended up making it a [Music] business site directory you know informational site whatever you want to call it has affiliate offers which you already know about and then the last one was the ad agency which is correct and then there's been a lot of stuff in between here and there a lot didn't work out but generally speaking i tend to do one thing at once focus and currently i spend all my time on my ad agency and that you're you're at six seven hundred how big is that at the moment and it's only like five or six years old right yeah so we're on our fifth year and then this year will be end of year five uh we're at roughly 700 people i think maybe a little bit more maybe by the year 900-ish if i had a guest who are these people these are like 700 anonymous indians in india what's going on who are these people uh we do have some people in india uh but what's funny how many people do you employ in new york that's what i want to know that's my agency testimony you're in brazil too though right yeah we're in brazil majority of our people are in the united states if i look at a region wise the united states has the biggest head count we also have offices in australia canada uh uk brazil india i think we're opening up germany soon we're looking at italy we're looking at france and a few other regions as well but our model is is like our ad agency in india markets companies in india it's not really used to outsource american work into india and what work are people doing like what's the service that you're providing all digital so like seo pay-per-click email marketing conversion rate optimization organic social paid social the list goes on and on and do all the customers come from neilpatel.com it used to be that way then we started getting a lot through word of mouth i would have never really guessed that word of mouth drives business how how many can you say how many uh so most people i would say like our audience they'd be like oh yeah it's cool to have like a personal brand but me and sam have figured out oh wow this [ __ ] really does open up more doors than you would have expected uh you've been doing this for a long time so neil patel which is kind of like a personal blog where you're talking about like you know hacks and experiments and strategies that you've you know figured out how many can you say how many millions that brought in in client bookings what for the agency like what uh how big did just the referrals from neil patel get you before other stuff kicked in like word of mouth and being recognized in the industry and other things like that i think the neil patel brand got us to around like 30 40 million in revenue and then word of mouth started kicking in and then other things started kicking in and employees started bringing in their own deals because they worked in the space for so long and then we saw more and more growth got awards that brought us deals um being a minority owned business that helps believe it or not there's if you're indian and you live in the united states you're considered a minority and uh i was about to say are we a minority i think you guys feel like i never get minority you're the majority of ceos out there so i mean it's funny because we go through rfps and some of them ask if you're what is it like mbe certification or something like that i forgot what it's called or minority business enterprise and i was like well i'm not a minority there's like one plus billion of me in this world right and they're like oh you're a minority i'm like what are you talking about there's like a billion plus indians in this world how are we a minority and they're like oh in america you're a minority and in some of these rfps they're looking it says in there we're looking for um lgbtq i don't know what the yeah all four of the letters are um you have the tattoo on your arm yeah the queue's there and then a woman-owned businesses veteran-owned businesses and the other one was minority and i was just like wait there's actually a quota that these big fortune 500 companies have to hit and they're like yeah and i was like well i'm a minority they're like well you need the certification and i was like i gotta have a certification to tell you that i'm a minority and at first i didn't realize i was a minority they were telling me oh you're a minority we reached out to you we're hoping that you would be a good fit and i'm like i'm a minority and they're like yeah you're a minority in the united states you'd help us meet our quota do you have the certification i'm like what are you talking about and then we went through the process and got the certification you got to get your papers bro you got to get your papers right i would have been offended and then as soon as i realized wait this is to my advantage oh hold on um i also got solar panels on my house does that help you know like i'm a dog wearing glasses uh yeah exactly i have a vision impairment uh called farsightedness you know so what else works in my favor here you know like was the certificate just turned the webcam on and it looked at you and it was like yep that was it that's not enough and what's funny is our ceo or vp operations one of the titles i forgot what tracy's title is she asked me for this like six months before we did it she's like hey need your birth certificate i'm like yeah why do you need my birth certificate she's like oh we need him for this certification like whatever and the moment someone ended up telling me how uh magic johnson generates a lot of his revenue because he's a minority and gets a lot of contracts partners with other businesses white labels it and uses his name becomes a quote-unquote owner of that business and then outsources oh wait tell me about that give me an example what's what's an example of the magic johnson formula sure so i don't know if this is true this is just what someone in the minority space ended up telling me so that's the caveat i don't know if this is true or real and they're saying let's say if someone has a food company and they have the contracts with all the hospitals that are run by the government like the va they're looking for minorities to provide it but there's already a lot of big corporations that provide the food so magic johnson may go create a business that's in that space partner with the big supplier who already provides a food to these hospitals he'll go get the contracts and then work with them to actually put those yeah wait you never heard you never heard of this my my in-laws my in-laws own a moving company and they're minorities they're uh black they're haitian immigrants and they win deals partially because of that reason because like morgan stanley or something like that if they want to move they want to they have some type of policy in their company it says we we want to get rfps for or we want to get bids from these types of companies i had no idea how i didn't obviously i knew this exists i just didn't realize how significant it was i definitely didn't know the magic johnson formula which is frankly genius on his part if that's if that's actually what he does right we don't know that part but it's true but think of it this way right it's a quota so if i go and i get an rfp let's say from boeing which funny enough we lost the rfp because we're over spice for what they wanted um and racism let's say the price is very similar to the competition i have rewards showing that we were the agency of the year so like all right these guys are good at what they do we have the case studies and if we're similar pricing like oh this is minority helps us hit our quota let's give the business here right yeah yeah of course you have some merit uh to go with it for the first 30 million dollars of business you got that and you must have gotten that by year two or so if you're growing this fast um what was the main year three sorry three what was the main service like when i think of like because i went to your website and i actually submitted a lead to figure it out there was the maximum you ask what your website is and what your budget is and it's like zero to ten thousand ten thousand twenty thousand and then just fifty 000 plus so were you serving like mostly small businesses and what like what were you were you doing as simple stuff as like making their yelp page good like what were you doing yeah so it's not that small we do have some smbs like that but we actually first started off in uh mid market our clients would pay us like a minimum of 10 grand a month and what would you do for 10 000 a month so nothing was cookie cutter it was all custom it's like maybe they need seo maybe they need to help on paid management maybe they need some cro or email marketing or a little bit of everything right but the plans would start at 120 a year right 10 a month and scale up from there to 20 a month 30 a month whatever it may be what was most in vogue as the service when you started like the trend everybody wanted and then what's the in vogue thing today when we first started it was mainly seo and what does that mean though what does that mean you use ha refs or something and your employees like look which terms they should rank for and then you write an article for them so it was optimizing their on-page code helping build links creating content promoting the content and making sure that traffic converted into leads or sales assuming if they weren't services um and it was a positive roi for the guy that sounds like a ton of work for 10 000 a month it would start at 10. it depended on the keywords how hard they were to rank for and it would go up from there and what about now sam i love when you describe people's businesses because you're just like uh so what does that mean you just google their name and then it doesn't show up and then you go write an article with their name and it's like what's the hustle dude you just read the new york times and then you just cut out half the words and then you hit send in an email like is that what is that what the hustle is yeah nailed it i mean it can be it like like like you know uh there's there's always more nuance and complication in reality but like if you can explain things in a fairly simple way where it's like what's hubspot oh they just make software so when you people sign up for your website you can email them and call them you know what i mean like you could i'm just trying to dumb it down a little bit but when you look at the business when they first started massive churn how to add tons of features how to figure out onboarding how to figure out training there was a lot of stuff that went to make hubspot a multi-billion dollar company right a lot of people look at it as email but they do more than email they do more than a crm they've added actually if anyone in the space has a 10 attraction they have a history of adding a lot of those features for free which is a smart model and then gobble up market share get them into the ecosystem and hopefully they stick around and so what's what's the popular you should do the ad reads uh for us yeah oh that was amazing by the way sam i think you should make suburban dictionary which is just you explaining businesses without like any uh any of the complicated stuff like yeah what is it well if you get covered like this call them and email them the the three syllable dictionary like i i explain complicated things but no word is above three syllables that's what we're gonna call exactly uh what by the way i was just gonna say ben brought up one point on that minority thing ben you want to say that that sounds pretty interesting you slacked us something but neil kind of mentioned this too but like this is really really uh in government work because the government is like very hardcore about hitting their quotas for racial minorities and so around here like i actually know a couple guys and basically what they do is uh the people i know are all african-american they get the contract they put their name on the contract they then outsource the entire thing to like uh deloitte or kpmg or whatever and uh they take like you know 15 of the revenue or whatever they create a consulting firm that's like the minority minority inc and then minority inc goes and gets the contracts and farms it out to to like deloitte or whoever that's great i can't find this client info have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out-of-sync spreadsheets are dueling databases hubspot grow better [Music] i lived in uh in indonesia for a while and they had such a bad traffic problem jakarta has like i think the worst traffic in the world like you just going two miles you might be there for two hours and uh so they were like okay we need to create like a carpool incentive so how do we create an incentive where if you have three or more people in your car then you can go in the fast lane and so this so it worked for like you know a month it was like oh wow this is great if we carpool we get to go faster and then this like little industry sprouted up where people would just stand at the edge of the carpool lane like a hitchhiker and they'd be like oh get in your car if you want a third rider i'll just hop in and we could ride in the fast lane and then they would get off on the other side and ride back with somebody else and so they would be professional like you know hov lane participants so they would just spend all day riding with you in your car so you'd be sitting there and someone would just get in the back seat with you it's just like a random indonesian person and you would give them 10 10 like rupees or whatever and then 10 baht and then they would you know get out on the other side a mile later it was amazing you uh neil was was quick sprout uh ben there you go uh was quick sprout i mean so that was your main business quick sprout and crazy egg were your main business for a while before it was just a blog and then my co-founder he then ended up taking it over now it's his blog so what was your main source of of revenue and income because like i said i've listened to you forever like you've been crushing it it seems like for financially for like 10 plus years i don't know if i'm crushing it but uh the main source of income was crazy for most my life and then it ended up becoming the ad agency and sam you said something at the very beginning that if i was listening to this i'd be like wait hold on i want to hear that story you said something like just for kicks he would like spin up a business that like did 100k a month in revenue what's an example of that tell that story because that sounds awesome yeah so everyone thinks like it's really hard to make money online and then you got these shysters or like buy this for a thousand dollars and you become rich which never really happens maybe every once in a while but for most people it doesn't so they create a business on anything and people are like go create a nutrition business my audience picked i gave them like a lot of different options they picked a nutrition business and i was like all right let's create a blog get a ranking get some traffic and then funnel people in through quizzes through uh emails and let's bundle them into uh supplements rank higher on amazon get traction and see what happens and it did well and that took you like uh months years how long did it take it wasn't months it was much more than that i think it was a year right a little bit less than a year i think it was like nine or ten months so it wasn't like one or two months sadly but a little bit less than a year so it's pretty good it was an awesome it was an awesome blog post series shawn you got to google it google like quick sprout or neil patel then like hundred thousand dollars a month and it was like a monthly update it was pretty amazing i i don't think we may have deleted it now i don't know if it's still a line but and then so i took the money i made from crazy egg and i would park it into other things so it's like stock market for a long time the stock market's had a really crazy run right then you also have things like investments a lot of venture funds uh angel investments and then sometimes you just get lucky sometimes you don't and it's a numbers game we had talked about doing a content series like this to grow the podcast i was like you know i think one of the best ways to grow the podcast could be if we do a challenge like what you described and one of the ideas was like what if sam created his own uh sam sticky stickyaki his own a condiment brand and we basically show how we build a dtc brand like from from idea to like branding to marketing to and we just do it all transparently to like like get people hooked on okay let me see how you guys actually build this thing now it's a lot of works which is why i think ultimately we didn't do it but how well did that work for you was that like just kind of like a good content thing or was it like no that was like drove a lot of growth for the brand and the blog i'm curious how well that worked for you it didn't drive as much growth for the brand um but it did help out every little bit like i did crazy experience so i spent like a hundred and something or two hundred and something thousand on clothes and wanted to see what that did in business meetings uh spent money applying first class everywhere she wanted to see what that would do but yeah i tried a lot of different experiments and it was just for shits and giggles um and it was also a reason to justify some of my expenses and i'm like i want to apply first class because i remember my first time flying first class someone else paid for it i'm like wow this is i've been missing out this is a lot better than being crammed up and flying all the way to europe from los angeles you know in economy and then i was like man let's do some experiments and let's see if i can justify this expense but yeah that's amazing and you just you did you say early on that you just gave heaton so did you invest in heat and shaw's other company sean neera yeah yeah so we're both neil we're both investors in nira which is he he is your cousin right no brother-in-law brother-in-law yeah sorry and uh heaton's amazing he's another he's a great blogger as well and sean and i both invested in his company called nera which is either gonna be a dud or it's gonna be like the biggest company ever i know like it's like a company that's close like they're gonna close like multi-million dollar contracts i would guess that's it's like a big old business potentially a big old business but did you say that you gave him crazy egg uh so with crazy egg what ended up happening is is what i wanted to do is we were doing business forever together and then eventually i just said hey you can have the monthly distributions and i'm gonna go create another business why would you give that why uh he didn't ask for it nor did he care for it nor does he want it you know he's never been about money neither him or i have and we're not rich i can't actually speak for him i'm not rich i've just done well enough and i don't spend as much so it's like don't really need the money does that make sense like if you just don't spend money you don't really need much cash dude you just said you dropped 200 000 on clothes what do you mean you don't need money well that was experiment right but that's not my daily life like i'm wearing a white t-shirt with stains that my kids spits up on um they're probably like 10 20 bucks i don't know what the white t-shirts cost but they're not really white anymore so i try not to do video recordings in front of white walls anymore uh because you can just tell the discoloration from it nonetheless so did sam say you live in brazil is that what no i have a uh division in brazil like we do marketing in brazil for brazilian companies and you live in texas where do you where do you live vegas vegas okay amazing and uh so have you um is it easy for you to keep your burn rate down because like uh i i was telling sam this i spend like i don't know twenty five thousand dollars a month now just like and i'm not i don't even feel like i'm dude i think sean you might i think you might spend more than that now if i bet you added up because i know how you spend i bet you it's more than 25 it might be it might be a little more uh but it's not more than 30 i would say i don't think it's more than 30. so i but like it's yeah i got two little kids but i got two kids but they're like babies like like you know like they don't eat food you know so so you know there's diapers sure but like it's not them it's meat so i would take 30. you said it's a steep burn rate or it's a good burn rate i would take it i'll trade with you okay gotcha so when you say you don't spend much what do you say is your monthly burner because i think for most people listening right they like most people don't talk about how much they make or how much they spend all right how much you make sometimes that's sensitive how much you speak well but but neil you actually wrote this in a blog post you said uh you said i spend this is i don't know if you're actually i have no idea if you're single or if you have a family and you can avoid that right now but you used to say in your blog post that you go 15 000 a month is all i need i'm happy that was like 10 years ago i think but uh that's but you used to say 15 000. single and no kids it was easy right now if i had a guess on my burn rate 120 to 180 a month what that's insane so what is how does that break down so what what's the like what's the bulk of it whether so house probably is the biggest one no i have no mortgage okay so you're spending 120 180k without spending anything on your home uh property tax property tax uh for both my homes and hoa dues is probably close to 200 a year okay great so [Music] we've got 12 000 of the way there where all right yeah yeah so there's okay life insurance is 25 grand a month what my whole life policy yeah that's 25 to 300 a year uh no no wait wait what what the hell is a 25 000 a month life insurance policy what can you explain that this is just a benefit like if i die my wife and kids get money like a life insurance policy yeah well i get that but is that normal i've never heard uh like either i'm done but you're dumb who's dumb here am i dumb because i've never heard of anybody spending that much on their life it's like an investment account it builds over time so it's not like it goes away right most life insurance policies are for call it 10 years and then you buy another one mine just keep going and you can borrow against it just think of it as like a investment vehicle so that's 25 a month okay now i understand staff uh cleaners nannies driver we have a full-time driver i think that ends up being around 57 a month um fifty seven hundred fifty seven thousand thousand uh you know a driver uber what why are you more affordable i optimize for convenience in vegas i go through this company they charge a hefty premium i go through this company and i have decals on my car so if i do a meeting in front of a casino the car can just stay in front of the casino it doesn't have to move if i'm going to the airport you can straight up pull up into the plane or whatever you want to do and you don't have to go through terminals or anything like that so that makes it like so part of your strategy as i'm picking this up is that you live the best lifestyle you want and it's all expensible the way you do it uh i don't know if it's all expensive isn't that what you meant with the decal like it's a company it's like marketing it's like a like a marketing vehicle for you so there's a limo company if i have their own windows i pay them i can end up parking wherever i want in theory not literally wherever i want but in most cases i can park wherever i want and the car can just sit there and wait for me so all right so what else anything else do you fly private he's like i buy a daily disneyland fast pass just in case i decide to go that day um what's been what's been the number one uh like kind of like where you feel like most people don't most people think this is too expensive and not worth it but for me i get way more value i'll give you an example in my life right so i i thought i had burn rate until we started talking so this is great i'm feeling so much better about myself but the one thing i did was i hired a private chef so i was like all right that i think i always thought that's the lifestyle of the rich and famous and i thought wow that's cool because you eat healthy and it tastes great you don't have to fuss with time and you know cooking and dishes and groceries and all that stuff and so to me it's like a no-brainer i'm like dude anybody with any kind of money you should be like that should be one of the first like fancy car later private chef now like because i'm like to me the value the reward way outweighed the cost i think most people don't typically make that trade sounds like you've experimented with many ways of spending money what has been a good reward for for cost uh trade that you're like this one is is great that most people don't do i don't know i mean i'm in a bubble because i have a lot of friends who are like me sadly in which we spend a lot and we don't know it's reality i know that sounds bad to say but it's true right uh cook is not bad uh housekeepers and best you don't have to do your own dishes and stuff although funny enough i enjoyed doing that and ironing because it's uh it's kind of like meditative for me it's relaxing i don't know why watching tv and ironing um nanny's help so you get the freedom and you can watch your kids when you want to but you can also do meetings and stuff like that um the probably the the best expense i ever spend on is private planes not because i like it it's uh i don't mind playing commercial not really any difference for me but it helps me optimize for time so i can see my kids more because i have to sometimes do a lot of meetings for work and just going and then coming back the same day just really in and out really quickly like sometimes i'll be home quick enough like go from vegas to utah for a conference speak come back and i'll be home quick enough to pick up my kid from school i like to meet really well valuable that's worth some money are you saving any money then or are i mean are you just taking a fat draw from the agency in order to pay for this or are you able to expense a lot of it to the agency how does that work i don't expense any of it to my company i just personally paid so you're just the agency is just that profitable of a business it's doing that well or investments or savings i've done well enough in life or i'm okay why did you do an agency so me and sam always talk about like uh we have many mottos on this podcast um for example we don't do public math for example you don't say you're rich you say you're post-economic uh these are things we've picked up from from guests along the way and one of the one of the models one of the mottos that we say is uh you know agencies suck and uh it's like and the reason we say is not because they uh like they do well that's not that they suck it's like they suck as a business choice like if i could i always thought if i could choose between software or an agency i'd do software because it's like oh it's not a services business it's gonna work while i sleep and they can scale up and i don't have to open up offices in poland and brazil and all these other places but you chose that you did software and you chose agency now um why'd you make that choice and what's great about agencies that i'm kind of like not giving enough credit for so you're looking at business as in software is more scalable it's more desirable by public market ex hubspot versus accenture accenture has way worse multiples than hubspot accenture is a bigger company from a revenue even a standpoint but now take a different approach okay helps us publicly traded companies you guys are both hubspot employees i'm assuming still is that correct kinda sure whatever your guys's deal is right but you guys are pretty much at hubspot now imagine creating a business and you don't plan on going public you don't care for the limelight you don't care for any of that in business what's a successful business good revenue growth and good revenue and profitability right all that really matters at the end of the day whether you grow or not grow is how profitable are you would you guys agree with that statement assuming you're doing something that's ethical and you're not selling drugs no i wouldn't agree with that i would say there's a third thing which is like is this enjoyable and like do i like my day-to-day and with the more people you have most people would say that's just a little bit more headache uh than than but that's not software or consulting anytime you build a big company you tend to have a large amount of people whether it's hubspot or whether it's accenture everyone has yeah but you can have you can probably have a much higher revenue per employee with software versus let's say you own a massive landscaping business you're gonna have to have tens of thousands of people well but what's the difference from dealing with how many people does hubspot have like six thousand i don't know five thousand six thousand is probably a lot i'm guessing on the number but what's the difference of dealing with five thousand or six thousand people and twenty thousand people there's a point where it doesn't matter and it's a lot of people either way like it's not like you're at fifty people you still have thousands of employees to deal with and you need managers and layers and all that kind of stuff yeah but you're hiring at some good or bad you're hiring a different type of person so for example if you're vaynermedia they're based in new york they can probably only afford to pay some of their lower level employees 70 or 80 000 a year and so you just have to get a ton of people like that and have to have higher churn versus say a bigger company where you're able to pay a significantly higher salary because the revenue per employee is much higher so perhaps there's a slightly different day-to-day with because of that not necessarily let's say you're a vaynermedia he could be doing it to optimize for profit ones if i told you his ltv was six seven eight years right then at that point you can still hire high quality people and pay my arm and a leg you got what i mean right like you look at the extent they're charging accounts so much money and their contracts are long and i don't know what vaynermedia's ltv is but there's a lot of consulting companies that have ltvs of six seven years for clients and their clients are spending you know a hub spot yes just more revenue per you can say potentially in software you can get to more revenue per employee but i know consulting companies that only take on contracts that are like five six million dollars and upwards so you have high margins and you can have a high revenue per employee but either way no matter what as you build a big business you're going to need more people and it's a headache to manage whether you pay them 70 000 or whether you pay them 150 000 it's still more of a headache and the notion that if you hire someone for 150 000 i'm not saying you're saying this it doesn't necessarily mean they're a better employee right and you know it just means different types of headaches correct exactly engineers for example are very expensive in this economy right so the point i'm getting at is a consulting company i had the demand for it a lot of people want to pay me for marketing and there was just so much demand it would have been silly not to do and if i'm not trying to go public or i'm not trying to sell money is money green is green as long as you're happy doing what you're doing take the cash will you ever sell the company i wouldn't say i would never sell the company but i don't care to ever sell the company because i love what i'm doing we also have good growth too right like i don't know what will grow this year 60 something percent which isn't bad you know with the market going up and down and fluctuating 60 something percent is my guess at our size is decent yeah the part i was actually talking about was a little bit more like i think you're you're totally right that like if you're gonna win big you're gonna end up with a bunch of employees and like you know it might look like 150 might look like a thousand it might look like 10 000 but like you know in either case you're gonna have managerial work and headaches and it's just different types the part i was really talking about was like you know i've now built let's say a media company content and then it's like um done educational stuff so courses which are like you know a different thing and then there's like a built software company and you know we ended up selling that one and then it's like and then there's um services which is like client services like like consulting or agency model and what i hate what i what i love about content media is it's actually pretty fun to create and it's cool because a lot of people consume it so they kind of you know you get that like hit um but you got to like you got to bake the cake every day right so like you know the hustle or like the milk road or this podcast like we have to come on and create the content again uh you know for the most part we we're not doing like super long evergreen stuff uh so you know like with the hustles the daily news that our milk roads and daily newsletters we got to bake that cake every day whereas software it was like we built one product and yes we might we will improve it over the course of a year you know every year we're going to improve it but like fundamentally um we didn't have to like recreate the product come up with a new viral story or a new great content segment uh that would like require like a new genius uh with software it's like you come up with one genius moment and then you sort of refine it make it work better over time and get rid of bugs and things like that so i prefer that part of software which was like making a product rather than making kind of like a disposable uh you know consumable piece of content or like i have an e-commerce company and like it's a pain in the ass to have supply physical products that are supply chain constrained and like we have a warehouse we got warehouse problems with our e-commerce business and so i'm like man digital was sweet compared to e-commerce but e-commerce is quite profitable that kicks off a bunch of profits that's nice so every business has these pros and cons and i always thought agency was like um the part i always thought was a pain in the ass was like the client services you are reinventing the next campaign and the next winning marketing you know formula for them and you have to keep clients happy all the time and clients are sort of like never satisfied in a way that like they if software is like you can have nameless faceless customers that like yeah some percentage of them will will write into your help desk that's in the philippines or whatever but like you're not having to like you know send account reports to your you know your big client to keep them happy yeah but you everyone has their own problems in software a lot of people have turned this issue and they can't figure it out or they have competitors who come into the marketplace and just undercut them on pricing for the same features because it's cheaper and cheaper to build software these days right so they all have their own problem to me i look at it as if you can find the right people so every time i start a company i find in people to put in place that have already done it multiple times before because your risk of failure are lower and they already know everything to do so i don't have to deal with client relationships i don't have to deal with customer service or anything like that i get to do what i enjoy doing which is go and create content be the face etc and uh my wife enjoys what she gets to do right she gets to donate the money although we don't really consider us donations we look at as investing we're investing in people although we really don't ever collect any money back it's more so you're investing into making the world a better place or people's lives a better place or whatever it may be what's uh who were who were your first three clients at this at this agent because i don't know they were small companies and right now who's an example client like a fortune 100 software company like that is a typical company think of any big large corporation in b2b that's a great example of one of our customers or even b2c actually think of any fortune 500 company that's a prime example of a customer what's uh and who's the ceo of your agency are you no i'm never the ceo i'm a terrible manager i'm one of the worst managers ever uh his name is mike gullickson he was the ceo no he was the president of i prospect which is an ad agency owned by uh densu i believe in i prospect maybe they had four or five thousand people is my guess and what when you how early into the business did you have a hired ceo or hired leader day one i won't start a business without a ceo from day one and what did you pay them in the first year first year is my co-founder for like 100 and that's because you basically went and drummed up 100 grand worth of business and you're like hey mike uh i got i got this clients to give a hundred grand you want to run this thing for me and help it get deployed no uh our business didn't start off that way i probably put a total of five million bucks into the business of my own money so it's bootstrap but not really bootstrapped if that makes sense it's kind of cheating um and it gets easier and easier as your entrepreneur right the more the more successes you have and i'm not saying i'm successful by any means the more capital you have to deploy into the next thing so reduces chances of failure and when it's your own money this is just my thesis and i could be wrong on this i have no data points when it's your own money you're much more careful than when if you raise like 15 20 30 million dollars of venture capital right you really look at every single dollar uh but mike was the ceo from day one he's a great operator has no agency experience eventually we got in a president and then eventually from there we got in a ceo and have you guys crossed a hundred million in revenue yet yeah we do nine figures that's crazy man so what i mean that's just pretty wild that you're able to like parlay this blog that was already always kind of a juggernaut but this blog into a nine figure a year business i mean that's amazing yeah it's been a good run i hope it i'm knocking on wood although you probably can't hear for the chris but uh i hope it keeps going and more so we're just having fun like for me what i enjoy doing is building a business um i know i have an expensive lifestyle i generally don't do stuff with the money like i overpay like house staff like nannies and stuff like that when i say overpay i drastically overpay not by like 10 20 30 40 like i really mean drastically overpay because i look at people i'm like if you're cleaning a house how are you gonna live on this like i'll give someone six figures to do that i know that sounds kind of crazy or stupid but like i'm not giving my kids money so might as well take care of other people in this world who need it more than um but we do did you say that you're not giving kids money yeah i'm not gonna give my kids money nothing leave nothing we have a trust set up what they'll get maximum is like if they're on the street and they can't provide and they're going to be suffering like i will help pay their bills um or put them in a normal home or like if my kids like i want to be a doctor and i want to go spend all my time in africa helping other people out and i won't get paid for this and i need you know x five thousand dollars a month to live or ten thousand so i can just go volunteer all my time but like sounds good i'll pay for that but like i won't give them money for the sake of it like if they're like i want to go travel to see italy or i want a honda accord and like go buy your own honda accord go travel on your own with your own dime like you know i don't believe in just giving people money because i think there's other people who need it more than we do sean are you gonna give your kids money i don't really thought about it like my oldest is two so i think i got some time to figure that out but i i lean more towards so i've kind of heard both arguments like um i know somebody who they if some people are like you know uh you know i do there's some people i i'm definitely not in the camp of i do this for my kids i want to leave my kids with a whole bunch cause i'm like that may be the worst thing you could do for them um not because it means that they're ruining drug addicts yeah you take away you know agency in a way right like you you want people to um like it's not that it's good or bad it's actually just it's just way lower on the totem pole of priorities it's like i just don't even focus on that it's like if i'm gonna leave them something it's gonna be a certain set of character character traits and skills and like uh mentality that's what i'm trying to leave money is like i don't know 15th on the list of like i don't know we haven't even gotten to think about that yet but i've thought a lot about what are the character traits and mentality and like mindset and skills that i think i can help build and like that's the focus that's the one that matters that's the that's the gift if whatever else comes from beyond that i don't know we can figure out like the foot it's like the footnotes so like we're very similar i have a two-year-old and a less than one-year-old right and i look at it as you want them to be productive units of society right you want them to be ambitious hungry uh caring thoughtful happy like whatever it is there's a lot of characteristics that you may want children to be but i look at it as like they don't need money even like with my wife and i we go over our expenses and we look at what we spend on travel and we do some of this because it's easier but like my wife and i are actually considering cutting out all private and just going commercial now the main reason our expenses are high is due to cobit so if it wasn't for cobit i would just be going in a normal airport i didn't know how covered was going to impact with young kids could afford it i was like yes just start flying private and we haven't gone back to commercial yet but we're thinking about going back because like my wife and i look at the money is like yeah we spend all this money on travel and airfare and hotels if we donated the money people would have a better life do we really need it that much what do you do when you donate that like what's a good way to donate in your opinion so there's like you know ranging from not donating to donating to one thing to donate to a bunch of things to like getting involved or seeing the impact or like you know i know people who if they donate to africa they'll actually their family will go take a trip every year so that they're more connected to the people and they actually see the impact and they take their kids with them so they see the impact like what have you found that's a good way to give so we have a balance it's my wife and i team up um this is gonna sound bad but i don't like volunteering my time my wife loves volunteering her time i think it's very inefficient for me to volunteer my time i should make the money versus volunteering my time because the money for the hours spent if we donated the money would have a much bigger impact to the cause than if i actually spent my time i don't my wife yeah and my wife loves spending the time and like from going to soup kitchens or whatever it may be so she picks the causes we have a few thesis so like one thesis is is we or not really thesis but rules one rule is is we don't like money going to organizations that have tons of high overhead we actually want our money going to the causes so if it doesn't go to the cause then we tend to not pick that um organization the second thing that we look for is uh organizations who are like uh self-sufficient right it's just like how can this continue going even if someone wasn't managing so like a great program for example is my wife likes donating to women's education we used to donate also to men's education as well so you find these people in these villages you say hey you can't afford to go to school get a degree we'll pay for you to go to college go get a degree come back teach kids in your village for a few years whether it's under a tree or anything people can learn anywhere right and then you know go move on with your life and do whatever you want but at least you're giving back to your own community and what we found is when we started giving because we've been doing this for so long now uh well actually not that long but when i mean long i'm talking about like 10 11 years where we've been donating and it's picked up quite a bit over the last like five six years when we started giving the money to men a lot of the men we saw a very low conversion rate from them actually coming back and teaching people in the village well when we gave the money to women for their education a lot of them came back and fulfilled on the promise it's not like you get a signed contract right it's just like hey we're gonna pay for everything come back help people out within your village which country we've done this in both india and africa so different parts of africa and uh in india and then another program that we've done is like growing gardens where a lot of people who have aids don't take the right uh don't take their medication and aren't doing well they're getting they're given the medication for free but if your body doesn't have the right nutrients it rejects it so what we'll do is we'll do programs like growing gardens we'll give them money they grow food and then not only do they eat nutritiously or well they'll more likely take their medication and you're also growing enough food so that way other people in the village can also eat so it's like but my wife picks all the causes she vets them she loves it like she'll go this is wednesday in two days she'll end up going to a function uh scouting out more non-profits and organizations i won't go like i think it's a waste of time i'm like if i'm gonna make more money she can donate it it's a better roi than if i go spend three four hours mingling when she could just do that and i can go make more so that way we can donate more other than your own private businesses what have been your best financial investments that's allowed you to to donate and and make a lot to give away stock market has done really well companies like apple amazon google facebook i know facebook's down but they still have been a tear if you just bought the stocks early enough um because some of these companies have grown 30 40 a year in the public markets compounding right and it really adds up uh angel investments have done really well for me and i would say probably those are the two biggest um stock markets still has done well although in the last 6 months i've taken a beating because i'm in 100 tech companies like i don't diversify like everyone's like oh you need some oil and you need this i'm like yeah i'm just gonna go all tech and people are like oh you're silly look how much you lost but if you look at the whole time when i first got in i've done well and i invest in what i understand and i'm 37 so who cares you know another 10 years everything should rebound assuming you pick the right companies what's your portfolio look like in terms of percentages not including private businesses my public portfolio i if i had a guest i probably don't even have more than 20 stocks amazon i i won't be able to name them all but amazon google facebook apple microsoft hubspot salesforce adobe atlassian shopify um i'm missing some as well and of your liquid of your of your liquid net worth how much is in public equities versus other versus real estate just non-agency if if i think at your agency is your agency the only company that you own a significant stake in if yes exclude that then what's your portfolio look like uh no i have quite a bit of other companies because i started using a lot of the cash to buy other companies for like three four or five x ebitda and then you just fix them and grow them and then just cash flow um i would so if i look just at cash invested in other companies that aren't mine like not companies i'm buying that or anything like that i would probably say 80 to 90 percent is in stocks what companies were you buying uh any that we can find that we like like we bought uber says it was a software company bought it for 120 put 3 million into it um it took i think less than seven or eight months to get to a million a month in revenue what's it called ubersuggest hrs competitor that one did well uh we just bought another map a lady named lisa crazy and then we just bought another one we haven't announced it we bought it for 8.6 i think a month ago a month and a half ago uh so we'll see it does a hundred thousand a month uh we think we can grow it within 12 months to probably like four or five hundred grand a month in profit so forget revenue we just will look at it as a cash flow so do you uh have rules around that like okay i have to be able to grow it using neilpatel.com or it has to be in the marketing niche so the agency benefits no it's like would you buy like brick you know like a [ __ ] laundromat or if i can grow it i won't do too much brick and mortar but i've invested in other people's brick and mortar like i have a friend who does a lot of brick and mortar businesses um like one of my buddies has a roofing company and i was like oh cool you can buy it for 3x it's good size and i can show you a few things and we can probably increase the profit by like 60 within 12 months so it's like it's just good cash flow right like if you're getting like 30 40 50 returns on your money it's great and then you also have to keep in mind because of my my history and i've been doing this long enough i also can get debt at really cheap terms and large amounts of debt like i can get debt at like 3.6 plus silver so if i'm buying a business for 5x in many cases because of the economics of my whole portfolio you know some businesses i put down like on the one that was um 8.6 2.6 was uh paid over 12 or 18 months or something like that but we put six mil up front i could have got a loan for it but i was like yeah this is easier to put the six mill and not deal with the paperwork but sometimes we'll just do loans on 100 of it but zero down right and what do you like okay so you do what you do now so you have your time and it's pretty much probably fully allocated let's say to the agency and then some of these other things um if somebody was smart but didn't have your you have a bunch of visibility you kind of know where your industry is going you see adjacent opportunities but hey i'm not going to go do them i don't have the time uh what are opportunities that you see that you think somebody listening to this who's just like smart hustler like i got more time than i have ideas um i got more time than i have money where would you go if you were that person what would you what would you suggest for them to look at as like you know opportunities that you see today i would look for opportunities in anything that they're good at and i know that's not the answer that you're looking for but what i found that the issue is when people go look for opportunities that make some money when you're not passionate you don't put in the time and energy required to actually make it successful that's a big issue we see maybe some people have it in them where they can make something successful because they'll just tough it out but most people we see will just quit because they just hate what they're doing and so but i think a lot of people don't know what they love to do they don't have like they don't if they already had what they love to do they wouldn't be you know looking for opportunities so you know uh sort of like a by-definition problem there right so somebody who's who's thinking about okay i don't love what i'm currently doing i'd like to i want to get to where this guy's at but which is basically like seems happy and successful right um he he seems like he said he loves what he's doing i'd love to do that but what if i don't know right it's like when my sister was going to college my dad asked her you know she's like what should i major in he's like i don't know what's her favorite subject and she was like lunch like you know i don't i don't have a favorite subject i don't love any of these subjects um so what am i supposed to do like am i just out uh you know i'm just not one of those you just having a lot of different until you find what you're passionate about because if you try a lot of different things you'll typically find something that you're naturally good at usually what you're naturally good at you'll also tend to favor and what you like and then just double down on that but if you're looking for industries with opportunities i see a huge slowdown in e-commerce not only the e-commerce market shrinking i'm not saying that but the growth in the e-commerce market isn't as what it was once used to be right when coveted first kicked off so you're gonna see the multiples go down to buy e-commerce shops d2c brands right so great opportunity for buying and go fix them up and grow them and scale them another great opportunity right now is uh free so i look at the whole software market as really backwards okay in which right now it doesn't matter if you're a hubspot or canva eventually someone can just create a me too company and just undercut you on pricing and what i've learned is if you can create a software company that already has a brand that has a free product and you just make it really good for free and you just keep adding more and more to it a great example of this is photo p so there's this company called photo p it's uh uh we love it photoshop and it's like they make very little to no money so i hit up one of my buddies who is great at outreaching and i told him i want photo fee i offered him 10 million he said no offered him 20 million he said no i can take photo p make it a really good canva competitor undercut him on pricing whatever be worth 10 20 40 billion whatever they are no but i probably can cashflow that thing to like or five million a month in ebitda right it's like who cares what it sells for what it's worth you're saying make it free and you're saying cash flows like a [ __ ] so what how do you take a free product in cash like how would you explain that well he said he said a canva a canva knockoff canva knockoff so you make you make almost 99 of it for free you charge for one percent but that one percent is enough where you can drive in the revenue so you don't ever make as much as like a canva or like a mailchimp or a hubspot but hey if you can make millions a month in profit it's still good what's your math there so when what's the calculus when you're thinking so like let's say photo p according to similar web has 10 million uniques a month or something what was your math is that right yeah it is right uh we researched it yeah so like what was your calculus to get to uh four million and even a month like what would how many people would you need to run it and what was the what's the calculus there sure so i can probably get the thing from 10 million visitors i can so let's say i bought it for 20 right he wouldn't sell to me for 20. um i've never outreached him but i had a buddy outreach to him for me who just does all my outreach so let's say i bought it for 20 i'd put another 10 into it so now i'm out 30 million dollars i'm really good at growing traffic and i know i can grow this thing to roughly 40 million uniques a month i just have a i don't know how but for some weird reason i know traffic really well and how to calculate what i can get it to and all this kind of stuff right and i've done enough research and competitors of what features drive x amount of traffic just looking at so many competitors in the space so let's say if i get it to 40 um what is it called 40 million and what what are the one or two things that you'd get at the 40 million like seo basically so uh more seo more virality uh increasing the quality of the templates increasing features uh adding ai in there like click a button we can automatically detect backgrounds remove it filters for social media because a lot of people use them for social media logo generator website as a lead gen [ __ ] like that right so then so let's say you got up to 40 million right at 40 million i can easily monetize let's call it like one percent of the traffic or let's be even more conservative like a half a percent 200 000 people if i have 200 000 people hypothetically paying three dollars a month okay that's 600 000 the reason i give you on average three dollars in certain countries you may want to charge different pricing like india and stuff like that so it's more affordable so three dollars a month and at three dollars a month if a customer stays for ten months that's six million dollars you can probably run the thing with less than a million million and a half and burn each month so then you think oh so then for a million and a half burn you would need once you have tons of revenue right when you don't have tons of revenue your burn is much lower on the monthly basis yeah but so then how many people then if it's you're looking at 30 people you need to run that operation i i don't even think 30 but let's say 30 total so i think i can actually run the thing for under a million dollars a month right so i'm just trying to do the math in my head but i mean the revenue was under a million two there was like 600 000 or something right 600 000 a month but if a customer stays for 10 months you're looking at 6 million dollars [Music] no no okay if they're paying three dollars a month if you have 4 40 million not 4 million but 40 million you're converting a half a percent that's 200 000 paying customers a month if they pay you three dollars a month that's 600 000 they last for 10 months that's 6 million dollars a month in mrr over a year you're making 72 million dollars in revenue that's crazy you're a very interesting person you uh i just i think i dig you because you've got your hands at so many different things i honestly don't at this point i don't run anything i come up with ideas i have really good operators who are great at execution like go do this it'll make money here's a play with go and just do it so how many businesses do you own i don't know i don't really count i only look at over under 10 over over under 20. i don't know 20 is probably getting close so probably under if i had a guess and how many of those 20 how many of those 20 companies have more than five employees full-time employees i don't know i don't really count employee head count i only know my ad agency head count because they do reports and i get in my board meeting decks like i'm like oh we got 700 people and you own 100 of most of these companies it seems like you're not raising extra capital you might you give your ceo of really anything um i always give equity to uh profit share i usually have a partner who runs things will get equity and then i'll do profit share what's the uh ideal setup for profit sharing and equity for your partner uh partner give them maybe 10 of the business they run it plus a really nice salary when i mean nice salary industry or more than industry and then you have a pool for employees like another 10 pool so then you losing total 20 i'm left with 80 myself i put up all the money if it does well great if it doesn't i lose the money no one else is on the line uh if it does well no one has to pay me back the money everyone just takes their distributions the moment it turns profitable from a monthly standpoint does that make sense they don't actually have to pay back any of the other stuff and then do you also do give them 10 the distribution or do you make that even uh heavier for them well if i'm losing 20 in total which is my deal structure then 20 of the profits gets distributed on a monthly basis that's crazy i love hearing about this what do you think sean yeah i think it's dope i um i had just seen you kind of from afar for a while that i i got i know he you know loosely like we're friends but uh so you know i didn't know a lot of the story i know i knew sam has talked about you before on the plot i think it's or maybe off the pot i'm not sure but sam had told me some cool stuff um but i didn't know a lot of this so for me this was dope because i got to learn a bunch of new things uh sometimes when we have a guest it's like dude i've already listened to 10 of your things i've been following you for five years you know so it's like i already know a lot of it and i'm doing sort of like translation work for the audience i'm like tell them about this hey tell them about that thing you did uh versus in this like i genuinely wanted to know a bunch of the stuff and i thought you know uh this is interesting to me yeah you're great there's two people that i wanted to talk to sean who are like neil so i mean there's neil so i wanted neil i like finding these people that like are doing really well and a lot of people know about but there's also this whole other world of people who have no idea who they are neil you're one of those folks i've been i'm an og reader so i've known you forever the other one is syed so syed we talked about syed a bunch on here him and neil i think are very similar which is very generous but also like pretty cutthroat when it comes to business and has their hands in just dozens of different things and they're just quietly crushing it and not even talking about it and he's a very generous person too i know he has a school i think in the same city i have a school in or a different city i don't know he actually went to go see his school but uh really generous guy uh him and i have built schools in third world countries and stuff like that yeah it's just like you you too you guys are i don't know if you're like this neil but i know it seems like he's like this where he like has this uh you know software business that's making who knows tens of many tens of millions uh in revenue and probably that much in profit but and he like buys a gas station or like he like just it's just like dude are you kidding me like you're a you're like a tech tycoon and you also own like 30 gas stations it's just kind of funny here's the thing some of those businesses sell for like 3x ebitda you get 33 returns on your money if you have good operators and you can put technology in place in marketing and you can grow to maybe 50 times irr that's great it's just the question of can you scale it up and can you do ones that are large enough i know i'm just saying it's cool that you know this stuff that's what you're eclectic yeah him and i actually shouldn't speak for him but i'm a little off right but the the madness or the methodology i think is great for cash flow it's terrible if you want to be like oh i'm going to create the next airbnb and take this thing public and be like on the farms list like it's not what i do is that are you motivated to become a billionaire what what's your motivation factor what are you motivated by well i won't ever be a billion i'm not saying i have the opportunity to but even if i did uh i would never be there because we donate our money and when i mean donate like not wait till you're dead to donate like actually donate on an annual basis how do you figure out how do you figure out how much you want to give because there's always like like when i think about it i think like well i could also invest this money it's going to grow i'm gonna give more later but then i'm not helping somebody now and so what's the right number what's the right percentage basically for me to be giving on an annual basis how do you figure that out for yourself whatever my wife wants to give what person what percentage does that come out to uh we don't have a percentage keep in mind businesses are so large i can get loans for anything on almost any type of business i can't go buy a business for a million dollar a billion dollars but if i wanted to buy a business for 100 million dollars i can go get a loan on that like literally for most of it so i still i don't have to worry anymore about do i need more of it to invest it's just we find the right causes and is it going to make a big enough impact that's more that's more about how we look about donations we don't really look at it from the aspect of am i donating x dollars or too high of a percentage we look at it as do we actually think it's going to make a big impact in the next year or short run or two years we don't want to wait like 10 20 years to see an impact we also don't want to put money towards like things like cancer research i think cancer is really important i know a lot of people who have died from cancer but i don't have enough money to make it into cancer versus you know solving some of the basic things out there like i can make an impact on things like education in a region i can't make an impact on cancer i just don't have enough cash for that where uh what is your school you said i have a school that sounds tight i want a school uh i've never seen it we have a school i think it's in cambodia and we've done a few others but i don't really keep track my wife does and you know the bigger thing is it's not my school it's more so the kids school and are they learning and getting value from it i uh i remember the first school that i bought and forgot about i was gonna say um when i buy my school it's for sure gonna be my school they might attend my school in cambodia yeah i'm like that guy i bought a couple i've got a couple schools in this couch cushion back here just i just forgot about it i just it's a little scene i played in a while ago i remember when i was on college camps i saw like you know whoever the rothschilds or like the rockefeller's uh name plate or whatever on the like uh the library at duke campus and i was like who would do this what's the point of this you know like so it's already nice not that kind of schools i don't have that kind of money mine's like little kids i didn't understand the appeal until you said you basically described a school you have and forgot and have never visited and i was like ah that sounds like something i want i don't want my name played on you know the villanova like 10th library on campus but like just to know that there's you know 12 kids in vietnam attending my school they're wondering why does this name have so many a's and it's you know who is this who is this benefactor silent benefactor who has forgotten where our school where school is that sounds like a perfect blend of giving and egomania that i live for so that's perfect neil we uh we usually so we don't have guests on often and when we do we typically never just ask them questions like this we like it's more of a conversation where we're brainstorming stuff we asked you tons of questions because you're just a very fascinating person i hope you'll come on soon and you can actually brainstorm uh like another uber suggests or something like that you know like actually go through some of this i i hope you'll come back again because this is awesome yeah it was so funny i was doing the interview i'm like oh crap i should have never told people how much i spent a month should i never told people i donate money and i was just like it goes against a lot of what my wife and i do we're more of don't tell anyone anything live our lives and do whatever it makes you only told it because it's not like you're bragging we like kind of begged you to tell like we were kind of got under we were like yeah tell us go go tell us it's not like you're like i don't think that's bragging it's not even bragging it just feels weird to talk about expenses right because there's so many people who struggle for like clean water or shoes right because i was like yeah yeah yeah but this is interesting those people uh if they ever listen to this podcast they've already been filtered out by our douchiness in other uh episodes so don't worry those anybody who's sensitive to that's probably gone by now but also there's there's actually a lot of like i actually pretty passionately believe this like not only am i curious from like a oh i wanna know i wanna learn uh but like i actually pretty strongly believe that the way that people are like treat money as a pretty taboo thing um actually is like a net like a huge net negative on most people so like you know people don't know what other people make therefore they don't know what like they don't know when they're underpaid they don't know what's possible they don't ever like sometimes the most valuable conversations i have with somebody is just somebody for whom they do something like something's very normal to them it would be abnormal to me but it has now expanded my world view of what's possible and what could be normal for me like oh maybe it could be normal to actually like give more donate more have a school actually that sounds like something i actually would go talk to my wife about today is like something we should go do that like it's not because you weren't bragging about it you highly you just kind of were honest about how you live your life which is no there's nothing wrong with that that's great in my opinion and it expands other people's worldview for something maybe they want to go do or something that they haven't considered and like it's really weird to me that we keep the stuff under wraps and if somebody's just honest about like the way they live their life it's sort of like there's like all this like negative taboo around it and like [ __ ] that i don't like that at all and um it's been like when sam first met me i think i think i've told the story before but like the second day i met him and then like the next day he messaged me on facebook investor was like so like how much do you make and he was like no like what do you pay yourself he's like so then what he and then i like i was like whoa that's like super forward and he's like but he told me why he was like so i'm trying to figure out how much to pay myself as an entrepreneur i have no [ __ ] clue and like my investors think i should make this much but i don't know is that normal and like i can kind of ask you and dance around it or like i'm just asking like five friends what they make in the same role as i am it's like startup ceo and like that'll help you figure out what's normal what's the range of like possibilities here and then after that he was like so what do you do with the money like what do you invest he's like wow that's a lot you know what are you investing that i was like yeah he's like what are you investing in i'll start telling him and he's like cool i'm investing in this and now i got new ideas about what i could be investing and i it really became very obvious to me in that moment i was like oh [ __ ] you're at a massive advantage if you have a few people you trust that you can talk openly about this sort of thing with and the podcast was basically taking that doing it at scale i was like all right well what if me and sam are pretty honest about like the [ __ ] we do and like what if we could get guests to be honest about the [ __ ] they do they're like that's actually a pretty valuable resource for people who don't have five they don't happen to have that lucky group of five friends who are all motivated entrepreneurs who are also open and honest about what they do it's like well not everybody's located in a place where they have five people geographically around them that they can trust to talk about that stuff and so the pod kind of like serves as that so that's my uh justification for why you shouldn't feel bad about about sharing that information did it work neil do you do not feel but if you want we'll bleep it out or whatever if you feel like that too okay it is what it is i still feel bad but it is what it is i thought it was yes i thought it was a great speech show and i i i felt good about that thank you deal that was a great speech but i i i still feel bad because i look at money as like a tool to help other people and i'm not saying that's right or wrong that's how i just do but i also know i spend more than i should um and i probably should cut back and live a more humble life and spend a lot less yeah dude i'm inspired by how you spend and how you live and it's uh you know you've done some good in the world by inspiring me [Music] you

this one streamer who we're talking about what's his name uh xqc in this case how much money does he make he probably makes between i wanna say three to ten million dollars a year no way really yeah probably five to ten is the easy estimate um ten man ten is not even the upper bound like they these guys can make much more than that maybe up to 20 25 million if they are maxing out their stuff but they don't always want to do that like uh i taught because i used to negotiate with these guys so you know um even before twitch like when i was just trying to get them to promote our products and it's like all right i'm going to talk to i want to talk to the streamer like no you don't get to talk to the streamer you talk to the manager okay fair that's fine they're stars i get it all right who's the manager is it like you know caa or like wme and like for 95 percent of them it's like oh it's like his little brother ray ray yeah that was his girlfriend or like you know exactly it's ray-ray or like oh hey jenny um you know so how long you guys been working together it's like well we've moved in together like when we were 16 and then like he didn't do anything for five years just played video games all the time and like now he's rich and so i quit my job to like check his email [Music] this is like the shirt it's like the it's like the gen y or gen x whatever what are the young people now called what are the what are the what does the young people call it it's like gen z it's like the uh tommy bahama of gen z yeah i was i literally was about to start with the shirt so you're on to something what kind of what brand is that scotch and soda uh yeah dude gotcha sort of crushes it there was uh two i was i went shopping this weekend and um like whatever the like union square in san francisco and two dudes walked into the uh elevator with their scotch and soda bags and they were so happy it's like shopping makes people really happy i think that's an underrated part of shopping is how happy it made them and they were just like it was two guys and they were talking to each other and they were still talking about their shopping which i would say i've never experienced that being another dude just first of all going shopping together secondly after shopping not just being like all right it's done whatever like we don't even talk about it anymore he was like yeah i'm really happy with the color the guys again the color's sick and i was like i'm just in the elevator with them and i was like i was like is that moss green [Laughter] is awesome you shop there no i didn't shop there i was shopping for my wife but um it's in the same like area whatever like but you were shopping for her like with her she wanted to go by i told you she was trying to buy like a like a designer bag which by the way it the whole experience is crazy have you ever done that have you ever gone like a [ __ ] you gotta make an appointment yeah well now they it's like a restaurant now basically they uh you you go you put your name down though like we'll text you to get in like you can't just walk into the store yeah and um we go in and it's like i've got two babies and a dog with me so i'm already like you brought your dog to a louis vuitton store yeah it's my stroller has two children and a dog they're probably like sir you can't come in here you have to leave the kids outside they straight up i don't even think they saw the dog because the dog's so small and so quiet compared to the kids like i think that just got lost in the shuffle otherwise they for sure would have kicked me out uh but we were like hey you know um we're here we're here and we're just like okay why are you so loud it's like all right let's do this and i was so excited just because i was like all right whatever make this an experience and then like five minutes in i became like i went in with the best intentions i was like i'm gonna make this a great experience for my wife she wants this i i'm gonna not just play along i'm gonna like be along i'm gonna [ __ ] sing along with this and then like literally five to fifteen minutes in i was just like all right like just pick one [Laughter] it's a small one or the big one i don't know which one do you like just pick the one you like you're such a redneck you're like we're here and then like five minutes and we're like hey do you guys sell me like a lemonade or a turkey leg or anything i was like oh they used to offer snacks do you still guys still do that and they're like we've never done that sir and i was like all right where the shot and then like there's no cheez-its there was like a section for the purses that's like five stairs up but i got a stroller two children and a dog as you remember so i was like y'all got an elevator and it's like three stairs they're like uh yeah there is like a wheelchair lift over here i'm not sure if your wagon will fit but like and then i got stuck in the [ __ ] wheelchair lift going between like going up a four foot rise i get stuck and then i realize i'm not stuck i just pushed the door and it opens nobody was on the other side to open the door it wasn't automatic either dude you're the indian uh curb your enthusiasm yeah that's exactly how i felt oh dude somebody said this the other day they go um they go i was in l.a you know i was in l.a or whatever in new york somewhere and larry david was there at a a driving range playing golf and they were like um it's and they're like it was like some like just like a hole in the wall type of driver not like a nice one they're like why does larry david go there he's like oh it's like mirror where he lives or something so he just popped over it's like 2 p.m on a tuesday he just wanted to hit some balls and they're like i overheard him and nobody even nobody pays any attention you know this just looks like an old guy and nobody knows who he is and he's talking to the lady who sells it gives you the balls the balls are the balls are 11 and he's like why does he have to be 11 he's like like he was negotiating the price or like he was complaining about he's like a super rich guy he's like it's not the price eleven dollars now i gotta have a ten but a ten is not enough if you made it ten one bill we're done now i gotta give you a now what are you gonna give me five and then four once what am i gonna do with these ones it's like like an actual curb your enthusiasm skills i would definitely like that in real life for sure um all right since we're talking about entertainment and content i have to tell you about two different things so we're going to call this segment i'm happy free freaks exist here's the craziest content that i've consumed this weekend have you heard of the show no yeah no definitely not have you uh have you seen this show called naked and afraid i've heard of it but i have not watched it it's like it's the craziest thing right no it's worse than that so what they do is they take two strangers and they drop them off in like the jungle in south africa or asia i don't even know where the exact locations are it's all over the world but like remote remote locations oftentimes places that's like 110 degrees during the day and like 50 degrees at night so you're freezing they take two strangers they put them uh in this area okay they give them nothing sometimes if the water's really bad they'll give them just a a a pot just an empty pot and and a machete that's basically it and they make the two strangers meet and work together to survive for 21 days and they're completely butt naked they're they're not wearing anything they're entirely naked and they've got to like spoon at night to stay warm otherwise they're going to like shiver and like and like is it it's not like two dudes to women makes what are we it could be usually so usually uh like a man and a woman but then they like throw like curveballs in there so like they had this like guy i think he was from australia and they played him out like he's like this like redneck hick guy from australia and then the woman is a transsexual and she comes on and the they set it up so like they like you know how is this conservative guy gonna feel about this and he was totally and like the whole show it was like oh you know it's okay like everyone's like unique and and he's like totally kind and like it's like oh man he's breaking the stereotypes and they like hug it out and they're like we'll protect one another we're team and so that's like you know like one of many ways the show is amazing is like they're like doing this together it's ridiculous and the hardest thing i've ever seen and i don't think they get paid a cent even you have to watch this show it's ridiculous and so they have to survive for how long 21 days 21 days and so what are they doing they're going and hunting or they're just like eating uh they're like usually they're like we have to make shelter they're like we have to go figure out how to make a fire sometimes it's in a rain forest and it's raining and they're like i don't know how we're going to stay warm we're not going to eat and so sometimes they won't eat for days or 10 days uh on one episode a guy made a bow and arrow and shot a bird it was awesome um another episode a guy tried to go and wrestle a crocodile to bring back and to eat um often times i've noticed another uh like trait i've noticed is usually the women are way tougher and way calmer like significantly like the men are like come out all aggressive like this is gonna be awesome and they're like trying to cheer the woman on like let's do this and then they like get worn out after seven days and they bail and the woman just stays by herself and does it uh so usually the it seems that women are mentally uh stronger uh it's amazing this it's a it's a it's a wild show i cannot believe that like people do this okay that's amazing uh what does that have to do with uh you put a tweet in here also next to it that's completely unrelated but i guess it's under the theme of i'm i'm glad that freaks exist the second thing there's this guy what's his name is his name felix felix what's the url of his website you know is it like felix today how is felix dot today so this freaking guy for eight years he tracked hundreds of different parts of his life so and i have a list up so he tracked the easy ones like weight steps and diet but then uh and then alcohol but then he tracked his mood his stress he used rescue dot me rescue time i think it's called an app that tracks which programs he was using on his computer how much time he spent on his cell phone his mood his energy his sleep uh how often he how many texts he sent that day how often he talked to friends um if he was more productive in the evening or the day if he took any drugs um what city he was in what the weather was how hungry he felt did he feel lethargic did he feel stressed uh what else did he it was like just so much stuff he had 30 or 40 or 50 000 data points and it's all done in an engineer-like way where it you know he could say like well i was 46 more likely to say i felt sad if i didn't see a friend in the trailing three days like there's like what what are can can you read out some of the findings yes so like for example how how does longer sleep duration like how does sleep affect my day he's like if i have um let's see so if he had more than eight and a half hours okay i think i think he means less here but he's 65 percent more likely to have cold symptoms 60 more likely to have a headache he uses social media 40 more when he sleep deprived um 30 more likely to be a rainy day that's interesting um yeah crazy stuff 20 less likely to hit the gym actually no longer sleep duration this is so i didn't read it wrong he's saying if i sleep more than eight and a half hours all those things are true um which is great read another one read some of the other ones it like it's pretty this is it's pretty amazing what you found but then air quality and various rooms like i'm not even going to read what goes beyond that but just like measuring the air quality is crazy uh wow this is wild i'm i'm scrolling i've been scrolling for like the entire time you were talking and i'm halfway through this guy's findings this guy's he's not is he okay he's a nut this guy's a freak the funny thing is he tracked everything and i'm like is this guy okay i don't think he's okay i need an answer it should start at the top is he okay and actually it says felix feels all right and updated one hour ago and it says what city he's in it's amazing this first little table is nice wait height sleep and then it goes last meditated 41 days ago inbox 20 emails personal to-do lists 179 tasks wow it's pretty wild is a sleeping heart rate 459 beats per minute so if you scroll all the way to the bottom he's got one sentence that kind of like summarizes this and he says do like a con my computer's not working but if you do like a control f build or something like that you might find it where he says basically building this and having all this information i'm happy i did it because it's just like a fun way for me to nerd out but it was not beneficial and it doesn't make sense for anyone else to do this so you were saying the main it says the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution and investing this much time um so that's on the building your own solution uh i'm very happy that i built this project in the first place it gave me much better awareness of everything going on in my life uh i'm excited i'm excited to have this uh have built this website to wrap up this project and showcase some outcomes so he's done this for eight years you said yeah wow [Laughter] amazing right yeah truly amazing how'd you find this guy on twitter how is felix dot today if you want to go check it out it's nice it's amazing it's actually pretty nice i'm not gonna lie it's awesome it's totally unnecessary and absolutely amazing like i would like to have this if i just could do no work or like you know touch a button once every five hours like you know i'm down to do that but i don't want to remember to log all this stuff his story and so this guy's incredibly interesting his story i i read i like researched a lot of them because i i thought he was amazing he said he moved where does it say where he's from is he from vienna or somewhere like that yeah and he moved to san francisco in 2015 to work at twitter and then after a year he was like you know i don't really like having an apartment i'm only going to live on an airbnb in san francisco and then he was like i'm just gonna leave san francisco and so for the past like seven years he's only like he doesn't own anything other than a suitcase i think and that's how he's been living good for him i like it i like the uh i like the segment too i'm glad that freaks exist can i tell you about uh another freak yeah all right elon musk so the the but this is not actually about elon this is about his wife have you ever stumbled down the rabbit hole that is justine musk on quora she talks a lot of crap she airs out a lot of their she's she like is it sounds like elon didn't treat her wonderfully and she lets the world know like she airs out their laundry well i don't know i don't know about all that what did she do that that aired out as laundry i'm not sure that that's true she said that he was driven and everything but she also said like uh i don't want to exactly paraphrase i don't remember entirely but i remember like she gave like a ted talk and on quora she's like yeah it's just like living with him was horrible because he wasn't there he clear we were all like second and third place to his work yeah yeah so she says things that you would that's not airing out of dirty laundry yes i don't know just come that's common sense almost uh he's had like three wives i'm pretty sure you know something's not great about the experience otherwise you know may have lasted for longer uh but dude i find her her quora to be fascinating she has and it's not all just oh let me tell you about elon musk it's like you know she answers questions about a bunch of stuff and she's done it for six years an author seven years yes so she's an author she's very smart novelist um and so she answers some questions i will give you a couple of the the answers that she gave so somebody said how can i be as great as bill gates steve jobs elon musk or uh or richard branson and so uh where's her answer let me find it have you been watching the johnny depp trial a little bit dude it's wow so good it's so good it's so exciting why are people why is this so fascinating to people there is okay you want to know another freaks exist uh moment go to um go to this instagram account before i even go back to this justine musk thing this is crazy and this is also like kind of interesting i wouldn't have guessed that this is a thing but go to the instagram account that's called what is it called how is habit or something like that it's called what's it called house inhabit so this person jessica reed krauss wow what are the odds both of them felix krauss and jessica krauss maybe they're married these two freaks so she lives in southern california uh and she calls herself the queen of the carpool the hollywood philosopher uh stereotypical scorpio tendencies and then she puts her venmo on here just to give you a quick sense of what we're dealing with okay so what's the scorpio i don't understand what that route is all like la things it's like you know here's my favorite crystal here's my horoscope here's my venmo and here's my casting tape so um all right so she basically covers trial like hollywood gossip but in the craziest amount of detail you'll ever see so look at her father account she's got 850 000 followers that's just like an independent person and she's been posting every day about the trial like if you go click her story there's like 50 like maybe more oh my god there's like 80 story frames right to like tap through and she edits it like crazy it's like insane so like um today's not a good one because it's like there wasn't like a trial thing but like if you click like 10 in it'll be like she'll cut like a little clip of johnny walking in and then there's music she overlays and then there's like a little thing that she cuts in this news clip from fox and then she adds on top of that then she transcribes a whole bunch of stuff and like puts the transcript there then she does the background research and so i know several people who are following the whole trial they don't watch a single minute of the trial they don't read the news they just follow it through her story because it because it is so crazy in depth and somewhat addictive and entertaining and like first when the first person told me i was like okay that's weird whatever you you got into something weird then i heard it again and i was like you also follow that random person and the yeah it's great and then i looked at then i looked him up and she has 850 000 followers and i was like holy [ __ ] this is crazy that this is like one of those niches that you wouldn't even really know exists but of course it exists and of course it's a big deal it basically takes the tabloid but it repackages it from a tabloid into like any individual person's instagram can become the juiciest tabloid in the world if you just put in the effort and she puts in mad effort what she just covered i was looking at her stories that there was a guy a couple of days ago he looked like he was dressed like he was about to go to be a waiter at a restaurant and he couldn't be at the trial so he was on zoom and he was in his car and he was sitting there with the zoo with this camera from him and he starts vaping on the call and you see him like take a hit of vape and like exhale all this smoke while he's sitting in his car waiting for the judge to ask a question and then uh it's clear that like he's got to go so he starts driving out of the parking lot like while and vaping while he's answering the calls and he's like all right you guys good dance it's everything all right i gotta go he's just he's like like vaping while driving away during this trial but uh all right what about justine okay so justine musk okay so somebody asked will i become a billionaire if i'm determined to be one and i put in the necessary work uh her first answer no one of the qualities of a self-made billionaire is their ability to ask the right question that is not the right question it's not to say it's a bad question it just won't get you to the part of your mind uh that's working to help you and mulling things over while you're doing up other things and sending up flares of insight you're determined so what you haven't been you haven't been racing naked through shark infested waters yet will you be determined when you wash up on some deserted island disoriented bloody ragged beaten staring off into the horizon with no sign of rescue and she's like so she goes through and she's like you know the world doesn't hit like the final thing the world doesn't throw a billion dollars at the person because they want it or because they work so hard they feel they deserve it the world does not know doesn't care what you want or deserve the world gives you in exchange for something it perceives to be of equal or greater value and um anyway so she goes through and and basically like you know the long story short was no a billionaire doesn't come on cora and ask these types of questions uh but it'll be like if you just go through and deep dive dive through to search her on on on quora and it's a fun like 20 minute read because i think you get little snapshots into somebody who knows elon musk really well and has been around somebody of that like you know kind of like the greatest entrepreneur and inventor of our lifetime um somebody who knows them from a different angle but then also somebody who's just like smart and objective so they're not a fanboy nor are they a hater it's like someone who i actually kind of respect and you know believe their opinion on these things obviously everybody's got their bias but i feel like with elon musk normally it's 100 fanboy or 100 hater um or just completely uninformed and like this is none of the above this is something else this is informed are there any other good ones that she's written up uh yeah there's a bunch that are just on so i started with the elon ones and then it'll be like you know um you know i'll be like you know should i how should i break up with my girlfriend it's like let's see what she has to say about that and like you just read like you know her kind of take on philosophy i don't know she's a fascinating character the other one is grimes just did a podcast with lex friedman i don't know if you saw saw that i heard about it so elon's current i don't know what i don't know if they're married girlfriend something baby mama i think they've had two babies together but they're not married or something like that they're not together anymore uh she did a podcast and you could definitely see like how these people would get along like she even talks like elon in this kind of like slow measured weird like finality type of way of speaking uh but she was talking about like you know um like how to raise kids or like you know looks like they're like you know what do you think about like you know uh free speech on twitter or something like that lex tried to ask her and she's like i i do not think i should have an opinion on this he's like oh my god and then which is like such an elon thing to say she's like i feel you know i'm too close to the situation i actually i should not have an opinion on this i should i shouldn't have an opinion on this oh my god [Laughter] it would not be it would not not be productive to this future of humanity does she come off that weird kind of yeah it's like not like i thought i don't know i knew nothing about her so like you know by just uh from afar is like oh i think he married like a musician or something like that okay she's probably like you know like some you know just like beautiful happy bubbly pop star and it's like no it's not that at all okay she's kind of like alternative all right i get it but still you know like i don't know charismatic charismatic and into like uh just like kind of like a extrovert people person and instead it was like you know she was like oh uh they were like how's it been you know like tell me about like you just had a baby you know what's what's mother had been like for you or whatever and she's like it reminds me of my favorite uh graphic novel sci-fi graphic novel um uh and then she named some japanese like graphic novel you know like no one's she's like have you read it and he's like no and then she's like it's called um i have no mouth but i must scream and that's awesome and that's what having this baby feels like because they're helpless right they can't even control their muscles they move they can't say what they want they can't express what they need but they need something and they're trying to scream but it's as if they have no mouth i was like whoa like pretty dark take on like motherhood but like i don't know also interesting and insightful at the same time um but yeah that's been kind of my like that's that's my contribution to the uh i'm happy that that freaks exist because like yeah i'm happy that there's people that are so different and um so interesting and we will live life in a way that's like interesting but like uncomfortable and i get to be comfortable and just watch them do interesting things like you know that dude i love it that teddy roosevelt quote that everybody all every entrepreneur loves to put on [ __ ] insulin like the the man in the arena it is not the critic who couch it's the man in the arena who's bloody and beaten and whatever you know what it's also tight to not be bloody and beat it's time to be just a casual fan in the arena eating popcorn watching other people get beaten up and then going back to your daily life like that's actually a pretty tight position that like most people should go into and not try to be like you know the gladiator dying in the arena or the critic hater you don't need to be either one our software is the worst have you heard of hubspot see most crms are a cobble together mess but hubspot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous i think i love our new crm our software is the best hubspot grow better dude do you realize that to some people i think you and i are that entertainment where like i'll have some people like reach out to me and i think it happens to you it's like oh you should do blank it's like you really just want me to dance for you yeah that's really yeah just tell me to dance that would be a lot easier that'll only take a few minutes you want me to dedicate three years of my life to starting blank yeah you guys should talk about this oh you want me to go get a phd in something i don't know about okay cool that's not how the podcast works but here's how the podcast works i'm weird and don't realize it then i come talk to sam he's weird and doesn't realize it then we kind of point out oh that's weird about each other then we go away and like you guys think we're both weird [Laughter] yeah i mean we are that to some people where they're just like want us to dance um but dude that's why i love the the youtubers like there's this guy i've been following i think it's called like whistling diesel there's all these youtubers where uh they got they get what does that pretty cool whistling i think it's whistling diesel so he like has all this acreage out in indiana i think and he just uh like builds cool trucks and cars and just like wrecks them basically uh like you know he'll build like um remember as a kid i think it was called the power wheel it's like the like the little toy trucks for kids where you like sit in it he'll build one i'll take one of those it's not really one of those but he like builds a version of that that has a massive gas engine in it it goes like 120 miles an hour but it looks like a power wheel so just like doing things that like you think you would want to do in the country but what's in or you know when you're out in the land and like just breaking [ __ ] and like blowing stuff up doing all that but what's crazy is these guys do it and then they start making money from it and they're like all right now we have more money to spend bigger stuff to blow stuff up and to build stuff like or there's all these guys on youtube who will like get like a 50 caliber rifle so like this gun that's like huge and scary and they're like you think it can shoot through that car like let's just try it let's see if it'll go straight through the car or what would happen if we just shot this at like a huge block of metal how deep will it go like just all these like stupid stuff that you would just only do like either when you're high or you just dream of but you're afraid of losing all this money they do it and i get to live through them and i love that wow that's cool they're actually kind of related note uh so mr beast basically does this but he's like exactly and you know he's almost like a hundred million subscribers on youtube so did you see this thing that was going on last night i i doubt you did because it's like you know you said you're gen y this is like gen z you know [ __ ] but basically there was a celebrity poker game last night with basically it was this public game last night that had like i don't know how many like 50 000 or more people watching it live um streamed on on twitch and youtube and it had mr beast who's the number one youtuber uh like or whatever one of the biggest youtubers ninja who was the biggest streamer for like a long period of time xqc who's the biggest uh like one of the biggest twitch streamers also there's basically like four or five huge content creators then it was phil hellmuth who's this like famous like pro poker player that's on tv all the time tom dwan who's like one of the greatest poker players ever so it's like a couple of pros and a couple of uh content creators and they came in it was a 50 000 buy-in game but they could rebuy and so it was called the million dollar game and basically this was being live stream last night and none of them were like playing seriously because they were like hey they're all rich and b they were trying to make for good content um and so they were like they played this game it was very entertaining game it was probably like the one of the most entertaining like uh i don't know like online or like uh tv poker games that i've seen like in a long time and uh i just thought it was a great idea that's a that's a pretty short list i would imagine though no i've been watching for a long time so i i actually care about about online about poker and have watched a bunch of like world series of pokers or so what happened so basically uh shout out to to our girl alexander botez do you know her she's the chess girl okay i i did a pie oh yeah we've talked about her i did a podcast yeah so she's uh a streamer content creator who's like her and her sister i don't think they're twins but i think they're they're sisters they um they're like chess mat like i don't know if they're grandmaster or their master players or whatever but they're like they're like great at chess but also great at content so they have like a big following or whatever and so she just cleaned up in this game and she's not like a great poker player it's just like they would they were all kind of playing very loose and she won like a half a million dollar pot like you know just kind of like with ace nine that's like kind of like a lucky hand or whatever and uh the pros were sitting there like just kind of waiting for a good car like waiting for good to play good cards or just playing smart whereas mr beast was like just playing kind of like ever any hand he could get into and then he'd be like he's just he's like i just want one clip to go viral like that's what i'm here for is for one clip to go viral because they're like i can poke or you could do this thing where once both people go all in you could say all right normally you would just there's only one card left and like one of us will win one of us to lose but you could do something called running it twice which kind of like smoothens out the like um the variability like it's like running multiple times in a simulation so you'll get like more possible outcomes so you can run it once run it twice running three times one or four times and he's like no we're gonna run it once he's like we need this clip to go viral it needs to be the highest stakes with the biggest heartbreak and like the easiest to understand and you can see the poker pros were like oh okay like i guess so i guess that makes makes sense it's like to be so funny just to see uh these guys playing with totally different like agendas and styles and also they were mic'd up the whole time and there was no edits because it was live and so you could just hear them like bullshitting about whatever to each other and like you know people from different worlds kind of just like so you do this like i was like so like you know uh how much how often do you play he's like oh i've been i don't play like this is the first day off i've taken in four years he's like what do you mean like uh how often do you stream because i stream every day for 10 hours a day he's like what he's like yeah and he's like uh this is one of the few like one of the rare this guy xqc and there and they're like how long have you been do that for like seven years i don't understand the poker player looked at the streamer like you degenerate which is hilarious because the poker player is normally like the biggest degenerate who sits at a table playing you know this like stupid card game for five hours straight losing money is that real well someone will someone really stream for seven years every single day for 10 hours yeah yeah that happens uh like not 10 usually it's not those exact numbers but people have streamed every day for 10 years and they'll stream like five hour streams or something like that as like their their normal stream and some guys do 10 hour streams and then they'll usually take one day off a week maybe actually i don't know specifics but like yeah he he he's a like he's a nut and when he's streaming what's he doing he's playing video games any game so he yeah he was like big in overwatch but then overwatch stopped getting like popular but he got more popular because his personality is pretty big like he just kind of gets wild on the stream and so now he'll go he'll do whatever he'll play in a virtual farm simulator he'll play like you know a shooting game he'll play like whatever the game is he calls himself a variety streamer which is basically like at that point they've stopped coming for the game and they're coming for you and is he funny like yeah what what he's what's great about him uh he's funny and he like he like rage he like gets enraged pretty quickly which is like a big thing on twitch is like you gotta like show emotion so like you see in basketball or like golf is the ultimate example of this uh and this is where i think traditional sports can learn a lot from online content because traditional sports they teach you like if you ever watch a basketball press conference they're the most boring in the world it's like yeah we're just gonna take it one game at a time you know they're a great team add respect to them uh you know we just gotta keep putting one foot in front of the other it's like oh great you know like super boring whereas you you and i love ufc because that one guy would be like he ain't [ __ ] i'm gonna kick his team his ass and his whole team's ass you know like they just like they like talk [ __ ] to each other so that adds a level of like drama and excitement streaming is like that but like 24 7 where they're just constantly you know talking [ __ ] to them to their teammates about themselves about you know the game about like the characters about the strategy about whatever so they show a ton of emotion so if he loses he'll throw the mouse he'll break the keyboard he'll like you know like spit and scream and you know like he'll get angry how does he have enough energy to do that every single day it's just what he does man it's like he that's and you just sit and he's sitting in a chair for he's sitting at a chair for 10 hours a day look different yeah yeah you may not like this but it is peak physical performance exactly somebody said this thing there was this hilarious line during the thing so she won the the alexander won the 500 000 pot and then she like won another pot she was like up 600 grand she came in with 50k and she had like a 650 000 chip stack and like she had so many chips she couldn't even stack them in time like the next hand needed to be dealt but her giant her giant chip stack was just blocking the tap the table and she's like um i need help stacking the chips and they were like [ __ ] you we're not gonna help you stack your chips you just took from us and like the pit boss comes over they're helping and then mr peace goes she's single-handedly gonna close the wage gap yeah they're just trolls and uh it's just amazing it was amazing and i just thought that was a great idea by the way i like a like a high stakes poker game amongst personalities in any niche i actually think that's a good marketing idea this one streamer who we're talking about what's his name uh xqc in this case how much money does he make he probably makes between i want to say three to ten million dollars a year no way really yeah probably five to ten years is the easy estimate um ten man ten is not even the upper bound like they these guys can make much more than that maybe up to 20 25 million if they are maxing out their stuff but they don't always want to do that like uh i taught because i used to negotiate with these guys so you know um even before twitch like when i was just trying to get them to promote our products and it's like all right i'm going to talk to i want to talk to the streamer like no you don't get to talk to the streamer you talk to the manager okay fair that's fine there's stars i get it all right who's the manager is it like you know caa or like wme and like for 95 percent of them it's like oh it's like his little brother ray ray yeah that was his girlfriend or like you know exactly it's ray ray or like oh hey jenny um you know so how long you guys been working together it's like well we've moved in together like when we were 16 and then like he didn't do anything for five years just played video games all the time and like now he's rich and so i quit my job to like check his email because they'll be they'll be like yeah we do like brand deals i'm like cool so like do you have like a deck you guys can share about like you know his stats they're like no you could just like go on and see how many people watch them it's like a lot and it's like it's like so like you have this deal with like red bull like logitech like surely you have like a brand and like like you know when you pitch them like we don't pitch anybody like like basically and you know as i got to know people it's like they just get inbound into their email and then they just decide they ignore 95 of it even though it's people literally throwing them like like people can get paid uh like the small even like like less high profile like ninja is a different tier right ninja does have a proper manager and like actually his girlfriend i think is his manager now his wife uh but like he had a proper agency behind him and they pitched red bull and all this stuff but like most streamers somebody will approach and be like hey i'll pay you 2000 an hour to play my game today and they're like nah that game looks boring i'm not gonna do it right because like they don't want to lose their audience or like piss off their audience too much or be seen as selling out and so they turned down so many opportunities that they could have because they don't want to be seen as a sellout nor do they want to like bother with anything it's like dude by the time i'm done streaming for 10 hours like imagine doing this podcast 10 hours a day or eight hours a day you have zero energy left to like do anything else and so you just like you don't want to even think about it so and do a lot of them have any expenses so or are they just paying taxes and rent and they're just stacking cash yeah that's exactly it some of these streamers i mean they could be worth 30 or 40 million dollars liquid yeah that's crazy isn't it yeah like uh ninja got paid you know i can't say the number but stupid money to go stream on mixer like a competitor to twitch i think it got leaked i think the number got leaked because uh something happened yeah maybe i think i think twitch got hacked and like all the spreadsheet got out remember you know i'm talking about well that's the that's pretty visible anyways that's that's just what they earn directly so basically like the fans subscribe five dollars a month or six dollars a month or whatever to the channel in order to like kind of just like show their support and get like special emojis that they get to use and uh sometimes the streamer can turn around where subscriber only chat but um but for the most part like they get donations that that most people can't see how much donations they get uh then they get subscribers directly that's a monthly recurring subscription then there's brand deals and sponsors that didn't show up in the twitch thing because that goes direct and it's like they just pay the streamer directly it's not part of twitch and so there's like other uh and then you know games come to them and pay them hey we're doing a brand launch we want all ten of the big streamers all playing valerian today and they'll drop you know five million dollars on that campaign because they know that if they do that they become the it game and millions of people will get to see their favorite streamer playing the game and saying how awesome it is or whatever showing it off and so it's worth it to them because they're going to make way more than that have you seen intro.com have you been intro.com yeah i looked at investing in it but i decided not to so i talked to the guy who started like i went to uh i went to like a car racing class and he like a friend of a friend brought him and i had to hang out with him he's a cool guy and he was like hey just sign up for intro dot com and basically what it you do is you just like put that you're available a certain hours amount of uh certain hours a week and someone will pay you like two thousand dollars an hour in 15 minute incr increments to talk to you and i was like i don't know man i feel kind of sleazy doing that and he was like well just try and i was like okay well you know you seem nice whatever i'll kind of do it just to like geek out and try this new product and i signed up for it and i've been getting bookings like crazy and between i'm i'm at the phase now a little bit where you know it's coming up on uh this july will be a year and a half since the acquisition uh it's like yeah [Laughter] how many years you've been married i have no idea how many years ago year and a half 16 months it's like well which uh which time zone are we are we thinking here because i can tell you uh so it's coming up to that time and i'm like all right do i like start a new company what am i going to do uh what should i be doing and i sign up to intro and we're doing this and i got that little copy that thing and i got like this airbnb and i'm like well besides like the fact that like i could live off interest like off my nut i'm like that's kind of cool like there's all this income coming in there's so much and i'm not trying to like i'm trying to do this like brag [ __ ] but i'm saying like for a creator that has a mildly big audience there are so many ways to make money it's pretty astounding and we're not even that i mean we're just like semi-popular and a relatively small niche so like let alone if you're like these twitch guys and you you're you're actually really popular but it's pretty astounding how many like revenue streams are available to us just because of all these this like weird all these creator type tool things totally like i saw uh some guy tweeted today he goes bro at elon musk give me my blue check back and had like 80 000 likes i was like who is this guy he's like he's a soccer player at like man city or something like that and i was like and he's got like millions of followers i was like wow you know like it's like there's so many levels of fame like that guy's not famous at all compared to like you know justin bieber or whatever and justin bieber's not famous compared to whoever but like you know down if you go 20 rungs down the ladder it's like we're like moderately known in a tiny niche and then i sent you that link of that those guys who discuss like uh they're like bodybuilders or something like that are they they're discussing like working out or something like that they're like wait wait guessing setup oh uh yeah i was on their podcast they're awesome what yeah yeah i was on their podcast a couple years ago the uh mind body wow is it mind body pump or just mind body that's the ultimate resume for your uh for your fitness influencer career i did it looking at youtube yeah they were like i think that video had like i don't know i want to say 80 000 views or 150 000 views or something like that but just not like you hear of bigger numbers but that's big that's like we get less than that on our youtube and i feel like we're big now they're big and they're in just like another niche but their niche lets them do a lot more because more broad appeal like there's a bunch of dudes out there who want to be like more muscular like people want to lose weight and so you know they can flip on one you know white labeled supplement or course or whatever the heck they want and you know that that type of following can print uh i don't know again five to ten million dollars a year for sure profitably you know without like the stress of being an entrepreneur trying to invent a new product and go into a new niche and then it also has a bunch of downsides right like the guys streaming 10 hours a day for seven years straight like the biggest problem with content is you're usually on a treadmill and like you know you feel like you can't get off like twitch streamers have this all the time or they feel burnt out because they're just like they feel like if they stop they'll lose everything and it's true if they stop they actually do lose quite a bit of like uh you know like sway with not only you know their subscribers but the algorithm and things like that so you know i think that's the downside of these models you have to build a business that's beyond that so those guys the what's it called the uh i listen to it all the time i'm totally blanking mind body pump is that what it's with sal and adam uh it's like the they're based out of a sacramento so they um they just bought a bunch of airbnb they bought a bunch of properties and they're turning them into fitness airbnbs and so that's like a good example that well it will it'll extend beyond them but uh yeah i mean like what do you do like have there been any examples i think you know who jenna marbles is yeah so she's like she was got popular in my mind when she was on barstool and then she bailed and went to youtube and became like one of the biggest youtubers of all time i'm pretty sure that she like got her cash and got her money and i don't even think she posts anymore even though she has many many tens of millions of subscribers how many i my internet's slow so i can't even pull it up how many subscribers yeah she's got a ton on youtube i think it's like 50 or 60 million she was one of the first people to get popular i feel like she got popular like i want to even say before youtube she got 19 million subscribers she's been on for 10 years uh when was her last video i have no idea uh is she still posting regularly i don't think she posts per post regularly but she has a a brand of dog toys called kermie and worm and mr marbles um so she was one of she she's had 20 if she said she has 20 million or 18 million she's had that forever and i'm pretty sure she's just like made her money and bailed and just left yeah like her last video was one year ago it was casey neistat did that too right he was vlogging every day and then he got paid and he just says i'm out yeah it's the way to go so i think if you're on on that intense of a treadmill it's it's pretty tough if you can't like you know get you out of it by the way there's a guy who tweeted at us he's like i i think he listens to the podcast um i'm gonna find his like exact details later uh because it's hard to just twitter dm searches like impossible but basically there's a guy who's just buying up uh youtube channels that are non-faced non-face youtube channels such as they're branded as something else um so there's no jenna marbles there's no personality to it and uh he buys these up for you know he basically you know he's just looking at their youtube like uh he's looking at their youtube like you know revenues or whatever and he's like cool i'll make you this offer so i can uh i can buy this thing out for this much or whatever and uh and it's like interesting i hadn't really heard of somebody rolling up youtube channels like that but i think that's a pretty cool niche i think that would be a good idea i think if you did it with a face it'd be a horrible idea because i imagine that if you could make a list of people who you'd like to have work for you a youtuber would be incredibly low on that list well yeah right it's hard to buy them out right because they you know they no longer have the motivation to uh to create content and then you're stuck because you can't just be like hey it's me now i'm here yeah it's me louis vuitton i'm here all right what else do we want to do uh let's do one other random one dude so have you ever filed for a trademark uh yourself it's kind of a pain in the butt in it i think i had a lawyer do it yeah but i like went through i tried originally like bootstrapping it and just like do it on my own i didn't know how to do it so i get this i get this letter so this letter comes in the mail uh six months after we file it's from this company called i don't know if you can see this wtp i'm like oh maybe it sounds about it it's about our yeah sounds legit uh it says at the top trademark publications and it's got our company name our address and it says reference number blah blah blah application date blah blah classes blah blah blah and then it has a giant thing of our trademark and it says here's your fee for uh 1 420 please pay the amount on acceptance within ten days by check don't forget to quote your reference number make it payable to a scam

[Music] all right it's question of the week time or one what do we call it one question friday i like that all right one question friday uh sam is traveling so i got my boy ben here ben levy not been the not producer ben not powerful producer ben this is ben levy the uh the ceo of the milk road and uh my business partner across my fund and a bunch of other things you guys hear me reference ben a lot but you never know which ben because i only deal with ben's so uh this is one of the bends ben what's up man what's going on i'm riding high today chris paul and the suns won by like 25 last night so i've never been happier this is true um all right so let's let's do this one question uh i think we have an audio clip right let's play let's play the audio clip i haven't heard this yet so let's see what it is hey guys my name is colin um i just had all of my nfts stolen today so my question is and i'm sure you've been through something like it before um you know when you get gut punched like has that happened to you uh what happened and how did you work through it oh man i could feel the defeat i could feel the uh the pain in his voice there at the end that thank you that was a soul crushed thank you uh okay so colin you got your nft stolen i you know i feel for you that's no fun i mean that's a it's a crime right somebody came and stole your property it's digital property but uh you know a crime has been committed so you know you got to kind of separate um here's my my kind of advice to you have i had somebody steal a bunch of my property before uh not really but you know there's different flavors of of gut punch and i've had i've had my share so here's my kind of like formula for how to handle it the first step is just be still um and i mean this in kind of a zen way which is that look what's going to happen you know for the next 24-48 hours for you is you're gonna your mind is gonna go to a bunch of different places you're gonna get angry you're gonna feel sad you're gonna feel upset at yourself you're gonna feel upset at others you're gonna feel upset at the the fact that you can't get it back so you're gonna hate crypto you're gonna you're gonna feel a bunch of emotions by default and what you wanna do is you want to not um just react you want to respond so what's the difference between a reaction and a response a reaction is what you do uh you know sort of right away it's an impulsive thing and typically we don't love our reactions to things because our reactions are the things that are happening in a more primal way was that whereas our response is what happens when we pause for a second and we we choose how we're going to respond so a reaction is typically not something you're choosing a response is something you're choosing and i this happens to me multiple times a day where i got to check myself all right am i reacting or responding here and which one do i want to do i know i can do both but i'd rather respond and so the first thing is you got to be still you got to distance yourself from it emotionally first then you got to say all right well how am i going to respond to this well there's some like logistical steps you might take to try to get back report it try to figure out who did it you know notify people in the community so other people don't fall for it whatever the scam was but then you gotta like okay let's say you've done the logistics part um and maybe there is no happy ending where you didn't just all turn out right that's where you got it what i call you got to decide what story is true so in any event uh anything that happens there are there are multiple stories but to simplify i'll say there's two stories anytime something happens there's the story that'll make you feel bad and there's the story that'll make you feel good they're both stories right uh and they both have truth to them but it's just a matter of which which angle you're looking at something and so you gotta decide which story am i gonna roll with am i gonna roll with the version of this that makes me feel really bad or am i going to roll with the version of this that makes me feel good and i know that probably sounds hard in the moment you just got a bunch of your [ __ ] stolen and uh you know which is why we first you know tried to distance ourselves from it but that's where you're going to have to go you're going to have to decide the version of this story that's going to make you feel good right imagine a breakup most people when they have a breakup in a relationship they feel bad and they choose a story that's going to make them feel worse which is oh my god all the all those years we spent together it's time wasted i'm not good enough or she's not good enough or whatever the reasons are right we have we come up with a story that makes us feel bad or we come up with a story that makes us feel good which is man now i know what i really want uh now i'm ready for for the right person you know you want to walk out into the street and just look left and right and say you know next you know i'm ready and so there's a version of the story that'll make you feel good or bad in any given situation the power is in being able to choose what the story is and not just having the default one put on you so that's my like mentality mindset ben what do you think you you've had your fear of gut punches have you ever had something like this yeah i mean in crypto i think like a year ago i had like a few eats stolen out of my wallet and i was crushed and i think i actually called you and i was like dude it sucks i just lost a few eat because i stupidly clicked on a discord scam and i think what you said was that's the price of admission every single person in crypto has had that happen and that's just what that's just the name of the game uh so i don't know my perspective on it is like yeah definitely been got punched a ton in crypto and i also feel like every crypto i've ever gotten i'm mad that i didn't sell it at the right time or i held too long or bought too late uh i think that's the name of volatility too so i'm just like that's the you know i'm gonna get a huge home run because i play this game and uh yeah learn from my mistakes yeah there's also like uh this phrase with investing which is i've never done i've never done an investment right which means on an investment that worked out i should have always been earlier and bet more and on an investment that's wrong i shouldn't have bet or i you know i was too late or whatever and so you'll never ever on any investment feel like you did it right you'll always be kind of kicking yourself wishing you had done it either bet bigger or better earlier or whatever on it and so um i think the thing you said that's right which is it's the nature of the game and so um you know crypto nfts this is the wild wild west right now there's a reason your nft can go up a 10x in price in one month or a hundred x in price in a year or like you know i don't know how much board apes are were but like i think a year ago they were under one east each and now they're like whatever 140 or something like that so you know 140x in a year so one of the reasons you can get these types of gains is because it's the wild wild west but what comes with the wild wild west is that dude it's it's not safe uh there are there are places where you could stub your toe and me and sam i think said this on a pod once which was if you become an entrepreneur or an investor and then every time things go anytime disaster strikes or things go poorly or things go down you're like emotionally a wreck because of it and i'm not saying colin is but it's very easy to become close to an emotional wreck when things go down uh it's like you signed up to go you waited in line to go on a roller coaster and you strapped yourself in and then the roller coaster went up and down and every time it went down you were like oh like oh my god i can't believe this like get me off this thing it's like dude why did you get on a roller coaster you know like uh if you choose entrepreneurship you choose investing if you choose investing you got to wake up and like the last four months dude i've lost millions of dollars just because i wake up and every day is red stocks are red crypto is red everything's red i haven't seen green in months dude i don't even see the color green right like i'm starting to text people on android just so i can see the green speech bubble dude like i just want to see green and uh but that's the reality it's like i signed up to be an investor what did i think it's always going to go up it's like i signed up to you know do this crazy crypto stuff like yes this crazy [ __ ] where you know i'm playing this this this game where you're you're a self-sovereign individual you're custodian your own assets well there's gonna be times where you didn't custody it very well and it got stolen um and so you know same thing with with being an entrepreneur is you gotta ask yourself am i just complaining that the roller coaster went up and down and uh and that's a way to not let yourself be a victim i think one of the most positive traits somebody can have is that they never let themselves be a victim no matter what happens in their life they view themselves as the person in control and the root cause of whatever has occurred and in doing so they give themselves the power to make things good and they give themselves the accountability when things go bad and so um so you know i think that's a just a decision you got to make up front am i going to let myself ever play victim and look for kind of pity uh self-pity or pity from others or you just take that off the table you say nope i'm never going to play that game and so that means on days where my [ __ ] gets stolen it did somebody didn't steal my nfts i let my nfts be stolen and right so you take control over what happened and it hurts in those moments but that decision to never play victim is like one that pays off you know in spades you know for the rest of your life ben what did i miss also it's a great opportunity for a twitter thread right here how i got my nft stolen yeah this is the great this is the beginning of every great story right uh i've had this many times where i get a cease and desist letter and then we turn it into marketing for our company i've had it where you know google or facebook will launch a clone of our app and your investors will send you a link and be like hey did you see this like yeah [ __ ] i saw it like i saw that facebook has cloned our app you know pixel by pixel and that you know this you know 500 billion dollar company is now competing with us yes i saw the news but you know you got to sort of like in that moment it's like this is our chance this is our story of course they're going to copy us we're on to something right of course they're going to copy us pixel 4 pixel because we have the right solution right and you have to decide what story you're going to tell yourself and your team and your the people around you so that again you're going to feel some kind of way would you rather feel bad or feel good that's all you got to choose i tell ben this all the time what ben started this off talking about the suns winning and ben how do you feel when the suns win amazing ben how do you feel when the suns lose pretty pretty down on myself pretty down on everything so you ride the roller coaster and you let yourself feel bad and so you know that's a choice you're making right now at some point you might decide to play the game differently which is i'm gonna is it possible to feel great when your team wins and not feel shitty when your team loses yes that is possible it sounds like it sounds like it's breaking the rules but like that's what you do when you're like a life hacker he's like yeah you break the rules like i'm gonna play the game i'm gonna play the game on my terms and uh and so there is a version of that yeah and like when your businesses have issues i think when the business have issues like you don't let it get you down at all uh and you're you're able to take the wins and stride really well do you have an example of that like something where we've we've taken we we've had a situation where other people would have felt down but we we spun it do you has anything come to mind uh i mean i think we're in one right now right like we send the milk road and we've had some deliverability issues recently where the open rates have dropped a little bit and we can't really tell you know we're trying to figure out why and i think there's one version where you freak out about that and you make it ruin your week or ruin your day and there's another version where you just take it in stride and know you're gonna figure it out this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of hubspot hubspot is a crm platform where everything is fully integrated well i can see the clients whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago i totally missed hubspot grow better yeah like you know you fast forward a year from now this will be a forgotten footnote on the overall story and even when things are really crazy and you know something really bad happens like you know in my e-commerce business our entire shipment for christmas got seized and flagged and then inspected and then we had to do a recall and like all this stuff and the people you know people on my team were all like oh my god like just for this you know 1 8 of an inch you know this random random seizure for no reason just because of random inspection then on one item they found a one-eighth of an inch discrepancy oh my god this is so unfair this is so bad blah blah and it's like all right like dude look like you know we and i created a channel in our slack called highs and lows and i said let's put them here let's let's document the highs and lows and i think every startup should do this honestly is document the highs and lows because it'll just get you used to being like when you go in there when things feel really bad and you want to go in there and write it down and you've it's like you see the last one six months ago and you're like oh yeah that felt pretty bad too but i've like i've totally forgotten that our business has grown 2x since then and like oh you know just the way that that one turned out to be nothing this one's gonna be nothing too i'm gonna eat this and i'm gonna like use this as an opportunity to learn like oh [ __ ] we didn't even know these this one-eighth of an inch rule we had to go like you know change the measurements of something like i'm glad we knew now versus when it's bigger right i'm glad this happened because that's gonna lead to all these good things um and so you know there's uh we had an example like this where like i'll give you another one with our e-commerce business uh the warehouse manager that we had hired uh turned it wasn't working out then we found out they were trying to like you know sort of like copy our business in a way and like launch a competitor or something like that because you know they're in the warehouse they see businesses going great so they wanted a piece of the action and this was a moment where our team was sort of like you know immediately felt betrayed and then upset and was like well you know um what should we do should we change you know should we we're gonna have to make a change it's gonna be so hard and that those are the moments where you need to show the most poise right that's when that's when strength matters is when things get hard when things are easy is not with strength matters so it's like oh dude i've been training for this i've been training for these types of moments finally i got a reason to use these muscles and that are that are in my body to be able to be strong here and so it was all about poise it was all about basically coming up with all right let's first be still let's not overreact second let's decide how we're going to approach this and respond to this situation not react and then in that response it turned out where actually we ended up finding this amazing manager and we ended up saving all this money now we couldn't have seen that up front in the moment it felt bad now three months later or two months later whatever it's like oh dude we found this thing that's saving us you know two dollars per order which is going to add up to be hundreds of thousands of dollars of extra profit saved because we found this new manager who found this new process who found this new thing and we would have never done that had that disaster not struck and so once you go through life enough you have enough experience you realize oh it's all working for me not against me and once you decide it's all working for me not against me then the next time the disaster strikes like all right cool what's this how is this working for me and you don't panic you know the people around you are like man how's this person never panic they never freak out about this stuff um that and then that becomes the culture of the company that's where you want to be ironically i'm good at that and everything except when it comes to phoenix suns basketball yeah well that's because you're fit you're mentally fit it's like you know you're mentally fit with your upper body you never do leg day right so it's like everybody's got something in the gym where they're really strong at it it's easy for them it's hard for others and then they have something that's easy for others hard for them and that might be calf raises that might be whatever and so like you know you could take a bodybuilder but you go put them in a pilates class and they're struggling because they don't have the flexibility or the maybe the core strength of coordination to be able to do some some movements and so everybody's got these moments that are these situations that are harder for them like ben wilson i'm curious for you uh what's the thing give me yours what's the adversity's disaster strike situation where you're pretty good and then what's the adversity or disaster strike situation where you're pretty weak what's your version of leg day i'm actually like um because i'm a pretty relaxed person i tend to do pretty well with adversity um but like personal attacks really get to me like like bad things happening in the world um don't don't bother me bad things for other people don't care things for me really care no but it can have like if it hurts my bank account even or like whatever like i just kind of i move on with life but if someone says something bad about my character um or yeah insults me or something like that the the one i think of that i think i dealt with pretty well was um i was in barcelona and as it relates to what this guy was talking about and uh i'm sitting there at like a like a cafe so imagine a cafe i'm on la rambla which is like a walking street and so i'm facing this this big street with a lot of people and i'm eating dinner and i've got my phone on the table and i'm reading my phone as i eat dinner and this old woman comes up to me and sticks a sign in my face and starts asking for money but the weird thing is i speak spanish and she's not speaking spanish and i i don't know what she's saying she's got a sign right in my face and she's she's speaking clearly asking for money but i can't tell what she's saying and i was like what i i don't understand you and she keeps saying something like go go away i try and kind of show her off she leaves i'm kind of shaken up and after like a couple seconds reorienting myself i go back to my dinner realization there's someone that stuck the sign in my face and underneath it had taken my phone from off the table and i run off and go search for her and of course even if i'd found her she'd probably handed it off to someone else and the phone was gone and um and that is the kind of thing that i actually like deal with okay like obviously i freaked out for a couple minutes i was was really mad and was stewing but uh eventually i was i just kind of like was like okay i'm okay it was hard to explain like i was freaking out because i didn't have a phone in a foreign country and it was like scary but i was like i'm okay i've got all my fingers and toes and it was like actually a good opportunity to kind of like reevaluate of like all right this is going to mess with a lot of stuff but all the things that actually matter in my life are not affected by this dog being gone right i'm gonna also give a technique uh because one one part's the philosophy another is a simple technique you can do so how do you actually be still how do you actually get to the response not the thing and it's really annoying when bad things happen and then the advice you're getting is like it's okay don't worry about it shake it off you know because it's like no in the moment i feel i feel bad i feel some sense of loss uh you know and so you know it's very hard and so the actual technique here is a tony robbins technique that he calls the 90 seconds of suffering and the story is tony goes to india and he's like he's taking he's taking his platinum partners and these are the dudes who's like you go to the beginner tony robbins event you're like oh my god this guy's the messiah and so you're like oh if i pay 25k a year i get to go on a trip with tony and like i get to be a platinum partner and so you pay maybe it's even more than it's 100k or something like that you pay some crazy amount of money and you become a platinum partner so he took his platinum partners to india to some like ashram in the mountains and he's like you know just giving them a unique experience and he goes and this like kind of guru guy in the mountains is like oh mr tony robbins you know blah blah and he's like he's like how are you he's like oh fantastic you know life is amazing i feel so grateful saying all the tony robbins things in his like monster voice and then they're like the guy was like um uh you know i said something like you know but how uh you know uh he said so how are you dealing with your suffering and he's like he's like uh suffering like the hell you talking about bro like i'm tony robbins uh i'm not suffering i'm mr positivity i got my platinum partners here we're in india i'm i'm teaching i'm not suffering they might be suffering i'm not suffering and he's like but i just saw you a moment ago um you know you're whatever your employee was saying about the thing they forgot and you got so upset you were telling them how they should do it differently you you totally changed your face and he's like oh well you know that was just we have this i want this trip to be great for our partners and you know this person dropped the ball and uh yeah i guess i kind of lost my cool but you know i i really care about bubba and he's like he caught himself he's like okay i'm just justifying um he's like he's like that's not suffering though suffering is like you know look around in india you see people suffering on the streets and he's like he's like it's the same thing they have a deep different cause but they feel the same thing they feel suffering in a moment right and so he goes he goes um you know you he's like you are tony robbins i see you now and you're you're you're you're bright and you're happy you're lit up you're you're energetic you've got the you have your charisma all the stuff and he's like don't make your happiness so cheap tony robbins and he told him and he was like um happiness cheap what do you mean he goes that amy's like that guy just did this small thing and your happiness he took your happiness so your happiness had a very low price it only took a very small thing to acquire your happiness he took it away from you and so what you want to do and so my takeaway from this was like you want to have this like you want to be the louis vuitton of happiness you want your happiness to be very expensive that it takes a very very big event even bigger than all your nfts get stolen for for somebody something to take it away so you have to decide the price of your happiness is your happiness going to go away if someone gives you a wrong look or cuts you off in traffic or you know your delivery gets your pizza delivery doordash gets delayed are you gonna get upset and it not upset in a big way but like you lose that joyful state of mind you could otherwise be in and so he gave himself this thing tony came up with this technique called 90 seconds of suffering he goes okay so i started to notice these little moments where i would lose my state i would lose my state of mind where i wasn't i was no longer in that kind of happy grateful you know optimistic enthusiastic state of mind he's like and i would just decide all right i can't prevent feeling that feeling like it's very hard to just prevent it but i can contain it and so he's like i'm going to give myself 90 seconds to suffer and after the 90 seconds i got to let it go but i get 90 seconds to do it and of course what happens is like you know if you don't give if you don't time box it it's very easy to like have something ruin your day or even kind of get you down for a week or a month or a year and you're depressed all of a sudden so time boxing is valuable but but the funny thing is if you do the 90 seconds of suffering we're like all right this [ __ ] happened i'm gonna give myself 90 seconds within like 24 seconds you'll be like all right whatever i don't even need to do the whole 90 like oh it's done like i know it's gonna end anyways in 90 seconds do i really need to sit here and wait the 90 to feel bad like if it's going to end in 90 seconds anyway so you don't even you end up not even doing 30. and so that technique of like giving yourself 90 seconds of suffering whenever whatever happens has been like pretty game-changing for me and so you know i'd encourage you to do that all right and if he's got stolen all right have at it 90 seconds to suffer suffer fully and as much as you want for 90 seconds but the agreement is at the end of that 90 you you no longer get to get to suffer about this at the end of the 90 you're going to take a deep breath and you're going to change the story in your head about what's making you feel bad because it's not that your nfts got stolen it's some story about that it's how much money you've lost how you're not going to get them back how you spent so long collecting them how that was your favorite one that story is what's making you feel bad and that after 90 seconds you got to change that story so that's my advice for one question friday that's it peace out [Music] you

in crypto there was like a long list of like crypto things that are high market cap right now but make basically no sense as to why they would have that much value litecoin there's no purpose or place in the market bitcoin cash no purpose to place in the market ethereum classic and so bitcoin cash is throwing plastic these are just forks of bitcoin forks of ethereum ripple also no purpose also a security also scam uh and like all these combined i think have like a hundred billion dollar market cap so that's a hundred billion dollars of value that that should be probably closer to zero than even 10 billion

A podcast where we brainstorm new business ideas based on trends & opportunities we see in the market. Sometimes we have famous guests, and they do it with us.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] all right this is one question friday where we answer a grand total of one question from a listener uh one lucky listener gets to ask a question me and sam are gonna give a give our raw off-the-cuff answer we haven't seen the question before jonathan has it and um these are tips and they are just the tips as i like to say we try not to go too deep all right jonathan you want to hit us with a question hey guys my name is brian and i'm calling about ghost kitchens i've first learned about ghost kitchens on pods so thanks for that so i developed a model to implement a couple of ghost kitchen concepts into my restaurant i had great success lifted my margins over 450 percent over six months with just one of the concepts now i'm looking to scale the business by offering licensing agreements for operators in other markets to use these concepts including the branding recipes etc it's very simple you find an operator that wants a new rev new stream and wants to do a ghost kitchen and they can start slinging product within a matter of weeks i've researched the model that much larger companies are using where they leverage celebrities to sell these concepts my model is better it's cheaper and the recipes are second to none in the space assuming you didn't have the following in the platform that you do how would you go about selling this idea to restaurant operators across the nation where would you start sidebar i love what you guys do on the pod sam i just signed up for copy that and i can't wait to get started good man so what's his name by the way we're gonna call him joe no it was uh i don't remember so thanks for the question ryan yeah two weeks in a row we have one question and we do not know the guy's name again it sounded smart it sounded like he's got his game plan together but so let's recap the business is is what all right so he owned here's what i understood he owns a restaurant and then he added in a ghost kitchen meeting he like created a ghost brand which is like what that means is if you go on doordash or ubereats or one of these delivery apps you can order from a restaurant but there's no physical restaurant for that thing it's just a virtual brand and his restaurant would then like have the packaging so let's say my normal restaurant is shawn's pizza well then i could also have a ghost brand called sean you know uh you know silly sandwiches and silly sandwich if i get an order from silly sandwiches my restaurant crew will just like package it up as a silly sandwich order and it'll be ready to go and so i'm kind of running multiple restaurants out of one restaurant is the idea and why does the restaurant owner want to do that with them versus on their own so what he said was he i don't know if he created that ghost brand or he added that gross brand but he said my ever improved my restaurant marge is 450 percent so he forexed his restaurant's margin so let's say a normal restaurant has i mean it sounds a little unbelievable right like let's say he had i don't know six percent margins before uh you know don't do public math but he's saying that that basically forexed his margins i'm not sure exactly what he's talking about here that's cool but you know what business would be way better is do you remember alex her mozzie's business exactly gym launch gym launch exactly what i was going to recommend go ahead well i think he well maybe you weren't going to say this i was going to say go listen to the episode um he that what his model was he had a gym and he was like all right how do i get my gym to be more profitable and then he figured out like a sales method to get his gym if he opened up a gym he figured out a sales method that would get him to have a bunch of customers paying high prices and making a bunch of money on a gym and his friend at a mastermind one day was like yo you need to like not do this you need you don't need to open up 50 gyms doing this you need to go teach other gyms how to do this like your product isn't the gym it's a sales process to make any gym more profitable and so that's what he did then he created gym launch which would basically advertise say hey are you a gym owner i can help you make an extra 100 000 year guaranteed um using my sales method to get you more customers paying higher prices and they'd be like all right cool and then he would fly out to that gym and he would spend the next i don't know a couple weeks or whatever implementing that process so that they would then have more revenue more customers coming in using his thing and he would teach them hey here's how you do it here's your offer here's your facebook ads when they come in here's your sales script then you sign them up for a free trial then here's how you close them then here's how you upsell them protein powders and this other stuff here's how you upsell them training packages that's the that's the sales process and he built a multi-million dollar business doing that if you did that for restaurants to teach them how to do this that sounds like a business 100 no-brainer that's what i would do except so you said that alex would fly out there eventually he wasn't actually flying out there eventually it was basically it was not fair to call it a course but he would if that was part of it so he would teach you stuff but then also he would be like here's the facebook ads like i've already made them for you you can use my facebook ads that i already made here's the drip email sequence here's the script that we use here's everything and then he would say oh by the way if you don't want to do this and you just want me to run the ads fine pay us and we'll do it and here's how you sell protein you want to sell protein and by the way the protein that sells best we just went and bought it so we already own it so if you want to get on a subscription and we'll just send it to you and here's how you sell it we'll just go ahead and do all that for you anyway so i would 100 do that we on that pod we go alex what's a good market for uh gym launch buffer blank and we actually didn't have that many good answers the answers this restaurant business yeah this is the answer this is a great thing that's a great example and like lucky for you know our our buddy here ryan we're calling him for a second um that there's like a pretty great blueprint to follow right like there's a blueprint that he was very public about how he did it he's now exited the business and also by the way this is what his business does now is it invests in other people doing this model and he's like dude i already know how to do this i can scale it up now you have to be at some scale before he'll do it but like he gives away the free content um on how he structured gym launch to do to be able to do this so that's i think what you should do which is like restaurant launcher ghost the ghost kitchen process the ghost kitchen system which is basically hey if you're if you're a independent restaurant and trust me it's tough foot traffic is tough with cove but it's tough it's blah blah everyone's ordering delivery here's how you can increase your margins but well here's how i did it you kind of open up your financials you say look i was making thirty two thousand dollars you know um a quarter doing it this way now i make 58 000 and that extra bit is from my ghost kitchen concept and here's how i do it and basically they can either pay you for the course on how they can do it or you'd hit them with the alex from oz where you're like if this sounds too complicated i can also do it for you and if you qualify i'll do it for you what he did was risk free he's like here's my offer for you you pay me nothing i only get money once i've increased your sales by over 30 000 000 so once you've made that much more money off this then i get to get my cut of 30 of whatever the total is that that we get and i'm so confident that i'm going to be able to raise your sales that i'll do that for you i'll take the risk on that how does that sound and they're all like yeah you're going to fly out here you're going to implement your process it's worked for you and you're saying that i only pay you once i'm making all this extra money that's a pretty pretty damn good offer and so you could do a similar thing for the restaurant i saw a guy the other day do a sales process where he was like trying to sell a service just like this and the let's just say the restaurant owner was like uh i don't know if i want to do that and he goes that's fine but how about this we you implement what i say and uh if it works i get a split of the revenue and the guy goes great i'm 100 do that what's the split and then the seller goes well how about 50 50 and the buyer goes i don't know man that's a lot and the seller goes well but i'm i'm you know it's 50 50. it's free money for you i'm doing all the work and the guy goes well what if it blows up you know like you're gonna get a lot of money and the seller goes you know i think you're right well he goes he goes it might blow up but i'll tell you what you might be right fine we'll go back to the original deal you only gonna pay five thousand dollars and the guy goes okay fine it was like it was like the best sale sequence like it totally worked i was like oh my god that's beautiful um yeah i would totally do this business as well i think that that's way better i would continue running the main thing just so you're in the know and like getting results that you could post to social media but uh that's what i would do too is that it is that the answer just the tip oh gaston what's the wi-fi i can't no i can't get in oh it's arg connect your teams easier than connecting your wi-fi hubspot grow better all hands on deck all right how uh you said that nun jumped out when you're talking to alex are there any other industries that jump out now that this could work for probably physical probably physical therapists i would imagine doctors offices and physical therapists i think maybe barbers real estate brokers so um every real estate broker is like running their own little small business sometimes as part of a brokerage sometimes their own brokerage and uh there's a whole process to basically like hey you should leave caldwell bankers they're taking half of your commission um i i spun out my own here's how i did it here's how much more i make and i will spin you out um of this big brokerage firm i'll set up your website i'll set up your back office legal legal structure i'll set up your marketing package i'll show you exactly how this all works and you know like instead of coldwell baker taking half of your commission i will take five percent of your commission uh you know to do this so i think you could basically i think selling a sales system is a um is a pretty good business to be in in general yeah i mean it's it's like very very high margin i think that a lot of course businesses top out at a certain level i think when you're selling a sales cycle or a sales product like this i don't think you're i think the the cap is way higher by the way also now that alex carmozy's not doing gym launch you could also just do lit gym launch again like you know now that he's like checked out doing other [ __ ] like you know you could have always competed with him but like he put a playbook out there he exited the company there's it's still running but like you could just do it again you could literally recycle his business i i think this is so underrated just recycling business ideas um once the person has exited and you know they've let their foot out the gas or they've expanded they've moved up market it's like they just leave you an exact playbook on what to do and um more often than not that timing still will work dude we we had a couple at the hustle we had a few companies that would just copy and paste our content and just create a new newsletter and uh they some of them got traction yeah edit that out i don't want people doing that now [Laughter] well it doesn't work in the end it's a very short-term thing you know uh but all right that's it you got the tip [Music] you

i think this guy's like 21. i think they said they sold half a million what does he know about this then [Laughter] bro got his first first wood and just decided to create a product still he's still on his first one what if like well you're 21 i mean things weren't great yeah why why why do you need this um but basically i think he said they sold like half a million dollars worth of chocolate off this off this ad um and like within a couple weeks or something like that so it really like jumps [Music] i've got one interesting topic today what do you got let's start there you want to start with my thing yeah start start with yours so you're a 33 34 year old guy so you probably haven't been to the doctor in like 15 years but accurate yeah men don't go to the doctors my wife's gone and i'm sitting here doing this podcast i'm wearing flip-flops but one foot has a sock on and underwear that's inside out because i didn't want to do laundry so like yeah i mean i'm a grown child too but uh so listen uh have you been to the doctor like with your wife or kid and noticed that there's like these tv screens in there i have like in the waiting room you mean in the waiting room but also like in the doctor's office like in the actual medical like in the room in the waiting room but i'm kaiser and those guys are cheap as hell so they don't put them in the actual doctor's office yeah kaiser what is kaiser's its own network in hospital so they they wouldn't apply to this but basically if you go to most like an independent or like a normal non-kaiser doctor there's tv screens in the waiting room there's tv screens in the hallway and then often times now they've got tv screens in the doctor's office and so have you heard of this company called outcome health i've heard of this once before maybe from you no i think it's actually from our buddy sieva and i'm just going to tell you three words i remember 100 million dollars basically like waiting room tvs and uh there's an indian dude who's the founder those are the three things i kind of know about yeah well you're missing the fourth word which is fraud okay gotcha this was four years ago so maybe something has come out since then so i'm gonna tell you about this business and i actually think that it's kind of like pretty morally corrupt but it's interesting nonetheless um and the business model is actually good and interesting but the guy who ran this particular business sucked so basically it was called outcome health it was started by this guy named rishi and he was out of chicago and he's like this wonderkin prodigy whatever raise money at a 5 or 10 billion dollar valuation promised that he had or said he had 160 million in revenue turns out that was nonsense it wasn't true and so he got sued and it didn't turn out well at all but listen to what their business was it's actually pretty again unethical i think but fascinating so basically do you would you watch never watch like cable tv yeah of course so it's like all toyota commercials and like pharmaceuticals right back to the earlier point dodge ram yeah it's like dodge rammed and like cialis and and that's one of the reasons is like on google and on facebook and stuff like that you can't really advertise pharmaceuticals or at least the rules are a little bit different and so pharmaceutical companies are advertising like crazy on tv something like 80 or 8 billion last year spent it's like the third largest category and uh but they spend like way more so of the 20 million spent on pharmaceutical ads like 15 million of that is spent billion billion is spent in the doctor's office and so they do that by like giving them free samples by giving them like those like mugs and pens and just like [ __ ] like that just like swag and so this guy came up with this idea where basically he puts a tv in the doctor's office and the tv is like touch screen and it's free for the doctor and it does some things like they could like put like uh like the person's chart on the tv or it's like interactive and like all right so your foot's broken and if we zoom in here it's this bone and but when you're not using it for that reason it's an advertising thing so it like shows ads and they're not selling the ad to the consumer because the consumer is not the one whose choice it is what drugs are gonna get prescribed it's the doctor and so the pharmaceuticals go to outcome health and they say here's the 50 000 doctors who we're trying to reach show me which of those you have your tv in in in their office and help us reach them and we'll pay you a lot of money for that right and theoretically this guy was full of it in like the fourth year business he was like yeah we're making like 160 million dollars in ads and pharmaceutical ads and now outcome health was eventually acquired by another company and they're actually doing it legitly and they're making over they're properly making over a hundred million dollars and it's all from pharmaceutical ads on these freaking screens what's he lying about he lied about which doctors yet or he lied about the revenue like they just didn't have so jay and jay johnson and johnson their executives and their their ad sales people would go to these doctors and they're like wait a minute this [ __ ] company told us that there's tvs here i don't see a tv anywhere and like it happened like dozens of times like dude you said that there was tvs and our ad was being seen by this many people it ain't happening and so they basically just lied they just said that their tvs were in all of these rooms they just thought that no one was going to check and so their tvs weren't actually there and so they built and but they were building johnson johnson on showing their cialis ad or whatever to you know but it wasn't actually happening so he lied but also pretty dude crazy put the tv there well a stupid reason to lie like go go get the tv at the doctor's office it's not that expensive or hard to do to get a tv in a doctor's office i just think it's crazy though that like this business model is like crazy fascinating though it is kind of a good business model but i think it's the whole pharmaceutical industry advertising is kind of like [ __ ] you know what i mean it's it's like someone someone's gonna do this for like uh so we saw we talked to that company that was doing this on top but putting you know screens on top of uber uber cars which i uh i was totally against like i thought that business wasn't gonna work was i right or wrong did it work i think it looked like we were wrong because they raised a bunch of money but again who knows maybe there's maybe it's a you know we got a rishi rishi in chicago situation again here so i i don't know but but that company had did pretty well neither of us invested in it um there's other versions of this so the question is like what are these captive audiences where you can go stick you can go create an ad network right so it's like um there's like physical places so like i don't know high schools colleges like what can you just go put this in every dorm um like in the country and then be like hey you wanna reach college kids there's no more effective place than this because like you know every three minutes we give out like a free you know code for like a snapple from the vending machine and then the other you know two minutes are are just straight ads and so it's like you know can you find captive audiences in other ways and create a network of like some highly desired um like person like if the the key would be you know could you somehow um could you somehow do this around like i don't know stay-at-home moms probably not because there's like they're spread out like that that's the thing with doctor's office is like there's there's there's a smaller number of them that you need to like get the screens about high value there's this company called cheddar do you remember cheddar cheddar was basically like the hustle if it focused on all the weird [ __ ] instead of just like the substance and then somehow sold for 200 million dollars that's my take on cheddar so you're forgetting the worst component is that it was entirely built at first on facebook live so right when facebook came out with facebook live this guy named john steinberg who's a nice guy and he's a he's a bulldog this guy is like ari gold like if he sees what he wants and he's like a just it's like a missile he just just captures on it he just goes straight towards it so anyway this guy launches company called cheddar and the content was [ __ ] and somehow they got like they're on the news the pitch right so here was his pitch and how he raised a bunch of money from investors he said very similar to what you said hey millennials gen z these guys are not trying to watch you know cnbc or msnbc or i don't know whatever the finance channel is i don't even know what that that's cnbc the the pitch was cnbc only has like 20 000 concurrent viewer viewers at any given point but it makes like a billion dollars a year right and they're all on medicare so it's like okay so how do you get like gen z millennials they're not going to watch that what are they going to watch and he's like social media social media right and all the vcs have nod their head he's like that's do you have a teenager do they watch cnbc or do they watch social media and everyone's like social media he's like and guess what they now have live video facebook is live video twitter has live video youtube best live video so we're gonna create cnbc on social media and they basically created a 24 7 like tv tv show that was business news that would just be streaming all day onto facebook live onto twitter live onto like youtube live onto all these different platforms that in itself is amazing building 24 7 is crazy it's crazy so that is amazing that he could even pull it off but there was one factor that he kind of screwed up on which is like no one wanted to watch it yeah everyone rolled right past it yeah no one it's so his like he executed a bad premise wonderfully yeah 10 out of 10 hustle 2 out of 10 idea because guess what happens on social media you don't stop and watch live video for 40 minutes like that's just not what happens on most social media and so you know just didn't really work and you're right and 24 7 it was kind of boring because this is not 24 7 worth of like interestingness when it comes to that stuff and he raised money i think he raised 40 million and somehow a cable company bought it for 200 million dollars and he told me i met with him and he told me one time he was like yeah so i'm gonna start this company and in two years i'm probably gonna sell it for two or three hundred million dollars he just told me and he just called this shot and he's a bulldog and he nailed it he's an unstoppable force and he pulled it off but now what they do is if you go to a gas station you don't even go to gas stations anymore no dude dude i pump my own gas yes i do uh if you'll see cheddar all on their little screens and so they're like owning like this weird market of people who want to play like jeopardy while they're pumping their gas like you know it's like snapple snapple facts while you're while you're like doing your gas so they they're they've got the gas market well who was it that we did we meet somebody i i mean it was just me i met somebody recently who was like yeah you know what a gas station those screens like i own the ad inventory of like these like in these like three cities uh like i'm like the kind of main guy so like you know how do you think i should sell these ads uh he's like i i that's what i own i own this inventory i wasn't making money i'm sure he was doing okay but he was like you know what would you do and i was like i was like well the people who want this ad is like the local businesses right because they have like look you can actually send them like local foot traffic better than like a facebook or a google or these like scaled easy to use ad platforms can dude selling local ads is the worst though there's like these like san francisco based i remember i had a couple san francisco-based yelp friends and they were like they were like like like have you seen that scene in the get rich or die trying with 50 cent where he's selling drugs and like one guy goes up to one of the drug dealers and tries to buy like some crack but with like quarters and nickels and the drug dealer smacks it out of his hand and 50 goes hey man come here i'll take it it was like see how hard i hustled i was willing to take the change and like the yelp is like that version of ad sales people like they would like find like a pie shop and sell a 400 ad you know what i mean and they're just grinding to get that done yeah there's just guys in the yelp sales office dude i would watch a 24 7 feed of yelp sales office because those guys are the grimiest grittiest salespeople on earth they will shake your local pie shop down be like hope you don't want this review that i just posted on your page don't go [ __ ] write a horrible review on your page and then call you tell you to go look at it and then sell you a premium plan that will get that ad removed it's like the craziest thing in the world yeah dude it's a racket and like put grandma on the phone put her on the phone grandma stop making pies they're basically like the mob like do you want protection and then like they do something bad if they don't from us they are like a mob yeah totally totally it's it is crazy so those local ads suck man i i've uh when i've got friends who want to start like local ads or local newsletters and i'm like yeah you're going to get tons of eyeballs the problem is monetizing that sucks man you got to deal with like you know like bob's steaks and chops down the street and like he's like well i'll give you like 30 pounds of filet mignon i kept this great deal for milk road i was like okay what's our fill rate i think our ad fill rate was like 75 or something last month i was like it was 75 yeah i was like ben what that's pretty good i was like what do we do with this other 25 and he's like um he's like dude uh you know he's like we actually got hit up by a couple brands that you have said you liked on the podcast he's like they were just like yo we'll take any ad that you don't have that day but we'll take it at 40 of the list price um and i'm gonna give it to you in store credit so it's like the worst deal it's like you know i'm getting shook down by yelp here but i was also like i kind of love that product so yeah like let's do it so i have like you know like right in front of my front door right now i have like like you know pallets of fit aid because i just like ran a fitting ad for them and it's like oh here's you know two thousand dollars of fit aid you know in exchange for that ad thank you so much and so i'm like all right great my gym has like you know energy drinks for the year and it's done that's actually pretty smart and it's really smart on their part it's part of their part and ben was like yo tell me like the five or five or six products you're like you love the most he's like i'm doing mine too and like we'll just we'll give sweetheart deals to all these companies like if we actually want their free product like if we really want their free product this is a great way to do it and it's like it's a great deal for them too they just get this like ad hoc remnant inventory i told you this off air but when the hustle started in order to get advertisers did you notice that when you started milk road when you started having ads you would get more people emailing you asking to advertising exactly yes and so i noticed that early on i was like if or i didn't notice it i guess i was like if we put ads in there we're gonna get more ads and so i was like well like what's like the most famous brands of people who don't who who everyone knows of but hopefully their employees don't read the hustle and so in the early stages like you know like it'd be like the hustle brought to you by ford and i had never talked to anyone in my life i just put their logo in there and said i was sponsored by them and i remember like hopefully ford do you guys i'm sorry but basically i love ford i had an f-150 i love ford but basically that's illegal i mean that's illegal you can't do that and i didn't know that it was illegal i was like oh just put like you know microsoft in here like put forward whatever who cares like hey a free ad for them right i'm giving them something yeah and i would put that in there and then immediately like there you know someone would email me and then eventually i noticed that if i put a brand's ad in there their competitors would call me to advertise right and this one i won't even i'm not going to say but i would put in certain tech brands i'm like dude this particular this company x has a really big ad budget but they're not emailing me let's go and advertise y which is their a direct competitor and put them in there and then immediately after and then sometimes what i would do is i would only put that particular ad in the email that was going to that company because with email newsletters you'd be like oh wow there's eight people that have an uber.com email let's send an email with a message just to them here's a lyft takeover email for them so i'm like a mini rishi a little a little mini outcome health here but uh yeah by the way that's that's kind of counter-intuitive like that oh if i put ads that's actually the easiest way to sell more ads and then being sort of you know you know fake it till you make it yeah i think that's like the startup way um there is a line i don't think i personally don't think you crossed it i did i don't think either with the podcast by the way it was the same thing somebody was like you know uh it's like i had this conversation on the way somebody was like oh dude love the podcast and they're like uh how much you making on that i was like uh not really megan you know much here you know it's a i do this for fun but then it's kind of like ate at me and during my uber ride to the thing i was like okay i'm gonna get a you know i'm gonna get an ad it was like the first or second podcast i made a third podcast i was like i'm gonna get like a sponsor i was like okay do i really want to go do outreach to sponsors no way so i was like um i just in the middle of the podcast after i go i go and by the way today's today's episode is brought to you by no one no one answered today's episode i like made it a joke and i was like but think about it you could have me right here explaining your product i could be like wow it does this and it doesn't and i just like did this like fake ad read like for nothing and i just like whatever i just like did that dude the next day i got so many like as soon as that episode released we got like our first three sponsors just from that like brought to you by nobody ad and so i was like oh that was like the hack for ad sales was uh you know just because embarrass myself a little bit on the pod well the reason it works and this is something that i learned along the way was marketers a good marketer is a shark and what they do is they spend most of their time seeking out underpriced new platforms and new places to advertise the way that marketing typically works is you find one thing that works you spend all the money and you crush and destroy it and you strangle it and then you go all right that's exhausted move on next and so you are constantly saying the middle step then you go tell everybody about how this ad channel is crushing for you you uh you get well-known you sell a course on that meanwhile you've moved on to the next channel yeah it's not saturated and you go do that and then you're silent until that one stops being like fruitful and you do the same thing you sell the course you talk about it and then you move on again and you do the same thing and so whenever you see like a new podcast that you think has potential or you see a newsletter or like um uh tick tock ads or a good example like dude they're probably gonna crush once they open it up um which they are and that's how marketers work and the smart marketers early on would approach me and they go hey can we just buy it out for the year and at the time i was like yeah definitely i'm poor i need everything and then i realized oh no that's stupid because we're gonna grow a lot and i know what they're doing and they're smart right have you seen um did i send you this tick tock ad for uh tabs chocolate i don't know you've been sending me all these messages i didn't realize it until two nights ago that i even had an inbox on tiktok all right i'm gonna show you what i think is the best ad um i've seen in like i mean i don't want to say my whole life but i can't really think of a better ad so i'm just gonna give this guy mad props about this ad this company riverside just raised like 40 we're so right now shounen are using this podcast thing called riverside they just raised like 40 million dollars so it better work tell me this is not the best ad you've ever seen and i'll i'll break down why that's good so first explain what it is for somebody who's not watching the youtube channel they're not so there's this attractive 19 year old right or 21 year old woman and she says y'all let me let me put you on and uh this is a special chocolate that will change your love life seriously it shows her and her boyfriend each taking a tab of the chocolate and then it shows her again uh with her hair having sex hair like it's implying that she just had sex and uh and then it just says it works at the end of it and uh okay so this ad has 650 000 likes went viral um it got featured in vice and a bunch of other places because the brilliance of this so why is this ad brilliant so first the hook the first hook is her she's covered she's got her hand covering her face partially which is like with like the kind of like oh my god and then it says y'all but it's real this is a real like this is like a real thing this was a this was i think he created this ad this wasn't no what i mean is it doesn't look like a highly produced thing it literally just looks like a woman holding a selfie yeah she's hold her phone okay this this and then there's a there's like a whatever a viral song right after that and it looks like she's saying oh my god let me tell you something and then this it zooms in on her eyes and she's just like moving her eyes in that way of like that like sort of a mischievous thing and then the next scene is it shows the packaging but there's also like a little like there's like another thing on the table so you kind of don't it doesn't again it doesn't scream ad at you right like it's not like this beautifully like a normal marketer would say well get this like you know candle that you have out of here that's confusing and she's like no like make it look like a desk and then like put the put the packaging of the product and it says this quote unquote special chocolate will change your love life dot dot dot seriously okay so now i'm like intrigued it zooms in on it and then it goes it shows the guy and the girl each breaking off a piece like half and half of this thing so hey that looks kind of fun to do um and then it doesn't tell you anything about it except it goes to her with the disheveled hair uh the jbf hair as they used to say in college if you know what that stands for and then uh it just says it works with the shocked face and then it's again her looking around like oh my god dude what is okay so i actually don't know what does jbf mean i didn't go to like cool just been just been after ah um so so so basically you why is this amazing this is amazing because to me the best ads have three components they have the hook which is like just a thing to like draw you in to even get you to pay attention which is in her case the her with the hand over face the second thing it has is the promise so it has the the promise that gets me curious and in this case is this quote unquote special chocolate will change your love life dot dot seriously and then it has the it skips to the end right i have moved straight to the end it has the implication of it working so it doesn't tell you how it works why it works though you know what it does exactly it's just the the end state takes you straight to the happy ending of this is life if you use our product and um most people don't like most people don't know how to do a hook they get usually they get how to do a promise and then very rarely do people know how to use the implication which is th this is this is if this works here's what happens to your life you kind of just show the ending and people just want to get into that and so they kind of put put two and two together about you know how how this might work they want to click to learn more so that's why to me this is an amazing ad and this is called tab chocolate if you look at the rest of their tick tocks they're all doing the same thing it's all like um you and your husband when you first get married and it's like them like wanting to have sex and then it's like 10 years after marriage and it's like the wife trying to be sexy and the husband ignores her and then they show now here's you with tab and it shows them wanting to have sex so like an easy thing to advertise for well kind of easy but uh what's this company about are they killing it yeah so they basically are a d2c company i want to give the founder a shout out i think his name is oliver i want to say oliver let me see uh and what's in this chocolate what what what makes you horny i don't even know dude i don't know probably nothing doesn't matter uh yeah this guy oliver i see this guy all of her on uh on twitter he's young i think this guy's like 21 i think they said they sold half a million what does he know about this then bro got his first first wood and just decided to create a product still he's still on his first one what if like well you're 21 i mean things were great yeah why do you need this um but basically i think he said they sold like half a million dollars worth of chocolate off this off this ad um and like within a couple weeks or something like that so it really like jumps jumps is it a bootstrap company i mean just tab.com would cost half a million dollars he has tab.com right so one of the guys jake his thing says freshman at university of michigan which is just kind of insane and is that true uh let me find this other guy oliver there's no way this do you think it's founded by it so this guy i'm gonna study this guy's uh twitter which is just hilarious wasn't that long ago that this whole operation was just the captain me and a couple of parents but hubspot helped us grow our business across all seven seats hey celebratory cannons hubspot grow better first of all so this guy's handle is oliver oliver underscore b1 or something like that or maybe 200 scores but his name is oliver b that says slash i sell sex chocolate that's his name on twitter then you know he's got his photo which is like him with his bros um and yeah he's he's been tweeting out like you know how um you know how it's been doing so you know they did 73 000 this week um he's like i have this army of user generated content creators so like he's like i basically have um you know i think he's got like an army of like 20 creators and he'll pay them between 500 and 3 000 and then they make 30 videos um they make 30 videos a month or something he's being a little uh loose with that word army maybe a gaggle he's got a gaggle of got a supper party yeah he's got like a he's got like a like a full he's got like a full nhl team that's the classroom behind him i'll have a good touch football football game worth of uh creators i want to know about army 20. [Laughter] but honestly this guy knows more about marketing than like half of the uh you know marketing gurus that you see on social media just go look at this guy's content no they're they're like um i think they're bootstrapped i don't know i don't know much about them i'm kind of making up half of the stuff as i'm going along here but i know enough that's this is that's an amazing ad these guys are young these guys understand marketing at a pretty deep level especially on new channels like tick tock and um and that they've done you know like a pretty decent amount of sales but i was looking at like his like uh he had said something he was like bragging about his roads or something like that and uh it actually wasn't super that part wasn't super impressive so i i didn't understand why he was bragging about that do you so this is kind of an interesting topic of like basically trying to reach like a young audience you're trying to look cool then you go and you hire like a young cool person and you're like make us look cool yeah the best example was when we when i hired steve bartlett and he's gone on to do some amazing things we've talked about him before uh if you don't know he basically ended up creating a marketing uh like a whatever a marketing company marketing agency that um did like over 100 million dollars in revenue it ended up merging with the company went public he's like a dragon on dragon's den he's got a real popular podcast and a bunch of stuff he's like to me he's the young black gary v that's like the best description i can have of him and you think he's uh he's totally the real deal yeah he's the real deal um he's the real deal in the sense that like uh you know i don't know in the same way that we were like dude gary v is awesome um you know does he kind of put on for the camera of course that's the game does you know is vaynermedia the best business i've ever seen no it's not the best but it's a great you know it's still a business that works and it's like at scale um so uh you know real deal could mean a bunch of things but i think steve's the real deal in all of those terms meaning i've seen his talent firsthand he's really super talented uh so i recruited him from the uk he flew over he lived with us and and worked with us in san francisco and then he then after that he basically went spun out his like marketing agency and like that's how he kind of got his start and uh and my whole thinking was like this guy gets social this guy gets social media he's a hustler and like if we're gonna build these social apps we need somebody who like hey they're they're not like an engineer neckbeard like who's like oh yeah people want to share photo galleries because why would i not want to share 128 photos instead of one it's more it's like no dude people don't want to share 128 they want one disappearing photo actually because i'm trying to send like you know something you know inappropriate to my friend i don't want this permanent record right so like there's a big difference of like what how an engineer will build a social product versus how somebody who's you know social will build a social product and and so i wanted to have basically like somebody who was young who was a user of every social platform to be like hey dude just [ __ ] test some of these ideas and be like is this good or is this not good and then secondly uh when we have something good be able to like blast it promote it on social in a way that's not like uh cringe and he did that like and so when we were we were like all right let me give you an example at the time he had this like network of pages he was like look i have all these uh i either own or know the owners of these twitter accounts that uh have you know together like whatever 50 million followers so when we're ready to launch we'll post it there and i was like great and so again the engineers were like all right we're ready um and so i was you know my brain went to like cool on all these accounts post like hey love this new app it lets you do x y z and i love this new app bibo it lets you do blank link and blank and then the engineer is like oh and make sure we can track the attribution so we're going to use this like this url with this utm parameter and they give me this url that's like 9 000 characters long it looks ugly as hell but it's like super trackable they're like look at this in the dashboard we know exactly who clicked and which tweet and all this stuff and then steve was like um like all right thanks for the suggestions but um not using that link in fact not using any link because uh nobody's posting a link and nobody posts links on twitter and we're like what like then how will they go download the app he's like they'll go download it if they hear about it a bunch and they feel like they're missing out and i was like yeah but that's like more work he's like yeah but again they're gonna feel like they're missing out not that they're being sold to and then he's like and we're also not gonna tweet hey check out the new bibo app it has these features he's like we're going to tweet out memes like um you know uh my teacher when she sees me you know like my teacher when she hears about bibo for the 50th time today and it's her throne it's a gif of a teacher throwing a phone out this class window and like shattering the window or like you know um my feel my mfw my you know my face winner my feeling when um i see bebo trending on twitter you know after 10 years and it's like um and i was like but that sounds bad for us right they're annoyed at us he's like yeah get it it's like they're annoyed because they've been hearing about it so much and so somebody who's not hearing about it it's gonna be like oh [ __ ] i'm out of the loop what is this and they're gonna go google it find it and i was like nah this is stupid guess what he we did it his way we launched we hit number one on the app store charts hit uh i don't know how many down i think we hit 250 000 downloads in like the first month or something like that something crazy and um yeah it was like insane and we spent zero dollars so it was awesome but how did you get the the the like the influencers so steve owned a bunch of them so me hiring steve was like me getting to use steve's like assets and then he because he had clout in like the social like meme world of like the people who own these pages uh he like pulled a favor it was like yo post this on this day and we're gonna get this to trend i need this he was like a 21 year old trying to prove himself so he's like yo i need you to do me a favor here put this thing up here so maybe we paid like a few thousand dollars total but like you know nothing to get like hundreds of thousands of downloads and number one rank in the overall app store charts um and we did that let's see a pain in the ass to employ though no no he wasn't a pain in the ass but i'll tell you first why i knew we needed to hire steve so when we wanted to we were building this app and we were like all right this social app definitely leans towards a younger audience we're like all right we got to be like in like in touch with you know high schoolers basically so i told jason and tyler i was like guys we need to be like we need to be able to pitch our app to high schoolers and see what they think about it and it's like all right well how the hell are we gonna do that so first they were like coming up with all these schemes and i was like guys like um i came visit him like an hour later and i was like all right what's the what's the point how many high schoolers you got they're like none we're like coming up with a powerpoint deck i'm like how are you going to do this or something like that they're like coming up with a plan and i was like all right like let me put it differently to you guys here's a better question in the next hour how can i show our app to like two high schoolers go let's go make that happen and they're like okay all right then they got it they got what i was looking for so they first were like all right my nephew's on the line so we got the two and i was like great how do we get 20 high schoolers now in the next hour and they're like uh okay there's a bunch of high schoolers over here at the mall near our office like so they went over there with a sign that said you know uh test our app get a free burrito and they got like immediately like 20 people and they're like okay that was cool but there was only 20 people there it's like how are we going to do this regularly and so we found a high school nearby and so we went over there first they started the same thing they had a sign outside free burrito if you try our app and people were signing up like crazy we didn't have burritos by the way it was just like a promise we were like i don't know we'll figure out how to get you a burrito later and um and then there so we got a bunch of people to like try it out and then uh a teacher came out and was like hey guys what's going on here they're like oh sorry sorry sorry we're not creeps we're just like we're trying to get beta testers for our app you know what that word means uh and they were like oh cool you're a startup and they're like come on in and they invited us to come speak they're like hey you know like you could just like take over my class for the day i'll just sit down and play sudoku and you just teach my kids about startups sounds like the most naive trusting teacher like to a fault it was it definitely was oh you're you're are you a little kid lover great come on in you you must love kids so much you build apps for them so you're a little kid lover it was definitely worrisome like why it was so easy but literally that's what happened so for seven seven hours straight that day like a class would come in 50 kids we would teach them about startups for 15 minutes and then we'd pitch them our app for 15 minutes and then we'd be like next and we and but just by doing that you know to take you know basically 30 kids per class times seven we're getting 210 kids a day in the same school to download our app so that like all their friends were on the app so it was a great it was like this great way to like take over a high school in a day and see if it goes viral once we get that seed community but in one of them we so the first day we go and it's me and jason i'm like dude it's cool i'm cool and i was like i start talking i'm like yeah that's tight and they start giggling and i'm like oh [ __ ] tight was a cool word when i was in high school that's i was like it's lit it's super lit and they're like you know i was like i was already outed it's like not cool but i was like and so i got like humbled big time i'm like realizing and by the way if you go talk to kid like high school classic they just don't give a [ __ ] they don't pay attention they'll just be like straight talking to somebody else while you're talking and you can't control them at all and so i was like oh man this teaching is so hard and then i'm like and so i'm like okay whatever let's skip to the end skip to the part we test our app so it's like all right you guys want to see our app and they were like nobody says anything i'm like okay um you know the first person who downloads our app like you know you get candy from this bowl and they're like all right what's up and i was like and i was like they're like what's the name of it i was like oh it's not in the app store yet it's on test flight and i can just feel the blood raining from my body as i said that i was like what the [ __ ] were we thinking and then i was like you were so just i was like i'm gonna put the link up here on the projector just like type that in and it'll take you to the thing and this kid in the back no joke he goes links are gay dude i was so embarrassed and just i just got wrecked and i started laughing so hard i couldn't stopped laughing and i was like it was literally at the office from there on out we were like hey like hr we don't mean this in a bad way but it's the funniest thing that just happened the whole company is in on this joke and so anytime somebody was like yo send me the link like in slack and somebody else would be like links are dead because it was the most like you thought you got nagged i got straight [ __ ] slapped by this like 13 year old [Laughter] and it was unbelievable it was unbelievable by the way the other thing every high school kid has just a cracked screen none of them have a phone that is like the screen intact they all got cracked screens you know what uh you know what i think about everyone's so remember this company called uh chubbies yeah so basically they uh made shorts for they made like short shorts and they were great guys but like their customers and we're just like bros like hard like chad bro chill like the hardest the hardest like bros you can think of and uh which is like that's fine but i don't want to be like 40 years old and having to like make ads like uh about summer and spring break like you know like you know what i mean like i don't know i don't relate to that at all at least i don't if i'm like 40. and it's kind of like the uh bar stool guys it's like man you're losing your hair you still you want to be doing like these beer bongs like and i think about like to build a social app or even like other products like chubbies in that space and to be a grown adult doing it it's kind of uh if that doesn't work it's super embarrassing i think you're going with some highly intellectual conclusion here yeah you basically were like like like yeah you're kind of a loser it's just embarrassing man like it's like it's cool because tick tock worked but imagine a bunch of like like a 45 i think the guy who started tick tock or whatever what's it called bit uh the owner of tik-tok i forget what it's called bitnami or what's this [ __ ] bite dance like this like 43 year old chinese guy trying to make products for like but it worked dude american girls like young 14 year old american girls it's like yeah it's cool because it worked but man this was like this could go either way like this could have gone either way and and like that's kind of that's kind of scary to me not scary but that's like another one we built so after that app so we go through that process that i get humiliated i'm like oh my god i go back to the team i'm like we are so far disconnected from like our customer like we thought we could go in there teach them about startups as if they give a [ __ ] and then tell them to download our test flight app from a link and like you know we all heard how that went down okay so so so you know i got basically like i was like a character in south park that day so i got honed and then i was like all right well let's so we pivot and we try this other app that was like the idea was like it ended up being what house party was so us a house party at the same time it was like an app where it's like i don't want to call somebody but like i'm you know like i'm down to hang out if somebody else happened to be like free at the same time and so it was this app where you could just kind of say like you know you could just say if you're available and if other people aren't you can just get into kind of a more spontaneous conversation versus the phone call where it's like dude what do you need from me um but i was like well so they made the app they made the prototype real quick engineers are great again and then the front screen they're like hey we need some text for this like because right now it just says like you know push to begin or like you know you know like initiate and i was like oh no that's like we don't want to write like initiate that's not going to work again teenagers they don't like links uh what do they like to do netflix and chill and so i was like oh just make it like a swipe like tinder i was like so so we just said swipe to chill and like literally like the first version said swipe to chill and the we had one guy johnny dallas working for us and he was a teenager so he was like a 16 year old programmer and he saw swiped chill and you could just see him being like do i have to share this with my friends like with other people before i said to my friends because it says swipe to chill on the front and like that's not a thing people say or do [Laughter] so it was all bad dude that sucks okay so then let me tell you steve bartlett's story all right so so i'm like we need we need some young blood in this and this office steve bartlett cold emails me a great cold email i'm like this guy's awesome fly him and his buddy out and we're like you guys work for us now you are kind of like our youth department and um how did they stay in america uh there was no like visa now there's not a tourist thing they came they could stay for three months at a time and they would go back and they would come again and did they live at the office they would live they got we got the hotel but it was like they're staying for a while so we were like all right just stay at the office because there's an apartment built in and like you know just i don't know make it work dude but did you ever think like what did steve tell his parents like can you imagine 20 year old or 19 year old you like uh explaining what's gonna happen yeah i would have been like this is awesome and i knew steve was wired like that so he was also like this is awesome he didn't he didn't bother telling his parents he was like living his life so he he thought this was great so steve's there and our if you remember our office stanford is kind of a baller pad so steve basically went from like living in like a dump like a tiny you know like he was a college dropout in the uk making no money to he comes to the us and now he's living in this like baller pad that has like a bar built into it a private chef all these like perks it just looks like it's designed like i know straight out of something like british magazine and um and steve would take advantage of that so he was living there and um so he would like you know people would leave the office 6 7 p.m and then what he would do is he would like go and um you know he didn't invite friends over he was on tinder tinder was active and so we would come into the office in the morning and like i remember one day i came in and like some girl was like leaving doing the walk of shame holding her heels in her hand uh like walking out and like you know we we had women working in the office who were like who's this girl like what and why is she like hungover leaving the like the bedroom in the office like what's going on here and then steve would come down he'd be like and he was like you know proud of himself in a way he's like dude i'm winning at life and so so that was a little bit of a problem and then i remember they were like what did you say to him like hey you know you can't even yes you are living here but you can't live here yeah i think i told him once but i remember just like even in the conversation it was like uh man he feels like he's in the principal's office and i feel like the principal and like i could tell this is lame because he wasn't doing anything out of any malice right like it would just be like they would just you know they'd be hanging out drinking you know at the bar we have in our office but they would kind of like leave the bars kind of sticky and with beers they didn't know to like you know just like some professionalism stuff like that's a tuesday night i should just like let me just at least make this look like we weren't here drinking and hanging out all night and playing the music and the neighbors get a noise complaint stuff like stuff like that right nothing nothing harmful nothing like uh bad just like slightly annoying to people who felt like they were parenting them in the morning when they came in um and like i remember one time the funniest one and the one where i was like uh this is just not working out um dude they had like or they like uh i was talking to our office manager and i was like i promise i talked to steve they're they're not gonna like play the music too loud and like they'll clean up the beers or whatever and like that happened one day and then the next day no beers no loud music it was all good and then she opened up like the supply closet to like get like some new pencils and like sticky notes for the meeting we had like the board meeting we had and like just a giant pizza box spell out why would you put a pizza in this closet like just throw the pizza in the trash and she was like these kids like i've i can't do this shot i can't do this at all did you fire him no no i didn't fire him but i was like i kind of knew in my head i was like you know what birds gotta fly i was like these guys they're talented they need to do their own thing them conforming into like our office like set up and like it's just not like a fit you know like they don't need to run these meetings like these daily stand-up meetings with the engineers it's like that's not their skill set that's not what they need to do like they're good at like taking something that's dope and making it like pop in the market like and they just need to do that and then basically that's what their marketing agent did they would just find cool brands to work with and they would figure out how to tell that story and make it big and trend in social media and it turns out they were great at that and they made went made like you know hundreds of millions of dollars doing that and so that was like a successful outcome but i i kind of knew in my head i was like all right there's these advantages when you bring in these sort of like these non-domesticated cats uh and they're gonna like they're gonna be real with you about what about the market they're gonna like have fresh ideas they're gonna be good at like playing the social media game but like you know they're not gonna be the best at like you know running this like you know agile software like you know uh meeting this is not what they you know they don't need to be product managers they need to be like out about i remember i wrote a profile about him when he was still pretty young and it was working and it was like buzzfeed or something i think it was buzzfeed and he must have been only 23 or 24 and they were like basically the office has like a slide in there and like it was like everything yeah like a mcdonald's playpen it's my face and he was like they've got like 40 employees here and i asked him how much each person is getting paid and it was like 25 000 a year it was like nothing and but they like love it because it's the first time a 21 year old is able to like be the head of hr and like just figure out stuff as she went and i was like oh my god i don't know about those numbers but i do remember at one point it was like they had 23 employees and i think 22 of them were under the age of 22. like it was like all 21 year olds and they were like and that was the device article or the whatever vox article or whatever it was it's just like meet the 21 year olds who are running the internet right now and it was true like they were really they owned all of the popular instagram and twitter accounts in in europe and so they just had like crazy ability to influence the market and they had the right people to do it right like that's who knew how to build that was the business the business was brands would pay to advertise on those twitter and instagram handles uh initially that's how we used it but the and that was a part of it we were like we created this like idea of like this the thunderclap which was like getting all those pages on the same day to be talking about your brain came up with that name i remember saying it but i think other people use that term so i don't think in my head i invented it but i'm sure i learned it i heard it somewhere i'm sure um but the thing what they were doing was then they were they would just like a brand would be like hey how do we what's our social strategy so then it they quickly got away from just like hey pay to post on our pages because that's kind of like transactional to to like hey netflix do you want to know how to do your social like why don't we just be your agency of record for social media for your social media marketing and like that became with a fat retainer and like ongoing campaigns and then like and then they would like do like proper videos and like kind of viral videos stunts things like that whole strategies for these brands so that's what it became and then they launched their own brands too we've been getting uh the past few episodes we've been getting more into just trying to just telling funny stories i'm very eager to see uh if this is the route that we should go it's way more fun that's for sure yeah it's fun but after every episode i have to like do like a cancellation check-in and be like was i um sexist racist homophobic uh you know is there anything that i said that could have been construed as hateful in any way to any group of people that is going to be like offensive like i tweeted out this thing the other day that's like and by the way they're never hateful they're always like a compliment uh but like i tweeted out this thing which was like you know my investment criteria you know big market good traction founder is mormon russian jewish or whatever i like said something but it was like positive it was like because i think those founders like on balance are awesome like i've had and it was a joke and it was a joke right and people were like what does race have anything to do with who you'll fund this is what's wrong with and i was like well first of all it's a joke to be clear like did you think this was serious and secondly like it wasn't a joke saying i don't fund these fun you know these random niche minority groups it's like no i think mormons are awesome at sales and like you know just as a as a general like positive prejudice you know i am i'm inclined to believe that these people are really smart or really talented or really gritty or really whatever um and you know but of course like there's no winning right like the audience that like gets that and thinks it's awesome it's like so small compared to the like the other audience that's like i will make it my life's mission to like get you canceled now for for this for this uh this joke you said the um the nelk boys which is like those youtube guys now they got this they've got a new podcast it's only good because there's they're not like good asking questions but they're good because they're so famous that they get like the best guests so the elk boys had donald trump on you know like one of the most famous people in the world they had um you know all types of like they had uh habib on they had dana white on they have like all these like hugely famous people and they were talking to dave portnoy and they were like uh yeah like we're uncancelable because like everyone's expectations of us are so low right and like we're just degenerate so like they don't everyone's like yeah of course they did that thing like there's no surprise there these guys are idiots and uh i'm not sure if we're there yet i don't know for it maybe yeah do you want to be right like i call it the cancellation vaccinations like do you want to be vaccinated against cancellation here's what it entails you need to consistently be provocative never apologize like cater to your base and ignore the rest and like that's the that's the cancellation of vaccinations what joe rogan does what donald trump does it's what the milk boys do it's what any group of people dave chappelle any group of people who like they're like look i'm gonna say what's on my mind there's gonna be some people who are offended by this that's not my audience there's some people who understand the point of view where i'm coming from they're gonna understand what's a joke they're gonna understand when i'm saying something positive about somebody that doesn't mean it's negative about somebody else um and they're just like and they're like i'm consistent i'm willing to do this i'm willing to take heat i'm not gonna apologize et cetera et cetera and um and so you know that's like the the cancellation vaccination now i think you do that i think you also need to be financially independent or directly fan supported and like you know for example this is a hubspot podcast network podcast you work at hubspot i don't think they're gonna love some of the jokes that you tell like even if that person individually thinks it's funny they'd rather us just take no risk right why like for them the risk reward you know calculator is like oh just take no risks and it's fine just like do your other stuff it's great whereas for us it's like dude no like i'm here to have a conversation with sam i want this to be like a conversation we would actually have i think that's how you get super fans because they feel like you're being authentic you're not you're not like separating the real you from like this like record public podcast version of you and i know my intentions are pure i know i'm not actually a bad guy i'm not sexist racist or homophobic or any of those things and if i say that i think mormons are awesome founders i think that that is should be a i think that should be a totally fine thing to say right i you know i don't think that's a controversial thing in my books and so i'm like you know i'm part of the common sense party and i want other people who are you know like confuse their common sense or are not like easily offended around me but that's a that's a risky path to take that's a good speech i'm on board good very good speech all right i guess that's the episode [Music] you

how do you deal with those negative critiques does it bother you if i'm not in the right state of mind that initial reaction i'm gonna clap back or they're so dumb because of this and this and i realize pretty quickly that doesn't get me anywhere in fact it would waste like almost like half a day or a whole day of mine i guess my rule that i created for myself was that i want my own opinion of myself to be higher than anybody else's opinion of me if i think something sucks that i did yeah i don't care what anybody else says i think it is so i basically want my opinion of myself to be the trump card i stopped seeking the respect of others because i'm like well if i don't have the main respect my respect then what is all this other stuff worth

[Music] i did i talk about this the other day i went to that the blippi show did i tell you about this no all right so so do you know who blippi is have you ever heard of blippi i don't know what that is no all right so like remember like back there we had barney or like you know uh like pee wee herman or whatever he's like it's like it's a dude so he kind of looks like peter herman or whatever but he's more like a barney or you know um sesame street style show so basically there's a guy who went on youtube created this brand called blippi and he um he's entertaining so he'd be like oh and by the way the funny thing that he does is there's no like set he just goes into like um hey we're at the aquarium but they just go in like after 9 p.m it's like closed down and so it's just they have it all to themselves like hey we're here in las vegas at this rock climbing studio and so he just uses that to film his thing but he gives it a shout out at the beginning of the video the video gets like 40 million views so it's like uh well you know it's worth it to let these guys film there and he just like goes around he'll basically just play with toys he'll be like i'm at an abandoned chuck e cheese and he'll go play with a bunch of toys and there's like music and whatever overlaid and it's the same guy i'm looking at him now it's the same guy every single time it is except for as he blew up and got famous then they switched him out with just a stunt double for a bit and so like that guy's like a substitute teacher sometimes and then sometimes when flippy comes back uh but like the main guy is the main guy he wears his outfits like this blue outfit with his orange glasses he like always looks the same so anyways my daughter loved blippi we used to watch a ton of bloopy and all of a sudden we see this ad that says um blippi like the live show is coming to oakland and so we were like oh [ __ ] and so instantly my wife buys tickets for for all of us in the family we go to this thing last weekend and it's it's at the same place you did hustle con so it's at the paramount theater and it is packed like you know hustle khan was like you know sold out ish this was like sold out sold out like all the even the back shitty seat is like sold out and it's full of parents and their kids and then there's this like this they basically just created like a little play like a little mini musical one hour because kids don't have that long of an attention span and it's just kind of like music and like you know lights and colors and he's oh dinosaurs oh rocks oh how much should it cost so every ticket i want to say was that venue's seats maybe like 60 bucks a seat something like that so that's been used seats between 2 500 and 3 000 i believe yeah so i think there was 2 000 there um and i believe the tickets were something like um something like 50 60 70 bucks something like that so we're in like 120 000 and he played four shows in a row um that weekend and then he went to the next city so it was our like no he had done eight shows or he was doing something like that so it was like some crazy like thing where i was like oh wow this weekend they made whatever 800 grand um and yeah the tickets tickets basically range from like you know 60 bucks to 90 bucks and um and the place is lit by the way so like you know he comes on stage kids go crazy he's like you know he'd be like you know what does the bubble do and everyone's like pop and he's like when i say pop can you say pop and like so it's like not like a quiet show like because kids are loud anyways so some kids are just not paying attention have to like my daughter during intermission was like i want to watch blippi on youtube and so we like had to open up youtube on our phone and give it to her during intermission because she couldn't like go five minutes without stimulation and so it's and then they have like the merch and the like the concessions they have like all that [ __ ] right so it's like pretty dope actually and i was like wow this is kind of genius they just took youtube ip and this is this guy who was there was not blippi the guy on stage was just some you know theater kid who like didn't make it you know and so he's like all right plan b i'll be blippi and um and so it was like they took the ip but they made their own show out of it and so i started looking into this and there's a company that does this called vstar entertainment awesome so v-star what they do is they go license these kids brands and then they put on kids broadway basically and they tour around the country awesome and so and blippi is just a guy with a guitar right or were there more tournaments no guitar he's just just him he just watched so were there any instruments or was it just like a soundtrack just soundtrack and like lights and like uh stage props so wow so he he always kind of like like you know if they came out as sharks like a bunch of like little backup dancers came out as sharks and then they whatever like that's an awesome mini theater show right and so v star entertainment they do another brand that you've probably heard of call or you may have heard of called paw patrol it's basically another kids cartoon so guess how much this is my like kind of triangulation guess how much they sold in paw patrol tickets last year just take it take a guess 20 20 mil 40 million dollars and 40 million dollars in event tickets and event tickets for and that's just the tickets not the murder that was just last year and 22. uh i don't know it's like this is like the just before covet numbers so like 2019 2020 something like that wow so they got bought by cirque du soleil so first so the back story is some guy decides oh you know what like he's watching sesame street he's like sesame street should do a live show and he goes and he basically raises 500 grand from this guy he mortgages his house he gets an extra 25 grand out of his home equity so he's got 525 thousand dollars he goes and he gets the license to sesame street he started with the sesame street show and then muppets and like he you know did but that must have been years ago this was in like 1980 something like that yeah and then um this other guy was doing it they merged and that whole thing gets bought by cirque du soleil last year is it cirque du soleil by the way like guess how much cirque du soleil revenue was have you ever written a cirque show no i've not but i do know that the guy who started it uh is a canadian guy he's a billionaire i read dan blizzarian's book and they talk about that guy a lot i think he's like i mean he started a circus so he's like liberty or whatever yeah he's really eccentric and wild and everything so it made him a billionaire how much revenue does it make um ben have you been to a cirque du soleil show cirque du soleil did a billion does a billion dollars a year in revenue which is insane ten percent a five or ten percent of all las vegas tourists go to a circ show when they're in town is that what what's that cirque is that the is that they have like ten shows right it'll be like they have oh and then they have zoomanity they have like whatever and the beatles yeah i know all about it and i'm i'm into it and it's publicly traded or at least it was before it was acquired by private equity right right private equity owns it now and um and it's a pretty badass business the idea was do a circus but no animals so it was like only human performers and to do that they did like crazy acrobats and like great costumes it's basically its own genre at this point though right and so he built that thing into a real juggernaut and so cirque then bought blue man group and v star entertainment and so they got blue man which is like an ad what they had said was like we do 10 million in ticket sales a year for cirque du soleil blue man adds another 2 million and then um and then v star adds another two million but they're all like different ticket prices but like they do 14 million in tickets uh sold per year and so this this like live entertainment thing really has caught my attention because i think as the world moves more and more digital that they're like the demand for like these one-off experiences like hey let's get out of the house and go do something i think it's just gonna keep going up music festivals that's a winner and then there's like uh i think plays and musicals are gonna be a winner i think they're going to be bigger than they were before even though the world news digital and in fact because the world moves digital what do you think about all this i 100 agree and so earlier today i sent you a notion doc of some of my notes on i'm interested in peer businesses which is basically like you pay money and you're part of a club and you meet up with them and i i can't talk too much about what the names of the companies were but they were doing like uh one of them does 100 million a year in profit and it's basically two or three meetups a year and there's executives paying 50 000 a year to be part of them and i think actually these are going to completely boom i think conferences right now are interesting but those are really hard this actually seems way easier to pull off um all types of meetups airbnbs i'm 100 on board that i think that in person is is the move yeah i and i think that so then i started thinking like what are the other opportunities and so i think a you could just like go compete with these guys on like either the same brands or another brand so like what they did was the v star guy took tv ip turned it into a live show the what the flipping guy is doing is taking youtube ip and turning it into a live show and i think you could just even do this for more so like i think you could even do like we've talked about religion which is the greatest free ip in the world so i think somebody could do this for religion which would make a extremely kid friendly in fact kid-focused like christianity show basically i think you could do this for dinosaurs or science as a generic genre because like if kids love trucks and dinosaurs or whatever and you could just basically create the like the the show you know day with dinosaurs or something like that and it once you get like if you have a certain level of quality moms will spread this and they will talk about it and they will like in their mommy groups they will help you sell these tickets and um and i just feel like there's a like it's not that hard like you build one show and then you sell that one show a thousand times right like the show goes on tour mamma mia has made like i don't know some stupid amount of money just being the same show on tour with replacing the the low cost action yeah anytime i'm trying while we're talking i'm trying to find the numbers so we used to so we did events but we would do like these this thing called hustle con which was like our big one where like thousands of people would come but then we do this thing called 2x and 2x was basically from like 7 p.m to like 10 p.m and it was basically we got 15 or 10 women all who were in tech and business not that many of them were like well known but they would have 10 minutes to like tell a story and we would charge like 25 but then we would get tens of thousands of dollars in sponsors but we got to the point where we could pull this off like kind of like almost weekly in other cities and when we started doing this the hustle wasn't that popular but we were making like i think like 30 grand a night when we were doing it and we had one employee running it right and she would use a team of contractors and then we wouldn't supply anything like i think we had free wine but i don't know i don't even think it was free i like we wouldn't supply anything but then we have corporate sponsors and we crushed it and in my head i'm like i can always fall back on this to make a living because it was so much easier than people thought right yeah that's pretty good for a tech bro um a tech bro business like all of us you you you were running one of the best like women's entrepreneurship events yeah because you got labeled wrong dude yeah they're i'm like an onion man there's layers so but basically like we used to do this thing called pizza and 40s where we would do a meet-up and i would interview someone and they would drink a 40-ounce and when the 40-ounce beer was done the talk was done but then like women were like this is like there's all dudes here and so we created like a like a wine version and that had like way better it was like called like cheese and wine i don't even remember but that had way better engagement and so we're like oh like let's pursue this vein like this there's clearly an opportunity here until we created 2x which uh comes it's like 2x chromosomes which i thought was clever i stole it from reddit uh but anyway we would do i think we did 10 or 12 uh in one year and every single time it was like 20 and 30 grand and the cost the cost was nothing the cost was renting the venue which cost like three thousand dollars and we would make like 20 grand and you also you had readers in every city right so that's how you sold the tickets is that yeah yeah but we weren't basically the speakers sold the tickets the reason why we had 15 speakers was was i was like i bet each 15 will get 25 people to come plus our like a little bit of our engine like this is easy and you weren't making the money off the tickets you're making enough sponsors really anyway the tickets the the business model was the tickets paid for the event and then the conference was all or the sponsors were all the profit but when it's there's two things going on one like women so whenever you have like an underserved community like sponsors definitely are willing to pay more and two it was like a b to b component so it wasn't kid's component which i think would alter the economics but my point of it is that i think that it was far easier than people thought and it was way more rudimentary and raw than people thought and it worked we just used splash that i think if you google like 2x the hustle you'll like see like the splash that is basically eventbrite it was nothing special and it freaking worked [Music] you

[Music] i think i could build it to sell it which what i want to know from your perspective is that even a good plan building to sell so part of me is like yes it's clear path to make money another part is like it's kind of lame though yeah well i think where you're at now let's take three three options build to sell that which is basically optimizing for like oh is there a sort of like a flip is there a is there a buyer on the other side of a business like this another one is build to win which is basically like um for example when i talk to these bankers what i'm trying to figure out is what which of these businesses is like not a special snowflake where it's like oh that's actually like a rinse and repeatable model like i didn't like that founder didn't like catch lightning in a bottle at the perfect time and it's their perfect background and they got really lucky about this one thing it's like oh those i don't want to emulate i want to emulate the one where it's like hey i think somebody could start that same business today and do equally well or do do just as well in this one adjacent space and like you don't need to be a genius with that and so that's the second part of it which is like build to win it's like optimizing for something that's gonna work and then there's the last one which is sort of like you know build for fun or build for mission which is like go for something that like you something you would never want to sell that you're willing to do even if it's low likelihood of success i think we all know the answer is to do that bucket right like i think the question is like how many how much security do you need before you go do the thing you know you should do well or it could be a combination of all three uh like it could be like you enjoy winning or you enjoy this space and you want to make it successful but there's a great clip from you and uh what's uh free what's what's uh all in david freeburg there's a great clip that i shared that you and him had where he basically said that founders always sell themselves short and they go for these small ideas because because they think it's more reasonable but when doing that they kind of screwed themselves because it's actually easier sometimes to do much of grander bigger ideas because that attracts the crazy types of people who you want to work with um you can interact competitive because nobody else no not every joe is going to try to you know do it like you know going and trying to you know start a railroad business or whatever versus an fba business it's like well they're both going to take all your time so that's equal money well you're going to have to go raise money from investors one will let you just raise you're still going to get the money you need from investors just one you maybe raise more at a higher valuation and the other one you'll raise less at a lower evaluation right like but did you agree do you agree with him i i do agree with him and i've thought this for a very long time i remember uh back in the day did you ever hear about this thing called the unreasonable institute i don't even think this is around anymore that's a great name it's sort of like the same guys who did summit it's not it's not actually the same guys but it's the same it was like the same idea it was like right the unreasonable institute was basically this like it was based on this one word unreasonable in the way that the hustle is built on this one word hustle and uh trans is built on one word trends and so the unreason was it was exactly that it was like it's going to take unreasonable people to do unreasonable things for the world to move forward and it was like very inspiring and then they met with all a bunch of you know a bunch of people who did that the sort of elon musk types who went and did unreasonable things and then you start to look at it and you're like you know all things equal um you know i guess like your inputs are sort of the same it's just your time and energy and then like the outputs can be very very different because the inputs aren't the same because it is possible to build something pretty cool and not work that hard but it's kind of impossible to build something huge and not work very hard all right who do we know and let's do real examples i'm not saying it's not true but who do we know that's building successful awesome businesses without working too hard well how about suli i actually don't know what's his schedule does he grind constantly he works hard yes he works hard so then no one you don't we don't know anyone but you and me like maybe i'll give you one nuance on it he got there faster than the normal person so it looked like it came easier but that's just because he was better it wasn't because he worked like he he wasn't putting in a tenth of the hours he was putting in the same number of hours and getting there 10 times faster which is i just think that like there's a world where you have business a and it doesn't grow nearly as fast and you're working 40 hours a week and then you have business b that's growing significantly faster and you have to work 100 hours a week like that that is a reality yes that's true that's what i'm talking about i'm not talking about like very little i'm talking about normal versus not normal there's also things like this podcast or like people who have like newsletters or blogs or something like that where it's like or they teach a course it's like you know like let's take your buddy neville right so neville i don't think you and me well because i'm doing multiple things right so it's like on each one i'm not putting in as much time but like overall i'm working harder and if i didn't do those other things that one thing would just expand in time i would just do more i would say how often are you working now a day normal work hours uh not normal hours but i work like a the equivalent of eight hours a day got it just not all to it not not all continuously all right but back to what was the original point so my my point was like uh is it is this really true that you can kind of like chill and win and like no i didn't mean to say i mean chill less or sorry chill more work less okay so then bro if you agree with friedberg which i think i do why are you not going after like one big grand thing like i started a newsletter that's not exactly like you know that's not like world changing entirely it's neat but i would i would put it on a six out of ten in terms of like maybe a five in terms of like big ideas right yeah i i agree with you the reason why is because to me it's not a bigness contest it's a do i have a clear picture of what i want like my life to be and then can i like do i have a crystal clear picture and then can i make that happen and it's like knowing what i want and then getting what i want and so what i wanted was not to work the hundred hours right even though i even though i agree like that's cool it's fun and if i did do it i do think there's all these extra benefits you'd get amazing talent to come join you you'd make a bunch of money you'd uh have a bunch of fun like there's there's great benefits if i did the big one the the big big big one but i decided that like what i wanted yeah yeah what i wanted more was more like the 40 hour a week but hours spent on doing these types of things like i love teaching teaching's not the most it's not the most like world-changing unreasonable institute style you know like let's go land a rocket on mars type of idea but i have the most fun doing it so i'm just optimizing for like a different thing rather than bigness i'm optimizing for like you know my own enjoyment and so that's why i'm not going after that so i need things that are sufficiently interesting so that i'm interested and big enough so i don't feel like i'm wasting my time but like it's not maximally big [Music] you

(27:00) How Elon deals with fear

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] i just saw if you go to brett taylor the chairman of twitter he just tweeted we've agreed to a deal with elon musk oh wow wow so i guess i think i think saying it's done is fair yeah that's fair okay um so 54 dollars a share wow so let me tell you something really quick i i i this relates this is gonna sound weird but it relates to what we're talking about so do you know how a combustible and combustible engine works that's what i look like i know how a combustible engine works no so all right here's how a combustible engine works so you've got this huge block it's called an engine block it's this big piece of metal imagine like a rectangular cube that's about two and a half feet long a foot wide and a foot deep in depth understand okay when you hear like a four cylinder six cylinder eight cylinders 12 cylinders that's how many cylinders they're going to drill into that block of that that engine block and so they you know how do you know how big a cylinder is uh well i've i've eaten pringles before so i could sort of imagine you're not far off so it's around like it's like a can of coke almost a little bit bigger but like just for the sake we'll say it's like the size of a can of coke okay and in in in in those cylinders goes a piston which is basically like you've drilled those holes and like you've got something like almost like a size of can of coke going back and forth through those holes and the way it works is you have a shaft that connects to the pistons which turns that up and down motion of the cylinders going up and down into motion that the engine can use but check this out in order to make this all work uh you have this thing called a spark plug in each cylinder and then you have this other device called a carburetor and that mixes the perfect amount of fuel and air into the cylinder and the spark plug makes a small spark and there's a miniature explosion in the cylinder that for that creates so much pressure that that's that piston is moving up and down does that all make sense okay i fall i don't know why you're telling me about this place i understand it now listen so it gets even crazier you know how you're driving and your car will say like 6 000 rpms yeah sure that means that those those pistons so these pistons they it has to be airtight for that explosion to be in that cylinder so these pistons they're super tight into that cylinder and they're it's creating a lot of friction when it says 6000 rpms that's 6 000 revolutions per minute and 6 000 means you're like driving pretty fast but not crazy fast that means those pistons are moving up and down 100 to 150 times per second wow and you have oil in your car because those pistons are rubbing against metal and it needs oil otherwise if you leave it without oil they're moving so fast it's going to fuse together and basically weld the piston to the cylinder geez okay okay the reason i'm breaking this up listen i can't wait to hear it and and because i just watched a youtube video about it and i it's still fresh in my mind that's why i had to say it you did no it sounds like you just like wait a different way i was thinking about this and that and basically and then the output of all this is like uh carbon ax so it's like a it's like a gas and there's fumes and there's oil and there's liquid there's all types of fluid and then there's a transmission which is like totally even crazier sometimes the fact that this was invented in the early 1900s and it's still the technology that we have exploited and made so good we've made this so good that these pistons can move for a million miles basically they're going to go up and down like a trillion plus times we have pushed that so far to the edge it's pretty phenomenal what we've done and it's such a shitty technology it was good for what it was and then elon musk comes along and i was like well he wasn't the first one to do it but he did a really good job of it he's like this this electric engine actually all we're gonna use is a battery and one motor that's all it takes and this motor is like just literally like three parts like there's very few parts whereas with the combustible engine there's like a thousand parts and not only is it simpler in terms of maintenance there's basically no maintenance it's far better so a really fast car i have i own a car that's considered incredibly fast and it's quite expensive and it goes zero to 16. yeah well it's considered fast it goes zero to 60 in three seconds a tesla that costs 40 grand will crush that can crush that and go so it's faster in every sense of the word it doesn't break and i kind of had one of these moments where i was like i wasn't actually high but it was like one of those high moments where you're like unfortunately you just decided to have high thoughts without you yeah i had high thoughts i was like dude we've been doing this combustible engine thing for like 130 years now and then along comes a couple people who's like no no we're gonna do this total opposite way so instead of making an engine that just like is it somehow has more cylinders or it's more smooth something we're gonna do something totally opposite and it's like levels above in terms of quality and i find that thought to be absolutely amazing and it just turns out he just bought twitter today so maybe something crazier is going to happen there i actually don't think it will but maybe but isn't that wild to think that like we can literally i don't know how many people have existed since 1910 billions and billions and billions of people we've all been doing it one way and then along comes a very small group of people let's say tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who said no no this is the way to do it and it changes everything and i find that to be amazing i i agree that is amazing a couple thoughts that came up while you were saying this first of all thank you for the engine lesson does that make sense did i 10 more man because i i know how to describe this did i explain to you do you understand how the engine works now a little bit a little bit yeah i feel like i feel like i'm at that perfect point where i feel like i know because i don't know what i don't know uh if you've ever seen the dunning-kruger effect exactly what you should know the takeaway here is that it's very very very crude you've got these like metal one metals like rubbing against each other and creating it's just messy it's smelly it's it's crude well i just did something today that reminded that what you're talking about reminds me of this which is uh i went to the doctor i went to the eye doctor i had a eye appointment and uh not because i wanted to i was like just give me my goddamn contacts and they're like nope you gotta come in it's uh that's two years old now we gotta do the whole we're gonna we're gonna do the thing where we blow puff air on your eyeball it's like oh my god what is that even for i don't know but i went in i decided to have a little bit of a different attitude so i got real curious when i went in this time i'm talking to the doctor i'm asking a bunch of questions she runs this other test on me where she takes a picture of my eye and then she shows it to me on a screen and i don't have you ever seen like the inside of an eye it's disgusting it's [ __ ] wild dude this is crazy she's like okay so like this is the nerve in the back of your eye that's what's sending all these signals your eyes just getting light from everywhere and your brain is this nervous the thing transmitting to your brain all these i these this light signals and your brain is piecing together sometimes the construction of the world yeah it's amazing looking these are all the blood vessels that's like keeping your eye alive and when you whenever i see how the body works i just sort of marvel in it i'm like i don't have to think but my liver knows how to like detoxify my body you know i don't have to think my heart will just keep beating reliably or else i'll die but like luckily it's on autopilot and um in fact it's on so much on autopilot i couldn't stop it if i wanted to and so it's like the way that the human body works is just like a true marvel and so today's my birthday and seeing that oh i forgot to tell you on air happy birthday thank you appreciate we all we talked earlier on the phone but the thing that amazes me it's like the best thing to do on your birthday is to go just like get a scan of your body and just be like wow you know the human body is like an absolutely incredible machine that just works in like the same way i don't know how an engine works i don't know how my liver works i don't know how my kidney works i don't know how my lungs work i don't know how any of this [ __ ] works but it does work and just the fact that it does is kind of amazing to me and just seeing my eyeball my retina and like the nerves the blood vessels in my eye was just a reminder of like uh it's like it's like a humble humbling feeling right it's like the humility of how you don't even have control of your own body let alone the world and all these other things that are going on so i really appreciated that that's the first thing second thing i wrote this down the other day for the podcast but i never knew how by the way are you wearing a mighty ducks jersey yeah dudes my birthday i'm feeling like a mighty duck right now oh my god that's awesome the older i get the more i need to behave like a child right like that's that's kind of the game plan is get more childlike as i grow not more adult-like so i wrote this down i wrote vocal minority mobile minority and i didn't i wrote this one like a month ago and i was like it might come up at some point the podcast and what you just said about elon about basically a very small number of people changing the way that things work is a great example of this so and it's not like he's the guy like that he was like you know we can't say that like elon came up with this we could just say that there's probably a lot of people came to the same conclusion he just was had the strongest will and is the is the is the person who we give a lot of credit to by the way have you seen what he's been saying lately about this like origin story of tesla have you seen this controversy no does he say that he's the founder no no so he so he so the what happened was tesla started about a year before elon invested in it and so now he's seen as the he's basically seen as the ceo the fountain he is the ceo he's also kind of like the founder you don't really hear about these other guys who started these two guys that were that were starting it i think and he is kind of the founder when you think about it like it's like literally the eighth largest company in the world and at the time it was worth like 10 million dollars like what's the difference exactly and so but the guys who started it have like basically just made it kind of like their mission so so the the elon there's a there's a group of people that are like anti-elon they're a vocal minority against elon and they'll say like things like elon didn't create tesla he just you know invested in it and like takes all the credit for it basically and um and that one of the original guys also really has like made it his mission to keep telling people how much he how he was the founder of tesla not not elon musk uh and elon sort of like come out recently he said something the other day in his interview he goes the biggest mistake they go what's the biggest regret you have this biggest regret you have or mistake you've made bad decision you've made he goes well certainly the worst business decision i made was um not deciding to just like start tesla on my own with me and jb like i guess the guy he started it with like guy he feels like was his co-founder in it and like basically buying the existing company and then building from there versus just doing it on his own he's like certainly that was the worst decision i think because financially that guy owns shares of what's now a trillion dollar company and then the second thing is that that guy basically has made it his crusade to be like f elon musk i'm the founder of tesla until you know how much does that guy own i don't know the exact percentage maybe maybe uh somebody john they could look it up while we're while we were talking but like but that guy basically uh there's like i think his name is there's two guys um yeah martin and somebody else and i think that's his name so they one of the things that they say is like um you know we created tesla and then elon has come out and been like tesla was nothing there was no product they were basically like it was a shell of a company there was no uh it was like you know pre-launch pre-everything i invested six and a half million dollars i think he invested in the first round knowing also that i'd have to invest way more after that took a chairman role and then like basically he had the guy from who designed spacex's logo designed the tesla branding and like you know he's like i guess he created it was a it was an inactive company it was what he what he had said um he i think he tweeted something like this out that it was like a dormant company or something like that and so there's like some controversy around that actual founding of it but yeah how is that his biggest mistake that doesn't seem like that big like it worked out fine and also one could argue maybe it was worth it just with the name yeah exactly just for the exactly just for the name i guess his take would sort of be like the company was just going to die if he didn't invest in right i think he was the only investor at that time um so anyways uh okay back to my vocal minority so there's we see this a lot on twitter and other places where there's a vocal minority this is what people call cancel culture this is what people will call like sort of the haters or the naysayers online there's a small group of people that are sort of unhappy about anything that happens and they'll they'll be unhappy that twitter's being bought by elon musk they'll be unhappy that he's a billionaire they'll be unhappy that tesla they'll say that tesla's cars yes they're electric but but what power is the electricity it's coal you know they just always have something to say so there's a vocal minority and i think one of the biggest skills in today for any business person is to correctly identify like a vocal majority versus a vocal minority if you just constantly let the vocal mind already sway your thinking you're letting like you know the bottom one or two percent of people sway your decision making just because they're very loud about it but then the the other so you i think you want to overlook them but what you don't want to overlook is what's called what i call a mobile minority so a mobile minority is a group of people who decide to actually like take their business and walk elsewhere or they take their lifestyle and they just change it so it's like you know if you're a safeway but all of a sudden there's like a small group of like sort of hippie people that are like buying this like all-natural produce right and they're shopping at this place called whole foods market in austin and that's only got one one location two locations but like all of their spend now goes to this or you see people that are like you know um you know people on netflix or whatever people who are subscribed to netflix but all of a sudden they start to instead spend all their time on tick tock and youtube and it's like they've actually voted with their feet or actually i mean even a a different non-business example i was just reading about martin luther king and rosa parks and when the whole rosa parks thing happened the black folks were like no we're uh you know we're not taking that and originally like well that only makes a certain amount of our population it's no big deal that it like goes on for like two weeks you're like all right something's happening and it's happening in san francisco right now like a mobile minority of group of people have left san francisco taken their business elsewhere it's a very small group of people some of them were loud about it saying oh i'm leaving because i have this this and this beef with san francisco most of them were just frustrated like i'm going awesome going to miami i'm going elsewhere i'm going where i will be treated better well i will be tax less and get more from my government and um and those mobile minorities are actually ones you want to listen to if whether you're a politician or you're an entrepreneur it's like we we talk about this a lot right dude there's just subreddit that's getting really popular and it's like oh yeah it's only 50 000 people but it's like wow 50 000 people have chosen this lifestyle of like you know either anti-work or over-employed or they're tracking their like fitness and their sleep at this like maniacal way it's like yeah that actually is something you really want to pay attention to and it's a great place to start a business is when you notice a mobile minority um and it's also like a really important thing to notice as a leader of either a city or a company to notice huh how come all these developers are like you know going to this weird like web 3 crypto thing like what's that about it's like yeah it's not everybody but like wow like you know 10 of our smartest people all left to go do this thing they took a pay cut to go do this thing i thought i think i should probably pay attention to that and so uh so i wanted to point this out which is ignore the vocal minority and pay extra attention to the mobile minority that doesn't mean there's another side to this it doesn't mean they're right so for example or that like what they're doing like i i i agree with you i would also challenge myself to find examples where there is that's a great what's it what's it called uh mobile minority yeah that's a good that's a good one trademark that we're trademarking that that's in my first million originals so like there's people like like for example day trading amongst young people has gotten incredibly popular i don't think the majority of people do it but i think there are a lot of people do it they're very loud and they're betting a lot and i think that's horribly stupid yeah yeah i'm not saying it's always a good thing right it might be people vaping and it's like wait a minute like 10 of teenagers are vaping now it's like i'm not saying it's always healthy but i'm saying it is almost always worth paying attention to this sort of like silent and mobile minority versus like i think it's worth paying attention to whereas i think the vocal minority is almost always worth ignoring you want to talk a few examples off the top of our head a few examples of those groups of people um well you get a couple i think i'm gonna give a few more yeah give give me give me something i'm just gonna write off a few so things that i'm noticing based off reddit and my interest um people who don't wanna buy off amazon because they don't want to have to worry about throwing away the packaging yes number two people who want to use reusable um packaging so like a ziploc bag that you'll pay 20 for one bag but you can use it over and over and over and over again number three people who don't want to eat out of plastic uh let's see number four i have another one that's related to that so my wife's vegan and so we're anything we do has to be compatible with a vegan lifestyle and you'd be shocked how much how much is uh not compatible so like okay you think about food i think food is where most people go but like leather is the other huge one right so like we're about to buy a car or uh like she wants to buy like a fancy purse or something like that she's like she is ready to go to whatever louis vuitton or whatever and drop five grand six grand whatever it is but uh she won't she won't do it because it's all leather and so she's like i can't believe these luxury companies don't make one non like non animal based product like they don't make one bag like even they would get all the v all the vegan people want to buy luxury like go to whichever brand makes it like all of the big ones gucci prada whatever and um and they just don't they don't make it or if they do they like they'll make the bag but not the not the handle or the strap and she's like well that's the thing like if you cared about this you care about this and so we see that with like car too like tesla has all like um vegan leather and they're one of the few car makers that like just lead with that it's like these little things that like again super easy to overlook i would you know i would totally understand saying look we're not gonna change our product line for this one or two percent but as that one or two percent gets big enough like it i don't know how much the sort of vegan population is now in america but like let's say it's two or three percent that's of a base of 300 million people and those are people who like they don't just kind of care about it they really care about it and so they're the they're the mobile minority and the vocal minority exactly they use they do action and they talk a lot yeah exactly so like you know you make a chocolate and make a cheese make a car leather whatever so that's an example where i've seen a lot of like wallet share go to the one brand that just cares about it what else is there so i think there's also uh when i read the tick tock comments there's so many people that when they post videos of people from the early 2000s or when i was in high school 2008 and they say oh wow look no one's on a cell phone they must be so happy so i think there's going to be a mobile minority of people who actually don't want smartphones the the disconnect digital detox population yeah there's also a group of that that's uh like vr like absolute vr nerds so uh they don't talk much in fact most of the dialogue around vr is how it's not here yet or it's not going to happen there's a small number of people that spend an absurd amount of time in vr they work in their vr like i don't know if i i think i sent you this take talk of there's a guy who says he's spending 24 7 in vr and uh he literally wakes up puts the headset on and he spends his whole day like that and he even goes to sleep in vr and then he like you know the headset falls off or whenever he sleeps it's like some some nut but close your eyes and imagine this guy yeah like the beard touches the chest hair so [Laughter] there is no line yeah we need strong borders he has a rack just for fedoras so basically like you know there's some people that are spending a lot of time there but you know i don't know if that's like a big one yet but like i'm just sort of like brainstorming off top of my head you know people who really really care about certain things and i think you'll see this with pet stuff i think you see this with like in like house stuff that's going on like if you're in the gym business right now you know the mobile minority through covet has been like home gyms like those people are never coming back once they put like thousands of dollars of gym equipment in their garage or their room you know bedroom in their house like they're not coming back into the gym industry right so it's a mobile minority they have voted with their feet and now they're going down a different path a different lifestyle yeah i think that that's a really good term i'm on board with mobile minority but what does it have to do with engines uh well no it's about like the few people that go and actually like they do something different right so like you were saying like elon and the sort of the electric car yeah yeah you know that that's a small number of people who just like took a sharp left turn and decided nope we're gonna like we're gonna get off the oil and gas system we're gonna like not have a combustible edge of car we're not gonna buy from any of these brands like we're just gonna go fully electric do you think but here's the thing i've been that i think about when i think about him and people like him is i think okay so obviously he's right so this tesla thing like it's right but it didn't seem that way all the time it seemed like the total opposite and there's moments in my life where i'm like i firmly believe that this is the future like i firmly believe that many homes are going to be bought online uh like that's an example but along the way i have so many doubts or i'm like ah screw it and so what i would like to know is i wonder how he cuz he doesn't give off that appearance like he ever has doubt he's like no no like this surely this makes sense but then he does say all the time he's like i think we're going to go bankrupt but that doesn't mean he thinks that his idea is wrong he just thinks that maybe like they're just going to run out of money because they didn't have enough runway and so do you think that someone like him or a lot of these other people like that that there is self-doubt or uh or what you move straight to the end now um if you listen to him talk he actually says three things so he says they're like how did you decide to do this no car company had ever no american car company had been made since jeep like 90 years ago or something like that uh nobody had ever made an electric car you know that was popular you know a fully electric car nobody had ever you know started a rocket company a private rocket company all this stuff and he basically just said they're like so how did you decide to do it and he's like well i agreed like the probability of success was low but it was worth doing so i just did it you know like he's basically like i thought it was worth doing humanity needs this so it's worth doing certainly probability of success is low certainly and then uh he said one other thing which was like you know did you ever think about giving up but he's like he had said and that likes free interview it is not in my nature and like i think it i think so if you take those three things like he doesn't decide to do it because he thinks it's gonna work in fact he decides to do it because he thinks it's worth doing he agreed that the probability of success was low but not impossible and he just decided that he's not going to give up that's not in his nature so you combine those three things well doubt has very little place right it's like no i've accurate i've i've taken into account the low probability of success and then i'm not going to quit so and i just already decided it's worth doing so we're in that you know doubt can't live in that home that's a two-bedroom home and doubt doesn't have a room in that in that house so so i think that's how that's the psychology i've seen not knowing the guy uh just from his interviews but i don't i'm not sure if that's the the entire reality even though he said that and here's why uh did you ever pay attention to boxing in the 90s with mike tyson sure yeah all right so mike tyson came on the boxing scene when he was 19 and he was like the man until he was like in his early-ish 30s and when he walked out of the ring uh walked out in the stadium up to the ring he was famous because he wore black shorts he wore black socks and black shoes and he would come out with no shirt on with his gloves already tight and everything and he would just as if he's just ready to roll typically that's not how they do it and he was already sweating and he didn't have a noise or sorry he didn't have a sound uh a song that he came out to he came out to a noise it was just that was the noise and it was just all his whole thing was about being frightening he's like i am i'm a tiger i'm a beast i am here to kill and yeah and he would say things like that like i'm going to take out your heart and eat it yeah and he'd be like you know you know what was the great interview where he's like he goes uh he goes i'm gonna defense is impregnable my my will is unstoppable praise be to allah he goes and he goes i'm gonna eat his heart i'm gonna eat his children he goes i'm alexander the great he ain't no alexander the great i'm alexander the great yeah like this is total bravado yeah scary guy and when he would look at you in the eye you're like this guy's gonna this guy's gonna murder him he's not just going to beat him up he's out to kill him and i would watch interviews with him now that he's older and he doesn't have to act that way anymore he goes he goes people thought i was so deadly he goes i was deadly but i was so afraid the reason i acted like that was because my the the reality was my fear was the total opposite end and i had to act that way because he was i was so afraid and i've heard a bunch of ufc fighters that i like like donald cerrone and chael son and bill go every michael bisping and they say every single time i'm backstage and i think to myself why did i do this why didn't i quit i don't want to do this i'm afraid i am so scared to do this in reality this guy i'm talking about michael bisping he's got the biggest mouth of everyone he talks the most trash and when i heard these fighters start saying this stuff i was like oh they're like you're you're you are the toughest guy on earth right now but even the toughest guy on earth is scared yeah they they go into a cage fight with another guy who's trying to kill them in their underwear in front of millions of people like and after talking mad [ __ ] right so it is one of the like you know most vulnerable positions you could put yourself into so that's why it's great to kind of like learn from them and hear their hear their uh you know their thought process i think that's true somebody had said this about elon they uh i think it was uh maybe jurviston like one there's an investor who invested in tesla and spacex um and i believe has never sold a share and never said he never plans to sell a share of any of those companies and so you know this guy's got the best returns ever because all his bets were just bad on elon and um he said like he said something like you know elon is just he goes he's a normal guy but the fear gene got removed and uh like you know in in his dna that the fear gene got removed i actually think that it's not that like nobody's that um everybody has you know fears and you know the the extent to which you are fearless is the extent to which you learn how to dance with your own fears right so like those ufc fighters they feel the fear but they learn how to cope with it and for mike it was getting into this like you know primal state of mind saying certain things and just walking to the to the thing to that sound and like that's how he was able to like dance with that fear and so i'm sure that somebody like an elon musk even though they have fears of you know failure humiliation you know three rockets blow up for spacex you know just like explode and now you're you basically put all your money in and you you have enough for one more launch and that's it you had to rush and do one more launch yeah i don't think he was sitting there you know with a resting heart rate of 46 you know i think he was feeling something at that time you could see it in the videos uh the relief when it happens but he learned to dance he learned to deal with it so i think you know that's that's the difference between people who seem you know totally brave or fearless is like they have just learned to deal with fear better than the person who lets the fear slow them down or stop them are any of your closest successful friends autistic or have aspergers sure do seem like it sometimes that's closest friends to be honest because uh yeah i like to get along i end up getting along with people a little more outgoing extroverted and easier to get along with but i've gotta you have a couple i know i've got a couple and you're friends with them as well and i've got a couple and what i've noticed i've got one in particular who i think you know i'm talking about yeah and very very very successful and he just doesn't he approaches things far more logically and i'm like well name this will never well brad i'm making up well brad this will never work he's like well why not why won't it work like you know you see on this excel spreadsheet this math adds up to where it does work like well but like who's going to believe you who's going to have faith in you how are you going to do it well why wouldn't they you know what i mean sometimes i wonder is that just a couple of my friends who are like that or if there is something and elon has studied as asperger's is there something in there where they like um where it's like you know it's supposed to be kind of like a handicap in reality it's the exact opposite it's like a superpower well i played poker for a long time and you see this with poker players too they uh some of the best poker players are some of the sort of like you know aspergery type of mannerisms you don't they're extremely intelligent but they have an emotional coolness which allows them to be rational under pressure not get as easily tilted as an emotional player would be they can play with huge sums of money and not change the way they play it's all just chips to them it's a game to them um and they also have the ability to focus for very very long periods of time longer than you know i would say the average person and so you know there's some definite superpowers if you have that you know that brain wiring which is i don't know what i'm just using these terms i don't actually have any idea what the clinical like you know definition of these terms is but i'm just i'm sort of reverse defining it as a person who has those traits the ability to have a maniacal focus the ability to stay calm and sort of uh emotionally cool despite what's going on um you know highly highly intelligent with especially with math probability and statistics and um and so they you know they're winners dude i've seen it just so many times that that is a whenever i sit down against that opponent that is the person i'm trying to stay out of pots with i'm not trying to compete against them when i go play poker all right let me let me tell you something interesting that happened to me you said you went to the doctor i went i had to get some like i bought a vehicle and i had to get it like registered you know you got to get your registered and title and all that stuff dmv stuff dude it sucks all right so this is like some people listening this is so obvious do you know that there's third parties that will do this for you i've heard about this actually some guy told me he's like yeah as like dmv sucks he's like oh dude my buddy and i opened up like a like an alt like an alternative dmv in like you know in the dc area it's amazing we do like three million dollars here i was like what dude open your own dmv like i never looked into it what is the rules all right so like i went to the dmv and like i didn't know you had to have an appointment to go and the woman working there was like hey just go to this thing called fry title or something like that and so i just looked it up on yelp and it was like 20 minutes away and i went out there and there was a line out the door but i got in and out and so basically it's a crappy building and a strip mall exactly like you'd think and uh like next to like a marshalls or something like that and you can go there to get license plates you can get their title transfer specialty plates temporary permits you can register your car there um and it basically has like a lot of the stuff that you would mostly do at a dmv you can't do some things but mostly everything that you do and the way that you get it is you do a partnership with the motor vehicle department of every single state and you got to go through this like application process that i don't think is that hard because when i was there i was talking to the owner and he was like a young he was like a 24 year old like it was like an unsophisticated smart but unsophisticated guy and he was like yeah i just applied and i was like do you guys always have a line because there's signs everywhere that says we know we uh line no new line people at four because we close at five so because so basically like i was like are you guys this busy all the time he goes constantly i'm like are you kidding me and he's like yeah and i was like well how do you guys make money he's like well we're gonna charge you like 50 to 100 right right here for this fee and i was like oh no brainer like because the the dmv here in austin i've got to wait four months or something for an appointment something crazy and it was a crazy service and i started looking into it and there's a few companies that are in the space you know dmv dot org no you know her at dmv.org it's like if you google like what paperwork do i need in order to uh uh in order to get a license in in in delaware like it'll tell you like what to bring uh so that that's out there but there's basically all these places that i've seen do this they're just like mom and pop like hole-in-the-wall stores and they are constantly packed it was crazy fascinating i did hear something which was like uh that guy that i was talking about something did end up happening or they cracked down or like they lost their thing or like once i don't know what happened but something did something bad did happen this was years ago so i don't remember but let me tell you about two other businesses that are very similar have you heard of acebel what's aceable acebel it's in texas it's you're gonna love this business so just go to like asable.com you sound like george zimmerman like you're you're gonna like the way you look i guarantee you yeah you're gonna like this business yeah you're gonna like this like i guarantee it [Laughter] men's bro house here so it's basically driver's ed online and they also do um like if you get a ticket you have to go to like corrective driving school or whatever oh my god kill it so they're like an officially licensed um like vendor for this driver's ed at these like these courses or whatever they absolutely crushed they bootstrapped for a while i think now they've raised like 100 million dollars these guys are absolutely crushing it i've seen their revenue once before back way back when i looked into this and um they started with like you know like a 32 hour driver's ed course or whatever and they could do i think they could do it in like 36 states out of that of the total or whatever and so um they said they have 13 million like people have gone through it and they also do realtors licenses which is like one of people trying to get their broker's license oh and so that's like another like this is such a this is an amazing business this is like a uh like 10 out of 10 under the radar business that just crushes it and they crush it due to like kind of like regulatory lock-in and um that they're one of like the only officially approved people that could do this they just crushed it with google ads because people would search for you know driver's ed free driver's ed online get my broker's license blah blah blah and um there wasn't a ton of competition i don't think early on and they just made a ton of money and so i i this is i'm pretty sure a billion dollar company at this point oh for sure you know just doing this this guy's name is blake who started another blake uh blake myoski the guy who started toms shoes his first business was an online driver's ed business and he said he crushed it oh wow i didn't know that that's yeah when i read his biography like give away shoes or i don't know it was one of those it was like about giving away buy a pair give a pair yeah and uh anyway this business kills it what's the other one so the other one so i was about to take a trip with my family and i was like oh we don't have like passports for the kids uh so i was like oh let me get like we don't have the birth certificates because you if you just like when a baby's born they don't give you a certificate it's like oh you want a birth certificate like you know they roll out like a candy crush map it's like do these six steps and like jump over all these hurdles to like get your kid's birth certificate so it's like you gotta like do this thing and go to the city whatever so i was like oh geez i don't want to do all that and so i just searched like get birth certificate online fast and the san francisco or whatever like the bay area you know whatever like you know the walnut creek like official birth certificate thing i was like yeah you can like either mail in this stuff or go to our partner vital check final check we'll do it and i was like oh here's another one and sure enough i see it vital if you go to vitalchek.com there's so many copycats there's yourvitalcheck.com and check is spelled c-h-e-k that's how you know these businesses crush the number of copycats that pop up so it's an official california birth certificate that you can get online um you know it's government endorsed so hundreds of government agencies nationwide exclusively trust vital checks so they've got they basically cut deals with those vendors and whatever you go on here you pay i don't know it's like whatever 99 bucks or something per birth certificate you follow this form and it's done and it's like you kind of have to do this like it's like a mandatory thing it's like a dmv thing it's like customers aren't just like choosing to go get certified they have to get certified and so that's why i love acebol that's why i love your dmv one that's why i love this vital check thing because it's super crazy you have to do it to comply and you can build these kind of like third party things and i i sent this to xavier and sieva our buddies with enduring ventures i was like dude this is a beautiful business to buy right like because they're going and trying to buy these businesses that are like just cash flowing profitable businesses that have defensibility um and can be maybe improved by like rolling up multiple or like centralizing the the back office and the the other the other like red flat not red what's whatever the opposite of a red flag is positive flag a green flag that my like red flag of like this is a killer company is going off because it's a website it's an ugly website with a lot of traffic and it doesn't say who the founder is on the about page it says we've been in business since 1992 and we do this this and this and like i can't find like a guy on twitter talking about it i'm like okay so you just so see eva got back to me he goes it looks he's like i dug in it looks like it's owned by a uk public company called the lexus nexus relics i think relics which owns lexicon it's like a multi-billion dollar it's like the most uh i believe relic is the most profitable company in the world in terms of margins so uh they they they own another the big thing they own is do you know how scientific journaling uh like publishing works basically like sure these like doctors and stuff come up with these these amazing insights and scientific journals like yeah we'll give you 500 for your article and like that's all they get paid and every university like has paid money to get access to these journals and so they make like four billion in revenue and like three billion in profit or something like that wow yeah it's a it looks like it's a 50 billion dollar a little more than a 50 billion dollar company what's the can you see what the profit like what the income is they probably have done 33 000 employees uh i can pull up i mean i can pull up it's like though i think it's one of the uh how do you spell it rel x yeah i think it's uh dude how do you know about this this is another sampard special right here just knowing that of some random british public company that owns scientific journaling companies and is the most profitable company in the world how the hell did you know that i i i confirmed that it's if it's not the most it's one of the most and i knew about it because a uh i i had friends in the in the journal uh who were like getting their phds and i was they were telling me how it works so i'm like oh that's a racket like you you don't understand but you're lucky like it's like you know dentists and stuff publishing stuff on like teeth like they don't understand like how margin works and i'm like they're paying you 500 for that you don't understand [ __ ] uh so they're just getting ripped off so i knew right away and second when we were launching the hustle i love database businesses and i researched database businesses like crazy and i came across this company because they own um they own they own lexus nexus which is which is like a total conglomerate legal records and documents they own patent site which is um it has a patent asset index of 135 million patent documents law 360 lex lex machina which is like 88 million whatever things there's just ton of database businesses in there illegal law 360 is like it's kind of like uh the hustle but for lawyers i mean of course they were first so we were like them for not lawyers but it was basically a daily newsletter for lawyers yeah elon's like me for billionaires you know the problem that i have about elon is he just rips off my style like i was using twitter way before like i was popular on twitter first yeah i do memes he does memes right like he's kind of like the poster he's impulsive but i am to podcast he is to money [Laughter] money business and innovation dating celebrities [Laughter] doesn't have a podcast though yeah dude i was thinking of uh jake paul we had jake paul on the podcast and i was like thinking about it i was like if i got into an argument with that guy he could just be like well i'm richer than you and i'd be like well i could kick your ass he's like you know i can kick your ass i'd be like oh yeah you can't he's like well i'd be like well and i'd be like well i'm famous and he would be like well i'm i'm more famous so i'm like oh you're like like everything better like every like whatever like i think of these people like i'm like oh like you are everything i do you are that but better i have nothing i could say to you in a fight like you're just gonna win this argument every single time i'm screwed so sometimes i ask myself what can i possibly say and so like that's sometimes i think about elon no that's when you have to uh swerve into the virtue signaling and be like well i'm just i don't chase money and fame yeah so yeah you're way more famous and rich yeah well i wouldn't trade lies with you you're must be invisible i i have one thing you'll never have enough and [Music] that's the moral high ground you can always take on somebody better than you he's elon's like the sam parr of but just have money [Laughter] good episode see you later [Music] you

describe your approach like okay you're starting a company from scratch i would say like it's just a question of priorities and i would say this versus priorities is building an awesome team they're recruiting like high-level people and then like really setting a cultural foundation around that so that's like the that's the non like non-poking fun way of looking at it is like that's that's their priority so what's your priority when you like start an endeavor [Music] did you see this email i sent you so i forwarded you uh and then like an investor update i got uh did you did you see that email i know from who uh well i can't say but because i was sort of like you know this person's smart they actually sold the company before which address did you send it to uh i don't know maybe you're like hustle one i don't know but just see if you see an email from me anyways i'll just explain to you you don't even need to read the email basically this is like i was like this is so different than anything i would do and i was like if if this person wasn't already successful like they did they built a cool company before this they are a smart person i've met them before but they um you know their their company updates or their investor updates are highly like um aspirational like so they haven't launched yet the team is like it's like oh the team is growing we have like i don't know i don't know how many people they have like 30 40 people now um we did our you know a second off site because remote work you know it's hard to build our bonds and on our off site we played these games and we did this mission statement thing and here's our values and then like on top of the values we're thinking about like how to build a culture that's really you know transparent collaborative and like again haven't launched yet no revenue no nothing uh but like a professional photographer but yeah have a professional photographer the update is like super robust and like again on one hand i'm like when i read this i'm just like oh no like this is this is like it's like watching a car drive off a cliff it's like this is like all the parts of a startup except for the important parts um and like i know they must be doing the important they must be building the product too it's not like they're not uh but like i would never prioritize these things in my own companies i know you're the same way where we're both a little bit like you know brash and like you know you're like no the office doesn't have cups like we use these little kids yeah like can you put your hand like this [Music] yeah like they don't call me sam hose water park or nothing like grab the hose and suck them down like if you need some i'll bring it to your desk so you don't have to waste time he's convenient the hose is 18 foot i sprung for the big one and so i know you're like me where like we do this like very bootleg company building and like you know oh like we look up and it's like oh [ __ ] we have 18 dudes okay diversity yeah okay like we're you know we're gonna change that or it's like the company culture is like oh yeah um come to my come to my house tonight i'm gonna cook for you guys i don't know what like so can you guys just stop at safeway and just buy like a bunch of chips like everybody likes chips right it's like yeah all right everyone like subscribe everybody go buy your favorite bag of chips that's what we're doing tonight like you know it's like these kind of company building at the minimum and it's like the as you go style and then i see this and i'm like either like either there's just like many play styles that's how you you can win in different ways or their way wrong or i'm way wrong i don't know what do you think about this sort of thing i think that for a very particular type of person i wouldn't be concerned about this type of email i think that you should most likely assume you are not that person um not even like you but like anyone anyone they should all they should default today or not like if you are uh you know like uh some like big swinging dick some big deal here's the analogy it's like steve jobs didn't like you know he was like a perfectionist he would like build it and then release the perfect product he wasn't trying to iterate he didn't ask consumers for feedback you know like early on early and often he was a product visionary genius okay but like to assume that you're steve jobs-ish yeah that assume that you're that is like dangerous that's a dangerous path to go down i think this is a horrible idea you and i have a friend that started a company and when they were only two people him and the business partner they hired a ceo coach so they could help with culture building and uh that's another sign but yeah i think and they would go to like retreats like for like right this type of stuff so no i think that uh this is not a good sign it's not very good at all have you um i guess like what's your describe your approach like okay you're starting a company from scratch i would say like it's just a question of priorities and i would say this person's priorities is building an awesome team they're recruiting like high-level people and then like really setting a cultural foundation around that so that's like the that's the non like non-poking fun way of looking at it is like that's that's their priority so what's your priority when you like start an endeavor so yeah i'm doing that now so like i'm gonna start getting into it and we can talk about it but i'm gonna start getting into something and i'm thinking like all right is this something that i want to build to sell or is this something that i want to run forever because that actually kind of matters on how you set up your entity um so i think about like what do i want personally what type of life do i want and how long do i want to operate this for so that's what would you do differently let's say build for bill own forever or build a sale what's the what's the core difference well if you want to pay yourself from the business as you go an llc makes sense um if you want to sell the company and you're willing to not pay yourself a little bit or you only want to pay yourself as a w-2 then you want to be a like a c corp and if you want to um i guess you could be an escort but if you want to sell your company in in five plus years and take advantage of qsbs which is ten million dollars of sac or sorry three million dollars of tax savings then you for sure want to be a c corp because you can't get that on the other two so i i would think about like that like what type of structure do i want this to be of course i have a history of getting hits so like if you don't have a history of like making money then like i wouldn't even worry about this [ __ ] you know what i mean like i've proven to myself that like if i say i'm gonna do something i follow through you know i'm not you don't want to be the nerd that just buys business cards before you even have anything done great point okay so that's like literally a company structure but um and by the way i i think i told you this i one of the kind of like tax slash uh lawyer people that's like kind of advising us they gave us a pretty great structure that gives us best of both they're like just have a c corp that owns the business assets and that's what will be eligible for qsbs down the road but then uh the c corp will pay your llc's uh you know your llc's for each you you know the co-founders uh like as a management thing and so you're gonna get you're gonna get personally paid out through your llc um and then but you still retain the long-term benefits of raising money or selling a c-corp yeah that's but is the is the stock owned by the c-corp uh yeah so the company well c-corp is the one issuing the stock it has the stock that's the stock that we want to so if you do a stock purchase and we can either we and then the llc doesn't need to own that stock yeah that's the right management company that's like savvy [ __ ] that i would have to like look into make sure i'm doing it right because there's a there's a clock you need to own it for five years additionally what you could do is you can issue shares to family members in different trusts so many many people could take advantage of the qsbs and other uh long-term capital gains things like that so i think a little bit about that stuff um and i i think like what right now i'm every business that i'm thinking of i'm think about how many employees do i need to run this and what type of employee am i going to have to hire because when you go big with some ideas you're going to hire these like smart ass ex harvard x facebook type of folks um you don't have to but you know like that like that type of thing or is this like no i could actually hire this like 60 000 a year person but where are they going to be coming from and do i actually want or not want to work with that type of person right so i think about who am i going to have to empl employ and what the business model is going to be and so how stressful will that be advertising was really stressful because we had to go out and well you're you're in it now you got to hunt every single month and that could be a that can be a bit stressful and so now i'm looking at what it's a little bit more recurring which is less stressful so i'm thinking a lot about business model i'm thinking about what type of lifestyle i want and i'm thinking about who i'd have to hire and you're thinking about these things but that's not your priority list right so like i mean like in terms of action right so that's thinking and planning cool that'll take you a couple days to be kind of noodling on that stuff in terms of how do you like that's actually the hardest action that's actually the hardest part is figuring out because that's what ben said that's figuring out what figure out what you want but in terms of the action i figure out i narrow it down to what's the one thing that can make this fail or work and so let's just say that i'm creating um uh let's say i'm creating uh hubspot let's say i'm hubspot a few years ago i'm creating hubspot so there's like a few items that could that need to work or at least i would think they need to work in order to make happen so like can i recruit engineers is probably one um do people want this um and are my engineers even capable enough to create this and so if i'm hubspot well salesforce exists so i actually think that um people can build this like it's i'm i'm able to build this product and number two i know a bunch of engineers and i'm pretty good at sales i think i can um i think i can recruit engineers so then then it's like well but do people want this so that's like the the like okay boom that's it that's the thing where it's like i have to figure that out before i move on to the next steps and so i go out and try to solve that for a company like hubspot i would actually just do tons of phone calls and i would make a judgment call based on that for this like little small copywriting thing the try copy that dot com that thing that yeah i i just no with that i just put a pre-sale on there and i got five thousand dollars of pre-sales and i've with trends we had fifty thousand dollars of pre-sales so depending on how easy the transaction is if it's a thousand dollars or less and transactional value i can probably create a landing page and pre-sell it we pre-sold this uh thousand dollar thing for trends and we're gonna charge 10 grand for it when it came out we pre-sold i think we got a hundred thousand dollars so we got a thousand dollars from 100 different people to launch it and so if it's under a thousand dollars my first step is uh selling it and giving me giving me myself one month to pull it off right yeah that's exactly right i to me i simplify it like um how do i make sure like how do i figure out do people want it step one do people want this and that's either pre-selling talking to people just kind of my own gut do people want this second thing is where will i get customers okay i think i could probably get the first 10 customers from here first hundred customers from there but like on an ongoing basis do i have like a repeatable way to get customers and if i know they answer those two questions then i just go and i don't do other things besides those two things i build the thing that they want and i give it to them and see if they want to see if they actually love it or if they just kind of like it and then i see if the way to get customers actually works and once i do those two things i don't really want to do anything else besides those two things for like a long period of time and like all the other stuff raising money company culture hiring um you know corporate structure naming branding uh packaging design all comes after yeah and you have to my opinion is not only do you have to not you have to like say i'm not going to worry about that at this point but you also have to say i'm actively actually going to avoid it so it's like i'm going to like actively not care about it you know what i mean like you have to like and you kind of have to like take that stance um and i think there's actually some products where the question is not do people want this so like there's some stuff that i'll create that i'm like well i already know people want this like i know they're gonna buy it the question is like can i even get customers to this repeatedly um and then that's actually gonna tell you a couple tactics that helped me with this yeah i wonder if you did something like this so i have learned that it's actually best to be a little bit what i'll call brutal about this okay so what do i mean by brutal about this it is very easy like when somebody hears that oh yeah you you first figure out do people want this and you try to like you know pre-sell it or offer it to them and see if they sign up for the wait list or they they pre-buy or whatever and then you figure out where am i gonna get customers repeatedly and like you test that marketing channel and like those only two things you do you say no to everything else that sounds so simple and then you like tell someone go try to build a startup and they'll do everything else besides those two things that's because that's like the embarrassing hard stuff yeah because it's the hard stuff and if they if it doesn't work the car doesn't move anywhere whereas you can do a whole bunch of other stuff and it feels like you're moving but the reality is you're not moving forward you're moving sideways and so but at least moving feels like you're moving and so people will gravitate towards those things so let me give you some examples um yesterday there was a tweet about furkan who was my my old co-founder my last startup and furcon is like you know a man of action you know a few words a lot of action and um you know like if you ever asked him like when do you think he could do this it is rare for him to not be like i should be able to ship it tonight now he only hits the tonight thing like i would say thirty percent of the time like thirty percent of the time nothing happens seventy percent of the time he gets like a crappy version that's like not ready but like he'll at 2am there will be a message from him be like here's where i left it and you know like 10 or 20 times he actually finishes the thing but he almost never says anything besides like yeah we should do that tonight um and so i learned that from him and every engineer we hired learned that from him we're like you can't give him a timeline that's not tonight he's if you say something besides tonight he's just like what the [ __ ] are you talking about so he now has this new like incubator thing uh called f dot inc what was that picture of that dude it looked sexy as hell right like he bought this ten thousand square foot or at least ten thousand square foot space in fort mason it was beautiful when everybody was leaving san francisco and uh and then remote work shut down all the offices and schools and in-person events he was like the only buyer he was like yeah i want a big space uh i'm in the middle of san francisco in the best part of san francisco so he's like you could see the water the bridge he got ten thousand square feet he's like i'm gonna put a robotics lab a hardware lab desks i'm just gonna have a bunch of engineers come make stuff here you don't have to pay me rent like just come back and it's like beautiful like it looks like he's been renovating it so it's like it started with an empty blank shell and now it's like looks awesome so does he make a story does he make money from that or is he just spending money hoping that one of the companies he he's like he's made a bunch of money and he's also just like he invests in the incubator company and the companies that are there invested a bunch of them and like those are already doing well so somebody tweeted out somebody who's working out of there they go uh one thing that furcon does around the office is if a developer spends like more than a day i think it's like if you spend more than a day on localhost which is basically just means like you're building your website project but you didn't ship it to the world like nobody else besides your laptop can access the site um if you spend more than a day he'll just start calling you localhost until you ship it here stop using your name and he'll just call you localhost because you oh you're just local host now right like you don't want people to use your products so you just all right local host you want to get lunch and like i wanted to tweet this out i knew people would take it the wrong way but like that is a style we kind of incubated at our last startup it's sort of like bully management and it's not that you're bullying people it's that you're bullying your values it's like how do i like live my values instead of just say we care about you know like building things fast it's like no if you don't build things and get it to customers you will get ridiculed here because that is not cool in our books you want cool you want respect then you got to do the thing we respect and like if you don't we're going to tease you until you do it i was giving a guy a hard time in the trends group because he posted hey so i've got six podcast episodes already recorded can someone give me an answer on which hosting platform is better and my i reply to go well that's not really the important question the important question is why did you record six with like just release one and and right and just post it it was like well by the way so i started this podcast when i started this podcast what did i do i message you on facebook i go hey i'm starting a podcast that i think you know is gonna be awesome uh you know here's the concept at that i was literally making it up as i was i made up the name made up the concept right there on the spot i knew i wanted to do a podcast generally and i go i go um you know you have this awesome audience but no audio content i'll make great audio content if you'll put in front of your audience and then i was like i'm gonna send you the first i'll send you the first episode later today there was no first episode i then go book a studio record the episode and send it to you within 24 hours in order for you to like see that i'm like being legitimate it was live like uh two weeks later right yeah i was like okay this is ready to go like here it's nobody's listening to it but it's in the store you can go listen to the podcast if you want to the guy was like we got we got six done and i'm like but that's not the question that you d like the question is why do you have six done and done none live like that's just crazy right because people default to they it's embarrassing and it's to post that [ __ ] so let me give you some other examples of this of being brutal about it uh at monkey inferno when when we were working there we would sometimes let like kind of interesting engineering guys like just hang out in our office and they would we'd just like just work from here no you don't need to pay us it's not a wework it's like the sick office we got extra space just come here and work just bring some good energy and so these guys came and they uh they were working there they had this idea that was really cool and then they were like they would always ask us questions that were like that like uh this investor is interested well you know we're thinking about raising money you know how should we think about this can you look at our debt can you do this and that i'm like and it's like hey is your guys you guys product do you have your product built like do you have users it's like it's just like those are more important than this fundraising stuff but like i get it it's flattering when an investor wants to give you money but like now that investor just took over your day like and now your day is all about that instead of like the main thing right like hey guys and whatever happens so then no so then they get they get into y combinator they're like oh we got into y combinator and we're like awesome those guys will keep you on track and then over the next six weeks it was like yo um you're nyc like what's going on what's it like to be an aussie i've never done it like heard it's awesome and they're like oh yeah the office hours are great they're bringing up this and that and we're like hey so how many users you guys got and they'd be like um and they would like they didn't know the number oh my god and me and fer khan just looked at each other like all right new rule if we ask you how many users you have how many daily active users you have you don't know the number like 10 push-ups and they're like haha we're like no we're serious about that and then they they still didn't know for two more days and they had to look up the dashboard and we're like all right bishop's not working so we took a marker and we started writing a giant zero on the like the wall behind them and we're like this is the number of users you have according to us because you don't know so we're just gonna keep putting zero here and like it's your job to like change this to be like the number of users you have every day when you come to the office you're gonna see this giant zero above your head until you change that and like again this worked and like all of a sudden they started thinking about how many users they had they wanted they didn't want that giant zero hanging over their head and i've just seen many versions of this i've heard a story about peter thiel doing this too peter thiel's values were all about like focus and so his thing was everybody at paypal when he was the ceo of paypal would have one thing that they were responsible for and the list could only be one they had one big thing to care about and if you try to talk to peter like hey peter um you know yeah the market you know the marketing stuff's going well but had this idea around this feature he would literally just leave the room if you ever tried to speak to him about the non one thing you were assigned he would just ignore you he's like oh that's not a remember we decided what's important so by definition this is not important so by definition i'm just not going to talk about non-important things i'm going to leave right like i don't know how hard i don't know how real that anecdote is because i wasn't there but like let's just say like directionally it's true um i think that that is like a really important way to like operate a young company what happened to the guys from your office they ended up getting into yc they ended up uh getting better they kind of grew but then they lost like like once the growth wasn't like instant here's my read of it they pivoted they pivoted and disbanded they're all doing different things now one guy one guy's like you know working on a different company another guy's working on a different company and the third guy i've never heard i don't know where he went and um probably found some cocaine somewhere and he had told me something once which was just like he was like you know once he was like like they were building a marketplace of supply and demand and like they the reason they we were all excited about them was because they got this huge amount of supply really quickly they just posted on reddit and like people really wanted the thing and so they started posting but the demand side was slow and he was like he's like when i he's like with the len with the supply side it felt like i stepped on a land mine i just like did one i took one step and it just blew up he goes i want the demand to feel like that too dude so on one hand i respected that on the other hand i was like dude sometimes you got to like figure out how to get no to work i don't respect that and the reason why is you know we're taught like you know people can change we can evolve and i've actually i think last year i actually made the decision i'm actually going to assume people don't change the way you are is the way you are and you're never changing and that that way of thinking how hopeful of you it's actually been amazing because like i'll meet someone and i'm just like oh you are a loser and you're always going to be a loser you say you're going to do something you don't do it you don't have big dreams you don't work hard like innocent until people yeah yours is guilty until proven 100 and then i meet someone who's just like a baller like steph smith i'm like oh well you're just a winner so just like maybe sometimes you're going to swing and miss but you're always going to swing therefore i'm on board forever with anything you do because i know exactly how you are and people never change and you're just a winner you win consistently whereas there's a bunch of other people i there's this great article it's called losers exist avoid them and it's the founder of bleacher report brian greenberg or goldberg and he writes a blog post about how he interviews people he's like yeah see i just think that losers do exist and like not everyone's a winner and i'm just gonna try really hard to avoid those types of people and his way of doing it is he would say i asked you about the bottom fourth of your resume so where you went to school so if i'm interviewing a candidate and she can't tell me like passionately about something that she studied for four years it's like oh you're just a loser like you're not into you you don't care about philosophy even though you studied that for four years you're you're uninteresting and thus are a loser but you interview this other woman and she could like passionately tell you a story about something and it's like well i don't even care about philosophy but because you entertained me like you clearly you are curious you're a winner so anyway uh my way of thinking as of late is just uh people never change my sister has a great phrase unless you guys uh people will say that people don't change they change for the worse so her default is even worse yeah this person will change over time they're going to get worse they're going to decay basically and like harden in these like bad patterns until proven otherwise um i think that's actually a pretty good way of thinking about things dude can i tell you about this last thing like this experiment i'm doing that i think relates to this which is like losers exist how to avoid them so here's my it's a good line right it's brilliant here's my my inversion of that winners exist here's how to attract them and so um i put out this thing the other day i tweeted out this i was like 50 000 thing yeah i was like yo we just made 25 grand uh like a wire just came in for milk road for 25 grand i did not think that was gonna work i want to give it all i want to give it away and i said that you know crypto has is full of speculators there's too many speculators not enough builders so if you want to build something here's the deal i will give away uh one one each which is like three thousand dollars i was like i'll give you 3000 no strings attached no equity to build whatever you want like you're you scratch your itch and um i just want to give it to builders here here's a link to apply um go and two kind of amazing things happen of how like winners exist here's how to attract them first a bunch of people who are winners were like hey great idea i'll put in money too it was just an excuse to touch base with like a bunch of these so the prize pool is more than doubled already and like now we're giving away more money to more people because people are like oh this is cool it was like the calm guy it was fur khan yeah the founder of com furcon was like we'll match it and then like there's more people but we were like hey let's just give away this first batch and then like if this is cool we're gonna like we'll do more we can just grow this into a self-sustaining like builder grant it's philanthropy but like i don't instead of charity i'd rather give to like people building [ __ ] and like i'm sorry to you know people who are like no there's people suffering out there like yes but also like this is where i want to give money to is something like this um and by the way the whole like a wire came in today that was all [ __ ] like that was just like for the story like we just i was just like i want to give away this i'm willing to give away this much money and people need to realize that lying for the sake of a story is actually okay have you remembered the book that we read uh about storytelling yes which one story were the story story worthy and he was like he's like just lie like for example if you're talking about like yeah so i was in the car at my teacher and she started flirting with me like and he was like well there's actually like three people in the back seat but like i couldn't say that because that wrote the story the thing was like uh don't lie to ad lie to omit details yeah details just omit details that don't add to the point of the story and um and so yeah but mine was like i kind of just framed it as like oh a wire just came in and because everybody's a wire could have came in oh it kind of came in and it did come in in pieces like the money did come to me somehow you received and so like so but basically i told like this came on a whim so i told you we heard that new guy safwan and i was like cephalon uh sappho is 22 i think and he's awesome and i just like having winners around me like young awesome energetic people who want to like make [ __ ] happen and i was like yo um i want more people like you around i'm not going to hire all of them but like how do i just get more like you know what those peter thiel did that thing where he like took like young people's blood and like put it in his body i wanted to do a legend yeah i want young young blood in my in my body how do i how am i gonna do that so i was like all right let me just put out a grant for builders this will attract people who a can build things b like know what one theory one eth is and like want one ether like and the three thousand dollars like mean something to them that this could like unlock like a month worth of like it's like an excuse to go build that thing right so what happened almost a thousand applications came in in a week and how long was an application it was like a form that was like you know uh who what's your i was like what's your story i was just like kind of open-ended and it was like uh what do you want to build give me the tweet pitch of it why do you want to build it um you know what's your handle what your address with your email what blah blah blah and so people wrote in and i'll share the air table with you it's kind of amazing all right so there's like a bunch of junk we shortlisted um like about 150 people out of the like close to a thousand as like strong like this person's kind of like either their story or their idea is strong and then we like kind of got to the finalists which are like these 35 people that are like okay these 35 people they all seem like kind of worthy of getting this and we're ultimately going to pick like i don't know 15 or something for the [ __ ] for this this batch of grants and um and i think doing this like this whole thing is going to take me i think maybe three days total to like of attention to pull off but what it's going to create is like just a bunch of young awesome energy young being just like not your literal age but like more like people who like psychograms somebody who yeah it's like somebody who has an idea has energy has optimism um and like doesn't think of all the reasons they shouldn't do it instead they like uh yeah [ __ ] yeah apply i'm gonna do this and so they're gonna be around me and i like i i think this is gonna be so roi positive in the long run that it's like insane dude i've done these things before and i think you did it before when you gave a business to someone right yeah and i've never had it work out like yeah it just kind of like went on the back shelf or they just kind of forgot about it yeah it could be uh and like you know that's why the main filter is like are you gonna actually do anything or are you just talking about it or like is your day job or your you know your student status whatever gonna just trump this and you never get around to like actually making [ __ ] happen that's the number one criteria here um but dude the stories are like amazing of like who writes in it's like it just reminds you of like oh wow the world is way bigger than the like the amount of people that i interact with on a day-to-day basis are you giving the money all to one person no no no there's gonna be like 15 people who get the grant and it's like a few grand each yeah all right well i'm eager to see what's happening what's gonna happen when are you gonna decide uh we'll decide like in the next five days who gets it and then we're just like setting up like we're just gonna run the whole thing you know just like a telegram group or something like that and uh and yeah we'll see what happens but guys my point is do things that create that like attract winners to you um is this which is the opposite lesson of like losers and how to avoid them that's great advice i think actually slightly less great advice is winners also exist here's how to get near them get around them get them around you and like figure out different ways to like get them around you this is one that like you know not everybody can afford to like do a grant program or whatever but like yeah but if i had no if i had no money i could have hustled and created this grant program instantaneously i could have said i could have emailed you know 50 people and been like hey will you put up a thousand dollars um for this here's all the benefits you're gonna get and you know which is how by the way i hired safwan he initially emailed me saying hey you should do a grant program here's five reasons why and i was like oh that's actually a great idea will you do all the work he said yeah i'll do all the work did you ever read uh uh san francisco's subreddit no all right so i used to go to the subreddit for san francisco all the time and there was this guy it started like five years ago he just said hey everyone and he posted a picture of himself holding a beer he goes i'm at this bar i forget it was in hey ashbury i'm at this bar come down and your first drink's on me and he just posted that and like people made fun of him and then he did it again the next week and he did this for literally like 60 weeks in a row and then he like became famous for the guy he's like oh you wanna have a good time this guy seems really nice everyone goes to talk so he's a really cool dude it'll buy your first drink whatever you can't if you do that with like building cool [ __ ] it actually works out quite well where it's like hey i'm building this thing tag along for the ride uh it tends to work well the guy does it all the time it's great it's uh he like became famous for like oh come have first drinks on me i'm down here i wonder how much he spent dude we used to do these mixers these roommate mixtures uh in san francisco and we would like only spend five hundred dollars but we were like the man like we were like the most popular people for a long time we did it every week for like two years well hey what were you doing 500 bucks went to doing what i bought everyone beer at a bar or at a bar you'd host them at a bar and i would just like hey can i get two dollar beers and i just come every week and i'll spend at least 500 and i'm like all right cool and so i was like all right here's my card stop it at 500. it was pretty sick can we turn the ship around we need to circle back business term let me tell you about a cool company that i just discovered and the guy told me to tell you hey so dude i don't know if you know i don't know if that was like he's a fan or if or if he actually knows you have you it's called uh so i i am i'm linking to it in here in the doc i'm highlighting it right now it's called um getcyberleads.com have you ever seen this no who so who's the guy uh well i don't i don't know i don't even know his name i just dm'd him on uh alex alex westco okay uh yeah i don't think i know this person he said tell sean i said hey alex west is his name i didn't know if he was saying it as like a way that he knows you must just be a fan all right let's get cyber leads the reason it's cool is it's just him and basically what it is is you pay let's see how much is it is it so you pay between 100 and a thousand dollars a month for a different a bunch of different versions but basically you every month just one time every month he sends you a thousand plus hand-picked companies that just raised a lot of money and are highly likely to go and look and look to outsource whether it's technology or design they're looking to outsource stuff and if you're an agency owner you sign up to this and every month you just get a bunch of new leads and the lead list it includes the ceo's name the ceo ceo's contact information what this person is likely to outsource where they're located how big they are and how much or how much money they just raised and the reason why this is cool is because it's so freaking simple very clear value it's just one person it's making three hundred thousand dollars a year so or sorry yeah three hundred thousand dollars a year so it's making um in march he said he did twenty he did twenty thousand dollars a month with a net profit of seventeen thousand dollars it's now gone up to like 30 000 a month but i just thought this was unique and i love these types of businesses because the value proposition is so clear if you just one of these things closes a deal it's worth it and i actually think that you could do this for a bunch of different verticals you've never seen this before no i've never ever seen this how does he do the like what they're likely to outsource is he just guessing basically so i asked him something i go are you doing this hand-picked he goes yeah every report takes me out uh a hundred dollars to do the whole leads list and he sends one email per month and if you go to the website and you click live demo uh you can basically see what he sends you it's it's just like an air table an air table table uh and you can kind of see all the information wow that's kind of cool all right this is pretty cool right yeah good for him um and i it's just him and he's like i was like can this scale he goes i think i can get a million dollars a year pretty soon and i'm not sure what i can do after that but i think just me this could get a million dollars and honestly i totally agree i think this is a beautiful business i think this is really really cool so he said okay let's just look at his march numbers all right so he said march revenue 20 000 cost 3000 a month net profit 17k profit margin 85 last march for example he was basically five times less so revenue was four thousand and now it's twenty thousand and so this is pretty good this is what basically basically one guy and a va can run this um yeah one guy and one guy and a va can run this thing and it's providing like you said it's providing clear value in the sense that like if i pay for this i'm likely to get more customers and make more money so it's like it pays for itself and like it pays for itself is actually a pretty valuable thing which is like there's a bunch of things in my businesses that i'm like uh yeah i want to do that but you know i kind of have these other priorities and i was like well i really do just need to look at all these things as like can i hire somebody and it be immediately value like you know a creative in the next six to 12 months because that job that i'm hiring them for is not to just make my life easier it's to literally generate revenue and profits and so like there is no way that if i hire this person if they are competent this has to be an roi positive thing to do and you know the only thing i need to consider is like do i have the do i ha have the bandwidth to hire this person and so um and so to me you know like that's and then there's products like that too this is a product like that where it's like yeah i paid 99 or whatever 199 a month whatever this thing costs and like if i can't make more than 199 off this like that's just my own incompetence at that point it's sick man it's really sick and so it says it says there's a thousand leads if you go to pricing for the prices range from two hundred dollars to two thousand dollars and it says let's see it says you get uh a thousand leads maybe that includes like all the past months uh it's pretty this is pretty cool by the way check out this tweet i put in the chat uh this is a good example of like content that's not like um it's like this is the easy easy mode of creating content that people resonate with so this is just a beautiful tweet all right so this guy tweeted out december 21st he goes one year again one year ago today i was fired for my job making two thousand dollars a month today i'm making six thousand a month with my own business and they post more importantly he posts a screenshot of his like calendars planner and it says fired extension point last day at work that's like on the 21st on the 22nd day one is self-employed man expectation point and it's just like you kind of root for the person and you know what's in this content it's nothing but it's like by showing the raw like planner uh and like what i wrote to myself that day like these are like these these have like an emotional impact on people and i think that's one thing that most people get wrong in content is that content is about emotion not information and something like that it generates like a feeling of like rooting for the person that is like most people i know are really smart and so they try to like outsmart everybody on content and so you don't need to outsmart everybody you need to trigger an emotional response whether it's outrage it's like compassion it's like um you know awe-inspiring whatever it is and uh this is a great simple example of how you can make somebody root for you is you know a little tweet like this this guy's a good find i think he kind of so there's this guy that for contacts for the listener there's a guy named peter lovells who i've been begging to get on the pod and he keeps like saying yes and then ghost and yeah so but anyway this guy peter lovells he's not exactly a one-man operation i think now he's got contractors but he's got like four or five different businesses they're basically all the same thing like job boards collectively doing like four million or or so in revenue and he posts like cute cool insightful content on twitter and blogs this guy alex west is kind of like in the same ballpark as that as that guy peter levels right like he's it's like cool well designed it looks like he's like a like a nomad as well uh but uh somebody needs to make the list i feel like steph smith needs to do this she needs to make the definitive list of these like solopreneur freelancer digital nomad basically like the peter levels this guy where it's like yeah this person's on some journey they're trying to get to 100k a month in like personal revenue but they have these principles like they're not trying to raise money they're not trying to build a big team they live nomadically they're like just a good enough engineer and just good enough designer and just a good enough copywriter to make it happen and they're like doing it all in public and like there's like 20 of these people that i found on twitter all of them are entertaining to me and i feel like most people just don't know who those people are and like actually like a good service would be to just aggregate them and put it in a newsletter be like hey i'm following all these people doing this thing check this out this guy posted an update about this thing and like you can just make a newsletter following their work and probably like you know build an audience of 50 to 100 000 people following you following them which is sort of you know meta do you ever read indie hackers uh i don't personally go there much but i have for sure in the past indie hackers is awesome it's started by his two guys cortland and channing um they're twins yeah i've become friends with channing over the years basically indeed it was like a forum for this weird genre of entrepreneurs called indie hackers but they sold it to stripe and i have a feeling that each brother will make in the world of 20 million dollars when stripe goes public i wouldn't be surprised if it were a little more but i can't i actually think it's above 20. they've never told me i just i'm guessing because because of when they sold to them and if they sold for a million dollars it would have gone up by like that much so anyway uh i on their website they list interviews and they list all the revenue of the companies and it's pretty amazing and you can sort by revenue and you can just find like a list of companies that basically you want to like get inspired by or copy right yeah that's cool uh and by the way just look at their traffic like their traffic shows about a million million to a million and a half monthly visitors so you know good good job by them of like this is like real scale and in fact this is probably like like for milk road i should go tell our story on indie hackers and product hunt i could probably add 10 000 new subscribers with one day of one day of like just crafting a story that goes on just posting on both of these i completely agree i've done it both times we did it for trends we made a lot of money i like it hopspot allows all our teams to work together seamlessly so no one's falling overboard unless we want them to um okay what else you got i don't know you tell me what do you got i see what another says wait i have a question all right yeah let's let me ask you i think i see this question you're about to ask me all right you ever seen those movies where they are it's about like drug lords and [ __ ] and do you find and you see just like a normal guy in a boat off the coast of florida and he finds like a brick of cocaine yeah like if you're like seeing that like premise my question to you is if you because i'm reading this book uh have you seen the movie no country for old men no um so it's like a movie i've heard of it but you know what it is that name to me sounds so boring that i will never click on that no it's not a boring one at all it's like a thriller but i'm reading the book and basically the premise is this guy like comes across a drug deal gone bad everyone's dead at the scene and there's two and a half million dollars as well as a truck full of cocaine he takes the two million dollars the drug guys look for him and that's the that's the book and my question is if i came across that cocaine what would i do and what would you do if you came across like i have no idea how cocaine is measured but like that movie scene where you come across like a hat yeah or many bricks i guess what do you what do you do with it take a picture put it on instagram be like oh my god get the social clout and get the hell out of there i am not picking up the cocaine i'm not becoming a drug dealer i'm not gonna figure out how to flip this you could also replace that with like oh i find uh you know a large supply of copper wires which have a like decent market value i don't know i've actually been down this path before once i think i talked about this on the pod where we met a guy who had this giant uh comic book card collection yes and like we had this opportunity to buy it for like probably like 10 cents on the dollar of what it was like what the individual like some of all the parts would have been but we had to like figure out like what the hell to do it's like here's a warehouse you now have the cost of this warehouse and you have all this stuff and none of it's graded and none of it's like categorized none of it's inventoried it's like you know you gotta go do that like you know american picker style like junkyard flip type thing for this stuff and when i kind of like i got excited at first because it was like it would have been a like multi-million dollar flip if we had done it how did that end it ended with me realizing this is not worth the time and energy to go do this like this is so much energy well so the story was basically you came across a guy who owned a warehouse and he used it really old guy really old guy who was like finally ready to like sell his thing he'd been collecting for 30 years like tens of millions of like baseball cards or something yeah like he had millions of cards most of which are useless but for sure some of it is valuable and like the question is like and you had to buy the whole lot you had to buy the whole like thing and then what did you do with it deal with it i think he did no nobody bought it because again nobody wants this headache and like even the discount like i was like okay let's say this is discounted you know based on our estimates this thing's discounted like 90 even at a 90 discount the like mental overhead the literal overhead and like some people out there like dude i would have done it and like you should go do it if you have no better options get you should go do this but for me i was like wow this is a lot of work so i would not i wouldn't do it in the legal case let alone the illegal case of figuring out how to flip these bricks of cocaine is kind of my answer what's your answer to that it depends what stage of life i'm in um like all right so let's take it by decade you're 20 i'm 20. and like one of these bricks if could they be worth like two million dollars let's say the whole thing is worth uh you know six million dollars if you if you you know sold it all at like street value so let's start at the end of you having all this cash let's say you have as you know we do we do move straight to the end i'm moving straight to the end assuming that i had six million dollars in cash i wouldn't even know what to do with that if you buy a if you buy a if you buy property with six million dollars in cash how can you even do that are you even allowed to do that i mean where would you keep that money yeah i don't know what you would do you'd have to like figure out how to like launder it basically to like legitimately own it or you'd have to figure out a way to like do some you know off uh off over-the-counter transaction of like gold bars or something else or do you just live a cat like a cash life forever yeah you go under the mattress you just pay for everything with tens of twenties uh this is breaking bad right this is the plot of breaking bad basically so what would i do if all right if i was 20 and i found it i i i don't even think i'm taking it i don't even know what i would do i i would not be maybe when i was 20 maybe i wouldn't be opposed to trying something but i literally would have no idea where to start where would you even start i don't know people who do i don't even know i don't know people who do cocaine i don't hang out with anybody but you're in the moment you have to make a split decision in the heat of the moment i would have bet we'll figure it no i'd have to call the cops i think i would call the police i wouldn't know what to do i wouldn't even know how to execute this yeah that okay so that's one uh if you're not gonna do in your 20s you're not going to do it in your 30s yes i don't i don't think it matters what stage of life you're in uh there is a couple other you know methods here right so like let's say you're in this what was the the old white country for old men or something like that like you know basically the guy finds the briefcase if i find that briefcase i'm taking 15 of the cash out i'm leaving the rest there because who's really going to chase me down for the 15 percent so i think i get like you know 80 you know i get like really none of the work is the easiest so i did the math so the book was set in 1979 and it was two and a half million dollars which is the equivalent of like eight million dollars today so finally eight million dollars today and this is set in el paso texas and the guy lives on a trailer like a mobile home so seven million dollars might as well be 700 million dollars it's just a world world-changing thing if i'm that guy like that's easy you just find it you get the car and you just never go back home and you just you're just gone yeah but i'm i'm what am i gonna do sleep you know with one eye open every night wondering what's gonna happen if i see that 2 million i'm taking 247 000 out no they're they're never going to they're going to not even understand why 247 we're 247 000 short and i'm living a happy calm lifestyle just as my life was but with an extra 247 000 that's my that's my move that's so funny i i don't think i could take 15 i would yeah i would definitely take the whole thing i was thinking about this the other day this came up uh i watched survivor yeah i'm like still watching you know season 48 of whatever survivor that's that's going on and and shout out to the survivor casting directors i'm i'm getting in shape so that i can go on survivor soon um but they have this new twist where they have this thing you find normally it's like survivor you go out in the wild and they have this this little prize called the immunity idol if you find this thing you're safe from the vote you won't get voted out this week so people always want that thing and they when they find it it's this joyous moment they unroll unscroll the scroll and they're like yes i found the thing but they added a twist this time which it says on the top of the scroll it says beware like this is called a beware advantage like you know there could be something good this this comes with power but also you know some drawbacks and they say you could just put this down right now and you can go on with the game as it is or if you open this you have to you know you get the power but you get the disadvantage as well you get the advantage and disadvantage 100 of the time they open up the scroll and i'm just thinking there i'm like you know the game theory here is that this is going to put me in a sticky spot they're not giving me something that's gonna give me like it's mostly great with a tiny downside it's gonna be like potentially great later with a downside today right like if i'm the game that's how i'm organizing this game but everybody picks it up and everybody opens it and i thought what are the things in life that are like this which is like you pick it up you know you shouldn't do this you know this has like drawbacks but you can't resist you just do it anyways because you know yellow and like i started thinking about like what that is in real life right like there's that with food like most junk food is that way you know pleasure now pain later um you know but what are the other areas of life you know what is the career version of this this is like that you got that really great job um but like now like you know you were thinking about maybe you wanted to start your own business or do your own thing but then you get this like you know job at mckinsey and you're tempted to take it because it has the prestige and it has the money but it also comes with a sticky trap of like this is for sure going to set you on a path for multiple years in a direction that you don't think you want to be your end goal but you do it anyways and so i'm now looking out for these what i'm calling the beware the beware advantages of life the big takeaway here though is with you wanting to go on survivor so let me tell you about something so there's this podcast called dead eyes do you know what dead eyes is no never heard of all right so years ago tom hanks was the producer of band of brothers you know it was like the tv show on hbo about world war ii and there was this one comedian who was like an extra of one of the guys who was shooting or something and tom hanks like looked at him and then whispered in the producer or whispered in his assistant's ear and said like hey hey man you gotta go uh tom hanks apparently said that he had quote dead eyes and he wanted him off the set like he just didn't like him as an extra something that probably happens all the time he just thought and so flicks yeah it wasn't working out and so this this guy created a podcast called dead eyes and the whole podcast was questioning why he got kicked off like a beta brother that same guy okay yes the whole podcast the whole premise is like he's interviewing people on band of brothers like asking like why do you think i got kicked off like what like let's talk through this dude how did you find this sounds like the most obscure of the obscure well eventually tom hanks goes on it oh my god that's amazing and he lands tom hanks and he comes on out again as a guest and he explains like what what was happening from his perspective and what we need to do with you wait hold on what was the explanation what did he say or he was just like i don't remember he yeah he was like i i don't like i'm sorry it wasn't let me see he's like hey this has haunted you for 24 years yeah he was like this i guess it just it just wasn't even like a he didn't really think about it i believe um apparently he said that like it maybe even it was like a mistake like maybe he said the wrong thing uh to the wrong person but like it was just it just dismissed him um like it wasn't even like an issue in his life and this guy has this whole podcast called dead eyes you've not heard of this it's hilarious no that's that's hilarious what were you gonna tie that in you said i should do something well so with you wanting to be on on survivor we need to like have you go through the whole process and you're likely going to get turned down at the audition but we got to like do like a whole series of episodes of you going through this process of getting on survivor and documenting it and getting off that's a great idea that's a great idea and we like what you need to do is comment get the person who does casting for survivor and act like you want them to come on as a guest and we could do it just to like humor them but like on air be like so like can shawn audition yeah i have auditioned before already so i've been rejected once uh so i already got that under my belt now oh no we gotta have them on and we'll do it like funny like you know i think i said this earlier like wouldn't it be funny if we just started kissing right now like wouldn't that be hilarious like that's gotta be it's good if i was on yeah like it's just hilarious can you imagine if i came on the survivor and if it would happen yeah is that allowed yeah would it be funny dude what is the exact line though wouldn't it be funny what would happen we just kissed right now maybe there's that there's that one and then there's the other one that gets me so bad is like you've heard have you heard this joke where it's like and then everybody started clapping no okay so basically this is it's like a recurring joke that comes in when like if you tell a story yeah like it's like when somebody tells a story and by the end of the story you're like you're sort of like wait what was the point of the story then you realized the point of the story was them saying them just saying how cool they were in a way that was like not even like the stories kind of exaggerated or not really believe it's like yeah we're at the restaurant and then this guy was choking and then like but like nobody heard him but i just saw it i was on my way to the bathroom and i just kind of like you know whatever just did the heimlich but i'd only ever watched a video and like you're like what is the story where is this going why are you telling me this and then and then you basically like it's an awkward silence at the end of the story and they're like and then they basically they realize the story didn't do it and so they have to one-up it and just say and then everybody started clapping and so it's it's this genre of stories these there and then everybody started clapping stories my verses also crack me up when i see someone get stuck in a story like that i'm like oh yes it's happening they got themselves trapped in a and then everybody started clapping story and they're about to start exaggerating because the story itself didn't hit and now they're stuck my version of that is and then i found five dollars yeah exactly dude okay so i have a crazy story like this somebody tweeted this at us they loved your orlando bloom story by the way oh that's i mean that's the one where i did i didn't want to get stuck in that that spot but that story is all true so so somebody tweeted at this this at us and they go this seems like it's up your alley and that's when you know you're winning when somebody sends you something really weird and they say i think this is up your alley and it's 100 of my alley this is my home address is in this alley and so he sent me this post and it's like a forum post and he goes what i'm doing is insane so here's what it says it goes i have a bot running 24 7 that is buying and selling for zero target profit just to just to waste the irs's manpower and money i print and send the irs all the documentation about every one of these trades in paper form so that they can't automate it or like you know just like get through my my report in an easy way he goes i will sometimes mix blank pages double print ghost print use mark use black and white i will number the pages and put them in out of order i will have people randomly scribbling drawings of dicks into the into the pages um i will send it as a whole palette of paper trades i even to send this palette i have to hire a guy with a forklift just to send it um and i want it to be in a pallet so that is maximum actually like troublesome for them and then it says like you know um is this real yeah i don't know if it's really nice it's like some forum posting goes this cost me thousands of dollars every year and i make sure to send them an invoice so that they know that i'm paying real money on top of the pallet that i've sent them um so whoever's in charge of this knows that i'm wasting the equivalence of two months of their wage on this asinine behavior on top of wasting their time and i was just like this needs to go to petty court it's like who are you why are you so troubled and like okay you know if you just wasted a little bit of your own time that's offensive to me but if you waste all of your time and money at this point it turns into respect from my point of view and like i don't know what your mission is i don't even really understand it but i i respect the mission-drivenness of this like of this initiative there's no game it's just mutually assured destruction on both parties it's like have you seen our uh south park where cartman is dressed up like steve jobs at the at the keynote and he's walking around and he goes um instead of saying thank you he just says [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you and the whole presentation is ways that they're wasting money and uh he's sitting around walking around the stage and he goes but we didn't just stop there you see we moved the couch from the left part of the room to the right part of the room and the whole presentation is just how they just reorganized the furniture in his office that quarter that was all they did with all their money and this is a good example of that [Music] you

[Music] here's my challenge each of us what's one narrative that you think actually you should be going counter to that narrative like there's a narrative that we hear as entrepreneurs as people and kind of tech and like what do you think is the like actually i don't know maybe it's this other thing instead so if anyone has one do it but otherwise i'll i'll give you one yeah go for it so mine would be um i'll give you two there's the inside crypto there's a narrative that's basically like oh there's all this innovation happening this it's like the next protocol the next token the next whatever i'm pretty sure that if you just buy three or four things like if you buy bitcoin eth um i put luna in there now just buy those three and you just chill either all of crypto is gonna work and those will work amazingly or crypto's not gonna work and no matter what you did like if those fail if those don't go up dramatically in value um crypto just didn't work and none of this [ __ ] will work and so i think actually a basically like for a while the best strategy was bitcoin and chill and now it's ethan chill i basically think it's still the same i think it's like buying two or three tokens and not even needing to know anything more just chilling on those is probably the best investment of the next like 10 to 15 years it's gonna outperform everything during that time i think so i think like going deeper down the rabbit hole and like learning more is actually gonna [ __ ] up your returns versus just buying the the main ones and just holding for for like 10 years not thinking about it that's one and then the other is i think that angel investing doesn't make much sense anymore and i say this as somebody who angel invests like the valuations are so high um that like if i think about like that same money going into like one of these sort of boring cash flow businesses is so much better for your life so if you're like an individual angel investor and you have let's say a hundred thousand dollars you know or 300 000 that you want to go put into like a basket of 20 startups it's like are you sure you shouldn't just buy like like get an sba loan and go buy like some random website that's already producing profit and that'll pay itself off in two years or less and uh and now you own this cash flowing asset like i'm pretty sure that's just going to do better dude i agree than a basket of angel investments the the the our friends who have all crushed it on angel investing you know it means they made their investments five or eight years ago and it was different it is it's outlandish at the moment so i agree with that i think for mine that i think that it's actually i think that i think that you only have a few swings in your career and a lot of people are like oh you should be patient and you've got a lot of time to do certain stuff i actually think you should try you should dedicate your 20s to getting your first significant win because after that life gets a lot harder you get a lot less energy you're a lot smarter which is actually bad you actually it's kind of good to be kind of ignorant um and not enough people i think all often times people go the other route where they go well just go join something for a little while and learn in my opinion f that your 20s dedicated to getting a win and getting even if it's relatively small and do it as fast as possible because after that life is a lot easier i'll give my what sean i was going to say give the moise quote about getting rich quick he goes why does everyone hate on getting rich quick get rich quick schemes are the best i want to get rich quick i don't want to get rich slow i got i got two real quick so i got off the phone with a friend of mine who works at facebook he told me this morning he told me that he works roughly 90 90 to 120 minutes per day on average i thought you're going to say 90 to 120 hours a week he yeah it's the best when you measure your work in minutes he's texting me he texted me today he said it was 9 12 am he said 9 12 a.m finish work for the day 12 12 minutes and so you know put us in a group chat i want him to text us every day just the time stamp of winning so that's what that's what i told him to do i said you need to create like a twitter a non account a twitter that's and so i'm gonna stay tuned do that um but i think that in your 20s like potentially go work at facebook go work at google get those high-paying jobs i think that by the way i think i think that's a good way to get a win get get you know do that for a few years while you're you know do you're doing your you're learning on the side like join a tao build a community build a newsletter do whatever you want to do it really speaks to you while you're you're not you know yeah so you're making money and you're learning what more could you ask for and then my and you know just because you gave a crypto uh one sean i think that and i spent a lot of time in nft land and web 3 land 2. i think that nfts are going to 99 freedom it it's going to be a free freedom in thing i think the the idea of selling nfts uh will be a very small thing so what what happens why why would i give away something for free or what's my incentive so what happens after it's freedom in so yeah i mean you know okay so the idea right now it's like people are selling nfts and projects for 0.05 to 0.2 let's say on average for some of these you know 10 000 pfp projects i think that um that's going to burn out at some point and i think we're starting to see it burn out a little bit and i think that you know did you see the hundred thieves drop yeah they uh what do they do exactly they did a much smaller amount so they basically first of all it was in gaming and gamers hate nfts so the fact that they did a successful gaming nft launch like obviously kudos to them but basically they won this championship and they were like okay in order to get this like collectible you can go grab it it's free we're not saying it's going to be worth anything and they got 700 000 people to collect this collectible and and there's like a trophy and then they make money on if there's value right so if it grows in value they get royalties and i think that's what you're going to see a lot of is like creators and and big communities basically doing freedom ins um even though people seem you know people today think that selling nfts is the future i don't think so right by the way i'm going to change mine to simplify it instead of starting a company buy an existing business i think that is the most overlooked obvious thing for a smart person to do is how do you take your market risk to essentially zero um you buy a business that's already working and profitable and you just say cool i'm a better operator than this person or i know about a different form of operation than they do and so i can grow this using facebook ads or i can grow this using outsourcing or i can grow this using you know code or whatever it is so you you hear almost no narrative you heard tons of narrative around the genius visionary startup start a new thing building a new project launching a new thing and like you hear like one or two examples of people buying businesses and i think that for most smart people buying a business is a far better idea than starting yeah but when you're in your 20s my pushback to that is like when you're in your let's say early 20s like do you know like you're saying that now but i think like yeah um you do need like that operational experience and that's where my point is um you got to like it's worthwhile to to just potentially take a a high-paying job and then on the side kind of like experiment and do stuff yeah that's true i'm not really limiting mine to the 20s i think i'm still making mistakes in my 30s so i'm assuming other people are too and i guess it's more like what narrative do i hear now that's easy to float along with that i'm like you know what actually i don't i don't i just think this is true and like that's the one for me which is like for most people who want to be entrepreneurial they default to starting a business and i think actually maybe it should be the opposite maybe you should default to taking on an existing business and growing it and only create a new thing if you like actually have a new invention in mind a new idea that really you can't shake in your head versus like just starting a new startup i like that because because you want to be an entrepreneur right [Music] you

[Music] okay this idea is called milo again what is it milo so milo is a company that got started back in the day that a guy who came on the pod jack abraham started yeah and what milo did was a very simple thing milo said if you if you said oh i need to go buy scotch tape it would say you would just type it it was a search engine for finding where you can go buy a specific product in person so you'd be like i want to buy uh you know whatever like um whatever philips razor or something like that you just type it in and it would be like it's in stock at this target near you so he took where you are and then it knew all the stores inventory and it just told you if the product's in stock right there and like there's like the world is moving towards e-commerce yes but there's still like a very healthy slice of people that go shop in real stores and or they want something now today and they don't want to wait for it to be delivered in in x amount of time and so this idea of milo milo got bought by ebay for like 75 million after like a couple years and then it kind of like you know like many acquisitions just sort of faded away and disappeared inside of ebay but this idea is still a great idea dude i completely agree man i tried buying something the other day like some chairs or something and i had to go to like eight different like homedepot.com tractorsupply.com lowes.com walmart.com even when you go you're seeing the generic thing you're not seeing like you're saying like does home depot carry this okay yeah now let's go to store locator type in my thing and then i have to go to each one and do that and it's like sucks i needed kids cough medicine and i was like dude i just need to know do you have kids robotics or not and then like usually like cvs or home depot or wherever they you type something in and they're like this isn't near you and it's like oh well because up here it says my zip code is like you know eight hours away when i was on vacation you don't have an easy way where it's just like searching you know what i mean uh it takes i completely agree it takes forever and i was trying to do this the other day it's a pain in the back pain in the ass i was using google shopping but it's not easy exactly and i know it's also hard to build right because you have to have like real-time inventory of physical stores yeah but that's not that hard if you go to target and ask for like a vacuum you they go to target.com and like type in like that vacuum to figure out where it is in the store right so it's in some system so you need to build like integrations with like the major backend inventory systems in order to be able to do this and you have a really strong reason why they should give you that access it's like hey dude i'm going to send you a customer like i'm going to send you foot traffic to your store like is there anything a store wants more than foot traffic to the store i don't think so so you know like to me milo is an idea and by the way this just general thing which is companies that go get that get acquired and then like kind of like dissolve in the big company just go restart those companies like three years later yeah i actually think that's a really fantastic idea that's one of so that business model i have said that i hate the advertising business model i don't entirely hate it but i do hate that when you're a publisher and you have to say stuff that you don't really want to because of an advertiser but and so i don't love that model but i love non-publishing business advertising models because it's the perfect alignment so basically with milo you have a site that gets lots of traffic and then you allow someone to pay money for a per click or a per view basis and it's very fair it's the easiest sales process i think i'm all about that right uh okay i got some more random ideas this is what you've got these these ideas by the way they're a little bit more like the the tipsy the drunk ideas the uh so this might be another drunk idea segment i might have to take a fake shot here and we might do drunk ideas because these are these are you know very very loose no these are like milo again that's all right good bad ideas are bad ideas but they're the good version like i'm giving you a good bad idea dude have you ever asked me did you ever ask that guy jack uh well he if you could we could just email him and be like is this cool was it would this work again oh no i didn't ask him yeah we should ask him we'll see what he says but also that people should know this when a founder goes into a space they can tell you a lot of things about it but they have so much scar tissue about that space that they will always tell you like nine times out of ten i should say nine times out of ten they're gonna tell you don't do it because they have trauma and like you shouldn't necessarily listen to the don't do it you should listen to all the reasons why they say don't do it and then assess are those still true or do i have a compelling reason why those are no longer true um but yeah we should we should ask them all right so here's my here's drunk idea number two all right you're um you take zoom calls right yeah get a pulse yeah what's the experience like okay let's say you had a meeting with me before the era of zoom we were meeting in person you come to my office for a meeting what's that experience like while you're waiting for that meeting in just another three minutes before the meeting what do you get so lately nothing but i recently did something where they had an ad on zoom and i thought that was intriguing no no in real life what do you get what's the best version of a real life before your meeting you show up at the building you've done this water yeah water famous new york bougie places you've been there what someone attractive greet you they ask you if you need anything to drink they give you the drink that you have a seat you look around they got art everywhere you start to feel like wow this company's pretty cool huh like yeah oh look at that they got that wall over there with all the like cool you know little handbooks yeah you know like i went to one the other day like the bathroom sign oh by the way there's another drunk idea this is coming next coming next drunk idea the bathroom sign of this thing was uh it didn't say men it said batman and they had like a cape on the guy a little bit and i was like ah these guys they like to have a good time these guys got a great sense of humor so i got all this all this information all this persuasion before i even went into the meeting which where which office is this i can't say but we um but zoom needs this zoom needs a waiting room experience this is a feature for some product manager at zoom we need a dope waiting room experience or even even it can be built off zoom right there's like whatever a trillion zoom calls a day give me a dope waiting room where i can send somebody that's connected to the zoom call and then when they're ready they can come in but before that they get a branded they get a branded experience a virtual office a virtual vibe of who they're dealing with what that person's all about and uh create a little a little website a little website space for them to uh to hang out have some fun have a drink enjoy themselves i did this call with a company i forget what they're making maybe they're making a game and i logged in and i was like a little bit early and they had like a teaser video like a one minute long teaser video and because they were the host of the zoom it automatically played and so when i got to have the meeting i was like pretty psyched up yeah i was psyched up it was awesome it was really cool and it almost felt like they were like by it i was like is this what is this new feature is this was that an ad that you paid zoom to play and they're like no they have this new feature where they allow you to show like an amp up like a video prior to the meeting starting and it was really cool but dude how about the fact that zoom has been we've been in a pandemic for three or two years and it's like the same [ __ ] over and over and over again yeah no features and the stock cut in half what's going on yeah this is not good i'm more mad about one of those than the other i'll let them figure out which one is actually bothering me and there's so many people that go to that uh landing page where it says like click here to open up zoom and it's just a blank yeah it's a blank page there's so much real estate there i get there when i've already clicked a zoom link guess what i do want to open zoom you didn't have to re-ask on similar web zoom.com gets 1.7 billion visits a month and it's the 26th most popular website in the world and that page is just this blank page i cannot believe that they can make maybe hundreds of millions of dollars a year just in like an ad yeah just like the new batman movie needs to play like a 15 second trailer to everybody today like that's what that's what needs to happen for real i do think that that's like with so much wasted space yeah i'm i'm more in the meeting room the waiting room bucket i want to you to be able to like say something about who you are by showing what you know you can decorate it you can put your little drinks there a little interactive thing you can play jenga you can do whatever you want right like make it make it cool all right so that's one idea the second one is what i teased a second ago it's called i don't have a personality give me one or i'm not funny make me funny it's a it's a store like spencer's back in the day remember spencer's or whatever i just went to a hot topic i just went to one the other day yeah it's awesome all right that's the actual joke for for me and sarah we had like a date night on friday and we're like you want to go walk around the mall and go to the food court so we did and it wasn't date night that's awesome it was awesome man it was so much fun so spencer's is still a thing yes and hot topic we went to both of them and this shirt that i've got that i'm wearing i bought it from abercrombie dude abercrombie's cool right now i believe you i believe you so my idea is it's the b2b version of spencer's so it's just [ __ ] for you to put around the office that's gonna make your office more fun and interesting i think we should workshop that name a little bit though what was your name i don't have a personality please give me one yeah maybe there's an acronym in there yeah like we want like it needs to be a word that's like botox but it's for injecting personality into your company instead of like filler into your like lips so so basically what this is botox for your company what it's going to do is it takes all the common items of a office of any office so bathroom door plaque you know the bathroom door signs the exit sign the emergency exit sign meeting room things little chash keys on the table for meetings um you know like your welcome desk sign in mat and and and like little bell you know like it's just all items like that and then it'll make you seem like the fun interesting version of your company because we just have the we take the comment and we do it uncommonly we just have this exit sign do you remember this we had this exit sign at the dojo where over the exit side someone wrote ipo because that was that was like that was the goal the goal exit was an ipo so we had an ipo sign instead of an exit sign uh it was pretty awesome but uh i completely agree yeah like this toilet paper opportunity opportunity in that toilet paper roll there's an opportunity in the bathroom mirrors there's opportunity everywhere in your office to demonstrate a little personality one time when i went to vaynermedia they had vayner branded bottles of water it was awesome and i still remember it and it stuck out have you been to a company that has a head of their own branded bottles it just no but i also i don't feel like i would have thought that was awesome why did you think that was so awesome was the label like just looking amazing or something i just it was weird i thought it was cool it was quirky it stood out it was just a bot i mean it was just a normal cheap costco bottle of water and somehow some company they probably paid a quarter per bottle and they just wrap it just had their label on it i thought it was a neat i remember when i went to twitch for the first time when we were trying to sell the company and they were like you want anything to drink you know here's the little fridge and i opened up there was a it was my first time ever seeing boxed water and so i was like boxed water fun i thought it was like their gimmick and i was like that's cool i picked it up you ever drank boxed water tastes nasty by the way doesn't taste good tastes disgusting and also you're drinking from the old school like milk carton yeah it's like drinking orange juice it's like drinking orange juice out of like a thermo like a metal thermos it just doesn't taste good it doesn't doesn't taste right and then it doesn't even look right or feel right so now i'm in this meeting trying to sell my company biggest day of my life and i'm like a toddler drinking from this like carton of water and like the thing was just getting all wet and disintegrating and i was like oh god do you have a do you like a dumpster i can go throw this away in because it doesn't trash me it's like a paper straw all right here's my next drunk idea um shawn's like [ __ ] [ __ ] them turtles i don't want to choke myself to save the turtles that's what was happening i have moved straight to the end so the the next one is i don't know what i need to call this i need a catchy name i'm going to call it um discord property managers because i can't think of a name okay so basically there's a ton of discords out there now basically this is like community managers is a job title right a lot of people have communities communities are all the rage now and there's a ton of discords especially in the crypto worlds ton of discords they're so hard to figure out that are just like noisy there's spammers and scammers and then there's new people coming in they never use discord they never use crypto this is like confusion all around i think somebody should build the best property management company for your discords just be like dude we are the best at managing discords and we will manage your discord for this flat fee and just build a brand around being an amazing property manager for your digital property for your digital spaces that's a great idea so vaynermedia we'll talk about that again when they started their whole thing was like social media is new we're like the guys you know we know how to handle it and basically most of their job titles were called community managers or early on a popular job title at their company was a community manager we basically just met will comment on everyone's comment uh you know if you're uh oreos and someone like makes a comment on about oreos we just reply and i actually think that and they got big that way i bet you vaynermedia makes 200 plus million in revenue it's a big-ass company and you do the exact same thing but now the new community or the new social is community and i think that you've got you know david spanks yeah of course it was way early he was just early dude he just if he started that like two years ago instead of seven years ago that would be like a hundred million dollar company right now and uh he was just a little too early he was early make it all the way so david spanx had this company called cmx summit it originally was a conference for community managers then it was like an online community and everything and he sold it i don't even remember who bev the big idea was like you have a you have a ceo then you have a cto they handle they are in charge of the technical part of things you have a cio they're the chief information officer cso cmo for marketing so you have all these c-suites and that his belief was that community is going to be a big part of companies and so you're going to have a cxl i think was the thing they were going for which is like a a chief community officer or some [ __ ] like that i don't know why i was x cmx i don't know what they were trying to do but like basically it was this is going to be a job title at the c-suite level and then you're going to have then like a senior community manager and then like a junior community manager like this is a whole new job function and he was right i don't know how to do it and he was totally right and totally early which is the same thing as being totally wrong and that's what sucks yeah he was totally right and totally uh early i i completely agree uh he was on that like it felt like 10 years ago yeah but i think this is a good idea it would be a pain in the butt to run an agency but i think this is an agency that could crush let me give you uh okay can i give you two ideas so there's a guy i'm gonna these are these are 100 stolen from another podcast i heard so i listen to bill simmons podcast sports podcast and bill has his buddy kevin wild or wilds something like that he comes on and he does half-baked ideas and he is he is like we need to get him on this pod because his half-baked ideas are like he does drunk ideas and he's been doing this for years and it's just a running bit he only comes on like twice a year but when he does he's got these amazing ones so can i give you yeah the two most recent ones he did and he's by the way he's amazing at pitching them he's even better than me at pitching these these drunk ideas all right so first one is called fit furniture okay fit furniture you might be wondering what is what is fit furniture i've been hearing a lot about it lately do we make the highest quality furniture no we do not do we have the best prices sure don't do we have furniture that fits through doorways you bet your ass we do because moving furniture is a requirement of furniture and all furniture is built as if everybody's home has just open walls that you could just drag these things through so fit furniture is furniture optimized to fit through the standard doorway width you know do you know uh lovesack you remember lovesack yeah of course so they're huge bean bags right yeah but their new shtick is furniture that fits through a door it's modular it's a it's a couch that you take apart and i i try so at my airbnb the way it works these guys are idiots they put a spiral staircase going up and you on the second floor and that's the only stairs and you can't carry anything up a spiral stairs so i was like i can't get a couch unless i could take it apart uh and there's this company in texas and they're the couch guys and they take apart your couch just for this problem they take the whole thing apart and they rebuild it wherever you want it and i was like all right well i can't do that so i looked at i i looked at luck because it's an airbnb i don't want a fancy couch i looked at lovesack they're interesting but it's like three grand for one of their couches or four grand for one of their couches so i ended up going with a futon because i could build a futon upstairs but uh dude it was such a pain finding a couch that could fit into certain doorways that wasn't like over five thousand dollars i completely agree if you want to pay five star prices for that college experience sam's short-term rental scotch cupboard sleep on a futon stars no we don't call it a futon because if we call it a pull-out couch because it's like crazy comfortable it's basically like a mattress that you can sit on sometimes but uh yeah i didn't i was embarrassed to call people i was embarrassed to call it a futon that's for sure that was your nickname in college right let me give you a second idea his second idea is called bulletin board material so this is for this for i think this is for you i think you are the target market for this so it's for somebody somebody who you got a little chip on your shoulder and you like it it's if that ship on your shoulder has made you who you are today there would be no hustle if there weren't any doubters dude they say they're skeptics chips on shoulders create chips and pockets exactly but what happens if you you grew up around nice people you don't have a chip on your shoulder or maybe you had that chip you sold the hustle and now everybody tells you you're so great you don't know you were so unlucky that you had a healthy father and a yeah mother who treated you well like you know like [ __ ] me right you could do anything that's such a disadvantage because i grew up in an emotional emotionally healthy household the biggest disadvantage there is the biggest with money we help solve that problem we are for the healthy middle class family who has lost their edge and what brother morgan material is is it is haters as a service and so what we do is we go and find the people oh my first people we love the podcast every day people love the podcast but guess what in some corners of the internet there's people who hate this podcast and so what haters as a service does is it compiles that information and it takes out the real toxic stuff that's gonna you know give you nightmares at night so there's some filtering and it just drips to you a little motivation every week that just reminds you that some people believe you can't do it that some people say you're not so prepared for this podcast some people say sean your camera's not working and you you know you got to get that sorted and so it just gives you that healthy dose of haterade it's like your best and we just hire a bunch of immigrant mothers who children are grown and they have some free time and they're like well you know your brother's a doctor sean you know exactly i actually know two women who could run the service single-handedly i'm not gonna name any names they can serve thousands of customers you know it's not too late to go back to school [Laughter] yeah so haters as a service uh what do you think of that idea yeah yeah yeah i'm down we'll just call it like it has it just you're just naked people all day yeah exactly uh and it's immigrant mom.com yeah yeah live like an immigrant yeah there's a reason why immigrants are always the best immigrantmentality.com um all right yeah those are those are my drunk ideas you gotta do drug ideas i feel like um i'm not creative like you all my ideas are just like legitimate money-making ideas you know [Laughter] it's hard for me to come up with bad ideas how do you do it yeah i'm like the lady gaga of ideas there are no deep hits or there's no deep tracks hits only all right that's it that's the episode [Music] you

so bankers are basically people who help people sell companies and help people buy companies and when you sell a company for like anything north probably 50 million they likely have a banker and i've been contacting bankers and my pitch to them is this hey i'm thinking about starting a company in this space you've sold a few companies in this space tell me everything about why the this company was bought as well as what the opportunities are that the buyer what they were looking for and uh maybe in five or ten years i'll let you sell my company and i've been able to line up meetings doing this and anyway genius and um i've been a part of one or two of those types of conversations and i was like oh wow these guys are like vaults filled with gold [Music] i i met a famous person this weekend um i went and saw jimmy uh is it yang or wang um the comedian uh i think jimmy oh yang or something oh yeah well it's jimmy oh i forget his last name but he's uh what was his character in silicon valley jin yang yeah and he's a comedian and he was an awesome guy and my friend is dating him bri and uh funny in person or not yeah he's awesome he was awesome like comedy and funny like you just talking to me like were you like wow this person should be a comedian if they weren't no he was just really insightful and he had like really good strong opinions and he told stories well i mean i think you could actually do it if you were to sit down and write a a bit i actually think that you have the same traits uh but no he was just a really nice thoughtful guy but he was like legit famous to where everywhere we went people would talk to him and it was pretty pretty cool to see and i imagine quite annoying for him because the people who are fans of him because he he doesn't actually talk like that you know he's american right right and but yeah well they are fans of him particularly the asian community they love him um because uh well he just like he's like representing nicely but basically they come up to like like a white guy came up to him and kind of said something a little inappropriate and it was like rooted in like the silicon valley show right and i like they think that he has an accent and things like that and that's super annoying particularly in awesome where there's tons of like white bros so i imagine that could be annoying but he was legit famous and it was kind of cool to see when you're around people who are like you know famous in their world do you how do you act do you like do you go door a treat them like a normal person in fact almost disregard their fame be nerd out about you know asking them a zillion questions about you know the show and what blah blah like you know basically to ask them all the questions they probably heard before but with enthusiasm or see something else what do you do dude so i do i i do b but i do it in a very direct way kind of like the podcasts where where it could tell that i'm like really confident but i'm asking questions up that everyone wants to know so i'm like so you're like kind of nagging them yeah yeah so it's like so what's it like here's a tiny example i've got a friend of a friend who had cancer and he lost his leg and when i first saw him i was like what's going on man um are you crushing it at pull-ups because you're lighter now like how many pounds did you lose off that leg and he like really quickly opened up because he was like oh you just got that out you got it we got it all the way it's not mixing like it's not here but you're also uh not making a huge deal out of it yeah yeah yeah and so that's like how i usually when i'm with famous people so i'm like so what's it like you're pretty famous is that cool or is it bad like just very direct and i typically find that it makes people lighten up and they and they'll and you you are making them in a sense but you're also like congratulating them and they really will just open up you're like you're better looking in person i watch the show yeah yeah you're way taller than i thought yeah you're not nearly as slight of bill as i was expecting yeah [Laughter] i don't know yeah it's like uh you know i don't care what people say i think you're great dude my brother-in-law has the best celebrity move um he see if he sees a celebrity he greets them like a long lost friend so he'll see like we saw mike tyson and he'll be like mike what's up man how you been and he'll go dap them up and be like because seeing you he'll just like keep going and they're just like do i know this guy where did i be like be like george yo how's houston ah george and then he'll like just keep going and like just he'll just make it seem like they are they're just reconnecting rather than meeting for the first time and i thought what a hack what an amazing hack because these people meet tons of people so they didn't they don't remember and so they'll automatically go with your assumption that you like sort of know each other or your equals in some way peers in some way you ever uh have you ever been to a restaurant and the owner walks around just greeting people and asking how things are of course yeah that is well i had a friend that told me he used to pick up women that way where he was just like i would approach this with the attitude like i wouldn't act like i was the owner but in my head i would act like the owner how's everybody doing here yeah and i would just and i had that energy and i was able to meet so many people with that restaurant owner energy dude that's yeah good it's a good one and so i like at hustle con when we're hosting hustle account or when you and i are hosting one of our events like you you kind of know everyone knows who you are and and so you kind of know that you have the feeling where you can just walk up to talk to anyone and they'll know what's up right you have that energy when you're trying to meet girls and it's the best dude that's so good like i'm just gonna start wearing like a small dish towel and my waist and go to restaurants and just yeah just just walk around just have a drink and just be walking around you know greeting each table making sure everything's going smoothly for them [Laughter] and you're not lying you're not telling them you assumed based on my big restaurant energy here um all right bro i got a few interesting things to run by you do you have did you have a lot left over from last time yeah i kind of did can i tell you about one yeah i don't know like business slash idea this niche that's like got my attention right now so um i did i talked about this the other day i went to that the blippi show did i tell you about this no all right so so do you know who blippi is have you ever heard of blippi i don't know what that is no all right so like remember like back there we had barney or like you know uh like pee wee herman or whatever he's like it's like it's a dude so he kind of looks like peter herman or whatever but he's more like a barney or you know um sesame street style show so basically there's a guy who went on youtube created this brand called blippi and he um he's entertaining so he'd be like oh and by the way the funny thing that he does is there's no like set he just goes into like um hey we're at the aquarium but they just go in like after 9pm it's like closed down and so it's just they have it all to themselves like hey we're here in las vegas at this rock climbing studio and so he just uses that to film his thing but he gives it a shout out at the beginning of the video the video gets like 40 million views so it's like you know it's worth it to let these guys film there and he just like goes around and he'll basically just play with toys he'd be like i'm added abandoned chuck e cheese and he'll go play with a bunch of toys and there's like music and whatever overlaid and it's the same guy i'm looking at him now it's the same guy every single time it is except for as he blew up and got famous then they switched him out with just a stunt double for a bit and so like that guy's like a substitute teacher sometimes and then sometimes blippi comes back uh but like the main guy is the main guy he wears his outfits like this blue outfit with his orange glasses he like always looks the same so anyways my daughter loved blippi we used to watch a ton of bloopy and all of a sudden we see this ad that says um blippi like the live show is coming to oakland and so we were like oh [ __ ] and so instantly my wife buys tickets for for all of us in the family we go to this thing last weekend and it's it's at the same place you did hustle con so it's at the paramount theater and it is packed like you know hustle khan was like you know sold out ish this was like sold out sold out like all even the back shitty seat is like sold out and it's full of parents and their kids and then there's this like this they basically just created like a little play like a little mini musical one hour because kids don't have that long of an attention span and it's just kind of like music and like you know lights and colors and he's oh dinosaurs oh rocks oh how much should it cost so every ticket i want to say was that venue's seats maybe like 60 bucks a seat something like that so that's been used seats between 2500 and 3000 i believe yeah so i think there was 2 000 there um and i believe the tickets were something like um something like 50 60 70 bucks something like that so we're in like a hundred and twenty thousand and he played four shows in a row um that weekend and then he went to the next city so it was our like no he had done eight shows or he was doing something like that so it was like some crazy like thing where i was like oh wow this weekend they made whatever 800 grand um and yeah the tickets tickets basically range from like you know 60 bucks to 90 bucks and um and the place is lit by the way so like you know he comes on stage kids go crazy he's like you know he'd be like you know what does the bubble do and everyone's like pop and he's like when i say pop can you say pop and like so it's like not like a quiet show like because kids are loud anyways so some kids just not paying attention like my daughter during intermission was like i want to watch blippi on youtube and so we like had to open up youtube on our phone and give it to her during intermission because she couldn't like go five minutes without stimulation and so it's and then they have like the merch and the like the concessions they have like all that [ __ ] right so it's like pretty dope actually and i was like wow this is kind of genius they just took youtube ip and this is this guy who was there was not blippi the guy on stage was just some you know theater kid who like didn't make it you know and it's like all right plan b i'll be i'll be blippi and um and so it was like they took the ip but they made their own show out of it and so i started looking into this and there's a company that does this called vstar entertainment awesome so vstar what they do is they go license these kids brands and then they put on kids broadway basically and they tour around the country awesome and so uh and blippi's just a guy with a guitar right or were there more tournaments no guitar he's just just him he just watched so were there any instruments or was it just like a soundtrack just soundtrack and like lights and like uh stage props so yeah so he he always kind of like like you know if they came out as sharks like a bunch of like little backup dancers came out as sharks and then they whatever like that's an awesome mini theater show right and so v star entertainment they do another brand that you've probably heard of call or you may have heard of called paw patrol it's basically another kid's cartoon so guess how much this is my like kind of triangulation guess how much they sold in paw patrol tickets last year just take a take a guess 20 20 mil 40 million dollars 40 million dollars in event tickets in event tickets for and that's just the tickets not the murder that was just last year and 22. uh i don't know it's like this is like the just before coveted numbers so like 2019 2020 something like that wow so they got bought by cirque du soleil so first so the back story is some guy decides oh you know what like he's watching sesame street he's like sesame street should do a live show and he goes and he basically raises 500 grand from this guy he mortgages his house gets an extra 25 grand out of his home equity so he's got 525 thousand dollars he goes and he gets the license to sesame street he started with the sesame street show and then muppets and like you know but that must have been years ago this was like 1980 something like that yeah and then um this other guy was doing it they merged and then that whole thing gets bought by cirque du soleil last year is it cirque du soleil by the way like guess how much cirque du soleil revenue was have you ever read a cirque show no i've not but i do know that the guy who started it uh is a canadian guy he's a billionaire i read dan blizzarian's book and they talk about that guy a lot i think he's like i mean he started a circus so he's like or yeah he's really eccentric and wild and everything so it made him a billionaire how much revenue does it make um ben have you been to a cirque du soleil show cirque du soleil did a billion does a billion dollars a year in revenue which is insane 10 a five or ten percent of all las vegas tourists go to a cirque show when they're in town is that what what's that cirque is that the is that they have like 10 shows right it'll be like they have oh and then they have zoomanity they have like whatever and the beatles yeah i know all about it and i'm i'm into it and it's publicly traded or at least it was before it was acquired by private equity right private equity owns it now and um and it's a pretty badass business the idea was do a circus but no animals so it was like only human performers and to do that they did like crazy acrobats and like great costumes it's basically its own genre at this point though right and so he built that thing into a real juggernaut and so cirque then bought blue man group and v star entertainment and so they got blue man which is like an ad they what they had said was like we do 10 million in ticket sales a year for cirque du soleil blue man adds another 2 million and then um and then v star adds another 2 million but they're all like different ticket prices but like they do 14 million in tickets uh sold per year and so this this like live entertainment thing really has caught my attention because i think as the world moves more and more digital the the like the demand for like these one-off experiences like hey let's get out of the house and go do something i think it's just gonna keep going up music festivals that's a winner and then there's like uh i think plays and musicals are gonna be a winner i think they're gonna be bigger than they were before even though the world was digital and in fact because the world moves digital what do you think about all this i 100 agree and so earlier today i sent you a notion doc of some of my notes on i'm interested in peer businesses which is basically like you pay money and you're part of a club and you meet up with them and i i can't talk too much about what the names of the companies were but they were doing like uh one of them does a hundred million a year in profit and it's basically two or three meetups a year and there's executives paying fifty thousand dollars a year to be part of them and i think actually these are gonna completely boom i think conferences right now are interesting but those are really hard this actually seems way easier to pull off um all types of meetups airbnbs i'm 100 on board that i think that in person is is the move yeah i and i think that so then i started thinking like what are the other opportunities and so i think a you could just like go compete with these guys on like either the same brands or other brands so like what they did was the v-star guy took tv ip turned it into a live show the blippi guy is doing is taking youtube ip and turning it into a live show and i think you could just even do this for more so like i think you could even do like we've talked about religion which is the greatest free ip in the world so i think somebody could do this for religion which would make it extremely kid-friendly in fact kid-focused like christianity show basically i think you could do this for dinosaurs or science as a generic genre because like if kids love trucks and dinosaurs or whatever and you could just basically create the like the show you know day with dinosaurs or something like that and once you get like if you have a certain level of quality moms will spread this and they will talk about it and they will like in their mommy groups they will help you sell these tickets and um and i just feel like there's a like it's not that hard like you build one show and you sell that one show a thousand times right like the show goes on tour mamma mia has made like i don't know some stupid amount of money just being the same show on tour with replacing the the low-cost actor yeah anytime i'm trying while we're talking i'm trying to find the numbers so we used to so we did events but we would do like these this thing called hustle con which was like our big one where like thousands of people would come but then we do this thing called 2x and 2x was basically from like 7 p.m to like 10 p.m and it was basically we got 15 or 10 women all who were in tekken business not that many of them were like well known but they would have 10 minutes to like tell a story and we would charge like 25 but then we would get tens of thousands of dollars in sponsors but we got to the point where we could pull this off like kind of like almost weekly in other cities and when we started doing this the hustle wasn't that popular but we were making like i think like 30 grand a night when we were doing it and we had one employee running it right and she would use a team of contractors and then we wouldn't supply anything like i think we had free wine but i don't know i don't even think it was free i like we wouldn't supply anything but then we have corporate sponsors and we crushed it and in my head i'm like i can always fall back on this to make a living because it was so much easier than people thought right [Laughter] yeah that's pretty good for a tech bro um a tech bro business like all of you you you were running one of the best like women's entrepreneurship events yeah because you got labeled wrong dude yeah they're i'm like an onion man there's layers so but basically like we used to do this thing called pizza and 40s where we would do a meet up and i would interview someone and they would drink a 40 ounce and when the 40-ounce beer was done the talk was done but then like women were like this is like there's all dudes here and so we created like a like a wine version and that had like way better it was like like cheese and wine i don't even remember but that had way better engagement and so we're like oh like let's pursue this vein like this there's clearly an opportunity here until we created 2x which uh comes it's like 2x chromosomes which i thought was clever i stole it from reddit uh but anyway we would do i think we did 10 or 12 uh in one year and every single time it was like 20 and 30 grand and the cost the cost was nothing the cost was renting the venue which cost like three thousand dollars and we would make like 20 grand but you also you had readers in every city right so that's how you sold the tickets is that yeah yeah but we weren't basically the speakers sold the tickets the reason why we had 15 speakers was was i was like i bet each 15 will get 25 people to come plus our like a little bit of our engine like this is easy and you weren't making the money off the tickets you're making enough sponsors really anyway the tickets the business model was the tickets paid for the event and then the conference was all or the sponsors were all the profit but when it's there's two things going on one like women so whenever you have like an underserved community like sponsors definitely are willing to pay more and two it was like a b2b component so it wasn't kid's component which i think would alter the economics but my point of it is that i think that it was far easier than people thought and it was way more rudimentary and raw than people thought and it worked we just used splash that i think if you google like 2x the hustle you'll like see like the splash that is basically eventbrite it was nothing special and it freaking worked that's dope um all right what else we got um all right uh let me uh i just got kicked out of the document all right i got it so one thing tell me what you what you think about this one thing that i've been doing as i'm now starting to like get back into the game uh or thinking about it so i've been setting up calls with bankers so bankers which i didn't even know what those were bankers when someone wouldn't like sarah my wife went to japan yeah and she would like i would always make her friends were like yeah like i uh you know i'm a banker i work at a bank i'm like oh which branch uh and so bankers are basically people who help people sell companies and help people buy companies and when you sell a company for like anything north of probably 50 million they likely have a banker and i've been contacting bankers and my pitch to them is this hey i'm thinking about starting a company in this space you've sold a few companies in this space tell me everything about why the this company was bought as well as what the opportunities are that the buyer what they were looking for and uh maybe in five or ten years i'll let you sell my company and i've been able to line up meetings doing this and it's genius and um i've been a part of one or two of those types of conversations and i was like oh wow these guys are like vaults filled with gold so much bankers need podcasts like why are they why are these guys not talking well they can't so much info no but they talk like generally speaking they don't they can't talk about any specific deal but like they know a lot dude and they actually know everything it's like you're you're accountant it's like accountants you know everything yeah they know everything and they've been telling me so much information so i like they'll like basically they'll say here's why this company was doing well here's why it was succeeding here's why they bought it and i'm like all right great what uh what other companies was that buyer trying to buy and why and they're like well they always struggled with blank and i'm like boom thank you and then i'll say like um you sold three businesses in the same space which one was more fun to run and so like for example i'll give you i'll give you a concrete example the business that i'm interested in now we've talked about a bunch it's like a vistage so which is basically a peer group so companies that it's like a group of 10 or 40 people who all have a similar job title and they meet together and they discuss their problems and it's like a safe space to discuss [ __ ] you can't talk about the internet and some of them do huge one of them i can't say which does over 100 million in profit a year and they're just like meetups in real life and i'll just be like well what job titles was uh gartner or whoever buys these companies what job titles are they trying to get to and they're really struggling to uh to reach and they'll just tell me i'm like oh great i can create a community around that and i think i could build it to sell it which what i want to know from your perspective is that even a good plan building to sell so part of me is like yes it's clear path to make money another part is like it's kind of lame though yeah well i think where you're at now let's take three three options build to sell that which is basically optimizing for like oh is there a sort of like a flip is there a is there a buyer on the other side of a business like this another one is build to win which is basically like um for example when i talk to these bankers what i'm trying to figure out is what which of these businesses is like not a special snowflake where it's like oh that's actually like a rinse and repeatable model like i didn't like that founder didn't like catch lightning in a bottle at the perfect time and it's their perfect background and they got really lucky about this one thing it's like oh those i don't want to emulate i want to emulate the one where it's like hey i think somebody could start that same business today and do equally well or do do just as well in this one adjacent space and like you don't need to be a genius uh with that and so that's the second part of it which is like build to win it's like optimizing for something that's going to work and then there's the last one which is sort of like you know build for fun or build for mission which is like go for something that like you something you would never want to sell that you're willing to do even if it's low likelihood of success i think we all know the answer is to do that bucket right like i think the question is like how many how much security do you need before you go do the thing you know you should do well or it could be a combination of authoring like it could be like you enjoy winning or you enjoy this space and you want to make it successful but there's a great clip from you and uh what's uh free what's what's uh all in david freeburg there's a great clip that i shared that you and him had where he basically said that founders always sell themselves short and they go for these small ideas because because they think it's more reasonable but when doing that they kind of screw themselves because it's actually easier sometimes to do much of grander bigger ideas because that attracts the crazy types of people who you want to work with um you're interested in competitive not every joe is going to try to you know do it like you know going and trying to you know start a railroad business or whatever versus an fba business it's like well they're both going to take all your time so that's equal money well you're gonna go have to go raise money from investors one will let you just raise you're still gonna get the money you need from investors just one you maybe raise more at a higher valuation and the other one you'll raise less at a lower valuation right like but did you agree do you agree with him i i do agree with him and i've thought this for a very long time i remember uh back in the day did you ever hear about this thing called the unreasonable institute i don't even think this is around anymore that's a great name it's sort of like the same guys who did summit it's not it's not actually the same guys but it's the same it was like the same idea it was like right the unreasonable institute was basically this like it was based on this one word unreasonable in the way that the hustle is built on this one word hustle and uh trans is built on one word trends and so the unreason was it was exactly that it was like it's going to take unreasonable people to do unreasonable things for the world to move forward and it was like very inspiring and then they met with all a bunch of people a bunch of people who did that the sort of elon musk types who went and did unreasonable things and then you start to look at it and you're like you know all things equal um you know i guess like your inputs are sort of the same it's just your time and energy and then like the outputs can be very very different because the inputs aren't the same because it is possible to build something pretty cool and not work that hard but it's kind of impossible to build something huge and not work very hard all right who do we know and let's do real examples i'm not saying it's not true but who do we know that's building successful awesome businesses without working too hard well how about suli i actually don't know what's his schedule does he grind constantly he works hard yes he works hard so then no one you don't we don't know anyone but you and me like maybe i'll give you one nuance on it he got there faster than the normal person so like it looked like it came easier but that's just because he was better it wasn't because he worked like he he wasn't putting in a tenth of the hours he was putting in the same number of hours and getting there ten times faster which is i just think that like there's a world where you have business a and it doesn't grow nearly as fast and you're working 40 hours a week and then you have business b that's growing significantly faster and you have to work 100 hours a week like that that is a reality yes that's true that's what i'm talking about i'm not talking about like very little i'm talking about normal versus not normal there's also things like this podcast or like people who have like newsletters or blogs or something like that where it's like or they teach a course it's like you know like unless you take your buddy neville right so neville i don't think you and me well because but i'm doing multiple things right so it's like on each one i'm not putting in as much time but like overall i'm working harder and if i didn't do those other things that one thing would just expand in time i would just do more i would say wait how often are you working now a day normal work hours uh not normal hours but i work like a the equivalent of eight hours a day got it just not all to it not not all continuously all right but back to what was the original point so my my point was like uh is it is this really true that you can kind of like chill and win and like no i i didn't mean to say i mean chill less or sorry chill more work less okay wait so then bro if you agree with friedberg which i think i do why are you not going after like one big grand thing like i started a newsletter that's not exactly like you know that's not like world changing entirely it's neat but i would put it on a six out of ten in terms of like maybe a five in terms of like big ideas right yeah i i agree with you the reason why is because to me it's not a bigness contest it's a do i have a clear picture of what i want like my life to be and then can i like do i have a crystal clear picture and then can i make that happen and it's like knowing what i want and then getting what i want and so what i wanted was not to work the hundred hours right even though i even though i agree like that's cool it's fun and if i did do it um i do think there's all these extra benefits you'd get amazing talent to come join you you'd make a bunch of money you'd uh have a bunch of fun like there's there's great benefits if i did the big one the the big big big one but i decided that like what i wanted yeah yeah what i wanted more was more like the 40 hour a week but hours spent on doing these types of things like i love teaching teaching's not the most it's not the most like world-changing unreasonable institute style you know like let's go land a rocket on mars type of idea but i have the most fun doing it so i'm just optimizing for like a different thing rather than bigness i'm optimizing for like you know my own enjoyment and so that's why i'm not going after that so i need things that are sufficiently interesting so that i'm interested and big enough so i don't feel like i'm wasting my time but like it's not maximally big right i feel you well to wrap up the bank thing i think it's it was it's been kind of interesting i'm going to continue doing it maybe i'll uh uh i didn't ask these people who i spoke with today if i could talk about what we discussed so i'm not going to bring it up but uh very useful i sent you the notes they were cool they're great and also this technique um whether it's a specific technique or a similar technique it's like there are people who just know a lot of things um you know people who invest other people's money uh accountants bankers people like um you know vcs are like this they see they see hundreds and hundreds of businesses a year and so it's like those people if you want to like speed dial your learning you can go to them and you can get basically free learning off of off of them alright that's it that's the episode [Music] you

[Music] all right um what's going on well besides massive technical difficulties nothing i'm good all right recording on one airpod today because we're having mic problems yeah there's no you know that's a man's last stand when he's down to his last airpod it's like remember the alamo is what's going on right now in my ears i'm out here at marathon ranch my ranch what does this angle here this looks good right that looks good and i really like how much you're trying to brand this as marathon ranch rather than just be like i'm at my house by my ranch my ranch house i have so if people like this they can go to marathonranch.com it's not set up now but i'll do it well uh if you go to marathon ranch it'll auto direct to the airbnb listing i got my first guest uh they left the other day did you like spruce it up for them and like kind of give them the five-star treatment i didn't but someone did yeah oh okay all right um do you want to can i get into a story that interests me a ton and i think uh you might know more information about it than is public but um but maybe not okay go for it all right so i gotta give a shout out to haley at rock health i saw this on her twitter so there it's about this company called you biome which you probably know a little bit about it at a high level because it was in the press for uh kind of being like a theranos type of thing but i actually learned a little bit more information about it and this story is way underplayed so check this out you biome was founded by this woman named jessica rickman and zac opti who the founders and so basically what it was was they measured different parts of your body and to tell you all about your gut and your biome and things like that in other words they basically measured your poop so you poop at home i think you could swab your vagina you could poop and then maybe swab your cheek and then you mail it in and it tells you all about your which one did you choose that's funny that's the worst 105 but i still got it so uh so anyway you uh you could swap whatever you wanted and they would you mail it in and it tells you all about your biome which i'm not sure what that tells you but it's supposed to be really important and so when they kicked things off they did a crown crowd funding campaign they raised three 300 thousand dollars they also were backed by yc which is a big deal and then they raised over 100 million dollars from a bunch of people including andreessen horowitz so tier one investors this woman who started it jessica she's this young woman in the tech space in the tech uh medical space and she's under 30 so she wins forbes 30 under 30. you see her all over conferences if you google her name some of the first pictures of course you're going to see her on the ted stage speaking at conferences whatever but once they get a little bit of pop once they start getting a little bit popular people start saying like you know is this really right and so the first thing is a lot of people are like a lot of people in the uh in the space the experts they say something like you know the way they're tracking and storing your data it's like it's a pretty big deal that we know all about your your gut health there's a lot of like identifying information there and the way you're storing that that's not really good second of all we've been trying to crack this whole thing where you can just swab your cheek or your poop or whatever and mail it in and get all these results we've been trying to do that and it's really challenging and i don't know how you guys are doing it and then about two years after they started i think they started the company in like 2016 16 ish 2015 but 2017's when they got this press around 2017 this article comes out turns out she completely lied about her age so jessica so if you scroll down sean in the document i have her picture that she actually had in forbes what does what does she look like to you [Music] uh i would have said like mid-thirties okay thirty-three four thirty-five something like that in that picture she's like 42 and so when she won the forbes 30 under 30 she was actually 42 which is which is crazy and so people start once people find out about that they realize that look what else is there a lot what else are they lying about and so turns out that they were billing patients without their consent meaning doctors would order this after you buy them would pressure doctors into ordering these kits and then they would charge the doctor which would pay them three thousand dollars and then they would do like a recurring thing so they kept charging the doctors which then medicare medicaid whatever it is they were one footing the bill and so in 2019 this is where you probably know the story a little bit in 2019 the fbi raided their offices and basically weeks later the whole company shuts down and she goes to court and there's a 33-page indictment that says the founders uh committed tons of federal crimes including conspiracy to commit securities fraud fraud conspiracy to commit health care fraud and money laundering because by the way at this point they had taken 12 million dollars of shares the two founders off the table so that went straight to their pocket of the hundreds of millions of dollars that they raised and so they go to uh trial they're guilty so they go to jail right definitely not turns out jessica marries her co-founder who's a german national he's a german citizen and they flee to germany and at this point people can't really find out where they are and because of the way that the law works they it's not really easy to extradite them back to america and so as of now they basically have gotten away with it you know reputation's ruined but they're not going to i think they face up to 95 years in prison they're they're and they've totally gotten away with it and this story until i saw this tweet i remembered it but it's totally been downplayed and this woman and her partner are totally they totally have gotten away with it so far yeah they're at like oktoberfest right now uh having a great time well you know there's some guy in jail listening to this podcast and he's like you know there for for 15 years he sold like 1.1 grams of weed and he's like and he's like making blind in his toilet exactly god making toilet wine he's sitting in jail right now serving you know a double life sentence and these guys are at oktoberfest right now after defrauding the public the patients the medical system and then running away from the country right that's that's pretty much what happened here it's a pretty crazy story and i remember when this happened i knew somebody who was working there and then it was or somebody who i think he had worked there and he was like this ain't right he kind of left really quickly and then i remember because their their offices i think in san francisco and it just got raided and shut down like all in one day and this was like kind of like a hyped startup that was like a yc backed biotech you know gonna save lives type of startup and then all of a sudden poof gone yeah and we didn't talk about it you know it kind of disappeared for the last two years the pandemic but i was researching it and it's just pretty amazing and then there's this other part which is the lawyers who are representing them america is like hey you guys you guys got to come back here and they're saying she can't travel because of some unnamed health condition so they like got all these excuses as to why they can't come back to america and as of now [ __ ] yeah yeah i think i wonder if you could find that out in her poop as of now like they're they're they're they've won wow that's a that's kind of amazing you know pretty good timing for them but this whole pandemic thing you know and then there knows there's just like higher profile frauds that like came out shortly after like the one we were talking about but the crypto like money laundering husband and wife yeah you knew you had met they're like the just like the flashier version of these guys yeah somehow this happened it's it's kind of i i i've been going down a rabbit hole of these recently so i watched this documentary on netflix the other day have you seen this it's called um don't tell the truth or someone's telling the truth or trust no no trust no one i think this is called is it like change do you see this on netflix but there's like one on enron and there's one on other things or is this just on crypto no no no this is like just their movie you got it so basically this is a crazy story dude check this out great movie by the way if you want to watch the movie you probably want to skip some of this because it's spoiler but like i'm just gonna say it because i'm not gonna like you know save this movie forever else all right so basically back in like 2013 14 15 this this guy in canada creates a like bitcoin he's like interested in bitcoin bitcoin was like pretty kind of like green at the time it had it's like first run-up where it like hit a thousand dollars and stuff like that and this guy creates an exchange in canada he's like oh it's really hard to buy cryptocurrency in canada so it creates this exchange called quadriga quadriga cx and so quadriga becomes the largest exchange in canada and there's this one the guy's like then pull us pull this guy up on on the screen chair thinks that sam could see it but basically he's like this blond-haired kind of like just nerdy looking guy and in fact he does these interviews and they're like are we talking to the next mark zuckerberg and he's like ha ha well you know i don't know about that but we do want to make positive impact in the world and um and you know so he's just a soft-spoken nerdy guy and he's the founder of this thing and it's whatever bitcoin keeps growing and and uh in value then like other currencies come out yeah this is the guy yeah dude he looks like butters from south park and he talks like him too according to your impression my impression by the way sounds nothing like the guy that was uh you know i just made one up there so he anyway so all of a sudden one day people go to quadriga.com or whatever this website is gone it's just like a 404 page oh quadriga must be down is it just me you know it seems like everyone's having this issue all right is it just down or is it gone the website is gone where is where does the website go where'd the exchange go where is my money and all of a sudden people realize that all of the customer funds are gone 215 million dollars of crypto is like not accounted for and this is before the run-up right now this would be like billions of dollars worth of of that same crypto but at the time this is you know 20 whatever 16 17 18 something like that um your crypto wasn't as uh you know bitcoin was you know much much lower back then and so everyone's like what the hell happened then news comes out the founder of quadriga died suddenly on a trip in india and he had the private keys to the crypto and like he died and no one else knew the keys and the crypto is now inaccessible i remember this happened maybe three years ago right and so yeah exactly so people are like what the [ __ ] and so a bunch of customers are like dude i had ten thousand dollars i had a hundred thousand dollars i had a million dollars there and people are pissed so they get in a telegram group and they're like oh my god like i hope they're gonna be able to recover this and that kind of like a day goes by and nothing comes out and like the wife's estate that is the wife post on facebook like um you know my husband has died suddenly on this trip to india um you know unfortunately like we lost the keys and it's like jennifer robertson the the executor of the estate or something like that that was his wife that's how she signed it and people were like that's really weird message like he died a month ago and they just posted this now and like where the [ __ ] the money and like really this this like the number one exchange in canada it was just one guy had all the private keys like that seems so weird and um so they start to say like how do we know he's dead how did we know he didn't just pull off what's called an exit scam encryption roll up that body yeah exactly and so literally that's what they do so they get in a telegram group together all these customers they start basically crowd sourcing the investigation first they report to the authorities authorities do nothing they're just like hey you know we can't really yeah cryptocurrency has all kinds of risks where was he buried so he's and he dies in india and they basically they do come back and have a funeral here and they're like what's the they're so they're like hey was anybody at the funeral blah blah then they like they get in touch with like what the wife's like sister they're like was the funeral uh was the casket open or closed they're like closed casket and they're like ah and then like so that people just start getting like in what what was he what did he die from uh he died from crohn's disease they were like oh he a sudden uh gastro you know complication uh from somebody with crohn's disease and people like dude i'm looking this up you don't die of crohn's disease like it's very very rare to just suddenly die did they call the hospital where he went to so then so they're contacting the local journalists they send somebody out to india they go find this it's like a needle in a haystack like oh is there a white man who had like diarrhea in india it's like yeah all white people in india have diarrhea dude like you know how you're gonna find this guy everyone gets number three when they go there exactly it's gotta die to number three and so they but they eventually find the doctor they go to the doctor and they're like hey do you we heard there's a there's a death certificate for somebody who who died here but like there's a so they're like there is a death certificate okay so we think he died then people like you you can fake death certificates like you can pay there's a black market for death certificates and so they're like talking about that then they're like all right they go find the doctor they ask the doctor the doctor's like yes i remember it guy came in was having like you know upset stomach we kept a mirror overnight for fluids and then he suddenly like had a heart attack and died like kind of like he you know he suddenly got much worse and he died and they were like okay was there an autopsy he's like no there was no autopsy done very that's weird why was there no autopsy done and like so there's there's still like a question mark but you know the journalist comes back says it look does there's no reason to believe that he's not dead uh like you know this is what happened and so there's there's rumors that he went and got plastic surgery changed his face and he's living somewhere in the bermuda triangle somewhere there's some random rumors like that and there's like all these people trying to like crowdsource this and they're like wait a minute the wife like the wife got like 12 million dollars of real estate they start looking into the wife and they're like how come her name is what it is like how come she doesn't have his last name how come there's no record of her name before this oh she changed her name recently she's changed her name three times in the last year why did she go from you know whatever aaron griffith to aaron jacobs to aaron robertson like that doesn't make sense and like then they find that like the ex-husband somebody with the same last name griffith or whatever like died also of mysterious causes in canada and they're like oh did you poison him and they're like what's going on and so nobody knows what actually went down but this and then there's like but because it's crypto it's all on all the transactions of the blockchain sorry so the whole time i'm watching this movie i'm like wait a minute but like if the guy's alive and he tried to steal the money you'll see the money moving if the money's moving somebody has the keys and like what ended up happening was actually that the guy oh there's even more to the story so they go look into this guy they're like all right who is this guy and they find like an er like you know the same way the silk road guy got caught they find an early like record or mention of the name um on this like black hat hacker forum so they go to this black hat forum which is where hackers hang out black hat means you sort of do the like the white hat which is like you find bugs you tell the company there's gray hat which is like you find an exploit you kind of use it but it's not illegal and black hat's like straight up illegal and they find this guy under this uh name like scepter or something like that on this black hat forum and he had been running multiple scams and they linked this founder that that guy i showed you butters they show they linked him to this guy scepter because he has the same name like they found his his email address in the forum and his official name because he had like ordered some product to put in his name and address and it was like his actual full name and that and so they like figured out that he is scepter he had he was a he was a scammer and then they find one key thing which is that um some the the the blockchain forensics guy basically he's like oh you know like these cases you sort of hit a dead end and it can be like that for years but then there's one bit of information that comes out that just cracks the case he's like that's what happened we got one bit of information about this scepter guy that went and cracked the case because then we found a user on the network called scepter we noticed that he basically what was happening was a customer would come to cardigan they would buy bitcoin and he was just in the database send them bitcoin like send them quote-unquote bitcoin into their account but there was no actual bitcoin he was just like funding that account with a a fake amount of bitcoin that wasn't actually on the bitcoin blockchain and he would just take their money he would go go to other exchanges and actually buy bitcoin with it and like he said he was funneling money himself so the whole time these users thought they had crypto in their account but they never did so where's the money now every crypto person's worst nightmare well so so that's what i'm saying is like it wasn't that the site went down and they lost the keys to this one wallet that had 200 million in it is that it was actually there the whole time it was never there there was no wallet there there was no there were never if you could always track it so where is it now so that money every time a customer imagine basically it wasn't ever one bit of money it's like every time a customer bought he would go make a small transaction on one of ten exchanges and you don't know who's who's doing that because it's all under different account name stuff like that so basically he like laundered the money very effectively during that so all that money is gone and so is this crazy movie what do you think happened is he alive or did the wife kill him oh well the other crazy part is back in that black hat forum he had um he had partnered up with her he had reached out to this other guy michael patron and michael patron uh was another guy on the black platform another scammer and they had built they had launched they had co-founded it together actually quadriga and then they got in a big disagreement and then michael patron left after you know some number of years um and then it was just this this dude doing it so one theory is that that guy that guy killed him uh another theory is the other wife killed him in others he killed himself because he thought he was gonna get caught another is that he's alive nobody knows which of those it is what do you think i believe uh i think the guy's alive based on the like the like the like the movie basically took the indian doctor's word as like i remember this guy coming in yup he had complications he died we did no autopsy and i remember it all you know like i feel like they vastly underestimated the amount of corruption you can get in india for like ten dollars and so um so you know i i think this guy is probably just for the people listening for the people listening sean's indian right yeah exactly uh so dude if you're is there if you're if you fake your own death let's you fake your own death and you have a billion dollars as low as 150 million dollars however much was stolen as high as a billion dollars what's even the point of having that money if you're fake dead like how do you ball out and like how do you live what's the point of it and what did his mom and dad say most importantly how how ashamed are your parents well like did they were they devastated they didn't talk to mom dad they talked to the wife's sister uh and she was like you know she's like we now look like huge liars because at first we were like she had nothing to do with this um and he was a good guy he was so sweet he was so romantic like you know he's not capable of like crime like if he died he died like you guys are horrible conspiracy theorists and then it like came out that no he clearly scammed and then it's like well we were wrong about the first part saying he didn't scam so now nobody believes us that a she wasn't in on it or b that he's not like that he's dead so we kind of lost our credit but we look like liars now just because we didn't really know here's what i've learned here's what i've learned studying conspiracy theories and watching like every episode of dateline ever which is people tend to be very bad at keeping secrets and so if there's more that a couple people who are involved in this it typically comes out even if it's a long time things come out um and so that whenever i hear these i'm like it could just be the simplest thing is that he did in fact die it's really hard to keep that secret to keep that secret would be so challenging right yeah i i'm kind of with you like i think maybe it's possible he did suddenly die or he got killed uh you know like one of those two or committed suicide yeah those are all possible but man dude just ima like can you even put yourself in the mind of to to execute on this elaborate scheme like you're literally just duping like millions of customers simultaneously sitting in your room on your laptop just straight stealing from everybody like it's just a crazy level of like you know like a sociopath to be able to do something like that it's really wild to me have you read about bernie madoff at all uh no so basically he um i can't think of a good analogy right now but basically yeah he ran a ponzi was a i think it was like 56 billion dollars but you and i were both too young to probably watching the news when it happened i think i was in high school or grade school i don't remember but um anyway he it was like a 58 billion dollar ponzi scheme and he had been running it for 40 years and the equivalent of it i think it'd almost be like um you know jamie dimon at um uh morgan stanley jacob morgan or whatever jp morgan like a figurehead like that because at at one point when even when he got arrested i believe bernie madoff was the chairman of either the nasdaq or maybe he was chairman of the sec like uh like he was the chairman who and it was his job to make sure that fraud didn't exist and when he got busted it was this massive ring this or this massive fraud of like 58 billion dollars i think i think i think it was in the 50s of billions of dollars so just massive and he'd been doing this for 40 years it's and and they're like why did you keep going he's like once i was in i just couldn't back out i was in so dude i guess i have another one a more modern day a current one of these that's unraveling as we speak did i okay so did i talk about this this video of the of the ceo of fast i think i did way back in the day on the pod did i talk about this video people were tweeting at us saying we called it and i don't remember what we what we talked about with fast but basically fast.com it's a quick checkout so basically if you go to a website i don't even know what websites like honest company or something and you want to buy diapers it's like a universal checkout button basically which is what paypal is yeah it saves your information and so you can go to another website and do this right so we uh we are the founder of bolt come on here i invest in bolt bolt does the same thing but like with a lot of actual users and revenue fast basically like i don't know uh this was maybe two years ago that this was happening maybe three years ago where all of a sudden on twitter there was this new company fast it had the domain i think i had the domain fast.com i think it has fast.com but it definitely had the twitter handle fast yeah and all of a sudden there was this guy dom you would see this guy d-o-m-m dom and it was like i'm the ceo fast before this i grew my business to 50 million um now i'm doing now i'm you know working on fast and then basically they were just like this twitter [ __ ] hype machine it's like this girl joined as the ceo and she looked cool and she was had a background at uber or something like that and she was the new ceo of fast and fast would talk about how how fast their checkout was right and how big of a problem this was and they were talking about like you know they're um they would you know they were making swag and they were like basically raising money and they were you know he could just tweet out at one point he like sponsored like a sea doo race team or something like that like there was like a press event where he was on a sea-doo with like a professional sea-doo guy doing that yeah we need to literally put that in this episode so ben can you google this uh uh i i know how i'm gonna get you a link real quick but it was like a guy doing flips on a fast sidoo the greatest promo ever word you're saying by the way i've never heard that like uh it's like kleenex it's the brand but a lot of uh okay so so ben go go to this link and we're gonna we need to watch this video together in a second here but let me just set up the rest of the context so fast goes and fast starts raising money um and they raised let me just pull it up so closer stripe they raised from big from shopify as well i might be wrong on that but they raised um yeah so they raised from stripe uh early on i think they raised this says christmas says almost oh of over a hundred million dollars all right so they raised 100 million dollars series b they had a 20 million dollar series a and um and so and so this was you know fast was like a darling in fact i met this guy from india this indian uh engineer and he goes he had worked at like i don't know stripe and now he was working at fast and i was like oh like you want to you want to be an entrepreneur someday he's like yeah i'm just right right now i'm just like i'm just collecting i'm just collecting my stamps on my passport he goes in india he's like in india if they see that you worked at stripe and you worked it fast and you worked it like name one up pinterest one other like one name company that they've heard of like oh you're you must be like super smart that's harvard iit that's like a pedigree right there and so he was collecting his fast stamp at the time and i remember asking i was like i was like so is it legit um because like they'd raised over you know nearly 200 million dollars and i was like um you know is it like awesome like is it growing really fast are there users i don't know anyone who uses it and he's like no there's no users yet and the ceo the red flag number you know i'd say red flag number two was probably like they he the ceo kept tweeting out these like tech like a screenshot of a technical scale test that they were doing was like we could handle you know 400 billion payments per you know you know per second right now it's like we can handle this many transactions we got to go back to the lab though and keep scaling up getting ready for the big fast launch and i remember thinking wow there's this problem in silicon valley called premature optimization where you're prematurely you're planning for scale when you don't have any skill yet instead of just like going and getting customers who actually want your product to start using you and giving you feedback you're planning for this like fantasy world where everybody uses your product and you can handle the scale we're just going to call it we're just going to call him dom pre-jack from now on exactly so so so me and me and fer we were looking at this we're like this is weird that he's pre-jacket over there he's like we were just like i don't know we just kind of shrugged our shoulders at the beginning like when it first came out i was like well honestly the idea is a good idea like a single universal one-click checkout will help the whole world of e-commerce like go forward you know it makes the customer's life more convenient it makes websites make more money like the idea makes sense which is why shopify has shop pay and that's why you know bolt is worth billions of dollars now like the idea is a good idea and fast is a great brand name and it seemed like that on paper this guy was great because he was super high energy he was building the brand and he was uh he said his last company was like he had something in his bio about 50 million so anyways it all started to unwind more recently when two things happen the first is people discovered that this guy dom who had branded himself as dom there was a reason he branded himself as dom because if you used his full name dominic holland if you just googled that you would find all kinds of articles about his previous company which basically was the same thing it was a hype machine in australia and ended up losing a bunch of money overnight getting sued and then he kind of like ran away from the scene of the crime in a way like and like not necessarily left australia and he didn't pay people back and uh yeah it was it was i think it was a gray hat for sure potentially even illegal [ __ ] yeah there's like a 15 million dollar dispute the government was like hey we're owed something blah blah and the same thing had a great domain toe.co and so it's like this guy's like you know good on the branding and the hype side saying we he came out saying we're uber for for basically like towing and so he had the story he had his brand toe.co and then you know they basically left with a 50 million legal dispute between him and the state government over who's supposed to pay for you know something that's going on right so the company goes under so and so you know his his story was like oh i built a successful company and i remember because i tried to get him on the podcast i dm them and i go hey what you're doing fast seems interesting i'd love to you know talk about investing and then you know maybe have you on the pod but can we do a call i just want to like understand your story it was like kind of hard to get a hold of him that he like we did a 10 minute phone call and by the end of it i was sort of like i don't know like this guy's kind of like he's a little bit fuzzy with the detail so i was a little bit on the fence and then he and he kind of sensed my hesitation then he dmed me right afterwards he goes you know what i think we're not ready for press just yet and like which was ironic right because he's pumping it on twitter so like i think he saw that i was kind of like this seems like kind of [ __ ] but like okay yeah um that's the only alarm was ringing so anyways they the news just came out about you know a about this guy's background um and then the second thing was that fast is like very very small so fast has i think a lifetime of 600 000 in revenue is that right like with 300 employees more 500 employees and six hundred thousand dollars in revenue that's crazy so i had an interaction with them at when i was running the hustle like a year and a half ago i think it was i either me or someone on my team i don't remember if it was me that wrote it someone wrote this ad where it was like a video ad and it it showed um it was like a magician you know how they do the tricks where cards are coming out of their mouth i think he was doing it with money coming out of his mouth or something like that and i get a dm from someone and being like hey fast ripped you off they took the ad that we wrote and made and they copied it shot for shot word for word and i tweeted out that video and i was and i tagged dom and his co-founder i forget her name and i was like hey you guys just totally ripped us off and dom replied with just like a smiley face and then the other co-founder was like hey sorry about that sometimes and then she named a person on their team i forget sometimes blank gets a little bit too carried away with the inspiration and i was like oh you're just gonna [ __ ] call out this guy that who works for you and then she dm to me and was like like i'm not gonna ask you to take it down but um you know maybe if you let them know if you could just tweet out saying that you you you know we deleted our ad or something like that and uh i had a run-in with them and i did not like that dom uh like like objectively he has a super punchable face objectively we're just talking objectively here objectively like if if 9 out of 10 doctors recommend uh you know something 9 out of 10 people recommend that they he he has a punchable face let's watch this video to confirm uh then play this video and kind of pause after the ridiculous bit so my my buddy matt uh sent this to me and he goes this is before this news came out about the like no revenue struggling to raise money maybe gonna have a fire sale and he's like uh dude is this company serious like you i remember you just talking about them but like what the hell and he sent me this obscure video from the tampa bay journal because they moved to tampa which first of all everybody's moving to miami right now that's like the big move tampa they moved to tampa is that that's the stock it's like the socks and sandals capital of the world right dude people love your socks and sandals joke recently that's where we're going to host a legacy conf by the way the funny part is i do wear slice of sandals in fact i love it all right keep going all right it's a little too choppy here that's all right pause it for a second getting out of the car he crawled out of the window like a fetus leaving the womb he okay so the mayor or somebody's like fast is on a rocket ship trajectory and uh what is this by the way is this a race like a pickup truck it's a it's a i think they call it stock trucks basically it's a nascar basically okay so so some car revving attention that has fast dot co all over it uh comes up does a donut and then the ceo crawls out the window and does a light jog to the podium all right play it [Music] [Applause] oh my god some guy puts a peach blazer on him no this guy his job it's like yo yo peach me peach me and he peached him with a peach blazer and then you know the paid crowd of people like 10 people all wearing fast t-shirts yeah these these must be ordinary citizens excited right making the world better one check out a time so much jim thank you for everyone for coming truly thank you to parker my uber driver parker kliegerman he also moonlights as one of the fastest nascar racers oh my god suck some sandals so fast forward a little bit get to the jet ski part basically he goes up there he gives this speech you know the city of tampa gives a speech oh my god and then there's a stunt man on a jet ski that says fast on it just going in circles in the tampa bay nice flip i gotta give them that um so so this event happens and this is just another thing where it's like the more parades you throw before you have customers like the bigger red flag you're throwing up into the universe and so you know i this is ridiculous uh this thing's about to blow uh the news has already started to leak we called it you know many months ago when we talked about this and uh you know it looks like it's going down soon yeah this this had red flags all over it man it's it is pretty ridiculous this is crazy uh what what is it what's he saying now is he has he said anything or one of the employees saying anything there's nothing on twitter about it from from him that i saw so you know it's kind of uh yeah his last tweet was like oh they don't like this here's this new customer that launched with us um that's crazy i'm so excited to see how this ends man it is you we talked about this i talked about this before so i've angel invested in over 50 companies you've done i imagine that or more and um it's easy to lie to people and i talked about about this with you i was like hey have you been lied to and i think you said maybe once so far i've not been lied to it is so easy to lie and it's so easy right i thought you said there was one yeah i thought there was one person here like i think they're lying i don't remember that but uh maybe yeah our point which is that like silicon valley does very little diligence at the early stages and even at the later stages there's a lot of like dude it's a hot deal other big names are in we're not doing uh you know basically they're like tight timelines minimal data sharing you're either in or you're out and you sort of bet blind and during bull markets everybody just you know like it is common practice for people to uh to invest in stuff without doing a ton of diligence and during the you know bear markets when when the leverage swings over to the side of investors they're able to ask more questions which dig in more and have more time i'm not entirely hating on by the way because i think you got to take the go with the bad so the good or the bad with the good what are the phrases the the good is that like someone comes to an investor and they'd be like hey i have a track record of doing some interesting things i don't even have a product yet but my vision is is this and the good is like there's people like me and you and other people who are way bigger than us who are like oh you know screw it like you gotta you gotta take a shot try it that's good and uh they'll say look i don't have anything here but let's try it so i understand that but then the bad of it is you get [ __ ] like this yeah exactly and honestly like if at the time when i was reaching out to this guy being like hey come on the pond and i want to invest and all that stuff because because again it really is a good idea it's not that this is a bad idea and you know at that time there was no traction so there's not nothing due diligence it's like it's pre-launch so of course they have no customers of course they have no revenue they just launched and he pre-jacked all over the place and now it's uh it's much further along and now you know sort of you see that the emperor has no clothes and so um you know but but i would say like it is very common practice for this type of stuff to happen and i think you know the well i don't think i don't think it's common though it's not common that people lie like that or are full of [ __ ] i think i think it's common that some people exaggerate but in general i think the system actually works but yeah sorry that what i meant was it's common that you invest without having to go diligence every claim that the company makes and audit all their financials and audit their customer base and go do you know reference checks and like you don't do all that for the sake of moving fast and in the in the aggregate it totally works but then a few times you're going to get egg on your face that's just the cost of doing business it's just the same way that you know one percent of all credit card transactions are fraud that doesn't mean credit cards are bad it just means you have to bake that into your model that you're gonna have some issues like this and then in general there's like there's the line there's the gray hat of like sort of fake it till you make it you know you're forecasting optimistically versus actually misrepresenting something would you invest someone would you invest had you known that this guy did what he did in australia so let's say someone's being charged with like fraud or something that is you know related to fraud would you invest in someone uh if they had that usually not but it depends on the situation like sometimes if you know somebody's being sued you got to take that a little lightly because uh people can get sued for anything it doesn't necessarily mean i mean what happened you sort of have to look into this to the claims but yeah it's not like a deal breaker in that sense of like if somebody has some bad press about them i don't necessarily like view that as an absolute no but i have to like come clear with it you know come to terms with it and i think i've told the story before about somebody who invested in hq trivia and at the time i was like yeah i heard the founders are like kind of uh you know like there was some suspect stuff they were like they had really gotten in trouble at twitter for like berating employees and stuff like that like they got fired like there was some kind of weird claims and they're like yeah we looked into it we didn't find anything that was like you know scared us away and in fact the fact that it scared other vcs away just makes us even more bullish right like there's a there's an honor in silicon valley of being a contrarian which is like you know being founder friendly and these things can get you in trouble sometimes the people the people who funded that they called themselves contrarian it was uh founders fund or some people related to that and they they own a conference called like contrarian conference but you want to know the thing it's called but yeah it is i think that's what it's called the thing about contrarians is they're wrong most of the time right so uh yeah i'm not surprised on that one um well where do we go from here um okay do you have time listen two more topics all right i want to get your quick take on something i'm going to call this segment genius or idiot i want you to give me a call is this more genius or more idiot um so by the way i've gotten as the co-founder before we get to genius i've gotten a fair bit of feedback on your drunk ideas the very long distance girlfriend fan favorite and the big ass bed oh dude by the way somebody somebody reached out about the long distance girlfriend very long right very long distance they were like don't share this don't share this oh yeah sorry very long discord they said don't share this on the pod but we we do this idea and they showed us the numbers and the numbers are super impressive so that idea like legit is working on the i wish we could talk about it but they asked us not to all right genius or not um all right so alex lieberman who's the co-founder and ceo maybe of morning brew um no chairman is that not right chairman uh of morningbrew came out and said uh he's looking at buying mini golf courses so he's like you know i'm interested in buying and acquiring uh putt-putt golf businesses um and he kind of had a couple of reasons why i think he was like you know um these are like recession resistance like people need entertainment that's cheap and fun um you know these are like you know cash flowing businesses and you know probably not a ton of competition so the prices are probably reasonable and there's like a real estate play baked in those are his kind of like reasons uh roughly if i was gonna gonna articulate them for him and he said he lost his reaction he said that he loves putt-putt that's what he said like the man loves to putt yeah so um first reaction genius or idiot which way are you going alex is a great guy i he's very smart and i like him a lot uh he's actually we become friends this is not his best idea in my opinion no i don't i don't think this is a good idea you're being very very gentle but so here's why so all right i'm an internet person i made uh some money on the internet now i'm currently at an airbnb where i i'm getting into the airbnb business and what i'm learning is that it is things like airbnbs and some other businesses where they like you spit off like 10 or 30 if you're really lucky a year in cash flow those are awesome but they're only they're more like just growing your wealth quicker not necessarily creating wealth or at least it's a little bit more rare and what i'm learning is like i was out here and i just looked at my shopify thing and my copy of that thing just made five grand today and it's it'll do a hundred grand a month maybe and i'm like okay well a good month at my airbnb will be like twenty or thirty thousand dollars a month and i had to spend over a million dollars i had to spend close to two million dollars to buy it like so it's like if i had to manage a course i think it's tough so my friend cody my good friend cody she does does all this stuff cody sanchez and in my head i'm like i just do not want to manage all these people i think it's a [ __ ] nightmare it's incredibly challenging and if you're alex lieberman you're very you're that means you're you're world class one of the best in the country at creating newsletter businesses i would stick to that maybe or something related to that so i'm uh so you're going 88 i'm going genius with a caveat the genius move is he already got all the value he's going to get out of this tweeting that out was the genius move because it makes him sound interesting it's something kind of fun he seems more basic just by tweeting it out he's a more interesting guy than just the newsletter guy i agree with that he comes across as kind of like fun and rich because that's who goes out and acquires putt-putt golf courses somebody who's fun and rich and uh he has currently no more work to do besides typing the tweet out and so if he stops here it's genius if he crosses over and buys his first pup golf course he has crossed the line indeed no i have a fine line between genius and individual he needs to take a picture of him touring it dude when i launched when i like just said i was doing airbnb and i said here's the property i'm about to close on that tweet got read by two million people or two million impressions and he does need to milk it a little more so he needs to like he needs to go to go to a few then he needs to tweet out the economics of how a public golf business works so he'll learn himself he should share that out just pour that out then he should uh you know like maybe like take a picture of him signing a piece of paper and be like we'll see new adventure yeah new adventure new adventure new chapter and then uh you know but like you know he's signing whatever the waiver and then he just gives the owner two thousand dollars for like a uh five percent share and he says he owns block by course yeah in his hometown he needs to do that in his hometown and then all of his buddies you need to be like hey i bought a piece of uh let's go to alex's i'm an owner i'm an owner and alex is putt and yeah in majestic putt we're thinking about changing it to alex's majestic putt but like for now i just want to keep that yeah they're like you guys we gotta go do the back nine at alex's you guys want to go are you coming with i have the keys we can go tonight yeah i know the owner if you want at night we can go yes that's the true genius move what's the next one all right so uh the next one here elon buys nine percent of twitter shares i don't know if you saw that this morning genius already oh he's going baller he broke the scale he's going balls i'm not even a i'm not even an elon fan i i don't like him for i i think some of his like jokes about like 4 20 69 and telling a politician their head looks like a penis i think that's i'm not on board with that i think that's silly i've also because a it's not even funny and b when you're have like people's pensions invested in your company and you're like doing dumb [ __ ] like saying funding secured at 420 not a fan of that but this move is awesome i think what's the point having it if you don't flex you know there's no point in having few money if you don't say a few once in a while i think this is an awesome move i uh he's now the largest shareholder so we spent three billion dollars is that right two or three billion dollars yeah something like that maybe not yeah yeah nothing for him and he bought into twitter the stock is up 30 or 20 today so he's already made a little bit a lot he's made a lot of it and i think it's amazing i think that he's all about this free speech guy i actually think this is an amazing move i'm very excited for it what do you think i think twitter's been undervalued by the way i think it's genius as well i agree with everything you just said first of all i also think that elon's kind of cheesy and cringy um when it comes to like personality and i think he's obviously absolutely dope when it comes to his business and like you know you know like changing the world stuff um so you know yeah i think his his sort of 420 joke and like you know 69 jokes that's sort of like uh it's kind of like if a normal person said that they would not be funny yeah so it's only funny because you're you're rich and you're in business so it's not like being like a hot podcaster you're right you're not actually hot you're a hot podcaster so it's kind of like that sounds like a conversation you just had it with someone did someone but you you acted like like well sean like yeah you're a good-looking podcaster yeah you've got a great voice you're one of the best looking podcasters that's like okay you've got an amazing hair for a tech person i'm the smartest person at creighton barrel so so basically uh yeah i think he's changing some of those ways but i think there's a baller move this is sort of like when bezos bought like the washington post or whatever and like you know whoever benny off brought time magazine and why it's even better now than it was who really wants to own an actual physical newspaper like this is actually better like just by twitter twitter is the newspaper of the world and so just buying like a big chunk of twitter and being able to like you know go swing you know yeah you know go flex and that way i think that's a i think that's a good move and i think actually like twitter could use um you know some change and you know people always try to build alternatives like trump tried to build a truth social as like an alternative to twitter crash the other day but the stock did yeah but but a better move is just to buy twitter and like you know if if your ultra rich buy twitter institute the changes you want there because all the people are already on it right how much uh how much stock do you have to own in order to have your opinion be heard if you own 10 i think there's like some legal stuff around 10 right i don't know exactly what it is but i think there's like it depends how much it's like he owns x percent of the float but i think it's you need to own the voting shares which is like you may not own the same percent of voting shares as you do total shares and the second thing is i think basically what you do is you become sort of an activist investor which basically says you get on the board or you you sort of lobbied the board to make a ceo change and the ceo needs the ceo that gets installed is a ceo that kind of carries out the agenda that you have in mind otherwise they're also going to get fired by the by the activist investors so so you know i think that's the the general idea i don't think he's going to play it exactly like that i think he's just going to be very vocal about what he what he thinks they should do which is a lot around fixing freedom of speech and like the algorithm being either open sourced or choose your own algorithm so that you're not you don't have to listen to twitter's filter you can choose your own filter or you can know how the filter works at the very minimum dude i'm on board with this i think this is great so i think that's what he's trying to do on board genius and by the way i think this is the only other stock he owns so i think before i've heard him on an interview say that he owns only tesla spacex bitcoin and ethereum and now this is this would be the only other stock he directly owns if uh if he was not bullshitting that first time that's crazy what a crazy person oh okay i have another um sort of genius or idiot thing did you see that logan paul was at wrestlemania genius i did and i watched it it was awesome and it's actually not a part of genius or idiot this is actually a part of like a different question is logan paul the greatest athlete of our generation did you see this video so he looked great he looked so good he looked amazing so so he did three suplexes in a row i haven't watched wrestling since like 20 years wrestling is back wrestling is like booming but wrestling is [ __ ] back dude is back in a huge way and i think there's a lot of opportunities around the fact that wrestling is back and but the whole world has changed it's like wrestling is back but the entire world and the way it works has changed and so that to me says there's a lot of opportunity because like you have crazy fandom and passion but like all new like tools at your disposal for like how you could like harness that energy so they did wrestlemania yesterday and whatever i saw a bunch of clips you know stone cold steve austin came back and drank a bunch of beers uh pat mcafee was also a podcaster somehow was like a key person in the thing i don't know why somebody can explain that to me but logan paul did a match and ben if you pull up the clip of logan paul in this wrestling match unbelievable athlete absolutely unbelievable yeah it was amazing and he did all the acting and stuff he didn't he killed it yeah dude they killed it i thought that was really good by the way not easy to do what he was doing what's it called it's not the wwf wwe i think they uh that's a publicly traded company yeah and so you could like and you can buy it by their stock and it's a killer business it it they crush it yeah i mean vince mcmahon is kind of an unbelievable story in and of itself but incredible athlete and a great crossover move the paul brothers continue to just not miss so i think you know i think like logan paul i think his podcast now one of the most popular podcasts in the world and more importantly than like oh the paul brothers did something and i got a bunch of views like that's a good podcast though but it's a good podcast and it's actual it's actually entertaining content it's actually like deeper content they talk to all different types of people from like business people musicians porn stars they've had like all different types of people and they have like full-on conversations so then it's a rebrand right it's like basically taking this guy used to be a vine star making fart jokes and now you see you know a more mellow side and a more thoughtful side and all this other stuff um look at him he is yolked logan paul is yoked yeah and as a kid i remember watching this look at him do all that [ __ ] do you dude these guys are basically bodybuilders who have personalities they are so freaking big they're they're bodybuilders that are soap opera actors that also can do are like also like cirque du soleil acrobats basically dude they're unicorns did uh like some crazy [ __ ] in this match anyways people should go watch it is honestly impressive just to see the physical feat that he pulled off in this thing um so i thought that was impressive and i also think it's a smart move or an influence like this was not what they've done with like going into celebrity boxing deep podcasting they've won crypto nfts pokemon cards and then going into uh like jake has a venture fund logan is going to wwe now and like building his character up there they're talking about potentially doing a ufc fight like these guys have like these guys are winning man they're winning at like a very high level that is very impressive to me um and you know most people just write them off like they're idiots they're not idiots these guys are awesome the thing about logan is i actually like i've been watching his podcast he like he's he's done a really good job of rebranding himself he is he still has a little bit but he's mostly he's not like a douche he's not a bro he's super thoughtful he's he seems like a really nice person he's the respectful one on the podcast he's got these kind of goofball friends that are like a little more brash and annoying they can ask questions and like joke around about stuff but he's the more reserved almost like introverted like thoughtful 26 mature person 25 he's not that old but he like he like gives advice like uh he seems like he's just it's there's a lot of stuff there that's rooted in pretty good values you could just tell that his brother i don't pay attention to as much but logan i definitely um have been watching his stuff and he seems very very uh like a good dude right yeah super impressive um all right let's do uh one last thing uh i have this this little life advice tip which is i believe that everybody needs to have a treat yourself budget and what is a treat yourself budget okay so basically this is part of uh the overall skill of learning how to spend money and your friend jason just did it wonderfully spending money is a skill and we so here's what here's my story around this so my dad was great you know good at making money right he came into the country i think with like i don't know 91 dollars and that was like all he had as his like starting point and like he ended up making millions of dollars in his lifetime and he learned how to make it but he didn't he never learned how to spend it you know if i go you know to a coffee shop with my dad my dad's first thought is like this is mostly water and like i can make this at home and like they're just charging you for the brand and the cup and you know he's like talking himself out of a three dollar cup of coffee when he actually wants a coffee and so you know like if there was a free coffee he'd walk two miles to go get it and so you know he wants the coffee but he doesn't know how to spend and so spending i've learned is actually a skill and so i think one way you can get better at the skill like anything else is to practice so how do you practice spending well uh i have this idea of a treat yourself budget so at my last startup we created a bonus program at bibo and basically i don't remember what it was exactly i think it was like a thousand dollars a month at the uh was like the low end and then basically as the company grew i would multiply the bonus pool so like when our user base doubled the bonus pool doubled as well and um and so we would give out this bonus and the only rules the only strings attached with bonuses you have to spend it on something interesting that you weren't otherwise going to buy yourself anyways so you can't just pay rent groceries your student debt can't do it sorry uh you got to buy something you weren't otherwise going to do it and then you got to come tell the story after you after you buy it and so jason was the first winner of the thing couldn't have been a better better guy to win it and um he was like trying to debate what to do and i told him i said he was like what's some of the he goes what's something you spent like a thousand dollars on that like like punched above its weight and i told him i go you know when i first got named ceo of the company i like i was like okay i'm making more money and i'm you know like how do i like mark this new chapter and i was like i'm no longer like a college kid anymore but i still dress like a college kid so i had hired a personal stylist i went on craigslist i said hey i want somebody to come to my house uh take away all the clothes that suck and buy me new clothes that look awesome and i said send pictures of like what you think awesome style what's like uh what's like the statue of limitations on that because it doesn't look like you uh are our followers this was a decade ago this is a decade ago so this lasted i think two years did she buy you cut off attack did was she like all right uh you're a cut off a t-shirt a cutoff t-shirt type of guy jordan shorts let's go over to foot locker i think we'll we'll make you look nice dude i gotta say it was insane i put that up on craigslist i woke up the next morning i had 81 replies in my inbox and i was like wow there's and it was mostly it was like half people who were like oh i work in retail or i'm a stylist or something and half of it was like dude i wish my guy friends would let me do this i'm just like it's just like a girl who's like i know how guys should dress better and guys dress horrible and i wish my friends would let me do this sounds like you're gonna let me do this like i'll do it but i ended up picking this like really hot russian model to do it she had great a great sense of style she came to she came to my house she went to my closet and she just took everything out and was like do you have garbage bags at the house oh my god oh yeah yeah let me just go get them and i was like but that one's my high school jersey she's like yeah it looks like a high school jersey uh you know like you're gonna throw it away for that for exact reason and she's like did you wear this to prom and i was like yeah that's my good that's my good shirt she's like this shirt sucks basically she yeah go ahead so we did this at the hustle so check this out and then look i want to hear what jason did so basically we did the same thing every month we would have it like it was like a thousand dollars and one person can uh vote how the group will spend it like we'll all do something together maybe it was more than a thousand i don't remember one time when we had i think 12 employees our office was down the street from costco and we basically people teamed up in teams of two so they're maybe we had 20 people i don't remember but i think we gave each person each group 200 and we said starting now you've got 20 minutes and you got to go buy something and at the end we're going to vote on who got the best thing and like i went and bought like and i oh and i think it was 100 you had to spend on something that wasn't food and the other 100 you had to spend on something that was food and we're gonna go eat together and vote on what the winning thing is and so people like bought all this stuff that like you don't really want up like the big cheese ball things like you don't want to bite at your house but you've always wanted to try it right and it was the most fun team building activity we've ever had it was awesome that is that is genius um i was just talking to somebody like uh the guy who runs our warehouse and he's like oh yeah you know people want another you know this other warehouse amazon warehouse is offering an extra two dollars an hour these guys are complaining that it's cold inside and i feel like it's hard to hire people because people don't want to work anymore and i was like dude i get it i get it but you got to be creative about how to make this fun for people and you got to figure out how to take this many dollars and make it feel like a trillion dollars of budget for you and the thing you just described cost you probably like a thousand or twelve hundred dollars but like you're still talking about it like ten years later it was amazing every single remembers it it was super fun great team bonding probably liked some of the stuff that you you got and like and then it's just such a simple way to like go go further it morphed into eating contests somehow so every month we would have an eating contest and we had one lady who worked for us who ate i swear to god 12 krispy kreme donuts in seven minutes and then went to the bathroom and like just annihilated it and she had to go home because she was sick so it wasn't the most productive but people loved it and then we would do the last thing that we would do is we would do taste tests so for example we would buy every single bottle of water that this nice grocery store near our office had and you had to see who can guess which bottled water is which we had another guy that he would win 100 if he could guess the difference in all the grapes because he was like oh i could tell the difference in all the grapes i'm like i don't know man i don't think you can we did the same thing with app and then we did this like a blind taste test yeah like which grape is this and then we did the same thing with apple so they had to guess which apple it was and if you got it right you'd get 100 and stuff like that was the most fun yeah sam this is why this is why you need to be teaching business school instead of you know whatever professors teach in business school because the stuff like this that actually matters to people actually make the work environment more fun and uh you know they don't teach you this at school so so i i am with you dude these like cheap there's like cheap ways where it's not about the money it's about the creativity and the fun and the kind of like the humor of it that makes it uh that makes it hit there's this book and there's this book called um man's search for meaning have you read it it's like really sad part of it it's like wait you read the cover yeah uh it's it's like way deeper than the [ __ ] that we're talking about but basically it's about like a jewish guy who was a psychiatrist or something and he went to the concentration camp for four years and so it's kind of interesting because he's like oh i'm my own experiment and what he said was that the people who survived best or the people who died would basically say we're gonna get uh released uh on christmas i think we're gonna get released on christmas and then christmas would come and pass and they would get all depressed and bummed and they wouldn't have anything to look forward to and they would die uh just like you know just get worn down and then the other people who are like i'm getting out of this and when i get out of this i'm going to become a doctor so i can make sure that no one's harmed like this again or i'm going to get out of this so i can see my loved ones i'm going to get out this way i could tell the world about this and write about it and he said that every person that survived they all most of them had a thing to look forward to and so i kind of stole that tactic it doesn't exactly apply here but i was like for my office we're gonna have a calendar and we're gonna make sure we list all the activities and so people always have something to look forward to and i noticed that that actually changed the morale so you want do you want to have something to look forward to so then when you're eating lunch you're like hey in two weeks is that thing have you thought about where you're gonna buy at costco and that type of stuff really really helped probably not the best to compare it to a concentration camp but yeah it was you learned it from there i learned it from that book it's a great book um yeah it was the end of the story it doesn't really have a point but basically jason hired a jason when jason won i was like you should do this thing he did it he loved it first of all he's like dude the experience it's it's it's like that scene from pretty woman where you just get to walk into the store you know you're gonna buy up a storm you don't even really have to think like the stylist when i did it she was like go to the dressing room i'm going to hand you things you put them on and i was like she'd hand me something like i don't know i don't really wear stuff like this she's like yeah i know that's the point and then you know i'd wear the thing and then you know i get to see it sometimes i hated it and sometimes i liked it she'd never make you buy something you didn't like but she would always make you try stuff that you don't normally wear or whatever and so jason came back to work looking super cool uh he was wearing like all of a sudden he had like rings and like you know jackets and like you know this is the ring guy now he's a big ring guy and he had like you know like these like look like you know whatever like these chains that like his mom didn't buy them and uh and anyway so he looked cool and he had just like the right amount of swag to it and he was saying something um on twitter that i thought was just like a very uh like a good way of putting anybody to say he goes um he goes uh where'd he go what did he say he goes most guys don't know how to style themselves it's worth being taught life was more fun if you're excited about what you wear every day especially if you know that the outfit you're wearing like amplifies the impression that you're trying to make it gives you more presence and like most people don't like to say this stuff out loud but that's part of jason's superpower is he's like completely unashamed of the things he feels and says and so he was able to like articulate it well so anyways somebody's listening to this do you have the budget um something i highly recommend doing you will feel different and it's a good experience uh to go give yourself a great way to treat yourself but even if you're even if you don't do that create a treat yourself budget create like it doesn't matter if it's a hundred dollars a thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars start with even like a hundred dollars and be like oh am i gonna spend a hundred dollars on something that i wouldn't otherwise have done for myself i didn't need but will give me some new experience it'll take me in some different direction even a slightly different direction in life uh it can make a big difference that guy's name is jason hitchcock he's a good follower on twitter because he's living his best life right now he's having a good time yep all right that's all i had for today all right that's the episode [Music] you

[Music] i'm gonna paraphrase but this was asked a ton of times which is how would you start again from zero i hate this question i don't ever answer this question i'm like that's an impossible thing to answer because you're just looking for like a spoon fed thing um and you're just not going to do whatever we say does i mean if you're asking that question you're probably not going to do it okay but still answer it what what answer it the way you want which is maybe you're not spoon feeding a specific answer but like dude what does a guy like sam do in a day and age like this let's put it there differently well and i also don't like this question because the answer is i would do exactly the same thing again sean perry is how's it going is it working wonderfully it's working amazing it feels great to be sampar at age 24 or however you old you were when you started this i would do the exact same thing it totally works if you pick the right niche you but here's the thing is like you care about this topic i cared about my topic which they were related but not the same you don't mind writing every day i didn't mind either and so i would do the same thing the only thing that you did differently was that you were already kind of famous and you had this huge twitter following which definitely helped i had a ten thousand person email list from hustlecon so i had a little bit of a base and we're both doing the exact same thing you get make sure you have content market fit and so which means you see if you can uh create a newsletter every single day which both of us have done you cr find a way to get traffic in my case it was by blogging in your case it's twitter and then once you realize that that works then you i would buy ads which you are now doing i think and i did do and you scale and you find out what your ltv is and then you just figure out how much you want to spend and then you go and get advertisers you're already making like a lot of money every month doing this and you're like great four months in it took me two years to get to where you are well that's because i saw the blueprint right like i wouldn't have even known this could even make any like when you first told me you're like yeah email newsletter um i think you make a bunch of money and then i was like by doing what like email's free with f what are you talking about this was there wasn't like sub stack didn't exist it wasn't even i didn't know of any paid newsletter and i didn't even really real i didn't even realize there's like a newsletter advertising industry and if you had told me that i would be like oh cool like might as well have said you're gonna go sell buttons at a flea market like right it doesn't seem like that big of an idea and then you're like yeah you can make and i think you had told me at the time 100 cpm which i don't think turned out to be true but like no i i think i said 50 maybe but that is true yeah i don't remember what i said but whatever i said it was ridiculous yeah you never said 100 and then i was like so wait a minute so you're like a list of ten thousand people and like wait what's the cpm i was like oh god gotta do math and then i like but like when i ended up at a number i was like so wait if you sent that every day you just make that much money every day and i remember just being like well okay maybe this is actually an awesome idea instead of like you know a kind of shitty idea but that's only one of the ways that it can make money right which is what you're seeing you're seeing that that's just the tip of the iceberg and you're only on the tip yeah yeah just the tip as we like to say business do you see how this could scale to 100 million in sales maybe maybe not this is by the way not a q a we're just giving tips and this is just the tip the justices it's a short podcast so we can only do just the tip uh do you see how this could scale to 100 million in sales yeah i think you know probably for more than just ads but yeah for for sure yeah and i think so okay one general idea of what you're saying is basically if you are good at content it is possible to build a large con content audience and then you that that is the door that opens more doors so either you use that to like you know like what i did with my following at first was i launched a fund i was like great investing is a cool way to make money first built an audience and then launched a fund and the audience became my investors i took zero meetings i did zero pitched calls or whatever and raised a multi-million dollar fund from just the audience so that's like the superpower of an audience so i i think that's one thing you could do which is already a like potentially an eight-figure thing for you uh at worst maybe seven figures but like that's like already monetizing you don't get that today but in the future and the the other thing uh by the way is that uh then by the way the next question is how well how how would you build an audience who started from scratch like that's a that's the next that's next question which you probably is like your second most hated question yeah i hate that okay so that's it's like don't ask a girl her weight or don't ask samfar what he would do to build audience from scratch if he started just don't like it because it's like dude you're asking me on twitter you see what i do yeah that's that's actually my middle lesson okay so can i can i do my rant for a second here yeah um which is kind of a buzz kill for the just the tip episode but let me let me do it anyways most of the people who ask that question i don't want to answer not because it's not a good question but because if you're asking that question that basically means you're not going to do it you're not going to do it because the answer is so obvious it's already out there everybody who's building an audience is doing it super publicly so all you have to do is be like okay so this guy does it this way and this girl does it that way and this guy does it this way and like then you sort of just bucket it you're like okay seems like you kind of need to just choose one medium like maybe podcasting or twitter or email they all have different benefits and then like on that medium you need to like maybe pick a topic and that's your theme you become the the guy who always talks about frameworks or the guy who talks about crypto or the guy who always talks about business ideas or whatever it is and then you can expand once you already have a base exactly and then like you should try to get the you start to make viral content because it's going to get shared a bunch you can kind of like get sponsors and turn that money into like buying out like it's so obvious what all of us are doing that if you if you if you don't know how to do it at this point like you failed the iq test and i don't mean that to be mean i just mean it like to me you're not serious about the question um yeah because the answer is already like visible to you and if and i think there's some like more nuanced questions like which platform would you pick today would you pick email or twitter or whatever like i think there's different questions that might be slightly better questions um but the generic one is pretty bad and this is how i rant so last night i'm watching tick tock i try open tick tock as i do for my tic-tacs basically like my bedtime story and um and i see this guy on there and he's like some like sean connery looking guy and he's like this like kind of like complete gray beard guy and he's cooking an egg so he's like the perfect that he cooked the perfect egg let's do it and he's like you know he's like we got eggs we got black salt we have this like you know i know he's got like what looks like just like a branch with leaves on it and that's probably something like seasoning he's like you know we have these things okay cool turn the pan to high heat crack the eggs put the eggs in now we're gonna like keep it on high you know you have your oil you have it on high and you're trying to get this crust he's like how do you know when there's a crust watch this jiggle it and like so he's he's like literally teaching you in like a 30 second format how to cook the perfect eggs and by the end he like takes that out of the pan you're like dude i just want to try that egg more than anything in my life right now and it had 10 million views had 10 million views and like all the comments are like you know be my dad and like you know i'll marry you if you cook me these eggs every morning and he like cuts into it the egg yolk starts running and it's cur like it's crispy on the bottom and soft on top it's like just looks amazing right and it got me thinking i was like he made it look so simple i saw the egg crack right so um you know i saw what he did it wasn't like that complicated he explained every step of what he was doing and there's like 10 million likes on this video which means like a lot of people have seen this video i thought how many people are going to cook an egg like this so how many people are even going to try to cook an egg like this how many people could actually cook the egg like this after watching it and it's got me thinking i was like you know when i watch this video of this guy telling me how to do it it seems all simple enough but i know if i walk to my stove right now and i took the two eggs and the salt and the pan with the oil my egg is not going to turn out like that right like i would need a lot of reps to be able to ever cook an egg the way the guy did it and he showed me the exact formula he told me the formula and it got me thinking about business advice i go this is the problem with twitter and even podcasts like this which is that imagine now that i watch that video of that egg and then tomorrow i come on and there's another video of like this guy cooking eggs and then there's like the next day there's another one and like maybe the next day the guys when you're gonna go make your own damn egg exactly and like after six months i would kind of in my heart i would feel like dude i know how to cook eggs but again if i walked to a stove and i tried to do it i would make a runny mess and it would be horrible and like the problem with twitter and the problem with the people with the way that people use twitter and use podcasts is they get on every day and they just watch other people cook eggs they watch guys like you and me cook eggs like we we don't listen to them anybody but we record our own right like right we are happy to take your attention well it's like they uh they're just masturbating instead of having sex exactly exactly and like but you convince yourself like i could just imagine if i had done this for six months i'd be like dude i know everything there is to know about cooking eggs and that's that same person who's on twitter who reads advice from every investor and founder who's tweeting out their you know three ways to you know three of my the biggest mistakes i made before 30 a thread you know my six hiring mistakes about managers a thread um you know like all these things right like it's like when i ask my daughter when we play this game i say who's your best friend she goes the floor that's how i feel about the thread you know like basically it's like here just i'm gonna say this arbitrary [ __ ] and like i can imagine that if you listen to that and read that every day you would think you are learning how to cook eggs but you have no idea how to cook eggs even after reading all of that in fact you almost are worse off than somebody who just tried to cook eggs for two weeks straight and then maybe in the on the 14th day of cooking their eggs they go on twitter and they see something they're like oh that's how i should change the way i'm cracking the egg because like you know how the heat is too high oh that's it okay let me go back and make an adjustment and so my rant is basically don't be the dude who just watches the video of cooking eggs like go crack some eggs make a bunch of mistakes and then come back to twitter and podcast like this for your just in time learning to like just give you a tweak on the thing you're actually doing right right right right i i'm i'm on board i completely agree with everything you said you want to do uh let's go back to answering some questions yeah from people let us watch us crack some eggs all right you pick one you pick one and then i'll pick one and so forth okay sounds good uh let's do this first one so what are the key traits you look for in a co-founder and red flags so that your business is successful and you guys stay happy and i think you've had like multiple co-founders i think right ish i was always like the guy and then like i had first people that were more batman robin yeah yeah yeah um and but then with joe spicer for my fund that's 50 50. uh the and what i've learned number one uh they have to be emotionally healthy and very emotionally stable i would consider myself to be mostly stable on the big things but my mood goes up and down and for me to be a good partner with someone they need to be emotionally stable even if i was like really stable it's really important because i've seen a lot of like it's just like the same way you ever have like a friend that's got like a husband or a wife and they're just [ __ ] crazy and it's like i don't know how to advise you here like this person is acting irrational like it's really challenging it's like you want to separate them like you stop acting crazy and you stop acting crazy that's my only advice to both of you guys yeah it's like dude this is this is just it's not going to work out and so i married a woman that was like very stable and even keel and i realized oh that's perfect so what i look for in partners is people who are emotionally stable uh and and i also want a partner that's incredibly honest and undersells themselves uh i also and if i find out that they lie at all like even on small [ __ ] it's game over for me so really high integrity is important um and then finally having really high energy so like who can just like who wants to push the pace and uh basically with my best partners i feel intimidated and inspired by them that's a great way of putting it and i think it shows like i'm pretty chill sarah is very chill i don't know joe that well but he seems also very chilly very chill you know very cool your your partners basically and your ventures are like you know resting heart rate under 40. like it's hard to get a heart rate up and like i think that's good that's a good pair for you yeah because i don't mind being the high energy like i'm typically the one that can be the catalyst and be the igniter right and then a person that wants to be the guider i enjoy right yeah that's that's a great one there's this book that i read called why you will marry the wrong person have you read that by uh tim urban no no he has a it's the school he's a blog post called that oh yeah you're right you're right school of life so the in it like the very first principles like we marry the wrong person because um you know one of the things that says like we don't even know how we are crazy everybody's nuts you just if you but if you don't recognize how you're nuts um you're not gonna know how to pick a partner who could deal with your level your version of crazy and you're gonna have to deal with their version of crazy and the idea that you're gonna change them to not be so crazy is like not a thing like everybody's weird or you just don't know them well enough so like you got to have your you got to know your weirdness is and then be like cool is this person compatible fundamentally compatible with my my type of weird uh that's kind of a version of what you just said so what what are yours so i kind of steal from like you know warren buffett said this thing and then i think paraphrase it as well which is like two things you just said energy integrity and intelligence so those those three so break them down um energy is the one i think most people overlook i think everybody wants intelligence they're like oh yeah i want somebody who's like really smart or really good right it's like yeah that's that's true you don't want to you don't want somebody who's incompetent it'll drive you nuts in the long run i've had that problem before you don't want somebody who's low integrity right because a smart person is low integrity is a crook it's just a matter of return until they screw you and then the last one is energy and the energy thing i think is the one that everybody overlooks i put it as my number one which is like some people call it vibe some people call it energy i call it mood you know whatever it's basically does this person bring enthusiasm by default or are they always looking for something like do they need an excuse to be high energy do they need an excuse to be motivated do they need an excuse to be optimistic and enthusiastic about what you're working on because if they if they do you're gonna i feel like i'm constantly like a doctor with the shock paddles like all right clear give me you know give me give me 20 amps or whatever and like just trying to like get them to be like yo wake up and i i've had this with like business meetings because ben who's my business partner on all my different businesses ben's a very low-key guy he's very low low he comes acro he's not actually low energy but his speaking style is low energy and so sometimes we'll be in meetings and i'd just be like guys i just don't want to ever be in a meeting that feels like this right now like nobody's fighting but like also nobody's saying anything like hello wake up like you know do you care are you there do you have ideas or are you just creatively bankrupt and like i just don't want to be in a room that's like low energy so can we just shake that up right now and they're like oh yeah sorry um let's [ __ ] go like they give me some token thing i'm like it's fine even a token thing is fine it shows that you understand what matters to me i was going to say the two people i think do actually have good who show that i was both of our ben so ben uh our ben here ben wilson he has good energy and vibe because whenever i'm around him i feel happier and i leave happier right uh and he does a good job of matching and then ben levy is uh whenever same thing whenever i'm around him i feel happier and he also uh gets a lot of energy talking to people which is which i [ __ ] hate doing so ben levy's a great partner yeah he's amazing uh he's really amazing um okay so that's kind of what i guess i answered that question um which one do you want to do next okay let's do this one um what did you tell your friend on twitter so okay question is what it what did you tell your friend on twitter that resulted in his audience's growth to 100k in just a few hours um so he tweeted i helped him write another one today did you see it no no is it pop it off oh yeah right away it got like five or ten it got five or ten thousand likes in the first 30 minutes and it's already reached five million people okay so explain the thought process how did you alright what advice did you give them that would help them do that people hate this advice but look here it is the guy made a hundred million dollars in the nhl and he spent 20 years being a hockey player and i'm just helping him craft some of the stories that he's already lived so step one is there's this massive unfair advantage which is he's he's lived in he's lived an interesting life yeah and i was talking to my friend logan who has this book called how to not die alone and she's like a dating coach and helps uh men and women find partners and i was talking to her about how i think men should find dates and i'm like you know the best thing about being able to attract a woman is as long as you focus on yourself and live an interesting life and constantly improve yourself that's what women really care about and that's really it goes beyond women so with chris it was like well you just live an interesting life are you are you looking at his tweet right now so it says first tweet is when you hear about x player making 30 million over five years six million dollars a year you think wow he made it however that's not always the reality in this field i'm going to break down how much they take home and where the rest of it goes i'm curious tell me more yeah what's the result so far uh so it has 10 000 likes it was posted five hours ago wow so um so with chris what i do is i basically uh talk to him on the phone and he's like hey i've got this idea where i want to talk about like finances and he'll like he'll have a conversation with me for 20 minutes and i'll say he'll say yeah you know it's crazy about escrow and i'm like wait hold on what the hell is escrow he goes yeah so like basically when you get paid 30 goes into escrow and i was like oh so when you get that money back he was you actually never get that money back that money is used to afford the lead the league and i'm like oh that's interesting because yeah it's no big deal so anyway and then like i'll keep talking i'm like no no no no that's the thing that's the thing and so when what you have to do is you have to find the big idea and you have to do this thing called the it's called like the knowledge complex but basically if you wanted to get good at twitter you've got to a live an interesting life and b understand that the interesting and unique experiences in your life it's really not well known to a bunch of people and you have to realize that like what seems boring to you isn't boring to most other people and so you've got to figure out how to tweet that and if you don't live an interesting life go and live an interesting one or go and learn about a topic and just tweet everything you're learning exactly exactly i think you said it perfectly i'll only add one part to that which is uh in in my power writing course i teach this uh exercise and um basically i use this i explained the exact same way you said i said you have two choices like fundamentally you can either be a generous expert meaning you know something so well you could just be sharing it with an audience or a curious novice curious beginner so it's like you just say yo i don't know anything about this but i'm curious i'm going to dig in and find out if you want to learn what i learned you know going from zero to understanding you know defy uh just follow this threat a bunch of people like great i'm also a dummy if you're gonna do a bunch of work for this i would love to hear what what your takeaways are at the end and so people vastly underestimate the curious beginner path which almost is a better path really um because they think you have to be a generous expert you think they think you have to have played in the nhl made a hundred million dollars in order to share this type of info um there's other formats like you know meme king um yeah spicy analyst like i have all these like names for these like different different like lanes you can go down for content to win but like those are those are two of them let's say the other thing i say is there's exercise because most people like well you know i haven't made 100 million so what do i talk about and so there's this exercise from the book story worthy that i stole called first last best worst have you ever done this yeah you well you did it with me it was great oh okay cool so we've done it before but like basically let's just play it again for people who don't don't know it but like and we can pick maybe even a different topic so you take any category of your life so it could be relationships it could be colleges like um it could be hustles yeah this could be jobs so let's take jobs so what would be sam parker's first job janitor at a bakery okay great didn't know that um what was your uh worst job um i uh staining decks in the summer in st louis you're totally miserable doing okay great then uh what was your um what was your best job being a podcast host and then what was your um like let like say we usually say last job but it means like most recent job so like in that case i was ceo of a media company that was making tens of millions of dollars great and and oh also weirdest what's the weirdest job you've ever had what's the weird it doesn't have to be a job what's the weirdest way you've ever made money i was a skateboard instructor at the ymca that's a good one or the hot dog stand i think it's a great one also for them all right a hot dog stand yeah um so so you take that and you say all right and everybody has some version of this everybody has an answer to these questions then then you say all right within that what's the story people don't know about staining decks or what some people think people don't realize about about those hot dog stands you see and then they're like well you know they don't and you're so it's kind of like you said the knowledge complex whatever it's like you're so in the weeds you don't remember what it's like to not know so you kind of got to talk to somebody about it just say it all out and you see when they raise their eyebrows or when they get curious it's like that's your hook you need to know like you know how much those hot dogs really cost or like where the heck do they go when the game is over right like you know okay now i want to know like you know yeah i have always wanted that so oh wow you put it in this area whatever um and so so i think that's what you want to do to come up with great content ideas you don't have to be chris pronger and nhl star who made 100 million dollars i bet you could have done maybe not as successful maybe not like you know 100 000 followers and like one tweet or whatever you did for that guy but like i bet if you worked for three months with somebody who's a completely normal person like you know project manager at deloitte i bet you could get them to 30 or 40 000 followers on twitter within a month and if you look at well look at so you didn't have a following on twitter like three years ago you started right two years ago yeah two years ago now you've got over two hundred thousand trunk fam the guy who worked for me for a long time when we when he started working at my company i think we helped or he signed up for twitter now he's got what three or four or 500 or something yeah 500 000 and then there's like loads of employees at my company that have done it like it's very easy to do yeah exactly all right let's do a different one um [Music] what would you say to a lawyer with a very i'm a lawyer with a very good salary what would you say would be a great answer to motivate me to leave my cushy but soul-sucking job and jump into entrepreneurship if my boss asks i'm asking for a friend i would say don't jump into entrepreneurship and get happy with your job if you're someone that needs another person to give you motivation to bail you're you shouldn't bail you're only doing it because you think that people think that it's cool because people they admire do it i would say don't do it i don't think that you're the personality type that this that will be happy doing this if you need someone to motivate you yeah exactly uh and by the way there's a trick there which is if that pisses you off it makes you want to do it cool you are an entrepreneur go ahead you know you may pass go you may collect your 200 if not like if that answer feels so wrong for you it doesn't sit well with you and it annoys you that sam even said it and you get this like random chip on your shoulder for no reason like yeah you kind of are that's that actually did get you going on the right path and also if you're if you're a lawyer i do think that the hours lawyer works lawyers work are ridiculous but you could make a lot of money and i bet there's a world where you could do like a nine to five legal business or be a lawyer and have a really good life so like why bail if you if you're not compelled to do it enough that you're just gonna do it maybe don't just don't bail be happy yeah for sure uh all right pick another one um would you uh would you consider buying an existing business and growing it or would you only want to start things from scratch frankly i don't know why i haven't done that like it's pretty clear to me now that that is a better path for entrepreneurship um [Music] unless you really just have the killer idea um but for some reason i haven't done it yet i just keep starting new things from scratch i think there's some fun in that and it's not really the logical decision it's more of the emotional decision but i for sure would and in fact think i should be doing that because i know how to run a good business i know how to grow businesses and taking something that's already doing 5 10 15 million dollars a year and getting it to 50 would be a lot easier for me than getting something from zero to 50 and um so why not yeah i said makes sense i just don't get i don't maybe i'll do it one day i i i know people talk about this all the time i agree that it is actually easier and i agree that the likelihood is better and your life would in most cases be better i can't i just don't give a [ __ ] about something that someone else made i i enjoy starting it i i think that to me building a business is like my art and i i like doing it from the ground level and what about okay i got a question for you from uh from twitter here so john williams asks how hard should i should you be willing to work to create a successful business is it an 80 hour a week job is expecting to only work 40 hours a week unrealistic and by the way his tagline is john williams [ __ ] work let's play um i think we know what even what he's trying to do here um so let me just say this when i started my company the first two or three years i was working constantly all the time and people would be like what do you mean like you're in the office you're thinking about it obviously i would get to the office at 8 or 9 a.m and i would go home at 7 or 8 pm um and i i would dick around at the office and hang out my employees but i it was really important to me that i was the first to arrive and last to leave and i didn't i didn't expect i would work sunday evening but not saturday so that's like this let's take that you know as as uh literally what you said so let's say 12 hours a day five days a week that's 60 hours a week plus maybe a couple hours of the weekend so maybe 64 hours or something like that in a week yeah but i couldn't sustain that so i only did that for like the first two years and to get to like profitability and hiring people and then i was able to to where it was like some weeks it was 80 other weeks it was pretty chill it was 40. um and uh so i was able to relax a little bit more um one time i took a month off so i was able to like but that was we were making like eight million dollars that year so um i was able to chill a little bit um if i had to start something again i would expect that i would work 40 or 50 hours a week getting it going but here's the thing whenever even now even though i'm not like actively involved in building a business i i think about this type of stuff 24 hours a day people ask us sean if we prepare all the time and i'm like yeah kinda but also not kinda but like we're like everything we read it's like we're relating it back to this trade of i don't know what you call this thing improving ourselves and sometimes making money by doing it yeah yeah it's like what's that um i want to keep referencing this like douchey uh this story that makes me sound like a douche it's like picasso's at a restaurant and somebody comes up and they're like will you make a piece of art for me and he grabs a napkin and he scribbles on it and he's like you know that'll be 30 000 or whatever she's like but you just you just made that in two seconds and he's like no this this ma'am like you know this took me 20 years or whatever to make this scribble um and that's how i feel about the podcast like there are days where i will show up and it's like wait are you you know what are you guys talking about like right before the pod i'll be like hey i'm gonna go record my wife what are you guys going to talk about today i was like i have no idea and it's not that i have no idea i have a long list of things that throughout the week i'm writing down here because i'm doing calls with all these interesting people that i'm researching this thing and if i'm watching a documentary i'm taking notes it's like i'm doing things that the average person doesn't do in order to generate a bunch of ideas so that when i show up it can just be natural i can just speak naturally about interesting topics because i've already put in the whole week of trying to learn interesting things and have interesting conversations and all that stuff so um and i would say like if if you know a lot of this these questions are like career advice listen if you can find a way to do that in your career you've won which is basically there's no separation there's no separation between the things you're most interested in and liking to do and spending your nights kind of like learning about or experimenting with like find a way for money to be the byproduct like the exhaust coming out the chimney of that factory of interestingness and like that's it i have heard that before yeah that's pretty good right that was that was that was that was great that's really good yeah and so i'm a little in awe of that oh hell yeah all right great put it on a t-shirt um i had heard things like that before but again it was just crack and egg watching other people crack eggs advice finally when i did it it's like this is the way this is for sure the way which is just go for the most interesting things and then learn core business skills so that you can turn you just doing what's most interesting to you on a daily basis into a profitable money making event like venture and then you basically are funding yourself to live exactly the life you want and how long were you working when you uh at bibo six seven years something like that but uh sorry i meant early on how many hours oh i was i would work a lot but it was more like i don't necessarily know if that was productive like i was at the office every day from let's call i would get there like 9 9 30 usually and then i would leave either like 8 p.m or i would sleep there because there was like an apartment built into the office and i was a single guy i didn't mat like who cares if i go home to my apartment or i sleep in this apartment like sleeping here saves me time and i could just keep you know working on stuff and basically what i would do the way i thought about my day was like i had decided when i took the job i go i'm going to work here instead of starting my own company i'm going to work here i'm going to pack like 20 years of experience into the next four years that was my goal right and then i said okay well how am i going to do that i said all right well my day job needs to give me reps working on startups and like trying to build them and grow them because that's the thing i like to do and then basically as soon as like everyone would leave the office around five i would walk out i would go get like like you know westfield mall was like right there i'd walk to western mall walk to the food court that's why i gained a bunch of weight i'd walk to the food court i'd be like tired super hungry i'd go eat some shitty food in the food court i'd come back to the office and then i would like like i'd have my night job and my night job was basically like what are the most interesting companies who are the most interesting people how do i like learn about what they're doing how do i meet them how do i invite them over for a beer right now at the office or dinner right now at my office and like pick their brain on what they're doing and basically i would build my network and i'd build my knowledge at night or i would like build my skills so i'd like teach myself sql overnight i'm like okay i'm tired of asking the developers to run queries for me i'm gonna learn how to write my own queries and like you know so i would like spend two weeks just trying to learn secrets and then i would spend two weeks really like studying up on like you know how mlms grow and like just like i just picked these like intensives and i would just go down them so now i kind of have a whole bunch of obscure knowledge but because i like dedicated a period of my life to really only learning about those things i didn't didn't do other stuff but it's okay i was like you know happy as a clam just to do those things that's badass i think that's a really good answer um all right let me pick one what are your biggest regrets what past time do you sorry all right what are your biggest regrets in business and life what past time in your life do you miss most what future time do you most look forward to so i'll answer really quick my biggest regret i wish i would have taken my work my school my sports more seriously as a young person so like in grade school high school and college i kind of dismissed it i wish i would have like taken it why yeah because i think that like i well when you're in high school and college like there's a time where all you have to do is acquire skills and like get good at stuff and i like would just i didn't like eat well uh i didn't like sleep as much as i should have for when it was as relates to sports i didn't train as hard as i could have trained and that's just like a period of time when you're young from like the ages of 12 to like 20 or 22 if you're a college athlete which i was for a little while where it's like you can just get good at a sport also with school i kind of [ __ ] off in high school and i actually regret that i wish i would have like took the time to learn you know i'm getting paid to read books now or i'm i'm sorry i have all my free times to read books now i read my free time so i wish i would have taken my my schooling and my um athletics a lot more seriously because that's like the only time you have to do that and uh i uh i'm most looking forward to having children nice all right uh it's great it's a great answer what's your favorite isn't this question really hard to answer like a regret question like i feel stuck when i try to answer this question well what do you think about all the time and you're like man i wish i would have had i wish i would have behaved differently during that period of my life so i kind of let me break it up into two different groups there's like knowing what i know now oh wow like i could have done so much better maybe made more of the opportunity whether that's like you know paid my parents basically paid a bunch of money for me to go to duke it's like an expensive ass school and it's got like tons of like you know opportunity i think there was like this thing that came out which was like in the in one in like 2007 on on duke's campus there was founders of like i think seven or eight like billion dollar companies um so like i was there um i didn't know any of these people i didn't even think about entrepreneurship i didn't think about like meeting i didn't even think about like wow i'm on this campus with a bunch of really awesome people like i should go not just try to make friends and party but like who are the people who are actually working like trying to do something interesting you know who are those people who okay i'm just like focused on my classes and passing them but like why don't i actually focus on figuring out what classes are interesting to me right there's a whole bunch of ways i would do college differently if i had like had the wisdom i have today it's not really like a regret though like when i hear the word regret i think about like that word you said behavior where did i where do i feel like i kind of let myself down in my behavior and the only things that come to mind are like any time that i've been like lower integrity so like either lying to somebody exaggerating to somebody um kind of making a selfish move or like i got some benefit and other people didn't really get a benefit there's not like a big one that comes to mind but there's like really small ones that come to mind i think those are my only regrets like uh the ones that you don't sleep well and you're not proud of like a simple test i do is like if everybody knew about this move i was making would i would that be a thing i'm excited about like if i could magically get distribution and everybody knew this about me would this be something i'd be proud of or embarrassed of um or neutral and it's like basically anything that's in neutral i'm like why don't i just do it more interestingly you know like let me just take the comment and make it more uncommon like that would be all that and so that's helped me a lot and the things that i'm embarrassed of it's like that's just a sign i shouldn't be doing this and i need to like bite the bullet and like reverse course on this and like i think before i used to definitely be like an exaggerator white liar like kind of like not like nothing that harmed people but like definitely things that like benefited me and like over time i've like tried to stamp those out um so i would say like just little stupid things like that would be the only things that i actually regret whereas everything else it's like i don't know like yeah i was dumb i didn't know things at that time and whatever you know who cares i learned them by doing the thing the wrong way i learned the right way there was one time when i was 18 and like uh a limo or i was like in a shuttle from the hotel to like on a college visit or something like that and the man driving the bus was the little you know it's like a van when you're at the marriott and they take you around and he was like all right you're at your stop and i you're supposed to tip him sometimes and i tipped him five dollars he goes oh no it's okay and i said oh no you need this and i meant to say like you earned it or something and i said you need this and that's one of those things that i look back and i'm like i cannot believe that was so condescending of me i cannot believe that's something i think about all the time i'm like i can't believe i said that i cannot believe that's that's one of my big regrets dude i have like 10 of those have i told the orlando bloom story on here no people make fun of me because i tell the story so often if i haven't told her i'm gonna tell you now okay here's one of my biggest regrets so uh i'm in london i'm 21 years old maybe and my buddy comes to visit uh for college and so i i was living in london at the time my parents up there and like so i'm like okay let's go out now i hadn't really gone out in london so i didn't kind of know where to go i didn't know the protocols the etiquettes i just been kind of hanging out with my parents at their house i wasn't drinking i didn't have a big tolerance at this time uh you know like i basically hadn't still don't yeah still don't didn't have big towers back then still don't have it my buddy comes to visit and i'm like all right i want to be cool with with his buddy uh shout out to my buddy goops if he's listening he he'll know this is him so we go out and london i'm trying to act cool because i'm like he thinks i live in the center of london he thinks i still kind of like go out like i did in college he doesn't know i've just been in my mom's apartment you know like doing nothing for like three months you know just like i don't know watching reruns of lost and so uh so i'm like oh let's go over here let's go over here i'm like oh this place is popping because i see a place just with a line outside i'm like this is the place we're going here he's like you sure we can just go to this bar i'm like no no we're going over here so we go to this place lying outside and he's like i don't think this is like a bar club it turns out it's a theater and i'm like oh [ __ ] but i'm like kind of pot committed to my like plan of like no no this place is the the best i've now picked a theater like a place but the plane just ended people were waiting outside i'm like and there's this group of girls they were all visiting for the university of georgia and uh duke university has like uh kind of notoriously like um not the hottest college girls and so these girls to me were like a 14 out of 10. and so um and so and they probably didn't have the hottest guys either yeah right like i was a strong seven at duke i'm a three-year-old private school seven public school three and so you know i'm a state school of three so so basically um i'm like okay i'm trying to still trying to recover from groups being like why are you telling me to go to this theater and i'm like because i want to talk to these girls and so now i'm like trying to act cool for these girls which was i was already failing and acting cool in front of my dude brown friend now i'm trying to focus for this girl so i'm like you're like the tinder swindler man of your friend group so i'm like what are we doing here what are we waiting for and they're like oh the other you know the play just ended and orlando bloom did a drop in at the show and so he's coming out and like we're all just waiting for his autograph face to take a picture of him and i'm like in my head i'm like like you okay do you know who orlando bloom is if i say that do you know the who who that is because you have a picture in your head i know exactly who he is okay i didn't so i'm like i've heard the name but i'm like i have no idea who this guy is or why he's famous but like clearly he's famous as a crowd here waiting for him and so we're waiting 20 minutes and i'm just chopping it up with these girls and so what year was this this would have been uh i don't know 13 14 years ago so like dude so orlando was like peak orlando bloom like exactly he's just done pirates of the caribbean i didn't i didn't know how to connect it and i couldn't ask because i'd already again told troops we got to go here told these girls i'm waiting for orlando bloom they don't know that i don't know who he is but anyways we're just kind of shooting the [ __ ] because i have this captive audience these girls can't leave they're waiting for orlando bloom so they gotta talk to me basically at this point so we're having fun we're flirting with these girls things are going well now so my night has turned around but problem is people are coming out from the plane i don't know who orlando bloom is so i'm just sort of waiting to see where the reaction comes from i'm expecting like i don't know brad pitt and his prime i'm expecting like you know bruce willis i'm expecting just like some like just some hunk to come out because like clearly all these women are waiting for him lando is pretty pretty hunky man he's pretty good person he's a lot more like um petite petite exactly the word i'm looking for so this guy walks out and he's just this kind of small guy and he's got this wispy body in this wispy mustache and i'm like this is the [ __ ] guy and so like i'm just sort of like i'm a little bit drunk i'm pretty drunk at this point i'm just like oh my god so he's facing these exciting autographs for the other people he's about to get into this car this limo and like there wasn't a lot of space you know like the distance between me and my kind of like like you know this window in front of me is two feet away that's how far he was away and he's just not turning around to like sign our autographs or whatever i don't want his autograph but somebody just tap him on the shoulder orlando orlando and like i'm screaming his name and so i said it like kind of like medium and then he doesn't turn and so then i'm just drunk so i'm like i'm just going to say this loud as i can so i'm yelling and americans are already like 40 louder than europeans and now i'm trying to be loud and so he's he's not american right now but so he probably doesn't like that either nobody liked it nobody liked it trust me like these girls who i was shocked they were like oh my god this is so off-putting why is this man so loud right now and so um it sounds like i'm just screaming and i am screaming he turns around and i just go orlando and he turns i go and i'd see his face for the first time i've only seen a petite body from behind which is basically a woman's body so he turns around and they see his mustache i go what's with the stash i thought it was from the play i thought he had left it on because it looks so ridiculous and so he's like he just sort of rolls his eyes and the girls are like you're the most uncool dude on the planet now you've annoyed orlando and he just like he starts walking into he just he just sort of aborts and the girls are pissed because he didn't like acknowledge them now either the whole section got blacklisted so he gets in the car trust me that's not the worst of it he gets on the car this is where the story ends in the in the the final crescendo and i'm like and something comes over me i'm like you know i'm like a entrepreneur i'm action oriented i'm a go-getter so i decided to be a go-getter with orlando bloom and i go to the car and there's no security because again nobody expects a buffoon to just like open up the car door so i i reach through the window he's waving bye to the fans through the through the back seat i reach through the passenger front seat into the back seat while he's waving and my hand just wraps around his um like i was going for like a high five but i'm he's waving so it's a moving target i only catch his thumb have you ever had another man's thumb inside your full hand yes one of the most uncomfortable feelings yeah i immediately sober up he looks at me like yo bro like why are you like why are you grabbing my phone and i'm just like i was like dude i'm so sorry and i just i let it go and i let go of the whole night and i basically it's the most embarrassing thing that i've done um you know since then it's never done never topped that moment so that's my biggest regret oh my god that's awesome grabbing orlando bloom's thumb as he drove away after making fun of his mustache if orlando if you if you're listening to this if if your cousin is listening to send this to orlando let him know that guy you know he was just he was just trying to impress his friend you know he was just trying to be i don't know what he was trying to do but it was an accident i didn't know we know you're trying to do you're doing it for the tail whatever everyone's been there he would empathize with that um do i don't think we should do any more i think we have to end on that that was awesome that was the best story i've heard in a long time [Laughter] all right fantastic good uh good q a just the tips uh from your boys just the tips all right we're out of here [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] did you see uh like what michael that guy michael rubin did so we talked about him a little bit to be honest i don't entirely understand what his business fanatics does but i know that like he's got three different companies right now one of them was worth like 50 billion another one's worth like a billion in other words worth like five or 10 billion like it's just like crazy it's like there's fanatics and there's like three spin-offs of it yeah exactly so um i don't have like a ton of uh you know kind of like research on him or whatever but basically fanatics itself is worth over 10 billion dollars and what fanatics does is they basically are a merch company but for sports and so what they do is you want to go buy a steph curry jersey whether you buy it in the nba shop the warrior shop or you just google steph curry jersey and you land on fanatics.com it's fanatics that's printing and they're actually like printing the jerseys and then shipping them out to customers i get that i just don't understand how can just like a rookie like a noob i mean he's not a noob anymore he's been doing this since he's 21. he's probably 55 now how can just like a guy come in and just like muscle like the people who have had those contracts for 20 decades for 20 years i also had that same exact question now i know he was kind of like successful before this i think he had done a uh it was called a gsi i think commerce and he sold it to ebay for i forget exactly how much but he made like 80 or 90 i think and then it didn't work out at ebay so he bought back some of the stuff and he grew that to be big and then he also spun out a few things so this company called shoprunner which is quite popular it's basically like amazon prime for people who aren't on amazon um he built that business and a few other things and so he started as like a ski shop when he was 18 i think yeah yeah exactly ski is sort of a ski business whatever then became like kind of apparel logistics so that's gsi commerce that's sports again sports commerce he sold that to ebay i think i don't know if you said the price 2.4 billion yeah i think he only walked away with like 80 which is a lot but uh i i don't think he i think he gave up a ton of equity and he was like in his late 30s at the time and then um and then yeah i don't know how he got the contracts but he basically just like continued licensing i don't think he got exclusive so i think he got the licenses to prince print the stuff and then over time demonstrated that like they had the best product with the best delivery with the best quality assurance and all that stuff and so they ended up being like we'll just power your shop right we'll be the we'll be the default one when you go to like the team's websites well he also bought a recently started a cards company that is making cards and they just and then he was like you know what let's just buy tops while we're at it yeah so i don't understand how he's totally just kind of brute force his way into this it seems yeah so he uh exactly so he bought tops which is kind of like a pretty interesting move we've talked about trading cards we talked about um you know like this whole thing what they're what it seems like what they're gonna do is they're gonna say all right we got the licenses from the from the sports teams we can get we can we know licensing as a business we can get the licenses for cards as well we know printing and manufacturing we can do that with the cards as well but then also with cards there's like basically it's the same customer it's the same fan so if i buy a steph curry jersey odds are i'm going to be like somewhat interested in like a steph curry rookie card and what hit the reason i want to bring him up was not because like i had some like deep insight on his like business plan although i think it's pretty simple which is like we have the sports fan as a customer what do they buy one of the things that they might buy is collectibles okay let me go buy tops and like we'll sell them collectibles but i thought his approach was smart and one that people should take which he goes right now there's like five million people who collect sports cards and um so the whole business is like these five million people and nobody has like taken a like big approach to this it's been this like hobbyist kind of underground there's like the charm of it like if you go to like the annual sports card conference it's like this yeah in cincinnati that's like you know these hobbyists bring their cardboard boxes and like some special shout out to like you know kentucky fried chicken for sponsoring this year's conference or whatever right and like eric's moms for bringing cookies yeah exactly third year running thank you mrs k um so they're like you know that's the conference right now so he's like dude why is that like that but like sneaker con is like this [ __ ] state-of-the-art thing and ces is like this epic show that's like you know like cutting it so he's like i'm gonna do all that in the tr no he's like nobody has spent a dollar on marketing collectibles like nobody like it's like this hobbyist passion industry but nobody goes out and markets this thing he's like but people have done that for sneakers and other things so i think what he's gonna do one one smart thing i like this part of the plan it was he's basically going to athletes that like to collect in general he's gonna like make it known that these celebrities oh did you know like the whatever you know like the guy from billions like the hedge fund manager has like he's gonna build stuff he's gonna build like a media company on top of this a little bit like a media company or it's a it's going to be a slick media play and they happen to sell the cards it's going to be he's going to make it cool to collect right which is a smart thing and the reason why again like okay that's just part of a plan the one part i really liked is he goes there's 5 million people who collect today and what anybody else in the space has tried to do is try to get as much take as much as they can from those 5 million my question when we bought tops was how do we get 50 million or 500 million people to collect and like that's the only game i want to play is expanding the total size of this market from five million people who do this thing to 50 million people who do this thing and i just thought like that's that's a really powerful mental model for how you how you build businesses and i've talked about this before that's the same it's the same framework as the the one that the guy from slack did when he created slack he's like yeah there's work chat tools and some people use them but he's like the reality is eight out of the ten customers that we talk to companies that we talk to they don't use a live chat tool they use email so he goes his memo was called we don't sell saddles here right because he's like if we just go to the existing people who like horseback riding they probably already have a saddle we try to convince them to switch because we got a better saddle they're kind of familiar with their ways we're always going to be in this like tiny niche but if we sell the dream of horseback riding and show people how fun it is to go horseback riding we increase the size of the overall market and then when they say oh wow i love this thing but my butt hurts we'll say great we have a saddle for you and so that's like just like a general approach to business that i think more people should take is increasing the um the size of the number of people who even want your category before saying pick me that i think more people should take is increasing the um the size of the number of people who even want your category before saying pick me have you i i agree that's a really good insight and an example of that is have you seen uh so kevin rose this tech guy for years kevin rose for some reason after i forget where he was he was either i think he was at google leading like their adventure arm he left and he became the see i think he became a part owner and the ceo of this blog called hodenki yeah i think that's hodenki and i remember hearing about that and i was like what he goes yeah it's a blog for watches and i was like well yeah there was a middle step so he created a studio a lab to incubate ideas and that's why he was even more crazy he's like yeah we're creating this like publication or this thing for watch collectors and then that got acquired i think by either hooding or that was called a dinky and it got it fired i'm not sure which one yeah they sometime this guy other he already had this blog kevin was tinkering with it and they became one and he started working on that and i was like what the heck man you're like [ __ ] about buildings yeah aren't you like yeah like a blog like what are you thinking and then i started watching some of their youtube videos and it was either kevin or the other guy who started the the site and he was sitting with john mayer and they were talking about their watches and i sat for like 20 minutes watching this like where john mayer was like yeah this watch is actually special for this reason and i was like that's that's amazing and they had this show on youtube where they were doing that and i'm not a watch guy because i don't want to spend i don't get joy i get more stressed out of spending 30 thousand dollars for something on my wrist i kind of get annoyed with it but i was watching his stuff and i was like i want to i want to own this you've turned me into a a connoisseur or i want to be connoisseur i want to be part of this exactly i want to want this i don't know how yet yes it's like sushi and wine there's a whole bunch of these things from like oh i kind of like the idea of getting into this hobby golf right like i want to want it yes and that's how i felt with him and i could see myself wanting to do this with cards i am when i was a kid did you ever collect magic cards not magic pokemon for me but yeah i did i did magic and i don't even remember how to play it and i remember like i was like just let me look on ebay see how much some of those are and i was like i'm just gonna buy some this is this is fun it'll remind me of my childhood and i would totally do that with sports cards even though i don't pay attention to sports now just remind me of my childhood i would buy like a a mark mcguire card or something like that um but yeah this is cool i think that's a really good framework actually [Music] you

buy drugs online well basically he created this website RX limited and then eventually he started like creating so many domain names that he created his his own domain registration system and then eventually his Network got so big he created his own email system because he didn't want anyone to uh hack and do his stuff and at one point he had like two or three thousand employees working at this place mostly Filipinos mostly working in call centers and he in Philippines and in Israel because he said the Israeli guys were the hardest working were the cheapest you know the cheap the for the cheap rate and he uh it was it was wild and he and he had basically hundreds of different stores selling drugs and the way it worked is he would somehow convince a doctor that he was like doing everything by the book and technically he kind of was doing everything by the book but it just really quickly warped into not but basically he had all these doctors in America in like Minnesota Kentucky Florida like these relatively small doctors and like Hey we're a tele medicine service can you fill some of the prescriptions that we're doing um it's all legal and we'll just send you the uh the prescriptions that we need and you just sign off and we're going to send it to a pharmacy so he would send it to a pharmacy and these local mom and popes would be like oh okay Dr X is um just F called in this prescription I'm going to ship it to the patient no big deal and so both the doctors and the patient uh doctors and the pharmacists they all thought that they were mostly following the law they're like this is kind of weird that I'm now shipping out I'm like a mom and pop pharmacist and I'm shipping out like 2,000 orders a week like that's weird but I have no reason to believe this is illegal and eventually it did become highly ille where like he it was just like you you didn't need to see any doctor to get any these prescriptions and at one point he was selling like 80% of all online drugs in America it was something large Ben am I missing anything and throughout doing this this is where things get even crazier so like this story in itself is already interesting literally uh it made I believe 400 million dollar in profit in four years one employee went to his apartment in Manila in the Philippines and he said that he saw $10000 million in cash in the house and he this guy like didn't want the IRS to see anything so he would just transfer it into gold because this was before Bitcoin was really around he lived in the Philippines he was an African guy so I believe he was born in like Cambodia and then moved to South Africa and then moved to the Philippines or maybe he was like Zimbabwe uh something like that but this guy had this like grandiose thinking where he thought that he like he's like I owe it to the world to run the world very grandiose thinking and so he hires these ex-israeli guys to run the call centers eventually he hires these ex-israeli army guys to be his bodyguards and in doing that he starts learning a little bit about like arms dealing and So eventually he buys thousands of acres of land in Zimbabwe and Somalia and he was like I'm going to raid an African nation and I'm going to set up like a country and I'm going to have my own I'm going to be the leader of of of a small African nation and hopefully eventually uh a much larger Nation like some crazy [ __ ] and [ __ ] it expands to the point where he's now an arms dealer so he's selling guns to different parts of Africa he gets in trouble for selling missiles to Iran like this guy gets into some crazy stuff he's killing people along the way he makes relationships with Columbia drug lords And Trades drugs uh pills for cocaine and he starts selling hundred millions of dollars worth of cocaine and he was doing all of it almost almost all of it behind a computer and eventually he gets caught now he's got he recently in like three or four years ago was sentenced to 25 years in prison uh and that doesn't include what he's uh convicted for in the Philippines so after he gets out if he gets out he's going to go straight to the Philippines in the US or he's he's in the US but because he's like basically a drug lord they won't say where he is and so you can online you can barely find any pictures of him other than one picture of his mug shot and that's the only pictures that you the one where he looks like really big that's his mug shot that's the only picture that I've really seen of him recently and uh the guy it it's just this is it's one of the craziest books I've ever read and what I I started talking to you about Satoshi because a lot of people think they're like well we don't I don't I don't really there's not a ton of evidence of so that he uh invented Bitcoin but he was talking about like creating a digital currency early on when he was arrested Satoshi quit blogging and you could read a lot of this guy's emails and that's really interesting and that's kind of how I got to the other topic of Satoshi where you can like read all his old blog posts but this guy it's incredibly fascinating he would have been an awesome business person had it not been for you know going the wrong route but it's a crazy book what was in the emails you just see him commenting with people so he was actually like a really good writer for a little while and he even uh this guy is so interesting he wrote guest posts I believe for the Washington Post under a pseudonym talking about like the future of money and like all these weird economic stuff but he uh he was somewhat eloquent and but in person he was uh brutish he was an [ __ ] he was disgusting he would just they would go to McDonald's and he wouldn't even talk to his employees he would kind of tell them to f off he wasn't very pleasant to be around and uh but in the emails he wrote pretty pretty nicely actually what are you gonna say Ben they found 500 pounds of cocaine on his yacht when it crashed which was worth like a hundred million and he also owned a logging business in Somalia at one point he was like I'm going to create a business that will fend off so basically all the Western countries driving through Somalia if they want the Pirates not to talk to them I'm going to be the goet and I'm going to get money from them and I'm going to pay the Pirates off and take a little bit of profit he owned uh he owned that business he also was in the mining this guy did like at one point the da the district attorney of I believe New York said we think this is the most dangerous and powerful man in the world and all of it was done on the computer and he he his his he was very early in all this like he's very kind of in the ballpark as a lot of the crypto guys and like some of his ideas even though he was a criminal were like totally on point with the Bitcoin stuff so it's super fascinating yeah there there's an article that says how the case for why he might be Satoshi I haven't read it yet but I when you're talking I just pulled it up you say he did it all behind a computer but and my research on this is old I I I was looking at the story like a year ago um but didn't don't I remember a story about him like throwing someone off his yacht and having people shoot them in the water something like that yeah but it in that particular story he wasn't there but he did Kill A lot of people think that he did kill one so throughout the Shawn he had his Hitman he had Hitman that are now arrested and they like kind of are spilling the beans he had Hitman that would kill people and there are a few occasions where they think he actually is the one who fired the bullet so he and he did travel so he would go to Africa he would go here but he the guy had like 3,000 employees and most of the employees had no idea who he was and even there'd be times where he'd be managing um so basically he had two Israeli Brothers running this call center in Israel with like 300 employees and they had never met Paul and Paul would talk to them via email uh you know as employees and it's kind of like interesting because like Anonymous work is something we've talked about but that's pretty much how it was so some of his employees had no idea who he was so in a sense it wasn't all behind a computer but a lot of it was behind a computer this uh this article I pulled up about him it says uh he's the Jeff Bezos of of organized crime and it says he's the uh he's the digital El Chapo uh because he was moving so much weight he was he was given up for adoption by his birth parents that rejection haunted him and then it says um he was you know transformed himself into a programming genius who developed encryption software like e4m in the 90s he founded RX limited which was the black market for pharmaceutical he was raking in $250 million a year selling drugs weapons and murder For Hire on the dark web yeah well that I think that the dark web thing is actually confusing because a lot of the stuff that he was doing was before Tor was even around so a lot of stuff he do it wasn't even on the dark web and like this whole thing about spamming email he was actually one of The Originators of that and so he uh somehow hacked into a far a pharmaceutical company and stole something like hundreds of millions of email addresses and he would spam these guys like crazy and the reason why he bought all these domain names is a domain would get banned then he would switch a domain so it was a incredibly complex what he did and he uh before he turned to the dark side he founded a uh or he built like a small open source product that helped encrypt things and uh it eventually turned into this thing called true Crypt which I actually think that thing is big but uh so like the guy was pretty genius he was amazing it says his first murder was he took his head of security he said hey come to my house in the Philippines and dig a hole I'm going to bury a safe filled with millions of dollars and then the guy dug the hole and then he shot him with the machine gun right after that that was the first his first taste of murder and then there's another there's another story where they they took a guy out and to the ocean and they go let's just have a a talk on our yacht and they throw the guy in the ocean and they drive away so he gets he freaks out and then he comes back and he shoots all next to the guy and he goes oh no no just so you know I didn't miss I'm just trying to keep the Sharks away because I want to talk to you and I need to know are you stealing from me and if you tell me quickly I'll kill you now if you don't tell me I'm just going to shoot you in your leg and I'm going to drive off wow and so like he the guy was really hardcore yeah he makes you know whatever the wolf of Wall Street look like a a small puppy um this guy's insane okay wow never heard of this guy either how' you hear about him how' you how' you find out about so when I I tweeted out that I love like crime books and I I think I I had just finished uh I forget what I had just finished but someone suggested this book called Mastermind and it's a buy this journalist that worked at Wired Magazine and I've been reading this book and it's freaking crazy and even though this guy what he did was wrong it does like actually inspire me to like live a more adventurous life well I'm like reading this and I'm like why the same way I'm the same way I'm like why am I so fascinated by this like this is why I don't like watching Wolf of Wall Street I'm like why does this excite me so much like I I'm beginning to normalize this in my head and think this is okay I can't watch this anymore but I do think that there is a thing where like I can I need to have a little bit more Adventure you know you could use it for good but you know I read it and I'm like Intoxicated by it do you get that way yeah I think that's why people love movies about you know prison you Prison Breaks or they love it about Bank bank heists and like why people play act you know video games that have violence in them it's like there's definitely like a part of us that you know this stuff appeals to and like you know if you can get that outlet by just reading the book or watching the movie or playing a video game like good cuz you know you didn't it didn't translate in that that kind of Dee rooted desire for like you know either Adventure thrill power um you know you know whatever it is doesn't have to like spill into your your normal life then yeah and it it it like inspires me a little bit in the sense of like man living life on the edge is crazy I don't want to go to prison but you should just add that to your bio you know top Inspirations Pablo Escobar Paul Ross Al right so Heroes and one of the reasons why it's interesting is the the cool thing about criminals online is that you can read their correspondence so like they got they when they arrested him he had his computer open and so they were able to see a bunch of stuff and that's I really love that this era about criminals and uh how you can like see it happening and that got me interested in these Satoshi post so basically if you go to like uh if you just Google like Satoshi you know the guys created bitcoin if you go to Satoshi blog post you can I was reading all of his blog posts and the what what what I found to be really fun is you go to his first blog post where he talks about introducing Bitcoin and you can go to the the form is still up and you I I spent about an hour looking at all the people commenting on it and Googling all of them and seeing what they're doing and what they're up to and you could see them like reply like hey Satoshi you know this is actually a really good idea I've been tinkering with this I went ahead and purchased 500 Bitcoins just to try it out you know what I mean it it's really fting the first few comments I think weren't uh like I think if I remember correctly the original comments like it's not like this thread blew up and people were instantly like genius you know this is a breakthrough this is a genius idea right like that's not what uh no it was like this is cute right and so like like literally the first comment so um so so you there's you know sep hurger says great stuff this is the first real Innovation so this guy recognized it for what it is this is the first real Innovation uh in money since the bank of England started to issue promissary notes for gold in the vaults which became Bank notes I believe an open source currency has great potential a bit like Google has become the default search engine for many of us and then like then there's some people who are like you I have questions about how it works and then there's like how finny who I think halin got the first transaction like um Satoshi sent it to him and I think he had the most questions about it which is why some people think halin was Satoshi Nakamoto um and I think he was also the first one to like write out the like the total addressable market for it I remember reading that one time where he's like well if this got adopted like you know each one of these coins is going to be worth like over a million dollars right and he like broke down why which is like you know it's hard to even discuss that now today that's sounds weird imagine 2009 you're on a forum and you know somebody posts this thing about how they're creating you know the new world money and you're like well you know that means this little random thing that I could go mine on my computer you could just send me 5,000 of these right now like yeah that each one of those could be worth a million dollars and to me that was really impressive the people who saw it for what it is which is like you know a true Innovation something that's great something that could catch on I'm pretty Blown Away by that me too I think it's amazing when I read it I I feel inspired and I think that's why I got obsessed a little bit with Paul laru is like just these people who just have the self-belief and vision even if it's like a horrible vision and go out and like do it it's in there in the depths of the Internet it's really interesting and this and and I've been reading all of the uh satoshi's Forum posts and just seeing these just like you can click and see these guys profiles like they're wearing fedoras and like crocodile dudy hats like they're the nerd the nerdy or the nerd the guys who like I would dismiss and like oh what do you like okay nerd like you're smart but like you're just outlandish I can't believe anything uh that you're doing you read this and they're incredibly thoughtful and they like are taking it seriously right off the bat and I admire that and uh it's a really really fun thing to read yeah I think it's on the you know who I think there was like a forum it was called the P top foundation or something like that was the the original Forum that this was on it was like a ning Forum or something like that and so you know the people who hang out in these types of forums right they're obviously like pretty hardcore either into peer-to-peer into cryptography into the these different subjects and so you know um hanging out at the fringes hanging out I gave a talk recently for um a bunch of people in the midwest they like zoomed me in and they were like we just want you to talk to our group and one of them asked they go you know you said something about like surrounding yourself with interest you know like interesting people how do you do that like what do you actually do to do that and I basically told him I go um I'm a pretty like normal person like I like catchy songs by Katie Perry I don't have like great music dates I like something's in the top 40 I'm like Ah that's pretty good you know like it's not like I have this like this nose for the next big thing but there are people who who have that that's their superpower and so I used to make fun of those people because every time they would do something weird I would be like H weird and then I'd point out how weird it is and I would kind of laugh at it and they didn't really care cuz they weren't trying to be cool anyways um like I remember my in colge the guy who lived next door to me uh this guy toi he was I walked in he was like playing a video gam playing Starcraft or something like that and he like turned to talk to me and the game kept going and I was like are you even playing like are you just are you just this this a computer and he was like he's like yeah I'm just he's like no I'm watching uh the match from last night in Korea I'm like what you're watching somebody else play video games it's back in you know must been 200 six or something like that and he's like yeah I'm watching a recording of this game this match that happened in the Ian server and I'm like dude say five more lame things like you know than that like I I'll give you $100 if you can say tell me you're a virgin without telling me you're a virgin exactly I was just like oh okay like never coming in this room again and then later like you know fast forward 10 years or whatever sell sell our company gets acquired by twitch and all of a sudden my title is like director of Esports or something like that and he calls me he's like you [ __ ] he's like oh Mr Esports now huh and I'm was like yeah dude it's a big thing you know you you were on top of it and like I sort of you know was embarrassed cuz like it was so true I was making fun of that behavior and then sure enough that becomes like such a you know like a billion it was a multi-billion dollar idea was watching other people video games and so I I kind of learned the hard way many times making making a fool out of myself on that where like now when I hear something weird I'm just immediately like let me pull up a chair so tell me like why do you do this do other people do this how often you do do you do this like and the weirder it is the more I want to lean into that phenomenon because I know like it's just a matter of time until I discover that this is like a totally normal behavior it's like oh you only drink soilent for all your meals like oh interesting are there is there Community people who do this yeah we're called you know whatever biohackers there's a subreddit with like tens of thousands of us like oh interesting you know you can start to see that the you know the future is is already here it's just not everywhere and like how do you how do you get closer to the Future you just find people who already live in the future do weird stuff and then you don't judge them in fact you just like complete have the opposite reaction I used to have and this exercise of reading these old blog posts and all the commenters is I think you just kind of put it in a little more eloquent eloquent way but that's exactly what's happening is like you're seeing like I'm trying to pattern recognition is kind of a stupid buzzword but like you're trying to like see like well I know for sure that a this sounds silly at first and B it worked so like what does this like pattern of like people dismissing and like coming up with like like and how do I not make that same mistake the guy that you talked about uh what was the for called the p uh yeah I I so I on the very bottom of the Forum it says like about and you could like read who the owner is and he's just a professor in Berlin or something like he's just a guy and uh it's pretty fascinating I'm like man like all these people were it's it's it's like you know they they they this kind of weird to say but they're like they they were around when Jesus was around like you know like they like saw this like thing that like potentially changes one the next thousand years or the next 500 years of history and they like saw it and I think that's really fascinating so dude uh I put this in the milk road I don't know if you saw this thing about like so Peter the big Bitcoin conference just happened in Miami yeah that was really that was really good uh on Friday you did that right yeah I did that one on Friday was rated one yeah that killed it that was so good but did you I don't know if you saw the clip I think I link to the clip in there of so Peter teal goes and gives his talk at the Bitcoin conference in 2022 just happened and he the before he comes out they played on the on the big screen this video that I had seen before I think I even talked about it on here once but there's this video I I've watched a ton of old Peter teal videos there's a video of him giving a talk in 1999 and he's talking about the idea of a currency not owned by uh by the government and basically this like this two-minute clip of Peter basically describing Bitcoin without saying the word Bitcoin and he didn't know how it would work but he's like you know the world needs a currency that's not controlled by you know the central banks of different countries blah blah blah and I think PayPal originally that was their Vision was to create they used to have shirts that said one currency to rule them all or something like that it was like this the original idea of PayPal was to create one Global virtual currency and they shifted away from that later like and he he at this talk he goes yeah we went to something that was more practical and it kind of worked but like it was less ambitious and like you could tell he kind of like regretted it which is like we before we wanted to create our own Financial system and then like we really hard and we settled on oh PayPal it's a payments Network that like it works with your existing bank with the existing dollar currency and with your to send to somebody else's existing bank so we're just like a funnel to like funnel money through and like yeah that was cool but like um man this other thing was the big idea and Bitcoin kind of proved that that was the big idea you know later on but him giving that talk in 1999 to me is so crazy like that's one of the greatest like calls I've ever seen of just calling it with what's going to happen why it's going to happen and in that talk he's like he's like uh you know the this currency will live on your cell phone outside of a bank um you know smartphones are going to be a thing and you think about it's like oh 1999 man iPhone came out in 2007 so he's predicting smart he's like we're already seeing the adoption of smartphones in Finland and he also he gave a 5-year term and you're like he it was 10 but he got it right yeah he's like a billion he's like there will be a billion smartphone devices in the next 5 years it took 10 years but like a billion devices like there was never a there was never a billion user product like there weren't a billion people who had computers ever um there weren't a billion people I don't even think they used televisions I think the cell phone was the first thing where it was like a smartphone was like the first thing where a billion people had this product so of course if you launch an app that works your addressable Market is a billion people who can download your app like immediately like it's kind of an overlooked fact about why mobile was so big it's just like well there wasn't ever a billion people who could have used your product before this like your restaurant could never serve a billion people your store could never serve a billion people like McDonald's couldn't even serve a billion people no matter how many locations they open like the cell phone was really the first thing that was able to do that you know that quickly and um and so he's you know when he was talking about like smartphone adoption is rising in Finland I'm like who even pays attention to what's going on in Finland dude like if I ask you right now if I said point to Finland on a map could do you think you could point to Finland on a map right now like me neither and so me like Finland Denmark and like Holland and Sweden are all the same thing yeah exactly like I don't know dude it's like that's where white you're clean and you're nice I get it like it's and so like I thought about that I'm like oh no wonder the people who were hanging out with Peter teal went on to do like some pretty hold on what hey Ma sorry there's some my bad there's some like random guy like knocking on my window all right sorry go ahead so I was saying that you know that it's no wonder that people hanging out with Peter teal ended up going on to do amazing things right like if you've ever heard of the PayPal Mafia it's like yeah like people who worked at PayPal went on to create YouTube and Linkedin and Tesla and SpaceX and Yelp and affirm and like I think there's like over 10 billion doll companies that came out of the PayPal Mafia and um like Kaa like one of the best nonprofits came out of that and so it's like dude why is that it's cuz you're hanging out with a bunch of people who are already thinking about the future living in the future they're all weird nerds and I remember the one of the co-founders of PayPal Max Lin he had this thing where he's like he was interviewing somebody and the guy started like talking about how like he's like yeah I love to play pickup Hoops he's like we're not hiring this guy he like why he's like oh my God he's like he's like no no great program I know plays pickup basketball he's like dude well that's what we said about the guys who were doing icos we're like dude if your teeth are really white and you got abs and if you have a Ferrari and if your last name is also a first name that's four out of four you out like like if your last name is Tucker or John like you're out like no St John's exactly and so you know these things like I mean you get canceled today for being like I'm not going to hire somebody who plays pickup Hoops um but like and and I think they even said something back then they go your goal as a startup is to basically build a cult and they're like the more cult like you can make your company the better and like that's not popular I think they've all they don't say that stuff in public anymore cuz now they're like you know big public figures but like I think that startup advice is actually fantastic startup advice now the cult doesn't need to be all people of the same race or gender or anything like that it's like people who are all believe like religiously in the mission and then people who kind of behave in a way that's like they're willing to work way hard or sleep in the office like you know they're they're willing to go to bat for this thing because you know they're like members of a cult they sort of have lost them their own personal identity to the greater identity of the group that is like a pretty hard Force to bet against and beat dude this gets me inspired how how do you think this was actually a third topic I was going to ask you how do you think guys like Peter teal who I I don't know his background but I think it was pretty modest uh how do people like him how are they write so often or I mean do they just make a ton of guesses and they're only WR a couple times but it I I don't understand like that idea of think I think I think big and then I like talk to or listen to him and I'm like oh I'm like I'm I'm nobody yeah uh dude when you hear him talk it's like when you're in a plane that takes off and all of a sudden the houses start to look like little toys and the people start to look like ants the cars look like you know little Flex it's like that's how that's how my brain feels when I hear Peter teal talk I'm like oh I am a small simpleton you know I'm a single cell organism compared to this guy in terms of just like where where my brain goes how how much conviction I have around my own original thoughts because like that's his thing right like he's all about being a contrarian and um you know I think Jeff Bezos said this about Peter till he goes yeah that's the thing about contrarians they're usually wrong you know and somebody else said like you know Peter's constantly predicting sort of like the end of the world and the market crash and like you just remember at the two times he was right in the 20 years and like the four times he was wrong it just seemed like he was a little bit late on his prediction and um so so I think there's definitely something to like you know being wrong a bunch but it's like when you're it's more like when you're right you're right in a major major way and I think he was right about PayPal in a major way he was right about uh Facebook in a major way right he was the first investor in Facebook he bought a 500 bought a 10% stake in Facebook for 500 Grand right so like that was the best investment of the decade I think you know like at that time and so you know he was right in a major way about that um you know the last time he kind of went on tour he was right about two very contrarian things one was Trump where all of a sudden like he was the only guy in Silicon Valley that was like publicly supporting Trump went spoke at the at the convention was like we need Donald Trump to be president and at the time it was sort of like Donald Trump was the underdog he was not supposed to win and like Peter teal picked that horse pretty early I thought that was kind of impressive and like also he gets off on being contrarian you could tell uh and then the the other one that he was right about was uh when he created the teal Fellowship so he basically went on stage which was laughable at first and he had he had this talk where he goes and he goes uh University you know college education is a bubble it's the greatest bubble since the housing crisis this is right after the the housing bubble popped he's like the next bubble is college education people like who goes against education like go ask a hundred out of a hundred politicians parents anybody who's not pro education and like he was the first guy to be like college education is a complete bubble and he explained why it was a bubble that like you know people go for basically this like certificate this he goes it's a he goes it's an insurance product partially he goes uh you know it's insurance for you know parents to buy for their kids so that they don't fall through the cracks of society he said it's like a a a a certification product you know you don't go there to learn you go there to get your certificate um and so he he's was calling out college and then he created the teal Fellowship which was kind of a genius move because he put up I think at the beginning $2 million but that $2 million was like $200 million of free publicity for himself because he he made it bold where he's like not just like here's an alternative to college for people who don't want to go he's like welll what it is it was he came out he goes I will pay you $100,000 to drop out of college and it's like oh [ __ ] you know like keep this man away from my children like you know it was like a seemed like a not good thing to do and then he explained why he like college is is you know a complete bubble but then how did he get his money back from that again I think he invested in the projects I'm not sure well for example ethereum came out of that which is a $300 billion product uh which is kind of ironic cuz he doesn't he never claimed Victory on it and in fact at the Bitcoin conference he kind of [ __ ] on ethereum which is a bit weird um so you know I don't know why he's I I I would think he'd be taking a Victory lap because like vitalic being a a teal fellow was like the total validation of the the teal Fellowship but I think figma invested in uh owner.com you know owner.com you ever see that company I know about it yeah he's a he's one of those guys I and about two or three more I've invested in about three of them maybe yeah um yeah I heard kind of mixed things about the the program itself but like there's no doubt like good stuff came of it like if if just figma came out of it the program was like a win you know like i' say 10 billion came out of it yeah damn dude and so you know and there's many others there's a bunch of other winners that have come out of it too but like so so this guy's like been uh you know contrarian and right many many times it's very impressive to me it's more impressive to me than people like obviously he's very successful so it's not even like that or success but if you just showed me one person who's very uccessful and another person who is like an original thinker who's right when they go against the grain damn I'm more I have a lot more respect and admiration for the person who was went against the grain and had an original thought that was right yeah and it uh it's inspiring I um I was reading today and it said that uh this is like kind of a weird a weird tangent but Jared Kushner all right you know Jared Kushner uh yeah so who so who is he he's he's married to to the Trump or his brother is married to the Trump uh so there's Jared and Josh Josh is the younger one I think he's like 35 he's married to a model and he runs Thrive which is a VC thing that's like immensely successful his brother is Jared who I forget his title in the white house but he was like Trump's right-hand man and he's married to I yeah and like a lot of people think he's evil he probably is a little bit he kind of has like a skeleton vibe to him like a Skeletor the the villain and He-Man or whatever it was so he like kind of has like a vibe to him but he just announced that uh like a few months after leaving the white house uh he he he founded a $3 billion do private Equity Fund and like regardless you put politics aside um like it crazy that that's just like your thing like you you ended that you you ended one like like when I end a job I take like a a lot of people take like a three-week vacation and they go start another job that's like 20% higher in salary and a little bit better title and like he just like was like oh you know like I've got some straight time now I'm going to like you know be B Boop just do this thing it's just a$3 billion fun and like I find that to be it's the same thing of like I feel like an ant and you are not that you know what I mean yeah exactly um I I know exactly what you mean it does beg the question of like you know why why do I not go bigger and also um you know is there a reason that I don't go bigger like is there a reason Sam that you don't go create a $3 billion private Equity Fund there's there's two reasons the first is fear so like it is scary to do that to like raise like for to raise out failure yeah to raise outside money and [ __ ] it up that's bad but number two I do think that there is I don't know if Peter teal has this but Elon mus for sure has this did you read that article in the New Yorker or New York Times where he describes his life he's like basically he was talking to the interviewer and he was starting to cry in the interview and he's like he's like you don't want to be me yeah he basically said he's like I missed my brother's wedding I or he was like I was about to miss it but flew in at the last minute I saw it immediately got on the plane he was like there was like a time a few weeks ago where for 5 days I didn't leave the factory I didn't see the sunshine I don't see my children uh I had a birthday but no friends came and said happy birthday to me cuz I was running around uh the factory and like I'm lonely and I'm pretty sad to be honest and frankly death I look forward to it as a way of relief that's like what he said he said all that yes and uh Jesus Christ the whole death take a nap bro take take a nap just do it just try it a little advice one brother to another take it that well and it's like so I think there's one aspect where it's like well I don't want to like be this like the slave to this computer in the machine like f that um and I want to live life but I do think that there and I I I haven't formulated this entire this thought entirely I do think there's a world where you can go big and have some work life balance so actually so do you think that's true yeah of course of course it's true uh you just got to decide your terms right like um and and as soon as you decide those terms watch you'll figure out a way to make it happen or you'll find people who make it happen I I am so anti there's one way to win or there's even one definition of winning like that's if I if I could just be the anti- one thing that's the thing I'd be most Anti because I used to follow into a trap I'd see somebody doing something one way or I'd hear advice that makes sense and then I'd kind of like it's like in life I found the counterfactual it's like wait but this guy doesn't do that wait this this this that lady did both right like so hold on if both is an option then I'm taking both every day of the week it's only when I accept that both is not an option I fall into this trap of misery of around picking one or the other right of like lifestyle and uh and like you know ambition so um so I definitely think you can do both I play this game though so I have two games that I play about any project that I'm doing this is kind of like my I kind of EXA coach myself and I really always asked two questions I go I go f the first question is if and I asked this other Founders too which is if I was to meet up with you you know if we hung out 12 months from now we're grabbing a beer and I'm like hey what happened with that thing man what happened with trends that was such a cool idea like what went wrong what do you think is the most likely thing you're going to say in that moment where you're like ah dude here's what you know here's where we we messed up or here's what was we turned out here's what we thought that we turned out we were turns out was wrong um so it helps you identify the riskiest part of your business either the riskiest assumption you're making the thing you need to go validate or the risky path that you're going on where you're cutting off other options or you're not you know you're really leaving yourself you know one move away from failure so I always ask that question and the way I don't know why like if you just ask somebody straight up like what's the biggest risk in your business they answer it one way it's like but this other way with I think people can relate to which is like if I see you a year from now and we're just grabbing a beer hanging out it's like I just let's just presume already it's gone wrong was the cause of death you know like what what do you think was the reason that that so that's one the second one a game we played yesterday with the milk Road um it was it's called the the why the [ __ ] aren't you game and it's basically it's like it's like either why the [ __ ] are you or aren't you which is like what part if I was just an objective person looking at what we're doing would I say why the [ __ ] are you guys doing this like why aren't you hiring somebody to do that it's taking you five hours a day and like you should totally you could could you not find somebody to do that part or like why aren't you like why aren't you at this Bitcoin conference like aren't you building a crypto product like shouldn't you be at this event um like there's just like this series of like why are you or why aren't you and it's like why the f aren't you which kind of distills it down into like what's the obvious good idea or bad idea like good idea we're not doing or bad idea that we are doing um that I would criticize about ourselves and we both came up with a list of like three things and it became like oh wow we should just correct those now uh rather than like so then what's your answer why aren't you going bigger assuming that you're not going big which is not a fair a fair assumption but for the sake of discussion yeah um so I I wouldn't say why am I not going bigger like the Jared Kushner question you mean or the questions I was asking just now the Jared Kushner question um because I want to have you know enough meaning I want to have a I want to be able to know what is enough and I want my vision of success to be bigger than just what's going on in my business so it's like to me if you said paint to picture of what winning looks like it's not just a number in an account or a number in my sales dashboard it's like a like I talk about this all the time it's this perfect Tuesday it's like my normal day is perfect for what I want and that includes like just like right after this I'm going to go work out with my trainer in my home gym like that's a part of my perfect Tuesday and if my business then requires me to not have time to do that and I'm like getting fat or whatever or it doesn't provide me enough money to be able to afford that then it's not winning right um it's like you know being able to like take my daughter to swim class like things like that like those are part of what winning looks like to me and so I'm just not going to like deviate from that I'm only gonna the only thing I question is not why don't I go bigger it's is this picture the picture I really want or is this outdated and do I need to update it you know and like that's the thing I find myself being like oh man I haven't updated this picture in a while or there's just like a gap over here where I don't know what I want what would it feel like to know what I want okay well let me get let me figure that out Ben Wilson tweeted out uh it's a superpower to know what you really want right Ben is that was that the Tweet uh yeah uh I TW that what what did you see or hear that made you tweet that um so what I saw is that I I've had a bunch of people reaching out to me recently and the people who were like hey I'd love to connect I get so annoyed with I'm like you just dumped something on my plate for me to like figure out which I just don't want to do whereas the people who are like hey I really love what you do I'm also a podcaster my podcast is this size I want to get it to this size I having trouble in these two ISS areas and I'd love to talk to you about it I'm like great you know exactly what you want I will I will gladly give you that um and uh it's just it applies almost everywhere in life like the guy who comes up to you and is like hey do you have any spare change no I don't have any spare change hey I need $2.50 to get a ride home on the bus do you have $250 all right I guess I got $2.50 like it's a superpower in every way so uh so so I like that you said that there's a a tweet that my cousin put out yesterday my cousin he's on Twitter Ro her great guy according to Twitter he's killing it I I don't I haven't talked to him in forever but like his updates killing it at looking like he's killing it I don't know if he's actually I haven't caught up in it a while I I'm not disrespecting him at all I'm saying like his like his updates are amazing he just bought like 20 ,000 Square F feet or something like he's on top of the game yeah and actually he did a good job of figuring out what he wants bro you just called out your cousin you should take that back what I love a cousin now he's great but I actually met that as a compliment there's a skill there's a skill especially in his line of business which is real estate there's a skill to putting forward your like putting your either your brain on brain forward like sharing ideas like he put out a thing of like how I do diligence on properties and it's like a great checklist it's like oh you're just putting out great on information it makes me trust you makes me think this guy knows what he's talking about or if it's like like our friend Nick Huber does this too it's like he'll send us a picture of him smoking a cigar you know playing golf at you know 1 p.m. it's like wow this guy must be killing it like you don't you don't get to go out smoke a cigar and play golf you know 1 p.m. regularly unless you're doing really well it makes me more likely to invest in Nick Huber's storage company that I know that he's doing well in life like some people take it as an anti signal like oh why isn't he working hard to me I'm like no if you're if you're able to like do well in life that means you're doing something right and so he tweeted something out he goes I'm looking for like a car like a new SUV it's like kind of a general vague thing and sobody go and he that he like defined it right afterwards so specifically he goes the exper you know the user experience of a Tesla the size of an Escalade the um he goes with enough room for three car seats and a pair of golf clubs and I was like first of all isn't there just a more fun way to look for a car like just to kind of Imagine really what you want and like sink into the vividness of like just having it and not like worrying about like well Tesla doesn't make a big car like an ESC no factu that I'm not I'm not grounded in reality I'm living over here in my reality of what I want and he's only he's got one kid so I'm like you know three car seats all right he's planning ahead like that's good and um and I just thought it was a great example of like specificity so so to me a lot of people are vague in general when they should really be being specific and then the opposite is also true sometimes people are like man I don't know what I want specifically and they get tied up in a knot because of that and my trainer had a great framework for that he goes you got to know when to be General and when to be specific he goes if you uh like sometimes will tell you you need to be more specific with what you want that means like the type of description my cousin gave about like you know the lifestyle that that that what he described as a car is not just a car it's a lifestyle and um and then the second thing is like when do you be V when do you be General so somebody trainer I was like well what if I don't know what I want right like if he said what you know what's your body goal right his personal trainer I'd be like well I don't really have a picture like I don't know if I want to like I could say oh I just want to have like a 12pack but I don't even know if that's true right I'm like I don't know exactly what I want and he's like cool just imagine satisfaction he goes just just first get to a place of feeling satisfied about it where you don't Str you're not stressed about it anymore he goes he goes you know relief is a very powerful emotion satisfaction is a powerful emotion he goes most people feel relieved one time a day and it's when they poop he goes and now people bring their phone in and they're not even paying attention they miss it they miss out on the one moment of relief they were going to have that day he goes so I get good at feeling relief I want to practice feeling relieved and satisfied because once you get good at feeling relieved and satisfied you know what things you want you're you're faster to figure out what things you want that will lead back to that emotion and like you're just better at being satisfied from a meal or a workout or whatever it is these daily things in your life he goes let's he goes and so we made a a deal it's like I'm I'm going to be relieved more times than I poop today and it's like that's the goal that's the first goal hilarious this is all from your trainer yeah what a smart ass dude by the way to talk about the real what your cousin's doing on real estate I've talked to a bunch of these real estate guys so and I'm friends with a lot of them Keith waserman um uh Chris uh Fort is that his name last Fort yeah I think so uh Nick Huber Moses Kagan your cousin's getting in there the strip mall guy so there's like 10 of them that are like really popular maybe 20 and I see the returns they're really good and the fees that they charge are crazy high or but like you know who cares it's I'm in Nick's hu thing it's a huge fee but like I I'm getting a good return so I don't care it this is one of the coolest things that's happening on Twitter right now is these real estate people are just crushing it all through Twitter it's pretty amazing I think some of them have shared that they bring in like tens of millions of dollars of investor money just off of people who are like I'm a fan of your Twitter yes uh which is like that means if you're in real estate like do what my cousin doing do what these guys are doing like up your Twitter game because it is going to lead to more deals and it's going to lead to more investors in your fund that you don't have to go knock on doors for it's way easier to just tweet out stuff than it is to go like do one hour calls and seminars and webinars and iners meetups trying to like shimo for a buck well I have no idea how big Nick Huber this is Nick Huber from sweaty startup I have no idea how big his portfolio is but I wouldn't actually be surprised if it was over nine figures and I bet you if it is most of it came via Twitter yeah yeah I I I don't I don't know if that's I don't know exactly but I agree with where where you're headed there and also um that that's also the one reason I haven't invested in a lot of these guys is because the fee structure like which might be to my detriment but like one thing I don't fundamentally like about real estate fees is that they all make this like 2 3% like acquisition fee yeah which like you know you will buy like a $50 million thing and it's like wow so you just banked a million dollars in your pocket just for Buy bu the thing which leads you to an incentive which is go buy more [ __ ] instead of being like really um Discerning between like a great property and a good property it's like just go accumulate and like I think Nick has a little bit of a different strategy because he's got like a kind of like a template now of like he buys the Self Storage thing he cuts out a bunch of the labor he adds in these automations and so he like has a Playbook of how to add value that I think not every investor says they have I don't think they really have it um I think Nick actually does a great job of that but like in general I would say one reason Shi away is because I dislike this incent this this incentive mismatch where like you're you're incentivized to take my money and go buy something because you get money today that's guaranteed that doesn't is not linked to your returns it's only linked to your returns over a long period of time and by then you've already banked these acquisition fees 15 times over by the time we figure out if these were good deals or not and I have no idea if they're killing it because they're skilled although many the all the people I named I I've talked to they appear skilled but I'm a novice but also they just happen to be in the game like starting 6 years ago and we're going through like the greatest like boom in real estate yeah so like of course they're killing it uh but uh the numbers are I mean I I'm investor of Nick I see the returns I'm like oh yeah dude I'll give you more but I by the way if I was Nick I would I would do exactly what he's doing I charge the highest fees I can and be like you're still getting a great return correct all right fantastic if you can go beat that return somewhere else I invite you to do it um which is like you know he's not as a front about that but like that's I would do exactly what he's doing so I don't knock for that I think that's a it's what I would do if I was in that position where I know I can generate great returns um but like on my side I just I hesitate as an investor in that sort of thing but maybe that's to my detriment um do you want to do more topics or do you want to save yours for Wednesday Let's do let's do a couple ideas uh I think people people like ideas if you made it to the end of the episode congratulations all right so let me Pitch you two ideas real quick one is called what I'm calling copy my trip Okay so I'm booking a vacation right now taking the family on a vacation and great idea I great name thank you came up with it myself yeah oh the business idea I put the idea of a family vacation um so so I'm like I'm like Googling I'm like okay let's I want to go to Hawaii for example so I'm like all right I want to go to Hawaii all right which island I don't [ __ ] know okay uh which Resort oh God here we go got to figure out which Resort and like it matters like it's going to change my experience if I go to the wrong wrong place or the right place but like and then I'm like and then all the details in between like okay so if I take my kids what do I do do I rent a car do I get car seats do I take the shuttle uh do we go on this activity is that age appropriate and so what I want is my wife follows all these influencers on Instagram they're like Mommy influencers and when they buy something she's like that's a good thing I'm GNA buy that thing too and like cuz she's like look we have the same taste and like these people they're not qu like they kind of are promoting things that they that like they have a good track record like so she's like bought a couple of the things that look good and they paid off so she's like now has more trust in them I don't get why they can't or maybe they do this I don't know but like I don't get why they're not just saying copy my trip you want to go to Disneyland literally click this and like here's the like full itinerary of like we fly into this airport we take this transportation to this hotel because it's great for families for these reasons we buy this thing this thing whatever and like I just get their whole trip that I can copy and that they have basically like a a Tik Tok or like Instagram story version that I can just browse it to be like oh yeah this looks fun I want to do this like I went on Expedia and I'm like this is awful experience overwhelming here's an overwhelming list of a 100 options ranked in five different ways that I clicked the [ __ ] thing I don't know if the reviews are real or not I'm looking at the photos they don't have all the photo it's like a it's a static photo from like a [ __ ] airplane above the resort it's like dude I just want to see like someone walk into the room and be like oh this is really nice the bed's good you know there's space over here and like oh this is cool they give you breakfast every morning like check this out like like an Instagram story right so I just think that there should be an in a Thing Called copy my trip that anyone could do it will create a profession of basically professional Travelers like people who they go find the best path of how to have a trip to you know Bali or whatever and like Sam you might follow somebody who's got like a fitness oriented angle it's like oh yeah they want to like go this person likes airbnbs versus hotels so I like aligned with them and it's like they went and trained at this gym and got mu Thai classes when they went to Thailand like that's awesome that's the type of trip I want to have so I'm going to just copy their trip as a springboard we could do it we do it for trips and weddings whenever I like saw my wife like working so hard in this wedding I'm like dude just find someone else and just do the exact same thing no one will know who cares or her younger sisters getting married and I'm like dude just do exactly what we did it was great it was an awesome wedding and of course obviously they don't like that but like yeah just do the exact same thing it was we all had a great time right uh B parties exactly birthday parties I want I want to copy your I want to copy your work which is like it's Pinterest but just like the whole thing strung together and like lifestyle you would just do it where like uh someone uploads an itinerary and then you and then you people rate it and you pay them money and buy it yeah exactly so um so you you don't even have to buy the trip like just by doing the trip those people get paid mad money from Affiliates like if I book that Resort because this person said this Resort is awesome I'm going to get a kickback of like all the things that they recommend now some perverse incentive but like everybody kind of offers a kickback so I think you can basically through Affiliates you can monetize this pretty heavily for the for the Creator themselves which which which you could do is you could say it's not about like Creator you just recommend what you genuinely recommend we're going to take the entire pool of affiliate fees and then pay it out based on Whose trip got copied even if that hotel doesn't have to pay you to like promote them you know what I mean I would do something like that where are you going Hawaii oh that's cool and and you haven't found this is not a fictional example this is real example and you haven't been able to find a a no I'm like so first I went on whatever Expedia and I was like oh God miserable don't want to do this okay what else could I do okay I could tweet this out then I'm gonna get a bunch of recommendations all right that might work but that only works for me because I got a big following all right I was like how do how do people do this and I was like okay let me go to I was like let me go look at like you know an Instagram person I follow but like they're not going to happen to post about it that day so like it needs to be saved somewhere like a link in the bi of like or like you know one of their Instagram story highlights which is is like take one of our trips and it's like you know they always do this like uh they do this with fashion it's called like um I like I buy like or some [ __ ] like that it's like if you like my outfits you can go here and like you can buy any of the items for my outfit and they get a kickback it's basically like that for trips um and then I went on YouTube and I was watching like okay you know watch this like f family Vlog at a at one of the resorts and I'm like they're okay but it's like this 8 minute video and it's just that one aspect it doesn't tell me about all the other [ __ ] that I could go do when I'm there and all that stuff so anyways I just think that elements of this happening is just somebody should make this like an explicit thing I think I uh Jack Smith uses uh uh vas to do stuff constantly and he he's like at one point he even had some vas going into hotels into different countries and like taking pictures and sending it to him to let him know what it was but on a on a lighter for real on a lighter level outrageous thing I've ever heard it's crazy and on a lighter wait did he pay for them to go on vacation like he found a local VA near he find a local person he's like hey can you go to these three hotels and take pictures and let me know and then he would like show him to his wife like all right which ones do you want uh it was pretty D I'm calling him Jack laroo from now on that's so crazy is kind of similar to that dude he just sent me a picture uh and it was him and Andrew Wilkinson and he's like look I with Andrew and they have their Ted Talk badge on and so they're clearly at at Ted together and I was like oh how funny and uh uh Jack's awesome yeah and anyway he uh does this all the time and it's actually really interesting and there's this company called flight Fox you know what flight Fox is it's is that like where you'll just is it like somebody will book it for it's like a is it a travel agent or is it the one where you're like I just want something give me like the best deal I can get which one is it it's amazing so I have no idea how they make this work so basically you go to flight Fox and you always have to click the button that says you're traveling for business and then a person you select like I want to go around this I want to go this day and I want to come back in this time or you can even say I want to go around this time um and then you like leave like notes like I've got a budget a blank or I only want first class or uh I have to be back for a wedding so I I have to make sure there's backup flights and someone on the other end pops up goes hey what's going on I'm with whatever I'm here to help you and it's a real person and they go and they find five to 10 different flights that fit what you want and then you finally say all right this itinerary looks good or you you could even reply and be like uh this one actually I had a change of plans I've got to change this this and this and they'll go and find flights for you and they find the cheapest ones and they know where to search for them and they only get paid until after you book the flight and they just take a $50 fee I have no idea how they make money and then like when I was in Portugal my flight got canceled so I just logged on and I go hey the flight you booked was canceled can you you know address it please and they call for you and they wait on hold for you and then you just pay them 5050 bucks it's amazing I have no idea how this makes money or how they can make that work yeah get it while it lasts bucks that's amazing um that's like I I I think I told you about this thing I did once mop points mop points.com it's our it's our but it's our good buddy Ramon's good buddy oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this was like one of the best things uh I did is like I booked this call with them and so you go to Mo mop points.com just like mop points.com and basically it solves the problem of like what credit card should I get and so you just call this guy and he's like all right look like again you could just Google what credit card should I get guess what you're going to get like the most SEO optimized blog post in the world because they they can make so much money off referring credit cards and you don't know if you're really getting the real deal and so I just called this guy 30 minutes and he was like all right tell me about what you spend on and tell me what you want do you want to travel like a baller like he's like look I travel first class worldwide just off this he's like I'm not rich I just but I use points to do it here's how and I was like yeah I want that and so he's like cool get the MX gold he's like you're going to get 4X points on all your Facebook ads for your e-commerce thing you're going to get one for you one for your wife so now you're going to get like 2 million points or whatever like in the next year he like then to travel you just do this you you get transfer points like don't book within their points portal because that's what I used to do I used to go to my points thing and be like uh rewards flights oh man I get like half a flight for all my chase points like no you need to transfer to travel partners and then there you need to like check this out you use like km to fly you know here here and here and he's like just call me when you want to book he's like for now buy the MX gold start racking up your points when you want to book first class worldwide just call me again and I was like dude I feel so taken care of this was like the best money I've ever spent um just in terms of the again the relief of like ah I'm in good hands right like the real all state I'm in good hands is [ __ ] Mo from Mo points dude I'm I'm a fan like these businesses I and I like the model of these things are typically monetized through Affiliates but instead you're just going to pay and I'll give you a more honest answer I actually I I like that idea a lot yeah exactly uh me me too I think it's great and um and uh yeah people should go sign up for that thing because if if you spend a significant amount on like for your business it's like I mean it just makes Financial sense to like optimize that so you're either going to get the best cash back like you know I found out oh if I use this Bank of America Platinum honors cash back card I get 2.6% back cash back which is like way higher than anybody else gives you does that mean it basically adds 2% to your bottom line yeah exactly like I I think 2.6% yeah so so you know if you're spending you know uh 100 Grand a month on ads which is like very common for e-commerce just use round round number here know you're getting $2,600 a month back um just straight to your bottom line right like that just makes sense or you can reinvest that a 5,000 person company or like BCG who sends people all around the world do they just have like a bank full of like points yeah I don't know what they do I actually asked my previous startup this I go I go what do we do with all the points we collect who gets to use those and I I think they said that they just cash them they just do the ca cash back basically or they just convert them to cash which is like not the most efficient way to use it but like you know for simp the fair way to do it and they just like you know keep it uh I like who keeps it yeah let me where is this money I kept I used our points at the hustle and I I flew first class like twice a month it was sick and when I sold the company I didn't have that perk anymore I was like damn I got to pay for a flight for the first time in four years it sucks that's how you got to negotiate that in I I kept them I got to keep all the points we had like a million points but I didn't get to uh I didn't get future points gotcha all right uh that's it I'll save my other ideas for the next one and you got a crime baby yeah I know um all right thank you [Music] what [Music]

and we did it and he tweeted it out and he went from 20 000 followers to i think close to 100 000 followers at this point in 24 hours [Music] andrew what's going on the return of andrew we promised that we promised that you would come back and um sometimes that's just something we say we're like oh we gotta do this again sometime but this was a real one so uh we're like all right when do you want to do it yeah we had like what like 20 things to get through we got through like four so what do you guys say we also [ __ ] around this time and not not address half of the topics again and set it up for a third parter i want to i do want to [ __ ] one thing and this kind maybe andrew you'll know a little bit about this but listen let me tell you guys a story really quick andrew do you know a guy named chris pronger no he is a hockey player he played in the nhl for like 20 years or something he um it's from canada i think ontario and uh he played in st louis blues he's like the fifth or sixth or seventh highest paid player of all time so for some reason he reached out to me on twitter and i started talking to him and then we went and got dinner and he wanted to he's like hey tell me how this twitter thing works like it looks cool like should i try this i was like yeah dude here's what we're gonna do tomorrow call me on zoom and the day before you call me send me five titles of what you think a tweet could be and we'll just sit and i'll just kind of like write while you talk and i'll just find the interesting stuff uh that you that you're saying and we'll go from there and we did it and he tweeted it out and he went from 20 000 followers to i think close to 100 000 followers at this point in 24 hours and the tweet was read by 10 million people and got 30 something thousand likes and this is the fifth time i've done this so i did this with my friend ramon and he got featured in all this he got he got on the how i built this podcast and business there because of that i did it my friend val who same thing we did it with um i helped do it with my friend anthony who talked you guys see the tweet thread about him living in africa and eating like only meat with like his the tribe he was staying with anyway this is this is crazy if you just take interesting people and it's not like i did any of the work they were just talking their stories i just helped them write it it's pretty wild how how this game works and what were the stories what did you share chris's was easy it was just let me let me let me tell you one because let me tell you one of them because he got picked up by bro bible so the bro bible headlines did it really nhl star chris pronger ex-nhl star chris pronger shares traps that pro athletes fall into including spending one million at a strip club and um so why do you how did it get so many like so much traffic right away i think because the story got picked up by bigger outlets like bro bible too so that adds a lot of fuel to the fire it's hilarious yeah and i retweeted it early on and but i think it's just like a he's already somewhat famous and cool and like i think sometimes they like i'm not trying to say this to brag because the reality is is like it's not that hard because the guy is already like a big deal and has an interesting life and like who's if you earned a hundred bucks dude he's not that big of a deal like well but what i mean is not that many people know chris pronger but what i mean is if you earn 100 million dollars in as a professional athlete you have like one you have there's only a thousand there's only 100 people who have that insight that you have so like the insights that are i wonder what you like if you think about the value you think about the value of what you did for him that's insane like if you went to someone and said hey i'm going to get you 10 million impressions on a tweet or i'm going to get you 100 000 followers what's that worth people pay like that's like honestly i'd say it's like a million dollar tweet or something that you gave him well uh yeah but you can't guarantee that right so it's like a hard service to sell oh dude you should do it right here right now you should say i will write i will write tweets for you but depending on the outcome and the number of followers you have to pay me a certain amount so it's totally variable um yeah that would actually be worth your time so andrew i um i uh had a right before this i was on a a twitter spaces with logan paul i was talking to logan paul so you're only the second most famous person i've talked to this morning only a little bit more famous holy crap that's crazy what's he doing these days he just launched a um like a marketplace like a fractional ownership nft things so he basically created this thing called liquid marketplace where like i don't know if you've seen but he's really into pokemon cards like charizard cards and stuff like that like that's been his thing over the last few years like these collectible either sports cards or pokemon cards and so what he did today was he launched a fractional like a rally road style uh marketplace where he would put up like you know his charizard card and you could just buy like a share of it rather than he bought the thing for two million and you could buy you know a piece of the a piece of the the pie there so that's what he launched today so that's why he was kind of doing like a promotional thing and i i was like i'll just shoot my shot and so i just like you know raised my hand or whatever and went and talked to him it's crazy the power of a the moat of a personal brand and a following right like those guys they can build they could build 100 businesses off of their following and that chris pronger guy the reason that's so valuable is he can now start his own business doing whatever he wants selling shirts selling nfts starting a consulting business managing money for other hockey players you know whatever off of that hundred thousand people the optionality of it is insane obviously the downside of it is if you're logan paul you're logan paul and you've ultimately got to be the face did you um yeah did you just say sean i was just telling him go ahead sorry we got a little delay uh yeah i was just telling andrew i talked to a little ball this morning that's the that was the on the phone or in front of people in in front of you on a twitter spaces just randomly i saw that i was listening but i i didn't his name on twitter is not i think it had a nickname on it so i couldn't tell if it was logan uh was he cool yeah he was cool i mean he was like promoting his thing which is you know he was so he that's why he was he was on there uh like because he launched a new like rally road competitor basically and uh and so i was just joking around with him basically that i know you guys covered it in the middle of a couple different things um we uh but that personal brand thing andrew you kind of got that early on because you built your personal brand back i think before a lot of people were doing it um because you kind of built it i would say pre-twitter even was that right like did did you kind of have a blog following before twitter or was it all on twitter yeah i had a blog and stuff but honestly like we're pretty quiet until coved and then during kovid i was bored and lonely and wanted to talk to people and so going on podcast was like a way to socialize um and then i realized the power of it like once i started getting uh you know thirty thousand forty thousand twitter followers i realized that when i talked about a business i was incubating i had our first thousand customers in a split second and so from my perspective you know i talked about last time about being like a dust bowl farmer mindset of what if you lose everything there's such power in that you could literally go bankrupt you could lose all your businesses you could reboot in two days with a business idea if you have a twitter following and no one can take your twitter following away obviously dude you were not low-key before twitter you were famous before that yeah yeah thank you exactly well no no i'm saying like i i i wasn't i was i was never i wasn't on a single major podcast and i was i was well known like when i went south by southwest there'd be people all the time recognizing me um from twitter but that was a very small nerdy community or whatever so i was well known within like the design community but that was it all right well whatever you say i feel like before covid we had you on the podcast and it was already one of the more popular podcasts because you were on it and people were like people already knew your story so i don't know i feel like you might be uh the timeline in your head might be a little bit different than than kind of at least the way i perceived it which was you were famous you were famous when we started the podcast yeah we started the podcast before covet so that's the word yeah my perception is like all of it has just been last three years or whatever can i give you guys saying it's true that like you you your personal brand does like kind of give you it's a door that opens more doors uh but the downside is you have to say you're you have to say to yourself i'm building my personal brand which is one of the lamest statements you could say so you know if you can live with that if you can sleep with that at night then it then it works out for you i know that it's hard for me and sam to to do that can we give you that's kind of why i haven't started my own podcast or consistently tweeted or anything all right i like i to be honest like i'm hacking your audience right i'll come on here once in a while when i have things to say but i don't want to have to always come on and always tweet and when i was tweeting consistently i was driving myself crazy because i was constantly going like okay what's my big tweet today can we um let me give you let me give you guys an update on the pod i don't know if i told you this sean or you andrew so and then we'll get into andrew's stuff when we first started i think i told sean or he told me i was like let's just get to a hundred thousand downloads an episode and i bet we can do that so sean we are now not consistently for all episodes but they just told me that a lot of a couple of our episodes are now getting over a hundred thousand downloads which is like pretty it's pretty good wow that's no that's been the goal for all of like a while like i feel like i've been that's been the north star of what would it mean to like kind of make it in podcasting it was like if we could do it where a hundred thousand downloads per episode because everybody else bullshit's like and we do this too like we get this many million downloads a month but it's like yeah you just pump out volume and like you know great the only test that really matters for a podcast how many lists per episode do you get uh that's like the best metric you can get and uh i remember we were saying the hundred thousand number back when we had like under i feel like slightly under 10 000 per episode at that time that's when i first kind of put that out there and then it's just been like climbing since then that's kind of crazy that it even happened without us like it's kind of like when i looked away from it and stopped paying attention to it like sure enough compounding just worked and it like got there you know without me having to stress it in december or no january one of the one of the last couple months we crossed two million downloads per month that year prior that same time i think was 500 000 and so i my prediction is i think we can get hit three million by december i've got no math or anything behind that but i think that seems like it could happen so anyway just want to give you the biggest like tim ferriss do per episode do you know i have to imagine he's a in the 500 000 to million range i think he's probably even a little bit higher than that i know that bill simmons or joe rogan i forgot which one it was i was looking to at the time they're they're two of the biggest i remember they were getting like three or four million downloads per episode um i think it was bill simmons at the time three or four million downloads per episode is what he was getting and he was like consistently in the top five you should do you should track though think about like um so tim ferriss has been podcasting for what eight or nine years or whatever and that's how long it took him to get to that scale you guys might actually be growing faster than tim ferriss if you chart it out well i'm already six over six feet so i did outgrow him a while back now goddess you are a very dad dad all right let's do one of the let's do some of these topics um you got a bunch on here i'm just going to say them out loud and i have no idea what these mean but i'll just pick the ones that sounds most interesting we were we were having a text thread we were kind of um texting about the idea of getting rich fast versus getting rich slow taking a big swing versus doing something boring dude i forgot i thought that was on the podcast because no that was a text message we should do that andrew can you frame it uh because i think you had you had a good take and i'm also going to give you the advantage of framing the frame the debate a little bit uh what is the debate here so i think i think anyone who's in the tech world um generally you read headlines about people who swung big and they they won big like jeff bezos and i always say for every jeff bezos there's 100 jeff bozos right so the guys that tried they failed they didn't raise the convertible debt in 1999 that allowed amazon to survive or you know they timed it slightly wrong or they were in the wrong market or whatever it is um and so if you think about it you know on one hand startups um are like a house like would you would you buy a house that had an eighty percent chance of being worth zero a ten 10 chance of making your money back and had a 10 chance of making you rich right and then let's say there's another house and that house there's an 80 chance of giving you a pretty solid return 10 chance of zero and a 10 chance of a poor return which of those houses are you going to buy and if you think about it you know when you start a business you're really saying i'm going to put 5 to 15 years of my time into this right so i am i've certainly chosen you know the boring house the 80 chance of solid return 10 chance of zero 10 chance of poor return uh i'd be curious to know you know how you guys think about it sam you want to go first so i think your numbers are i think your idea is right the problem that i had when we talked about this was i think your numbers are wrong like the whole 80 percent 10 percent now i i'm gonna let you talk about any numbers that you want to talk about with your life if you don't want to talk about anything then don't even bring it up but let's just say that so everything i'm saying right now is just made up let's just say that you you want a business that makes 10 million dollars a year okay or no let's say that you want to get a net worth of 50 million by the time you're 50. how much do you think that you would need to make a pr profit to get a 50 million dollar liquid net worth how much profit do you think that you would need if you started that business at 30. i would think that you would need a profit i actually go i did the math on this actually before and i wrote it down so if you have a million dollars at age 30 and you can invest you can produce uh profits of maybe 300 to 500k a year at between ten to twelve percent you can have a hundred million dollars by 60 with compounding so say that okay million dollar net worth is your stock so let's say you have a million dollars let's say you have a million dollars at age 30 and you start a business and that business produces 500k a year and you just take that 500k a year and you reinvest it and you manage to rein to invest it at about 10 which is a little above historical market returns let's say that you're a good investor you're a nick huber you're gonna just put it in steady eddy real estate that outperforms a little bit or something there's a full 100 million dollars by 60. yeah but there's a flaw here which is do you have you're assuming that you have zero living expenses sure yeah i'm not talking i'm not really addressing that first so you're just talking about i guess the point 300 the number you need the number you need the number you need to start with does it doesn't need to be that big like a small number can compound into something staggering if you have a long enough time horizon especially if you're out performing 10 i think is quite low um compared to what you can earn with skills so let's go backwards so you said 100 million by 60. and i think the trick with most compounding is it all kind of comes to you at the end the last two cycles three cycles is where you make all the money so so backtrack what do you add at 50 and 40 in that world i don't know we don't get public math i just did the headline calculator you can kind of you can kind of guess if you're at a 100 at 60 you're probably in the range of 50 at 50. yeah you basically double every seven years right at that pace so you're at seven and seven percent doubles every ten years 50 million ish which is sick that's right that's sick okay here's here's the question so you know everyone loves to point at people who are sitting on massive paper gains like let's say um let's say that sam started a startup and vc's invested at a 5 billion dollar valuation in reality that doesn't mean sam sam's a billionaire on paper but he's not going to realize that until the company ipos maybe he takes a small secondary maybe he's got a 10 million 20 million dollar liquid net worth but he's really not a liquid billionaire until that company ipos or sells to somebody and typically the timeline even in a tech startup is 15 years right and so my argument is you know you can take a big swing with a venture bet but i mean statistically you can argue all you want but most venture businesses fail right at least an eighty percent failure rate and maybe five at mo five percent at most go on to be something at scale and large right so i think what i advocate isn't uh go uber conservative and go get a salary or go buy a dry cleaner and work there for the rest of your life it's more what's in the middle what's the third door and i like to look at somebody like nick huber who found a niche and he said look i'm going to go buy a bunch of self storage businesses these are businesses that have been around for 100 years i have a very specific view on how to make them more profitable and he knows he can earn between 15 and 40 percent buying a bunch of those he just does that for the next 10 years he's gonna be worth hundreds of millions of dollars yeah i'm actually with you i think uh i i did this rant on the podcast that nobody liked which was that you're an idiot if you go for the olympics uh like going for the olympics is a trap that you know society has tricked you into giving up your entire life to like turn yourself into a human tool uh that can just you know bob bobsled at one tenth of a second faster than anybody else and uh you know people didn't like that because everybody likes the olympics and we're supposed to honor our athletes and blah blah blah but basically venture like venture back startups is the same thing it's the olympics of business where you're basically saying okay i'm going to swing for this billion dollar prize which only point one percent of the the startups are gonna be able to you know like to achieve this type of outcome and if i miss i get essentially zero that's kind of changed nowadays because you get to maybe take secondaries along the way if you make progress but like a lot of times i would say the average you know the median result is essentially zero or you know you've underpaid yourself by 50 to 75 percent of market salary during those you know seven years that you seven to ten years you spent trying to do it um and you worked way harder and you had a worse lifestyle the whole time so you know like the venture the venture thing is like the olympics thing you sacrifice your your lifestyle for this very rare and often like you know like at least in the olympics case sort of a trivial you know here's here's a piece of metal um you know at least at least with startups if you if you hit big you do become a billionaire so so that that that does pay off but i'm i kind of think that the venture path is that and you really only do it for ego is my like my current understanding of it which is like either you do it because it's your calling meaning you stumbled into a business opportunity or a problem you tried to solve it just so happens to be that the way this looks is going to be like a winner take all massive massive business if you do it right or you are like i want to play the ego olympics and i want to prove that i am the toughest smartest you know entrepreneur in the world and so i'm gonna go down this path and like everybody will cheer you on the media will cheer you on because hey what's it to them you sacrifice yourself for their their pleasure uh the investors will all cheer you on and call you a hero because what's it to them they get to go home every day at 4pm and you know to their house in atherton they don't they don't care you know how many hours it takes you for your like low probability of success they have a portfolio um you know so really it's the entrepreneur who in some ways i feel gets tricked into it i say that as somebody who who in many ways was tricked into it um not by anybody's evil just by the way that the game is set up and now i've come to the realization that like more nimble small lightweight businesses that provide like a lot of cash flow or businesses that you just buy instead of trying to start a new genius idea from scratch is definitely the way to go from a logical rational perspective you can still choose to do the other one because you want to do it it's more fun to you but the logic and reasoning is so far on the side of going for cash flow you know cash flow business that promotes like you know it gives you an awesome lifestyle from essentially year one or buying a business that's already working and just using your intelligence to grow it is like a far better path on paper than the venture path and i say that as somebody who kind of my natural inkling is to go towards that venture path because it's so sexy well and also i mean it can all go away on the venture path that can all go away so fast right and i think the reason why it's not done as often is people are attracted to get rich quick right nobody wants to get rich slow and like sean said the only way to get rich right now is like someone is in crypto and they're liquid and they have a massive gain but those stories are so few and far between if you want to get rich by building a business even if on paper you're a billionaire in year two my argument is you're not liquid until 10 years 15 years anyway right it's very rare that you start a business on year one and in year five you're a liquid billionaire and to me ultimately liquidity is what matters so often in these things right either you have cash flow or you can sell your stock um or you can use it in some way have you met uh michael acton-smith you've heard his name he's the co-founder of calm but before that he had um what was the name of his brand moshi monsters i think it is is that it's either minnow or motion monster i think it's moshi monsters so he was in the uk and he created essentially like a pokemon uh type of phenomenon so like i think moshi it was in the uk it was like this children's kind of like um there was like these characters and then you would like uh i don't know like it was like a game or something like that it's like this online little world you would go into and do this and that turned into many things it was a brand that turned into many things they put her they slapped those characters on shampoo and started selling it over there and he dreamed of having a theme park and you know he's a really like big dreamer big thinker type of guy super creative uh you know you wouldn't you wouldn't have created that in the first place this like phenomenon like like a pokemon or a digimon or you know these like these brands that just catch fire i think at one point like one in three kids in the uk were playing it um so it was like you know just an insane like cultural phenomenon and it was valued over a billion dollars and he was the [ __ ] man and he was you know he looks like russell brand if you see him like he's just like this like kind of like you know good looking like wait does this guy have sex in public he seems like a guy who has sex in public and it's like you know he's got this free love energy and if you meet him you're like yeah exactly he's got like you know he's got scarves he's you know maximum two buttons up on a collared shirt so like you know the guys the guy's walking around with two buttons right so he's just living his best life and so he had the persona and then he had the the movement to back it up and it just seemed like this is a type this is the type of guy who crea he's like a walt disney type of guy who creates this type of phenomenon and you know richard branson loves everybody loves it and then sure enough you know they kind of got ahead of their skis and all of a sudden you know like whatever third grade came around for those second graders and they were like you know what i don't care about moshi monsters anymore i have moved on to the next thing and it's like overnight the business starts losing relevancy the characters start losing relevancy and like nobody's blind nobody's buying the plush toys and the tv show doesn't want to get made anymore whatever they started to unwind essentially it was very hard for them to like reverse that cycle because uh you know like as fast as you can climb as a like fad phenomenon uh that's as fast as it can unwind and so i i don't know exactly what his net worth was but i'm you know he was the main guy and it was the company was worth over a billion dollars i'm sure he was worth hundreds of millions of dollars on paper but never got to realize it and then basically had to start back over from scratch as like uh you know just a guy and as you know just a guy who who's like went through this went through this like roller coaster but like didn't have the money to show for it which makes it even more amazing that they you know he went and and helped seed calm like co-found calm and then joined calm and helped grow calm into like a multi-billion dollar brand so he's kind of done it again and uh i just think that's amazing um i had the original agency and in the early days the agency barely made any money but it was a couple hundred thousand dollars and i read about the base camp guys you know doing these uh sas products and stuff and i was like man i want to make money when i sleep that sounds amazing and so i started just taking most of my profits and starting um you know sas software companies by the way you set up 90 10 right you put 90 back into the business into new stuff or whatever you live in the early days it was probably 80 20 but then over time i ramped it up so basically i was taking the majority of the profits anything i didn't need to live on was almost all going into incubating businesses i incubated a bunch and you know some of those businesses ended up being worth uh you know one i sold for seven million bucks and was producing 600 700k year of profit or something like that so i was i made a lot of bets with that money and ended up compounding into something significant but then i ended up continuing to take that money and just do the 80 20 90 10 strategy of always investing and i really started making a lot more money when i went from starting businesses to buying businesses and investing which i started about seven years ago hold on those numbers don't make sense yeah tell you sounds like 20 million 200 net income well no i mean no no no so so it's like you know let's say let's say let's say metal abs revenue is a million dollars we made 500k of profit and um so that's what's left over at the end after we pay taxes and stuff i'd take 80 of that 500k and i'd use it to start more businesses right i would just do this on a monthly basis whatever was left over in the bank account that i didn't need to run the business i would go and i'd use it to start yet another business and i you know i've been doing that for 15 years now and we're are i think you know all of our businesses together worth over a billion dollars did you do you know how much you were compounding so for example you took the money and you either started a business or bought like controlling share in an existing business versus just saying i'm gonna put this into real estate or the stock market or angel invest or whatever um how much additional lift do you think you got to meaning like at what percent were you compounding by doing the extra work of like identifying and buying businesses and owning them versus like if you had done a more kind of like hands-off strategy which maybe let's say i think somebody like you could have got 10 to 15 consistently i think i could if i was passive i could have got eight to 12 percent right putting it in real estate stocks that kind of stuff by buying businesses um you know there's a lot of advantage in that we could use a little bit of debt because we controlled the whole business right so you can get the bank to give you 20 or 30 percent of it which adds a lot of lift on your return and then we were buying these businesses anywhere from three to ten times earnings and then we would usually within the first two years we would find ways to double the business within one to two years so you start to think about it and you go okay well that's a kind of two to five year payback depending on what's happening that's based on cash and then the actual value of the business as you grow their earnings increases over time right so the numbers start getting very big very quickly especially when you've done that you know 20 times so what do you think was the like what do you think was the compounded rate well i don't know how long the last but it goes back to at the end of the day you know when i started i was making you know 200k 100k a year and today our businesses make you know over 50 million dollars of profit across everything so so what what uh what percent rate do you think you you were able to generate you think you were compounding at like 40 uh i think probably in the end it's it's something or we did the math a couple years ago um because we raised a fund and i think it was like 40 40 some percent now keep in mind you know that was at a time where not that many people were doing what we were doing so you know it's gotten more competitive over time and those are small deals it's really easy to compound at high rates when you're doing small deals as you do bigger ones i think we'll probably slow down on that um but it's not a number i think about i i you know i never was like i want to compound at 44 i was like i just want to make my money back in a reasonably safe way i want to buy great businesses and i want to feel good about what i do that's crazy to me because you're andy munger you uh you know the whole buffet monger like philosophy is based on compounding over a long period of time and the number one variable is time how long you're going to do it for and what's the rate right that's like the two totally key things even if you generate you know okay let's drop the rate down to 15 or 10 percent it's still hundreds of millions of dollars right that's what's crazy about compounding is you don't need to outperform massively you just need to do you know a little better than everybody else and if you do as well as everyone else you're still good and all right let me just ask this question which was two things of your businesses how many of them do you actually think can last 20 30 40 years and also if you can buy any company right now internet related business what are a handful that you like that you like you know just to give an example to me and sean the listener of like things that you would look for you know not actually something you can buy but something that like this is what i want and name a very specific one yeah so um you know think about accenture right so accenture i forget it was part of one of the big five consultancies and then it got spun out but basically they help people do like um consulting strategy digital transformation that kind of stuff that business will definitely exist for the next 30 years um you know i don't know why it wouldn't and in the same vein i think like meta lab and our agency services businesses you know we're really early in every business turning into a tech company right over the next 20 years more and more companies will have to build software and go digital and i think there's only so much talent so i think those are tremendous businesses for the next 20 years i don't know how to predict over very long times aeropress is a business i think will exist in 50 years you know i don't see any reason why it wouldn't will it have the same competitive advantage as it does today will it get a bunch of copycats probably but you know kleenex still exists and it's a hundred years later right so um i don't know i mean we also own i own like a bunch of restaurants and a bakery and you know if people still like their food as they have for the last 30 years those will probably exist in 30 years but we do own businesses that they're you know platform dependent or you know technology dependent where the seas can change and there's no way to predict how long they can go but i've been surprised how long some of our businesses have persisted and grown um it just goes back to like you know not not underestimating anything and andrew i'm gonna give you one of the the uh like the devil's advocate to the don't go for the big big home run uh strategy which is something else i believe is true i believe it's true that uh kind of like lifestyle business and a big business a lifestyle business and a moonshot business will both basically take up all of your time so might as well go big that's another way of looking at it right uh so for example i've i've run a restaurant i've started a tech company in both cases it was on my mind all the time i was working on it you know five six days a week you know at minimum as many hours as i could i was trying to do it to make it successful a restaurant was going to be able to spit off you know 150 200 000 of profit off that location and you know a tech company could be worth 100 million dollars in two years and so like those are just different sizes of the prize for the same level of effort probability of success i would say you know you can do better restaurants not a great example because they fail a lot but like let's say dental clinic or something yeah a dental clinic you'd probably do great but you'd have an agency or whatever um so probably that's different but also uh with a bigger more ambitious project you also every day you get to be more excited about it you get to recruit better people because their great talent is really excited about it versus like i know like for example my online course business i know i could do better for hire people but like not everybody wants to come work on that project for you know and then i'm going to get somebody who wants just that with is willing to accept a salary that i can afford and that's usually not the a plus person i like to work with so you know you get stuck in that middle middle zone yeah i don't i'm not advocating for some tim ferriss lifestyle work four hour work week kind of thing i think um you know warren buffett is not a lifestyle he doesn't have a lifestyle business he has a business he loves to run and he does exactly what he wants to do but um personally you know i like incubating businesses starting new businesses getting excited about stuff i just go i do that off the side of my desk right so that's 20 of my time 30 of my time um i also like buying great businesses and letting them run and choosing ceos and doing the buffett thing but i need excitement and you know all the other stuff but i'm in no way saying it's any less challenging i'm just saying your odds of success are higher and let's be real if you go to the gym and you try and lift um you know 800 pounds on your bench on day one you probably will fail that doesn't feel very good but if i give you an 80 pound bench and you lift it you're going to feel really good about yourself right and so i just want to jump over the one-foot hurdles right i want to feel the sense of success and i think when people start out in tech and they do a startup and they fail and it's brutal a lot of those people turn around and say well i'm never doing that again when they might have been great entrepreneurs in some other format right i just think it's the hardest lift it's the olympics as you said let's do one of these other topics uh all right so i'm just gonna name it and you give us your riff on it so doing it wrong before you do it right what's that yeah so i am i finally put my finger on this because i people always criticize me because i will hire i'll hire the wrong person right i will i'm a big advocate of if i have an idea and i just want to get moving i will just go and i'll hire whoever's in front of me and i'll say hey let's go do this and that does not work that well obviously but what it does do is it forces you to make it real right so um you know for example um when i know i want to go a direction i will do this so i've always loved food in restaurants i always dreamed of starting my own restaurant i did i started my own restaurant i went and i signed a lease i shouldn't have i hired the wrong manager and i lost 800 grand right total learning experience here's what it did though it forced me into that industry it made me learn it it made me make a lot of mistakes and then i found the good people through that so actually via because i was in that restaurant that failed i met the guy next door who ran a very successful restaurant and when he wanted when his partner wanted to sell this the steak i ended up buying it and now i own this wonderful restaurant and i know it's good because i've owned a bad restaurant right so directionally moving into something and i think people are way too pressure precious with their hiring like they just need to do it and then let people go and it doesn't work out so that's kind of what i mean by that too many people um think they're measuring twice but cutting once and they just never cut they just measure forever so but do you just have to fire people all the time no not all the time i mean like i've gotten really lucky with lots of these it's like 50 50. right um the pattern that i've seen the best thing to do when you're going into a new industry is look for somebody who's actually succeeded within it the problem is that when you're when you're the rube at the table when you're the newbie to the industry uh even a [ __ ] looks like a genius so that's that's the hard part right and i've certainly i've certainly made that mistake before and you've got this new business called mailman right mailman the gmail plug-in i've had that i've actually had that for a couple years but yeah basically yeah it basically it makes it so that you only get email a couple times a day so you're not putting your inbox all day it's picking up steam it feels like right now and uh you met a guy on twitter who you got to run it right like yeah that's an example if you're just like yeah whatever you're you're an engineer you seem like you might be able to do this just do it 100 i'll do this all the time so i literally um that same year i did it twice um i i tweeted out i said hey i've got this idea for a gmail plug-in i need someone to build it who wants to build it this guy mohit in india messaged me sent me a great email and he said tell me what you wanted to do and i'll have it to you in 48 hours and he did and over and over again he just kept delivering there was another business idea i had where i went to the guy i did the exact same thing and he just didn't make any progress and so i said hey after three months it's not working out and went a different direction but you know fifty percent of the time it works really well and now we not only have mailman but we actually started a company a holding company in india and we're looking at acquisitions and we've got him managing some of our businesses so it's been it's been awesome that's crazy and this kind of like it feeds into this idea like i wrote it down here but taking chances on people which is the most satisfying thing like i don't know for you guys like when i was like 15 i always had this feeling of like someone just needs to give me a chance like i'm a dog to a bone i just need the opportunity and no one ever gave me that chance no one ever saw that in me so i had to start my own business and um i had i've had this experience a few times where i've taken a crazy chance on someone like have i told you guys about how i met my business partner chris no so uh maybe like two years into business i am a bank balance accountant so like you sean i don't do bookkeeping i don't understand what's going on i don't know how to pay taxes i would just look at the bank account and if the bank camp was bigger on day 30 than it was on day one i thought i was winning and one day i go into the bank and i'm trying to get a corporate credit card and the teller says oh you need to go talk to mr sparling he'll fill out all the forms for you and so i go into the back of the bank and i get welcomed into this nice office and mr sparling looks like the son of mr sparling he's like this little skinny 23 year old and we start chatting and immediately just hit it off with this guy we're joking around and talking about our days and our lives and stuff and after i was done doing this i go like hey what's your deal like what you know do you want to stay at the bank like what are you doing and he goes well i'm thinking about getting my accounting designation or something like that i don't really know and i just blurt out do you want to be my cfo and he's kind of taken aback and he's like hey like let's you know let's go get a coffee tomorrow we'll talk about it and i convince him to come and be my cfo he has almost no accounting experience uh he worked at a bank on paper he's like the wrong guy to be a cfo of a business at the time we're doing over a million dollars i think and he just shows up on day one and i trust him i give him my social security number all my information banking wires everything and chris is now my business partner of 12 years he's responsible for a significant amount of everything good that's happened in my career and he's an incredible person now for every story like that i have you know someone who is terrible and incompetent ranging from that to fraudulent but when you do take a chance on someone one in 10 times it pays off big and so what i've struggled with is not knowing you know obviously i don't want to take that level of risk still but i got to figure out a way to give people chances i have do you think that a large great story on that uh okay i can tell the story of same thing same thing they just have i'll give you a good and a bad because they both hit yesterday and um so i'll give you the bad one first so the bad one took a chance on a person who um honestly i still think this guy's a good guy i like this guy he was a i met him uh working out so he was a he trained with my trainer he's like a workout partner basically he came over to our house and worked out with us one day randomly um nice guy young guy he was like an apprentice plumber at the time so he's a plumber in training and with um and like we had a issue with our 3pl for our e-commerce business which was like we had a theft issue at our at the warehouse that we were working with and then the owner was kind of like uh yeah i don't know you can't prove that we stole it i'm like dude you have the goods and now they're gone like who else who else stole it except for someone at the warehouse he's like ah let's check the cameras oh don't keep the footage sorry so i just got so pissed i was like we're leaving like [ __ ] tomorrow and so i was like all right we're not using this 3p anymore we're going to just do our own warehousing i didn't know the first thing about warehousing but i was like okay whatever i don't know we'll figure it out so we i hastily signed a lease of this like 8 000 square foot warehouse near us and i was like all right i definitely don't want to run this warehouse but it's like the stuff is coming tomorrow so we need to uh find somebody so i i'm working out that day and i'm like hey you wanna you wanna run a warehouse you say what and i was like you know you're kind of like a hard-working blue-collar guy like you want to try this well i've never really done anything like this i was like don't worry like i'll take a shot on you and like you're going to make a bunch of mistakes that's okay i understand because you've never done this before i've also never done it before let's figure it out together and like you know you'll learn from this and who knows like this might lead to a future you want we had talked about what he might want in the future like he wanted to one day own real estate own his own business i go you know this could become that like if we open up a second warehouse like we'll buy that one and you know you could be a part owner in it you could run a basically our own in-house 3pl like you could fulfill not just our brand but other brands too so i kind of laid out this vision he was super excited about it and in my head i'm already i do this thing all the time samuel appreciate this i always imagine the hustle con talk this is like a phrase i use all the time i go all right imagine two years from now you're on stage talking about how we growth hacked our way to success what are the stories we're gonna tell or like how we survived chaos and like absolute like you know disasters but still made it so i always work backwards from like i imagine telling the story on stage and it just gets me more excited about the current moment and like so i was already imagining like this plumber this like apprentice plumber that we hired that now is this amazing guy and i'm like imagining all these great things and it started off good it was going good but then like you know here we are and you know a year later nine months later something like that and you know all of a sudden balls being dropped on a couple things and not really growing at the rate we want to grow uh in terms of his growth as a leader of that part of the business but i'm still holding out hope and then i find out he's kind of like scamming us like trying to like start his own thing he like sees us growing and like trying to start his own version of it and like you know what like it's okay to be want to be an entrepreneur and start your own thing but like if you do it above board i'm cool with it if you're kind of on company time company dime like trying to steal your idea like that's not cool to me so so anyways i had this like kind of that all came to a head yesterday and i was like look this is not working i guess you know like my bet was wrong here this like my hope that we could help this plumber guy become like this like star like throw that hustle contact away that's not happening and i'm feeling kind of bad and then the afternoon i get a call from this guy johnny and johnny's a kid who i hired at i think age 13 or 14 he called me one day at the office and he goes hey is this shawn i was like yeah how'd you get this number who's this he goes my name is johnny i met pete who works at your office at the dog park i go okay and he is everything okay with pete he's like yeah yeah he said that you know i'm in eighth grade and i'm a programmer and he goes and i don't know any other programmers um it's something it's about to be summer and like i just want to hang out around other programmers i've never met one can i come hang out at your office this summer and i was like how can i say i'll be a winner so i'm like it's not me i'm like okay this cold call is a yes so he shows up and like the idea was he'll just like he's going to be over there in the corner he just wanted to like shadow the environment or like whatever first day i was like uh we're in a meeting i was like oh you know what we should do we should do this like viral little quiz we don't have enough people to do it i was like hey johnny get in here johnny can you build a website he's like uh yeah like he didn't know how to but he's just like yeah i think i could and i was like all right build this today and he like literally stayed there until midnight that day and like had a version of it working by that night probably was under like such an immense amount of pressure now that i look back at it probably poor guy like you know aged the guy probably five years so anyways he he just joins us full time as an eighth grader by 10th grade it's like johnny needs to be here full time johnny's the man johnny's the [ __ ] man he's like hanging out with a bunch of like old neckbeards like us and uh and and he's like and i want to drop out of high school and i just want to do this and his mom is so worried about him dropping out and i like go and i meet with his mom and i'm like man he's not dropping out he's going pro it's like when lebron james he skipped college because he was going pro he was just that advanced and like she was like okay if you put it that way that sounds good like i don't feel bad about my kid anymore you know like okay if you say so and so and then he became when we got acquired he became the youngest amazon employee i think in all of amazon at that during the acquisition and now he's like starting his own he's now he's i don't know 19 or something like that and he's the kid's name give him johnny dallas johnny dallas i don't know i'll pull up his twitter awesome so he has his own startup now and it's like he just called me yesterday he's like yeah um it's going pretty good like we just got a term sheet from you know i guess i probably shouldn't say the firm but it's like the best vc firm so he's like the best vc firm just gave us a term sheet you know 38 million post valuation i was like johnny you know have you had puberty yet what's going on dude like this is crazy to me but that was and i told him i go dude he goes thanks for just making the time i go bro you don't understand this is the best feeling i can get it's like i feel like i bet on you you were my personal angel investment and like we became friends and then you're actually doing the thing you like actually did the thing that i always hope somebody does which is like take the opportunity and just [ __ ] run with it and become a superstar and like when it happens it's so worth it and you're like all right i'll do this 10 more times even if i whiff nine more times if there's another johnny in there like this is this is gold for me totally there's nothing better than when it does work but it's so painful when it doesn't because you're just going like dude don't you see this right like that guy you gave the opportunity to you know he could have owned the business with you and done the real estate and all the other stuff one question what was what were the warning signs that that guy wasn't going to be the guy because chris has this thing about he calls it gumption it's like if you say to them um hey balls in your court do they follow up within 24 hours do they move the ball forward are they do they have cases before you even gave me that example you go what were the red flags or the bad signs it was exactly this during one of the workouts after we brought them on board we're still working out together and i go i go dude here's my vision for you like what's the dream he gave me this idea like i want to own real estate it's like dude at the moment you have no pathway to real estate you have like you're just making enough to live let alone and you don't know anything about real estate so like you know he didn't really know his path and i told him i said here's the plan we're going to open up another warehouse i want to own real estate let's buy it i'll give you a piece and you run it you you and we turn this into a business where you actually are running your own business inside that real estate as our own 3pl because i know this that e-commerce is booming is a good idea and i didn't hear from him like he was in the moment he was like oh wow that's awesome yeah that's great and then there was no follow-up for three months and then i met up with him and he was and he was in the other boat he goes yeah like i wanted to like talk more about that but i didn't hear from you and i was like you know i thought maybe maybe you would like you know i've really been excited about that i've been thinking about it i've been i was research i was googling some places i go bro if that was me and somebody's late if somebody gives me a window into a life i want i'm like knock knock knock hey about that thing you said but you know here's exactly what i'm planning to do to move the ball forward hey here's a couple links hey i put together a spreadsheet hey i'm making a checklist of like we can do this if i hit these goals and like you gotta do the work at that point and so the biggest red flag was that he didn't follow up on that opportunity it's not that he didn't want to he just didn't know that that's what you're supposed to do and it wasn't his natural inclination to like to do that and i noticed that with johnny it's the opposite it's like tell johnny something he'll if you give him an inch he'll take a mile type of guy they'll tell he'll text you at nine o'clock at night and say hey check this out check out the website i'm working on this guy that i i gave the other opportunity to obviously i won't share any details about it but he i emailed him and i said dude i haven't heard from you in two months what's going on and he goes yeah i've i redesigned the website take a look and i was like you should have sent me this on day one when you had a design show me there's momentum instead we've lost all this momentum and yeah it's it's crazy but there's no better high by the way i just found another guy like this and i'll tell you the signs that i know i'll bet right now this guy's gonna be a winner so this guy's i didn't know this until i hired him he's just graduated from college he's got like a dot edu email address but he had emailed me being like hey heard you on the pod talk about something like you know you want to give you want to do some philanthropy he goes here's a better idea let's create a micro grant where you give out like whatever it is some amount of money that that's you're cool with and like write a grant for people who who do something i know you're all about action and making [ __ ] happen so like give it away to people who are going to make [ __ ] happen that's better than charity it'll feel better for you so the guy like knows me he reached out intelligently he says he's doing the same thing he doesn't pitch his company which by the way is meant to be he was trying to start like a microgrid like angelus for grants instead of like startups it's like a way to quickly spin up like a grant program and i was like you got my attention but you know i was like yeah i'm interested that sounds like a great idea let's uh whatever and then he followed up like 10 times in the next like 12 days he was like hey here's three ideas for what your grant could be tell me which of those three you like just send back the number one two or three then he's like hey i saw your tweet about this other thing remember the grant thing you should do this instead of that right and he just kept following up intelligently each time so i was like already like this guy's a winner and i told him i go hey dude i don't have a ton of time for this grant thing but like you're awesome if you ever want to like do something like and he was like no no i want to try this grant thing anyways long story short like six months goes by he ends up graduating he takes a job at like a i don't want to say which place but like takes a job at like kind of like a hot startup that we know of and then i get an email out of the blue three days ago subject line i've made an irreversible decision so another great sign is like his copywriting is good for like a 21 year old he knows how to like frame it he goes i made it a real decision i quit my job yesterday even though it was a great job and they they offered me whatever um because i've decided that i want to come work for you and make xyz happen he goes wow he goes you know i have a couple other ideas of what i might do but you're the top of the list anyways he makes you feel good does the flattery thing says exactly what he would do he goes i have two ideas for how i would uh make the milk road better um let me know if you're down to hear them and i'll send them over all right so he baits me i'm like yeah of course something ideas send you ideas and i just reply i go i didn't honestly i didn't care about your ideas i just want to hire you and now he's working with me and he's already awesome and we're on day three so i can tell you this guy his name is safwan safwan is gonna be a winner and i bet you like six months from now i'm gonna be talking about how amazing this guy is dude the problem that's my problem with with all this though is all three of us i get so much inbound and i'm like i don't wanna i'm not in the mood to figure out who's legit and who's not and also i don't wanna have to train someone i don't want to have to manage someone at the moment so are you guys getting exhausted managing people are you getting worn out like having to talk to people all the time and tell them what to do or to give you feedback sean sean i would love to know how you do this you've kind of alluded to it a few times that you have a team helping you kind of manage channels or at least looking at opportunities and stuff how does that work because i have that same problem where people email me ideas all the time and there's nowhere for it to go there's no one to help yeah that's okay that's by design it's like it's meant to be a bottomless pit of like no reply but then we like cherry pick interesting things and just like pull it out of that that that well dripping wet we're like oh you know maybe we should reply to this but basically my version of of chris right your business chris mine is ben and basically ben has the keys he has my email and he has my twitter and that's the two biggest forms of inbound and basically he's the wall and it's like if you can climb the ben wall then like you've made it and like ben knows what's interesting and what's not and so like and that's like one of his main things is like he likes he gets energy from that whereas i kind of like i lose energy doing it like you say i'm like i kind of i don't enjoy doing it whereas he's like oh yeah this guy sent me this thing so i checked it out and then i chatted with him i'm like dude i would never check it out or chat with him he's like yeah that's what i like checking things out and then if it's cool then i like to chat with them and i'm like yeah you make it sound normal but like dude i [ __ ] hate doing that and so and then he just replies basically as me to them and they he sets up the call and then half the time i don't show up on the call it's just like they're like is sean coming and it's like ben's like nah it's just me uh go and like it's a good counter too because like if they're like you know offended by that or whatever it's probably not gonna work because i don't have enough time to dedicate to each individual person if you're if you're just trying to meet me that's one thing versus if you're trying to like advance your cause your mission your project or whatever then like you'll take help from ben or anybody right like you shouldn't be like on your high horse about it so to me the answer the secret answer is like it's basically ben and ben knows the tight filter of like what's interesting and what's not because we are like so in sync with each other right we talk all the time about like about little nuggets or hooks that are interesting and if he finds something he'll hang it on that hook sam have you ever explored delegating your email yeah yeah i've explored it for some reason i not pounced on it like i should but i probably should do that shouldn't i i mean i miss so many emails that i just don't read chris and i did it about six months ago we we started using front and so our our assistant actually reads all the emails and it goes into her inbox first and then she chooses what we need to respond to so it's like oh here's a docusign that goes to the general counsel here's a venture deal it goes to the rolling fund so i don't actually see any of it and it's really reduced my email by you know even though the volume is the same but for me it's reduced it by 70 percent because in the end the yeah every single email you have to even archive is like mentally taxing my thing is that once after i sold the business i didn't have um a business i didn't have a business so i was like i'm not i don't want to justify i couldn't justify having uh someone you know doing stuff i didn't want to have like a higher burn just for personal reasons now that i do have some things brilliant maybe um maybe i can actually have cash flow coming in from a business then i think yeah it's worth justifying it which is crazy because i don't understand sean how you set all your stuff up because you got like it seems like a lot of different things coming in so your accounting must be horrendous i mean it must be a huge headache huge mess yeah you gotta go to the bank and find your cfo yeah but by the way that little thing you said that's so true i i always say this hire your favorite vendors and your favorite sales people so like anytime you have an amazing account like experienced account manager or a banker like i had this one woman who helped me with my mortgage and i was like hey if you ever want to like switch careers like you're amazing and like same thing with like you know my trainer different people i'm like yo you have this like great way with people or like the guy who manages our rolling fund uh he's like he works at angellist but this [ __ ] handles like such a [ __ ] so we'll send it we'll be like hey we're doing this deal we don't know like half the terms and it's gonna uh we have to sign now and why are the money in three months is it connor yeah connor he's amazing i don't know how he tracks all this yeah we the same thing will be like 100k into this and then like he handles everything and i'm just like this is insane connor's a absolute magician and it's so funny that you have the same guy because he's he is so on top of it and i'm just like conor you are like like i need to basically like as soon as i have enough operational [ __ ] to deal with i'm like conor's the first call because this guy handles the messiest most disorganized thing and he's just like yep got it never makes me feel bad about it he just like solves the problem and if he needs something he tells me and then i give it to him like it's so nice when you find somebody like ultra competent like that it's four seasons service right i don't know if you guys are gonna you go to four seasons and you you know you say oh like i really you say something fussy like oh i want you know a thinner blanket and at some hotels they grumble and there they just say oh yes we would we would love to sir and i feel like and then they'll never complain or anything and i feel like um conor is one of those people uh and my assistant is one of those people those people are just they're they're amazing when you find one you just gotta i'll tell you one more signal somebody who thinks bigger than you um especially if they aren't the one in charge of the company this is super rare it just happened safwan did this so i brought him in to work on the milk road nft projects like we're going to launch an nfd as part of milk road we're brainstorming what it could be and we don't want to just do some [ __ ] thing we want it to be like really great and he was like it's like his first or second day he just goes you know just a thought like um right now we kind of think of this as like some sub little project like a like a cool add-on to the milk road he's like but there's no reason this shouldn't be like as big as board ape yacht club or anything else like this could be one of the biggest best nft projects around i just want to say that out loud because like i don't want to limit that and i was just like you know if you can make me feel like a little [ __ ] then like you are my favorite employee right because i'm like oh yeah i if i'm not thinking sufficiently large enough or aggressive enough about either a timeline or a size of the prize that's the you know that's my favorite type of person to work with is somebody who pushes my thinking on like couldn't we do this faster or couldn't we do this bigger because that's normally like normally people will just accept whatever the leader sets as the frame they'll just set that as this invisible walls around how good or how big or how fast something can be and somebody who breaks those walls is like a winner dude sean how much more hyped are you around milk road than some of your other things it seems like this is the most hyped like it's it feels good so you're 33 it's taken you of 33 years to finally find the thing where it it's like this is this is what i should be doing like the it's you know ikigai it's like what you're good at what the world wants what the world's willing to pay for and like what you're passionate about right in the middle you've you've seen like you've found that whereas before you found things that made money but it was like it's kind of interesting then you found things that you're passionate didn't really make money now you've got you're in the center yeah i think that's true maybe the podcast is also a good example of that but um yeah on that note you have this thing called five pillars of happiness what are the things oh yeah what are the five pillars so chris has all these uh all these sticks and stuff but one of them one of them is sparling's five pillars of happiness and i it's very simple but i think it's really it's really absolutely and he counts them out for you so he'll say um see family every day right obviously um see friends and loved ones multiple times a week be in nature once a week new and novel experiences once a month and then feel like a man or a woman go with your buddies go hunting sports whatever makes you feel tough and gritty and ticks that box for your caveman brain once a quarter right and it's like kind of this very simple model we we built this little circle of it where you can rank yourself on it but i was like this is actually like kind of a thing i i feel like more people should uh should use this system sam does it in the reverse he sees his family once a quarter and every day he does his caveman [ __ ] he's doing everything i do think that that that it's kind of interesting sean do you do any caveman stuff yeah for sure the workout is that i play sports i play basketball i compete i think that's kind of like the version of that uh and then sometimes i'll just do like uh manual labor i'll just like be like okay i'm gonna [ __ ] assemble this thing that's been sitting here like it's not the most manly thing but it's like right you know something i don't really need to do and i'm just going to like just put my full focus into using my hands and like trying to like make something or build something or do something that's more rare it's so weird like i have a trainer i do power lifting as well and it's so funny like you're basically paying someone to come to your house to have you simulate doing labor during right yeah and it's amazing like i always feel you know my happiest in the hour after my workout or whatever and you just go oh even that that's caveman brain right you would have been building a log cabin or doing something manly and now we're so pathetic that we have to pay other men to have a simulate data for us in our houses right but yeah it's kind of green stuff too so you do boxing sam right i got it he does that for me bjj if you've ever done jiu jitsu it's like yeah wrestling they're like so primal and like such a good feeling when you're done boxing has been awesome i love like fighting i think it's it's awesome it's in a controlled environment it's badass and that's awesome and then i'm at this ranch now and i i have been so happy like i'm trying to figure out how to build a fence and i'm not literally going to build the fence but like i'm like you having to like move stuff to you know you're doing a little bit of work to like figure out how is this going to work or you know where we're going to put a pool just like [ __ ] like that i have found to be so much more rewarding than internet stuff the problem is is that internet stuff is still also awesome and makes so much more money with so little effort compared to like having to construct a pool uh but so i think sean i feel like you're similar to me in that you're looking for shortcuts you want to delegate everything you know everything's doordashed assistance chef you know all that stuff right i'm the exact same way and i did this thing where i did a um i had a psychologist do a 360 on me i heard about this one of my favorite investors this guy um manish pabrai did this thing where he hired a psychologist to basically write an operating manual and say here's what you're missing in your life uh here's the brutal feedback your friends and family have about you here's how you need to improve and so i heard this on the past i was driving i i i think it was 10 grand and so he spent like four hours interviewing me we did a whole bunch of testing and then he talked to like my six six i think it was three friends and family members and three um three people i work with and i got it back and it was absolutely one of the most brutal experiences of my entire life like our brains are not or we're not designed to know what our friends say about us and stuff but one of the key key things he said to me is he goes um you're it's almost like all of your friends have come to you and said andrew on saturday let's mow the lawn together and then afterwards we're going to celebrate and we're going to have a cold beer so we're all going to sit in a circle and you know be all sweaty and papa papa corona or whatever and i just say nah it's cool i just got a guy on taskrabbit and he's going to do that so i never get the sense of satisfaction of doing the work and i never get the camaraderie of doing it with anyone and you're right you're right it is doing real labor doing no i know but it that was the feedback and i was like holy [ __ ] that's so true and sean i feel like you're probably similar yeah except it's my wife telling me at all times to go [ __ ] do the work instead of like hiring a man to come hang you know to like literally like hang a poster on my wall which by the way me and my wife one of our biggest fights over the last couple years was i didn't like wheeling the garbage out to the street because it would always be like 10 o'clock at night i'd be in my boxers you know and i finally i was like oh there's a private garbage service they'll take all of our recycling this is awesome my wife looked at me like i just like you know she i didn't defend her in a physical fight or something it was like i lost all respect my wife like wouldn't have sex with me for weeks it's not good she gave me that jada that jada smith look um exactly yeah except i didn't slap anyone i just cowered yeah that's why will did it was like oh [ __ ] this is the moment this is i can get out of the doghouse about the trash right now but the worst pain is when you like hire a cleaning lady or something and i see her like try to like move the trash can down the thing and it's like heavy i'm like oh [ __ ] i can't come on come on just move i got it it's all good like uh you gotta feel that deal so fascinating it's so fascinating though to think about like we do so little labor compared to someone 75 years ago and there's a value if you grew up in a farming family your parents would think you're pathetic if you don't grow your own vegetables right so it's like where do you end where you know what's what's the right amount of labor and what's the wrong amount because i also know people who they're wealthy and yet they spend all their time doing miserable tasks they hate you know cleaning the cat's litter box taking out the garbage and i'm like hey just delegate this hire someone and they hate it you know they're fighting with their wife over it you know it's miserable so i think there's a balance uh dude you didn't need to spend the 10k you could have just asked your cleaning lady nobody knows you better than your cleaning lady and or you're you're a nanny or somebody like that like they my cleaning lady doesn't speak english i actually have to i text her in spanish uh so she doesn't know anything at least that's when i think maybe she's actually she knows where you leave your underwear on the floor and [ __ ] like that she knows how long that couple sit on your desk before you just finally take it to the sink she knows everything all right bros i gotta bounce i have someone here but you guys gonna keep talking uh no we can wrap it it's cool yeah that's fine it won't be the same without you all right uh let's let's wrap it up ben uh ben what'd you think uh making me come on camera here on on my sick day but uh great stuff of always a great absolute episode from andrew i anticipate this is gonna be one of our top download ones it usually is did we uh awesome ben i said that we crossed 100k per episode that was like only for a handful or what what do you know what the numbers are they just like what's your actual average like what's our actual average i don't know the actual but it depends what window you're looking at if it's i think most people measure it by a 60-day window yeah whatever 30-60 is fine all right let me just let me just pull up the stats have you guys considered like building in public and having a graph or something or with that dude i tweeted out it starts going down i know you talk about it a lot our march numbers i tweeted out it was 1.5 1.6 million whatever the number it was something like that that includes youtube though that includes only people who watch full youtube videos as opposed to just the clips if you add in the clips yesterday sean your video about lamar ball or lavar ball i don't even know anything they made fun of me all in the comments because i don't know who these people are it got 400 000 views in like 24 hours or something like that 400 on what you dude you realize what are your videos right now on youtube youtube shorts has like millions and millions of views yeah dude it's got like thousands of comments and people just roasting uh me and a little bit of you it literally probably has tens of millions of views getting fancy youtube sucks does it really have tens of millions of views yeah you just get bullied by like 14 year olds if you yeah and they're all way better looking they all wear vans like i got super excited about our tic tac tic tac videos i was like oh sick a million views they're probably saying how useful and helpful this content was right can you open up the comments it's just like there's nothing good in the comments for us right like you know i'm hairy ugly and dumb and you're like you know i don't know i don't know i don't know what they say about you i was just too focused on me what all right you won't know the numbers so so i think what you were talking about was the other day it's for the first time we have youtube videos with we have multiple youtube videos with over 200 000 views which is good and uh these are not like the short tick tock style videos like actual videos with uh with a couple hundred thousand uh in terms of just podcast our top downloaded episode is at seventy thousand um all time just all time uh but if you throw on youtube it crosses a hundred thousand um so how much how much of your growth has come from doing all that tick tock stuff where you're like oh we'll give out i forget you're giving up money or something like that for the person who takes stuff viral it's hard to say yeah yeah it's like i mean that definitely worked um but we were doing other stuff at the same time so it's hard to say how much of that came from that oh hey when are you guys doing this summit what's the deal with that i don't know can i read you the top three top five comments on that video that has three million views on youtube this is exactly what i'm talking about right here's comment number one this is what people say when they just read the headlines that comment has six thousand likes number two there's a guy in the nba that alone told us everything he has no clue what he's talking about okay fair enough i know a lot about the mba um this guy reminds me of myself in college when i was giving a talk about a pro about a topic the professor taught and i'd only skim reading 10 minutes before the class that has 2000 likes um please stop covering sports all of this information is either the wrong or in the wrong series of events okay damn all right all right i gotta go talk to y'all soon [Music] you

okay so so you don't like to lose if in this case you are not successful in you know the board does not accept your offer you've said you won't go higher is there a plan b there is all right we're live breaking edition sean just texted us and said we got to do this elon thing sounds like you've got a lot of opinion or you have a lot of opinions i got some opinions i got some opinions for sure uh first let's summarize what happened and then tell me how you i guess like how you initially heard about it and how you reacted to it when you first heard so let's start from like all right so the weeks and months and years ago elon has always criticized twitter saying how he loves it and i actually think he's one of the top 10 most followed accounts in the world and of the top 10 he's one of the few that is actually actively posting as a normal person would and he's criticized twitter for doing some uh for banning free speech things like that for basically being too liberal he didn't ever say that word but that's kind of what he's getting at right and about ten days ago or a week ago he bought nine percent of the company and then he announced that he was going to join the board of directors and the weekend after he announced that he was joining the board of directors he started posting things like let's turn twitter's hq into a homeless shelter i actually lived next door to twitter's uh headquarters in uh at ninth and market year a couple years ago and it's basically like no one's there because the pandemics shut down that area of the city and it's full of homeless people and he said let's shut down twitter hq and turn it into a homeless shelter he tweeted said because nobody's going to work anyways because yeah because no one goes to work anyways boys don't go anyways so he took it it was two jabs that he took and then also he said uh should we create an edit button button yes or no and he tweeted basically three or four things like that then on sunday or sorry uh last on sunday night he was supposed to join the board on monday he said i'm not joining the board and to a couple people or people who are a little bit in the know of this kind of granular stuff they said well the reason he's not joining the board is when you join the board of a company like this you can't own more than 14 and so by not joining the board he can now buy the whole thing and that happened on monday it's thursday morning first they were playing patty cake with each other he's like you know the news comes out then it's like the ceo of twitter perrog is like hey um so happy to have elon musk on our board he's the best um jack dorsey says so glad to have elon on our board elon says so glad to be on the board jack you know they're all playing patty cake and then one day later or two days later something like that it becomes he's actually not joining the board and he basically goes hostile and now at 6 00 am 7 am this morning it was announced that he was going to buy twitter uh right away when he bought nine percent of the company i think the stock jumped 10 the day he did it but uh its current valuation was like 43 billion and i think he offered to buy it at 53 building billion give or take i forget the exact amount but it was a nice premium not a huge premium but a nice premium and here we are now waiting for what's gonna happen next and by the way i think jack dorsey i do actually think he was somewhat genuine i think the the ceo of twitter was not genuine that guy doesn't even tweet like he's not even a user like have you ever read his tweets like he just tweets like screenshots of pdfs he follows me that's all i know and so he's good in my books perrag you're the man you have an excellent taste in who you follow well that's he might be the man but he's not like a power user of twitter like he's like i think i know how to use twitter better than he does you know what i mean yeah for sure you do yeah okay so he tweeted on january 20th then february 16th then march 3rd uh you know before that november 30th so you know this guy's tweeting bi-monthly yeah so like whereas elon actually gets it yeah so anyway that's where we are now what's your take so i think there's a couple different things first i want to just say baller move i've baller i've been on the record of saying i think elon can be kind of cringy with stuff he says in public i think he's an amazing inventor i think he's he's a amazing you know visionary and you know a force of nature for sure but i think he's kind of cringy in the way he kind of uh for somebody who's like you know trying to be kind of like an engineer's engineer uh he sure does do a lot of stuff to like make himself seem cool and like try to be cool and it just comes across try hardy to me but this was not that not just the move i'm going to read you have you read the letter yes i have it up the letter is badass so badass he he created an offer dude that's so funny that we both like grew gravity i was good that's exactly what i was going to bring up was the writing it was the writing's amazing i'm just going to read it word for word so he goes yeah uh so he this is part of his like sec filing he goes i invested in twitter as i believe it's potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company as a result i'm willing to buy one hundred percent of twitter at 52 40 uh 54 20 per share in cash 54 premium over the day i began investing 38 uh over what i you know the day it was announced my offer is my best and final offer if it is not accepted i will not re i would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder twitter has extraordinary potential period i will unlock it so that was the start and then there's one final thing he goes best and final and he just bullet points a this is this is the goal this is really cool this is where he to put his nuts on the table he goes i am not playing the back and forth game b i have moved straight to the end i am not playing the back and forth game and moved straight to the end it is a high price and your shareholders will love it that's the best slide your shareholders will love it yeah if the deal does not work given i have i do do not have confidence in management parag sad parag face nor do i believe i can drive the necessary change in the public market i will need to reconsider my position as a shareholder which it is he says it's not a threat it is entirely a it's a threat yeah the biggest biggest threat i've ever it's like saying this is not a threat it's like saying like i'm not trying to be racist but or like it's like dude what you're about to say is gonna be racist right don't take this the wrong way yeah you're gonna be you're about to be really freaking rude you're about to get offended um he says this is not a threat it is simply a good not a good investment without changes that need to be made and those changes won't happen without taking the company private but just the best line of all these is i have moved straight to the end that's my new [ __ ] dude i have moved straight to the end that is my new [ __ ] sean's new [ __ ] is i have moved straight to the end i'm just gonna be using that left and right negotiations uh tomorrow's milk road is going to start with i have moved straight to the end uh you know when i talk to my wife tonight and she wants to you know cuddle and kit no i have moved straight to the end if i go if i go in line somewhere i'm going to stand at the end of the line i'm going to say i have moved straight to the end that is my new [ __ ] what a line it's good man how about the fact that he's so this was basically when he says send via text is that literally does he mean that this is an email that was sent in text format and then there's voice format or is he saying this was a text message you think yeah i don't know what that part was it's like it's like the file there's like a screenshot of it and says like oh it's almost like he's like hey siri send this to the sec send this to jack in my address book it's like which jack do you mean i don't know what that part was it sounded like that part was i think he sent a message either to jack or brett taylor the the chairman or whatever and taylor the guy from salesforce who's brett taylor yeah oh dude i think he's the chairman of the board uh josh and so i think he sent it i think he sent it to hi i think it was to him and it was saying uh here's my offer letter this will be public tomorrow so i think he you know was giving a heads up to whoever i do not think this is going to go through and why do you think that i think that i okay so uh there's this app called blind it's very inside baseball app like typically only uh the you basically have to have an email at a large prominent tech company to use it so i don't even have i mean maybe hubspot has the ability to use it but um it's like i used to use this all the time at twitch it's awesome so like amazon apple just people twitter [ __ ] whining gossiping but you do it anonymously and they you have to be an employee at the company to be on there so you know these are not just randos and they'll like it's they basically will complain about stuff that they should be made fun of like i only make 450 000 a year how's that how am i able to survive in sf or what is everyone making right now my salary is blank post your salary below whatever and i got some screenshots from the twitter blind and the people who use blind i do think are not the representative of the normal employees but they basically said that uh like 50 50 thought it was a good idea and 50 thought it was a bad idea um so but the reason i don't think it's going to go through is i do think that management and a large vocal subset of the twitter employees are going to throw a fit enough that it would make this hard to go through but it's not the employees who get to decide i mean what do you mean well i said the management i think management could could could cause such i don't know what they could do this is it's a i think this is like i don't know the exact mechanics of these takeovers so you know there's people much smarter than me about this stuff but this is something that basically the the board has to decide and it's like a share the shareholders if i'm a twitter shareholder this stock hasn't like stocks have been basically a poor performer for like a decade i used to own this like 10 years ago and um you know the stock prices you know it has not been like this up into the right curve and you're getting a whatever what is a premium versus today so today's price is it's now 45 he offered 54 so that's what i like 20 something percent premium don't do public math but um yeah but would you take that premium and and also what he's i think one thing he said was he would try to retain as many private shareholders as possible meaning you wouldn't have to sell to be in favor of the vote of of this going through you could like you know keep your shares or whatever i think that um i just think that there's like some like i've read enough like finance books that there's all these crazy things like the poison pill which frankly i don't even understand a lot of this but there's all these like weird like you know art of war type of things that you can do i think i don't think it's as easy as well i'm the top bidder i think there's all these weird things but anyway the thing here's the thing about twitter do you know what uh all right so twitter's market cap as of today it's 34 billion of course we're like a nice pullback right now for tech so it's probably 30 higher a year ago but whatever uh right now it's um 34 billion you know what snapchat is uh 50. about 55. and here's the thing about twitter is i believe they have way more users and it's the center of culture right now maybe not the center but it is a center of culture at the moment and their ad platform is dog [ __ ] it's the worst ad platform all the big dogs so if they could figure this out they should be worth way more the thing is i don't think elon gives a [ __ ] about ads i think he's gonna try and figure out a way how to make money other than ads but twitter's ad platform is really bad so i do think that this company twitter is way undervalued and way under monetized and they they don't ever innovate although lately they've done some cool stuff uh but it's been like you know 10 years 10 years i think right yeah and by the way here's here's a couple of takes on the on the situation so um cuban mark cuban came out and he was like i think uh he goes i think elon is effing with the sec he goes his filing with the sec allows him to say he wants to take a company private for 54-20 which is like you know before he used to sec fined him like crazy because he said i'm considering taking tesla private for 420 funding secured and so he got to now do it the official way and just put a five in front of the 420. um he had bought the shares a couple months ago this is gonna this this news of him buying and now of the potential takeover that drives shares up let's say they don't accept his offer well then he's he already said i'm gonna sell my shares if you don't take my offer so he's just gonna make a huge profit off of off of these shares right like he's gonna make uh you know like i don't know whatever like i think he bought the shares for three billion uh if if he sells it you know for for you know like whatever 23 game he might make up close to a billion dollars off of just effing with twitter and he gets all the fame remember we were talking about our friend who uh our friend alex who from morningbrew who's gonna who's talking about buying puppet golf courses and we were like this is the optimal spot you said the announcement you got all the praise you don't have to actually do it yeah um get the picture with the check and uh and post it on ig don't don't actually give yourself all the headache and the work of actually running and owning that business uh so elon is at that's perfect spot right now so that's that's one take on it um other takes uh so you know some people you know like crypto twitter basically so there's this uh do you follow this account punk6529 no but i i think i know who he is i'm actually gonna click file now what is it punk what so punk 6529 so this guy's one of the like best twitter accounts to follow he sort of like posts these kind of like thought leadery things about crypto yeah i know this guy he's great he's great he's i think in a very short amount of time like a couple months he's built you know he's got 320 000 followers now because he's just had like really good takes on things um uh on things like this and he he said uh what did he say he goes he said something like you know um he's he's basically like you know twitter should be a protocol it's a short messaging protocol and it doesn't need to be owned by a single company nor does it he says if you're excited about elon taking over twitter or upset about elon taking over twitter well both of these are the exact same problem our global short messaging internet protocol should be completely unaffected by who's the ceo of some random company in california in that same spirit let's talk about you know what what a future you know protocol like this could be and i think that's one of the like that's not like what's going to happen here but i think i think it is like no one company owns email for example right but but which is a protocol for sending messages that are long form and but one company does own twitter protocol and because of that you know you can't just choose like if this was a protocol you could say i want to use the client that has no algorithm i want to use the one that has a really tight algorithm and shows me nothing no no right-wing stuff you would be able to have way more choice as a consumer and way more companies would be able to innovate and build on top of twitter if it was a protocol not a single company so kind of his that doesn't matter who's in charge i don't even think that's logistically possible at this point though or is it uh not really for twitter it's like almost like it's easier for the next thing yeah right that's what i mean jack dorsey has said he's there's a project called blue sky which is the idea of like turning twitter into a decentralized protocol but like who knows like how realistic that is and how much of that is just like you know lip service um so we're working on it and like you know right check in in five years and see how it goes let's talk about this angle here which is actually maybe the most interesting which is a best troll ever so like this guy's like a child and it's some of it's not funny this one is very funny but b i actually think and i think paul graham said something like this this i'm not convinced that this would be good for twitter but i think definitely there's a for sure possibility uh that it could be good for twitter but i think there's a for sure certainty that this is horrible for elon musk consistently the guy makes decisions that are funny and cool and leave people like shocked that uh they did that but it's kind of like eating an entire orange including the peel it's really funny and hilarious that you actually did it and we're gonna laugh about it forever but i'm shocked that i do a guy in college you ate an entire orange and an entire lemon one time in one sitting including the peel and i'm like that's hilarious that you've done that i have a story but now forever but that's gonna suck for you for a while and so that's kind of like what this is like this is gonna be bad for elon for a long time this is not gonna make his life more fun this is gonna make his life uh significantly worse significantly harder so much more pressure this is not a smart move for his personal life well the the point he's at right now is brilliant because what does this say about elon this says number one i'm super rich i could just buy twitter how about that uh somebody tweeted out they go elon said um i okay you know you don't want me on your board okay i won't have a board seat i'll have all the board seats right so so so that's one piece which is like if you in case you forgot i'm way richer than all of you um okay second thing is why are you doing this elon are you just you just want to own it have more power like think about when jeff bezos bought the washington post or whatever it's like uh what are these billionaires trying to do they're trying to control us elon's is like these tech companies are effing it up which that's already the the way that a lot of people believe is that these tech companies have too much power or too much control they're shaping the narrative they're they're not free speech so he came out as i'm doing this for free speech it's like ah how are you gonna argue against free speech right like you know raise your hand if you're against free speech and so he virtue signaled free speech on top of it uh he did it in like a bold and baller way where it's like gonna give him like way more attention and fame and a bunch of reasons why people will talk about him and he's going to make money from it you know just by like buying the shares beforehand then creating all this ruckus and then like you know being able to sell out if he says oh well i didn't get it you know um so so i think and he can kind of be the underdog if like yeah you know they the powers that be wouldn't let me do what i wanted to do i was gonna make this [ __ ] awesome but uh you know they they wouldn't let me do it they tried to they tried to squash me dude how about the fact that we just did an episode where we recapped the milk road where uh you where peter thiel had this like outlandish headline where which it might be true no i don't actually don't think it's i think he was joking a little bit where he said warren buffett's a sociopath and he went to list about all the reasons why warren buffett who called him hold on he called him the sociopathic grandpa in omaha yes who but like warren buffett his stereotype and it's probably actually not true is that he's this nice old man who's just oh shucks i just happened to do it whatever and peter thiel is this evil guy who causes like old grandpa a sociopath and then you've got elon who does the craziest [ __ ] on earth imagine these guys when they're 25 30 years old and they had a little something but maybe not like that much and what type of fun would it have been to be in the same room with these [ __ ] [ __ ] who are who are it's like the perfect combination of like capable enough to pull it off crazy enough to think it's funny and uh it's just all this perfect combination i can't imagine being around these guys when they were younger yeah exactly ben pull this tweet up so he's at elon right now as we're talking he's at ted and uh you know who's there uh is our boys our boys andrew jack so he's at ted right now he was there to talk about whatever spacex tesla whatever dude but of course yeah of course you know uh it's a it's a 30 minute talk about twitter and so ben can you pull this link up in the in the screen share we should watch this this is elon musk talking about his plan b if the deal doesn't go through for twitter so i i haven't watched this video because it's how this just got tweeted out just now so i want to hear i want to live react to whatever he says here seconds do you while ben's finding that clip pull it up then but while ben's finding that clip do you think so like i don't buy like that nice stuff but like let's say like i see a car that i like and it's like 50 000 and i'm like yeah i'm just gonna buy it and i'll figure out how to insure it and i'll figure out where i'm gonna store it after i'm buying it like it's kind of a big deal because it's like a fifty thousand dollar thing but like it's not gonna kill me do you think that elon is thinking about it like i would think about like a fifty thousand 000 car or is this like um like how well how thought out do you think this is well let's let's look at this so elon net worth right now is 265 billion dollars i think yeah but he can't i don't think that i don't i don't think that like that's entire that is true in a sense of a net worth but he definitely has a lot of debt because he's got to sell i mean it's not like that liquid i would think so even if we don't know all the details and we don't know how we don't know all of his personal financial situation but let's just take the high level numbers for a second uh that's i think it you know like whatever roughly 20 of his net worth that he would be putting into this so that's a lot you're worth 10 million dollars is you buying a two million dollar asset right the difference is is that you only have eight million if you're worth 10 million left which is a lot but like you're not gonna go and buy a bunch more two million dollar things with elon you still have 70 or 50 or billion yeah yeah you have whatever like 200 billion to fall back on at the end yeah or whatever it is we have this clip i want to see what he says i don't know if this is going to be good because it just happened just now but ben let's play this and i want to hear it but the truth matters to me a lot really like sort of pathologically it matters to me okay so so you don't like to lose if in this case you are not successful in you know the board does not accept your offer you've said you won't go higher is there a plan b there is i i think we i think we would like to hear a little bit about plan b for it for another time i think another time yeah all right [Applause] i that that's a nice tease all right so um that's great nice [Laughter] well played well played in that in that case i don't know the plan b could be right like launching his own um launching his own thing i think he's probably i don't think i don't think that would that's a good plan b twitter is is you know it's really hard you know like how many people say they're they're gonna create a social media product and how many people try and how many have worked so a lot try everyone tries when they first start and there's like three right right tik tok youtube facebook and instagram and you know what i mean there's three yeah i i do think it would be very very hard this would be much better as to buy the existing asset but how's trump's things doing what's it do you know what the i mean it's like horrible right i downloaded it because i was like i gotta see what's going on on this thing but uh i haven't spent too much time on it it was like crashing like crazy like the first day so yeah so social i don't think building is possible maybe that's the plan b maybe he's gonna be like hey everybody truth social that's where we're going right because then you get the trump stands and the elon stands together together that's a lot of people who are like devoted followers of those two the problem is they hate each other and also elon doesn't care about making conservatives happy he cares about trolling so if you only have your own audience on there it wouldn't be very fun right you know what i mean he he he doesn't like getting people cheering he like he likes pissing people off or ruffling feathers and the thing about the truth i you know what i think that's rooted in i think that's rooted in his father lying to him and so elon's dad so listen you went you went there daddy issues it all comes back to daddy issues everything i think not everything i think that most things in life are genetics and then the other half is things that happen to you from ages like zero to four and i that that's really i mean someone's called he's young what was he lied to between maybe ten how would we even know maybe ten but i do think like things happen when you're two and three like like it actually impacts you but let's go up to ten um and i think that like he's had a troubled relationship with his dad and his dad just wasn't around and i have a feeling there's a world where his dad was like i promise i'll be at this game i promise i'll do this or like you know like you know i'm working on this huge business deal it turns out he's like unemployed and he or he doesn't show up to the game i think that there's like something like that that has happened that he's like obsessive compulsive about the truth i actually do believe him when he says truth hmm what did his wait sorry what did his dad lie to him about i'm just made that up i don't know but i know that his dad his dad his dad wasn't around like his dad like was uh he left his mom and like he wasn't very present in his life and i think he was kind of uh rude to his family and i'm just guessing like there's a world where like he's like a just one was kind of an [ __ ] and was kind of messing around uh and just not doing it for sure the things that you value come from your experiences like you know people who value authenticities because they've dealt with inauthenticity people who value you know family is typically because they've had either great experience as a family or uh terrible experiences with the family and they want to rectify it right so you definitely are shaped by that so if he's telling us you know i'm sort of like what i don't know what he said that like i'm maniacally or whatever he said like you know maniacal about the truth um i think he said i think he said he said obsessive i think i think he says like or he said something like to it's point it's almost a problem that he goes i care about the truth and like you know okay some percentage of that is just again virtue signaling but you know let's take him at his word for it um you know let's be clear what does he think is happening so you know like um what is untrue you know like it's like free speech cool people gonna be able to say anything those not those are not necessarily going to be true right um it's just this belief there's a belief that you know the answer to bad speech is is more speech not censorship so you know i i get that um but i'm not sure really what his ideas are right like if you if you look at the list of ideas i forgot what um i saw this screenshot of elon's uh elon's twitter uh ideas let me see if i could find this real quick i don't even i think that like i i'm not well versed in like the political scene of twitter and like i understand why people want free speech obviously i know the donald trump example and that's just like an example everyone hangs on i don't know tons of other examples one of them being this hunter biden story which i don't even remember what the story was but i know the new york observer which is a conservative paper in new york they said hunter biden i think it involved prostitutes i think it involved drug addict being a drug addict things like that they published it twitter suspended them and turns out a year and a half or two years later it was true and new york times wrote a very similar story saying the same things happened they posted it and they weren't banned and i think that there's a handful of examples like that that people are pissed off about but i'm not sure if it's like rampant other than i mean but one could argue it is rampant the most popular if the president can't use twitter yeah i think that's probably like the strongest uh the strongest like you know example hold on uh okay so i'm just gonna read this out loud real quick uh because all right here let me uh yeah let me read this one here's a list of of what elon has tweeted since um you know since he kind of announced that he what he was going to do and before he uh left the left the board he goes the first one tweet was vote to remove the w from twitter so just tinner and his poll options were yes and of course god that's so stupid that's that's that's kind of a cringe joke exactly proposal number two turn hq into a homeless shelter number three eliminate ad revenue number four just say that twitter is dying number five overhaul the blue checkmark policy number board with that he said he was gonna uh smoke weed at the next board meeting oh my god he posted a meme of him smoking weed at joe rogan uh at the next board meeting uh the next one an edit button next idea and they just put this in quotes free speech like there was no idea of how or why or what you know like just free speech and the last one was open source twitter algorithm so like you know so the people who are like you know elon's gonna save um you know i was gonna save twitter it's like well if you if you pay attention to the uh the ideas that he had uh they were not the most earth-shattering ideas between our tenor homeless shelter you know quote unquote free speech what you know what were these ideas our friend nikita who uh seems like he knows what he's talking about with some consumer apps was like i you know maybe i like elon maybe i don't but running a car company and creating paypal and a solar business is a lot different than like the kind of art that it takes to create a consumer tech product like twitter and i totally agree with that you know like think about this like when someone's like well we're gonna create this thing that you could only rate 140 characters nine out of ten normal people would be like what f that let's make it so i can write as much as i want or let's just make it so anyone can edit it and do all this other stuff and they're like no no we're gonna do this weird thing it's kind of like vine like you only have four seconds to make a video four seconds no one no one can do that it's like no it's actually and it creates a whole art out of it you know what i mean and so i think twitter will or elon could potentially be a little bit too rational and logical to create the magic of uh of twitter so i have the complete opposite take i think if the guy can land a rocket re-land a rocket on its butt in the middle of the ocean and he can make electric cars that are awesome pretty sure he could like you know figure out the social media thing now the problem is he's still doing those other things like [ __ ] albert einstein ain't going to create youtube you know what i mean like he's not going to create it he doesn't need to create it he's just he's a he's a he's a leader and he's a first principal thinker you know like do who do i have more faith in perage or elon i have more faith in elon than i do for peridot well yeah but that guy ain't running that guy's running it he ain't he's a video he's just making sure that his trains show up on time he's not building the train well that's the problem right like you know that's why it's plateaued that's what user growth was like 300 million monthly active users like whatever five years ago now it's like 340. it's like it hasn't grown uh much at all plus you know other problems of like hate scams and other stuff so my take is is that this is the ultimate example of social media ruining everything so like think about in your in my day like um i know for me how much time and productivity from like useful awesome activities i i could be doing i'm just checking twitter i'm on tick tock and whatever you know social media is this like distraction time suck it's like damn this guy's trying to make us multi-planetary and like self-driving cars and like get us off of fossil fuels and he's getting distracted by social media he's just doing it at the biggest scale like not just using social media he's like i'm gonna buy it then i'm gonna have to fix it and it's like dude no no just just do the thing where you help us like go to mars and have self-driving cars that are electric like those are the useful things solving social media is like just another distraction just done at elon scale if he dies in the next five years would you be surprised i would not be surprised i would not be surprised either do you think that would be the way that that would that's does this story have to end that way like no i don't think he's gonna die that i don't think he's gonna die like you know low probability but i do think that um it would turn him into like the greatest cult hero ever well it's kind of like uh you know everyone talks about tupac and i've got tupac in my background here i love tupac you know he died when he was 25 he was only 25 and people talk about this guy being like yeah a lot of people don't know that he was 25 biggie was 24 okay and so people are like oh they're the best rappers ever and i'm like well they didn't really have that long of a career so like jay-z and m and eminem they've done it for like you know 20 years now so they definitely have and and and but the reason we say he's the best ever is because he died young and it's like all the potential so in some way i'm like that's elon can do the same he should go out on top maybe and then we'll remember him as being the best i mean would you want to die and be the tupac of newsletters or what no i wouldn't want to no but i'm not elon you know there's two things i know in this world like that you know there's crazy guys in the world like elon and the second thing is i'm not one of them that's that's what i know is is there's weirdos like him and i ain't it we should end it on that just to reiterate your angle sam you're of the opinion that elon has daddy issues and you hope he dies is that correct um uh to the first point 100 his dad daddy issues yeah show me a successful person i'm gonna show you a [ __ ] up dad for sure without a doubt okay the second thing do i do i hope he dies 100 no do i think it will be an even better part of the story yes unless he has some like um what's the guy's name uh the rich guy who uh created the airplane that uh leo had a movie howard hughes unless he has some kind of weird howard hughes thing where it becomes even more uh or jd salinger where he just disappears and it becomes even more of this like mystery then yeah i'm on board with that but if he just gets old and he just begins like peeing himself and dies i'm like oh [ __ ] like you can't he can't go out that way yeah yeah that's actually a better question which was what's the right way for elon to go you know like heart attack nah just he was overworked and stressed nah that's that's for that's for the common man well dying on mars like crashing exactly that's a great way he's got to be the guy who goes to mars dies in the process taking taking men farther than they've ever gone before that's got to be the way he goes just drifts out of space or he just disappears and just like no one knows where he is and he's just he's he lives in a uh a trailer in rural and he has to go when he goes out he has to say he's satoshi nakamoto also he has to just he's the smartest move he could do right if i'm his pr team i'm like listen elon before you go we need to claim the satoshi thing uh that's just the cherry on top of your legacy is if you were satoshi and there's no way to disprove it if you're going to go anyways so um so that that's the last little little thing he should do on his to-do list on the bucket list before he kicks it dude this is awesome all right that was not where i thought we would end it with him dying that's a that's a good impromptu episode i think ben what do you think loved it i loved it i um i think uh i think it's a bad investment i but i think elon's having fun if you had as much money as he had why would you not spend your time just having fun i think he's having fun i don't think he's having fun i don't think he's having fun i think he's doing it as an investment you think this is a strategy i think that he's kind of playing the role of a court jester where he's laughing on the outside and it appears to be fun and everyone's laughing with him uh but also he's crying on the inside i think i do i i do not think that his life is enjoyable in any sense of the word i don't either but i think he's getting enjoyment from this probably yeah like it's like a i think it's a but i think it's our version of like when you tweet something funny or i tweet something funny i also like like giggity like i'm like i'm like quagmire family guy like giggity that's hilarious but like it doesn't it's not like i'm happy like three days later from that and feel like content right right yeah you're saying he doesn't come across like a content happy person and hell no said in many interviews the to that extent you know things like you wouldn't want to be me that's not what uh you know a very happy content person says okay great or i will find death as a relief right so those are pretty you know as strong as it gets you don't have to read between the lines there uh but to ben's point i do think that he gets off on being you know the class clown the guy who gives the middle finger to the to the to the system right he's he's taking fu money and he's saying fu so you know he's he is enjoying i think the stunt aspect of it and i don't think he's doing it as an economic investment i think he's he's doing it as a combination of maybe 20 stunt publicity stunt and maybe 80 mission and maybe i'm wrong on those sliders maybe it's more like 50 50 or you know 80 20 the other way i'm not sure i i think it's 80 mission 20 stunt not an economic investment but i use the most economic as we say on the on this on my first million podcast uh yeah we're big on being post-economic uh late stage capitalism that's what we're known for but i do think like you look at jeff bezos who bought washington post i don't know he paid like a billion for washington post oh i think he paid 200 million dollars to 200 million okay 200 million nothing but at the same time he got nothing like washington post gives you a voice i guess but like you don't even have full editorial control and like it could if you wanted to but he could if he wanted to i think what he got is a little different i think at the time that was seen as like cool power move like we all know about that so it did work in that sense the second thing he got was something many rich guys have just vanity you know collectibles items ah yeah i own this i own the you know this farm i own this basketball team i own i own these things you've heard of um that there is a sort of rich guy toy toy chest thing i agree it's like owning a sports team it's like a journalism sports team but i think like from the functionality standpoint of like actually being able to have a voice like buying twitter is sort of the same thing but he's getting the only voice that matters like he's getting the only thing that can actually drive and change public opinion if he wanted to to pull that move how much is like cnn hmm good question what's the parent company [Music] well i think they just merged did they uh maybe between five and 10 billion i would guess yeah look up look up a lot of bags for your buck but news corp which is the one so basically rupert murdoch started fox which is uh he started this one company that recently uh had to separate because it was a monopoly on news and those two companies became news corp which basically owns fox news and fox news affiliates and then 21st century fox which is like the movies and tv shows and collectively that value is like i think a hundred no no uh or 50 13 billion uh both of them combined no maybe i don't have the second one what's the news corp news class a is 13 billion that's the least valuable or the less lesser of the two what's the more valuable one fox 21st century i think that's what it's called i don't know dude i think this is the one uh fox corporation fox okay i don't know if this is the right fox but fox corporation 30 billion yeah that's it that's it so fit uh 43 total yeah yeah this is the right one and they're way more popular than cnn so uh yeah cnn can't be that expensive but who the [ __ ] wants to own cnn these dudes who want to own washington post and twitter right why not dude you know how many people watch cnn uh at any given point like they're real-time viewers it's like sometimes as low as tens of thousands of people like it's not it's it's not a significant amount of people that are watching at any given point there's chicks on twitch doing asmr that have more viewership than cnn like in the middle of the afternoon yeah that's what i'm saying like cnn like not really but it's hilarious that i said that i mean there's like cool [ __ ] like anderson cooper is pretty cool but like it's just like [ __ ] dentist like you listen to it when you're at the dentist like it's not like particularly when you're trapped in a chair being tortured yeah it's like shooting situations and like going to the dentist or like the only times that i've got like cnn on or when you go to like do you ever go to the do you ever get coffee in the morning in fox or at a mcdonald's they always have like fox playing in the background that's like the only time i like see the news that's hilarious did you see the cnn plus like fail it failed yeah dude what do you expect like you can't just like put a plus and then a paywall on like the [ __ ] that no one cares about and hopefully they automatically do courts shut down their paywall today too it was the same thing it's like you can't just call quartz pro and expect to get more money because the main course already sucks you know what i mean like you're just putting a bow on like pay for it though yeah like you can't put a bow on a pile of poo and it automatically isn't a pile of poo but that's basically what a lot of these companies do and it's not the right move yeah the plus thing is just like a dead giveaway it's like that's a tell a plus or pro [Laughter] um all right that was good you

[Music] there were so many things that i did foolishly during that time and i'm not just talking about like you know oh you know i wasn't as good at this thing as i am now it's like no like there was so much opportunity right under my nose and i was blind to it and like one of the biggest like scary things for me now is like what are those things today that are right in front of me that i'm too stupid to see just like i was too stupid to see it seven years ago when i was doing that other thing um for example greg you were in our early mastermind groups and the founders of calm were there and they were talking about how hard it was and how they're just you know it was just alex it was just kind of like yeah it's hard to raise money right now i'm trying and and we were just like dude it's cool app man you should stick with it he's like yeah i'm gonna just keep going and like that's a two billion dollar plus company now and we were helping him like dude why didn't we cut the check you were there too i don't know you didn't cut a check either did you i remember at the time like if i'm being honest like i felt that it was too niche like i was like we were like sean you and i were focusing on like we were doing the big stuff stuff that was going to be yeah exactly later he's got the huge company exactly uh there was so many of those so in our masterminds itself i think uh loom was in there that's a billion dollar company and i remember kind of like trying to mentor shy and being like bro like you know don't worry you'll figure it out maybe it's not this one but like when you get to your real game you're gonna be like good because of this experience you were friends with him too like did you invest in that like i missed i missed it was called uh uh what was it called open test dot co and that's what loom was originally and it you know it felt like you know when you're doing your first startup and it just feels so shaky because you're it's your first time doing all this stuff like that's what it felt like and so it was you know and then also the the narrative at the time was don't invest in other people's startups you got if you if you want to make it in silicon valley you got to give laser focus so i you know my mistake in my 20s was i came to san francisco and you know i listened to all these vcs with all their narratives and i did it and if i were to redo it i would frankly just be doing what i now which is doing like what i'm doing now which is like focused on communities doing agency services you know focusing on niches and and and web you know yeah just build an experiment and not have the biggest exits in the world so there was like 10 examples like that like i remember alex mccall came over one day and he we were catching up and then he went on to start clear i remember thinking this guy's [ __ ] amazing um i should invest in this clear bit thing and i like went over to his office and we like hung out i was like about to meet the guys i was like i love the energy of this office man like if i just couldn't do anything besides feel this office i would be like they're building a winner in here and that's also like i don't know if it's a billion it's multi-hundred million um and he told me at the end he goes oh by the way i'm buying up uh i was like what else are you doing finally i started asking more questions like what else are you doing he's like oh i bought up some stripe shares this striped shirt is available for like two billion dollars so i'm buying a bunch of striped shirts i think it was him maybe josh buckley is one of them and he's like i'm buying up stripes for 2 billion let me know if you want in and i was like 2 billion to me i was like well that's like the most a startup is worth there's like a billion is like the top of the mountain so like to me it was like oh there's no upside left you know i didn't like think from first principles about like everybody knew stripe was [ __ ] amazing it was like the best startup in the whole like you know in silicon valley and i had this opportunity to go buy stripes at 2 billion and i thought how late i was and i was like man i wish i could have got in earlier and now like you know the things i would give for stripe shares at 2 billion now like it's like that's already like like 100x you know from from there and that was proven right forget that then there was all the services we were using like fur khan who's my cto he would be like oh this is a cool cool product let's use this in our tech stack if i had just invested in all the bills we were paying for like software we were using like pagerduty and elasticsearch and so you know like one after another those were all huge winners that were pre-ipo um so first was investing the second was like project selection so like you were talking about greg i did the same thing i was playing by the rules of like i was playing by other people's rules meaning like what was considered cool in silicon valley was to be like a product guy who was building who had like cool product taste and was building like um you know like new markets and like going for the big billion dollar prizes and then i met sam who was like i'm writing this newsletter it's free i'm gonna have like newsletter ads and i was like yeah but like are you gonna do a startup someday like that's how i felt about it right sam's company sells for more than more than my company sold for in the end he goes uh he goes look you're good but basically like you're showing up to a knife fight with a knife and i wish you would show up with a magic wand that would just murder the competition i'm like sounded cool right i was like uh that's a great analogy that's a cool story but like uh i don't know man i think the math kind of i think it might achieve the desired outcome which i'm trying to do here which uh when i started i was just trying to be financially independent by the age of 30. that was the only goal um and so so like if i could go back and just whisper three things about like just stress just strategy like forget life advice just strategy advice i would have said um invest in all the smart people you know like it'll it'll work out if you don't have the money go convince somebody that you have a bunch of really smart friends that they should give you money to invest in that that would be the first thing the second is invest in all of the expenses on your p l so go find all the places you're spending money and go try to invest in all those companies that will also do fantastically well you'll make more on that than your own company okay if you really want to do your own company beyond that fantastic that's great you're going to build up skills and you've got a lottery ticket there that might work i would have just said like don't try to be mark zuckerberg from the social network like think about what like like basically just open your eyes to the problems and the opportunities that exist today and so like you know whether it was like e-commerce or shopify apps or like these sounded small at the time but they sounded small because that's where they were early and like at that time i needed a vc to like stamp their approval that this was a good market or a good opportunity which by that time is pretty late because what's the vc doing they're looking at what companies are raising huge rounds which means like four years ago those were great opportunities three years ago those were great opportunities and so i wish i had just kind of been more eyes wide open on like what projects are available to you and like the things that sound kind of nation funny those are actually better signals for you than the thing that the vc is saying is gonna be huge or is already huge because it's often um you know those companies to start are like you're in a you're in an absolute dog fight and it's just like one winner out of 100 is going to emerge versus other things where like you could basically take no no product risks no market risk so i had a friend vishal tell me this once he goes i invest in companies with no product market fit risk i had never heard somebody say that it didn't even make sense to me i go what do you mean like every startup is product market fit risk you guys know it's not like what he goes he was the one who convinced me to buy bitcoin initially as well he was like bitcoin's going to be the you know the biggest thing in the world he's like i just put up basically all the money i have in the bitcoin i was like what the [ __ ] this is like back in 2005 16 15. nobody was really saying that back then so for the product market fit thing he goes he goes for example i just invested in a company that's making a robot that makes pizzas and it makes pizza it makes a perfect pizza every time 24 7 at a lower cost than a human being can do it he goes i don't know if they can because there's a ton of engineering risk like they may not be able to technically do it but if they can do it there's zero market risk every pizza shop will want this over paying an employee to make imperfect pizzas only in certain hours call in sick and blah blah like it for a higher cost and i was like oh [ __ ] that's true there are things that have zero market risk and i was taking like maximum market risk before so like that's the other strategy is like you don't have to take as much market risk the thing you're doing now greg is like way less market risk the thing i'm doing with milk road had like zero market risk basically and there's just like there's a lot of money there's life-changing money that can be made and a lot of fun that can be had without taking on unnecessary what happened to that pizza company uh i think they're still in engineering risk mode they got like a big contract from domino's but then their ceo got was in trouble for some things that they hired a new ceo something something something you know like again these are legit engineering risks so i'm not like that doesn't mean they'll all work but like what i'm doing with the newsletter is like neither technical risk nor market risk yeah operational risk it's just are you gonna are you gonna be able or wanting to do it for a long time which is yeah we're just like you know that's a pretty good thing to try to overcome right yeah it's really tough you know i remember coming to san francisco and and hearing all these narratives and these bc's telling me this and also entrepreneurs sort of repeating a lot of this stuff and i will say it it's tough to go against what these stamps of approvals say to do you know like you have to tell yourself every day like and i have to do that too like when i started a services business all my most of my silicon valley friends were like a services business like an agency that's what you're gonna do after you know like and you just kind of have to push forward and really just um remember that you know just because some you know certain people on twitter say a certain thing or or or sequoia or andreessen say a certain thing doesn't mean um you can't have a great like i would say you can have a better lifestyle not being mark zuckerberg than being mark zuckerberg yeah exactly [Music] you

so i haven't seen any of these questions so um it started out from a tweet where someone said like here's 10 questions to get to know people is that is that right yeah listener of the pod and i think your friend blake blake burge i think is his name uh he had tweeted out a thing like you know whatever there are many questions but few will change your life here's ten questions that will change your life and you know thread goes viral so by the way you know normally it's kind of like eye roll no it's good there's this thing ben you'll have to look it up again no research here there's this thing i remember years ago it was called like the new york times like 21 questions and it was like here ask these 21 questions on a first year right well on a first date i thought and it was like here's how you get intimate with people and like as a single 21 year old i read that i was like oh like here so i can hook up with girls and i remember those questions and they're very similar to what these guys questions are but it was like when did your father make you cry or like like it was like pretty deep questions like that um and so i'm down with these questions [Music] so i actually read these questions and i was like these are actually good questions but um the way he presented it i think uh you know no offense is how most people do twitter it's like here's some general advice or some general questions what's interesting to me is not the quote like the question but it's kind of seeing somebody struggle with their their answer to that question so for example um he would ask a question like and i'll give you give you the first question which is which is going to come out here in a second so ben read question number one i'll explain how he tweeted it and how i think we should answer instead read in what areas of my life am i settling okay so what area is my life am i settling that's a powerful question it's a good thought-provoking question now his the rest of his tweet was like you know just enough or just okay is not good enough identify the areas you like you're just settling so to me that's the part where it was like no no blake i want to hear your answer like you tell me like if you're gonna put out one of these [ __ ] ass threads that's like you know generic generic generic thread um to try to get likes i think that the next level of this like [ __ ] thread thing is people are gonna get a little more vulnerable they're gonna put their actual answers in the thread rather than general advice who's invented this this theme i'm seeing so like upworthy was like here's ten things you're not gonna believe number seven this new one that i'm seeing on twitter is there's eight thousand of this thing here's the four best eight billion humans on this earth not all of them are worth following here's my eleven friends that are worth who created that well ben all right what's the first one i just tried it it's uh in what area of my life you go first okay so what areas of my life am i settling and by the way this is called the boys go to therapy because we got to open up a little bit we gotta we gotta see what the what this what the answer might be i would say two come to mind the first is fitness like i think i got kind of comfortable with my workout routine and diet and i was like oh okay like not as fat as i was i'm on my way to getting fit and i just kind of got okay with like i was kind of settling for like wow you're much better than before but i've been like writing that for for like you know 12 months now and now the before is the same as the current because it's like been a while like six months of like the same and so i just realized this recently and was like why did i settle here this isn't the destination like i basically was on a road trip and i stopped at the gas station and then unpacked my bags instead of being like no no this is not the destination this is the pit stop i gotta get to the hotel where's my suitcase open you made a lot of progress so in a relatively short amount of time you just gotta keep going yeah so i would say i'm settling there and the other one i'm settling i think is me and my wife like we have two little kids and there's like you know this feeling of like you know what like we put a lot into work okay then you put you're putting a lot into your fitness you're putting a lot into your kids and it's like oh whatever's left over at the end of the day for each other like you know we take what we can get as the scraps uh of like you know the energy the kind of like um just the effort we put into kind of your relationship as i think we've both kind of settled on that which is like it's fine they're not they're not leaving they're not going anywhere it's just fine we can hold you because we can always do this later when the kids grow up is she gonna listen to this no that's the beauty of it you should never listen to this i think that that's good that you you said that maybe uh maybe that will make her like you more yeah especially because i didn't say that she is doing all this right he said we are doing it which is you know the key all right what about you what areas of your life do you think you're settling um my a consistent diet needs to i think i could i like to improve that i looked at my goals over the last 10 years so i created a goal tracking thing 10 years ago when i was about 21 and i hit all of them except for wanting to weigh 190 pounds i've always struggled to lose 10 pounds and i just i've always wanted to do it i've never done it and so i've i'm sucking at that the second thing career-wise i've settled a bit so i i purposely set up a period where i was like one year the sale in plus one year i'm gonna chill i'm just gonna read i'm gonna learn and i still am not ready to like go all in on something i'm not there yet and so i'm kind of being a little bit lazy and i feel a little guilt around that and then i'll do a relationship one dude i'm super dependent on sarah like uh if someone like wants me to come speak somewhere i'll be like sarah can you just like handle this or like do you want me to go speak here like let me know like i'm only gonna and oftentimes because i don't like to fly i'll be like uh by the way i'm only going if you're available like if you don't go i don't want to go because i enjoy being around her and i think i should learn to do a few things by myself a little bit more than i have been lately i just tend to rely on her so freaking much that i need to i need to go do stuff by myself give me one that's give me one that's uh a settle that you i feel like all those settles maybe that both of us said are like settles that we're kind of cool with what's a settle you're not cool with the weight thing yeah the weight thing i'm not cool with that like i get up like i'm pissed off i'm like why can't i just be consistent if i was just consistent for like five months with in a certain amount of calories i'd be good i'm i would be good i would hit it but it is so freaking tempting and i just give in to that [ __ ] and that pisses me off um what else i don't know what am i i do think that so tell me if this is a settling thing i create i've created a couple little small products in my free time and i get so excited about making like 500 100 a thousand dollars a day i get so much joy from that and i'm like dude i could crush this if i want to i can build i can build things that are huge why am i not why don't i have the motivation to do this and so i feel like i feel soft and like i'm settling in that aspect yeah i think one uh one that i've seen in myself and by the way i don't think that that was uh i forgot what you said you said tell me what you think about this like i agree with you so so i think that was good um i'm thinking more and more that the the settling thing the easiest way for me to pinpoint where i'm settling is when i see the contrast when i see somebody who's not settled in this area and i'm like oh hmm they wow they're really pushing it beyond beyond where i am right now in this like and it doesn't mean i'm always going to just chase and do what others do necessarily but it kind of takes me seeing that for me to be like oh word like that's this isn't uh this isn't the kind of the spot to just settle down and dig my heels in and so that's happened to me with money like for example i've seen people's lifestyle or i've seen people's just people talking about stuff it's like somebody will be like um yeah we you know we picked up this project and then we you know like a real estate deal we picked up this deal and we're gonna flip it you know basically four months later and you know we should make one and a half million on that and i'm just sort of like oh okay so like their normal where they have settled for their normal is like what would have been let's say an outstanding outcome for me but like to them that's the normal course of business and then i just sort of check myself and i say all right do i care and usually i usually i do care usually i do care when i notice those things because that's why they stood out to me in the first place and like sometimes they don't stand out in this way that i'm saying where i'm saying it all calmly i'm just sort of like usually it's like i'm jealous of them or i'm like um i find myself trying to come up with a reason why that's not good and then i gotta hold my i gotta pull myself back like oh or maybe instead of coming up with reasons why that's not good i should just admit that it's probably good and something that i actually want for myself and i'm just trying to kind of like mentally in my own justification tear their [ __ ] down a little bit to make myself feel okay but in reality maybe i should just say oh cool they showed me something i want um and maybe i've i've i've actually just kind of settled here but i could go further than i than i currently have do do a journal do you have a history of journaling or goal-setting just like writing down like thoughts or targets that you want to achieve for different ages not ages uh but like do you like kind of have ideas in mind but it's not it's not based on how old i am like i i've done this no i don't mean like in the future current age what i mean is like when you're 21 where you're like all right this year i want to accomplish this when i was 21 i did i said okay by 30 i i used to say by 30 i want to have a million dollars in the bank and i had a couple of goofy ones it's like i got a million dollars in the bank i want to have gone on survivor and i want to like you know i had like two other like i don't remember what they were at this point and then like as i got older i was like oh well that number needs to be bigger and then the second one time isn't really a factor and like oh i don't care about forbes 30 to 30 that's actually all [ __ ] and like you know i kind of adjusted my like goals once i like wasn't 21 anymore well i think it's good to look at those things because i i'll look at all my old journaling and writings and i'm like what what energy was i putting into there what was i bummed about what was i excited about and then oftentimes i do one of two things i either try to impress my past self or try to make my future self pumped where i'm like what what what will i be really excited that i did now um in 10 years so there's this thing i don't know if you've heard of it so chris sacca who is uh you know one of the kind of best investors of all time who's one of the biggest investors in twitter and instagram and a couple other badass companies he um he had this thing which was like he he read out somewhere i think it was like on the tim ferriss podcast or something he like he read out a note that he had written to himself um a note that he had written written to himself when he was 20 years old and um and he goes i i actually i just found it while we were talking here this is perfect i found the transcript have you do do you know what i'm talking about do you know what about dick say yeah yeah i remember it i remember it what did he say i don't remember exactly what he said but i remember this episode he goes uh he goes something about you know what do you want to be when you grow up he goes so here i am i'm 20 years old i'm living in cork ireland and we'd start the day drinking at 11 30 blah blah blah and i never heard of an investment banker i've never heard at that point i had never heard of a venture capitalist and so i just wrote in there i don't know what the job is called but i know it's going to involve a lot of talking on the phone a lot of negotiating a lot of yelling at people high risk high reward unbelievably high stakes and i'm going to do it part-time from the mountains part-time from the beach whatever it does whatever it is i'm going to be done with it before i'm 40. and then he's like you know fast forward he this was you know just i think he was 40 41. and basically a billionaire accomplished is exactly that yeah so he's like he's now a billionaire who does exactly that makes deals he didn't know what a vc was but he became a vc which is that deal he has a house and truckee and you know another one on the beach so he had the mountains in the beach thing and it was like literally it all played out and he retired from the game and he was like done with it and he moved on with his life and he started doing other things and so um so i always thought that was really cool and i thought it was cool because it wasn't like these [ __ ] lame goals it was a description of his it was like a painting of his life it was like a movie scene of his life and i've noticed that the people who kind of do this like they kind of call their shot and manifest it they don't really call their shot with like some like it doesn't feel like excel it feels like imovie it's not like a bullet point analytical thing it's like a vision for how their life is gonna be and what life is gonna feel like and they don't even know the words to describe it or the route to get there like but that's it that thing at the end that's how it's going to feel that's what it's going to look like that's what i'm going to do i'm doing this tonight i'm doing this is good i imovie not excel that's a good one if you were going to do uh like let's do a kind of off-the-cuff shitty version right again we do it for the entertainment uh we do it for the people what do you think would go into that what do you what's your what comes to mind as your version of that um i like physical places as opposed to internet places so i like i it would really i want to have a i really want to own i want to have some type of physical land or pla or buildings throughout the country that i can entertain all of my friends all at one time by the way for all of us can i propose something here yeah can i propose we do a two-minute thing where we just jot down on our note here what we think it is and we'll just cut that out no because i'm not prepared i'm not prepared what's yours that's what i'm saying we got to write it down we got to figure it out okay so i think i'm not ready all right look at that reaction this tells you that's that's what we call resistance when the boys go to therapy that's we've identified some resistance i have to figure this out this is like such a hard thing to do next question ben [ __ ] are you guys ready for the next question okay let me let me give you my let me give you my scene right now okay my scene that i have in my head is you're already living i'm living no dude my house is like this i already know the house it's this big-ass house that everything's [ __ ] white inside my i'm at this i have the same i have a chef like i have today but it's like on this like giant area there's people just coming in and out of my house because we're like the [ __ ] lobby like my whole life and work is so integrated that like my trainer's showing up they're having brunch with us and then the you know i'm having this meeting with this other person but they're also going to work out with us and the whole thing is just integrated into one big ass thing my mom's over my sister's over because we all live nearby because we all made it the second thing is i take a nap midday with no guilt so zero guilt midday nap i already know that that is like that is the that implies that the rest of the [ __ ] worked itself all out and then the last piece is um all i get to do is just meet interesting people and uh be super curious about them and then i just either i don't know record or type or something like kind of like what we're doing right now i just take the interesting bits i put it out there and it's in millions it's in a million people's ears or eyes you know the next day because they are following it um they love the content the like they love the content package that i put out and i never meet those people i don't have to talk to them i'm not their consultant i'm not their motivational speaker i just kind of i'm taking little bits of what i'm curious about and i'm putting it into a million people's ears every morning i think uh you're almost i think you're practically there i don't know you got to get the house and the fancier chef dude you could take a nap now i'm sure dude the midday nap right now with kids that's indulgent if you take it like two years that's like that's not giving the middle finger to your spouse i'm gonna take a nap right now what's the next question by the way that million people's ear things that was old i said that before we started this podcast i had told silly he was like what do you want to do next when i was selling the company and we were on like a [ __ ] 10 mile walk we just kept walking in the middle of the night and he was like tell me more what are you thinking i said dude i think what i want to do is i just want to have some way that i can just get my thoughts out there and it gets in a million people i remember calling it ear balls i said it's in a million people's ear balls in the morning i said i just think that that would be so cool if i could just be on people's ears while they're on their commute to work or whatever else and that was before the podcast now the podcast is getting close to that yeah you have that all right and you can go out of order ben pick pick the questions that are interesting to you um let's go with question 10 you should choose your battles wisely what battles do i choose dude i choose so many petty battles like if i when i'm driving and i see someone behind me and they're driving like an [ __ ] and cutting other people off i like go out of my way to slow down and purposely like block it so i'm going just as fast as the fast lane so they can't get by me um also i reply you're like i go to their destination yeah dude i don't have to wear it it pisses me off at someone's route i also uh reply to the just so many comments that i shouldn't reply to um where i think someone has said something and it's just kind of ridiculous and i reply to it and there's no reason why i should be doing that so i pick a lot of really really really dumb battles your hoa battle that you had i would die on that one that would that would that this would not stand that's what i would i mean i would go hard on that one what was the question though what battles do you pick that you shouldn't it's basically it says choose battles wisely what battle do i choose so which really which is saying what battle do you want to be choosing another way of looking at is what you said which is what are the shitty what battles am i stupidly choosing right now that i need to not be choosing dude i choose so much small stuff like i just for some reason i stay like hardcore in the dirt like for example i'm out at my ranch and i've got people here like setting up my airbnb and stuff and like people are like doing the stuff but like i just have to be here and i'm like putting [ __ ] together or like [ __ ] it i guess i'm gonna go rent a car go to costco it's like no we're already doing that i choose the smallest stuff as opposed to leveraging my my skill set and so that is an unwise battle that i should not be picking instead i need to be thinking about much bigger things and i just i simply don't i think having kids might change that i think there's a world where that where i'm praying that having a child is gonna like somehow like show me the way uh you guys could tell me if i'm wrong but dude i picked the smallest i focus on tiny tiny tiny issues that's like i have a friend who the like they're a couple they're like kind of going through problems right now as a as a relationship and then she said something she was like i just feel like i need to have a kid and then that's gonna like help us and i was like oh my god no that is not the answer like i understand why you do that that will make this relationship better but it is going to do the exact opposite i think it could be the answer to be honest having a dog is like two percent of having a child not in the sense of i'm taking care of it but it's like i've got something that i need to protect and take care of and it makes me a little bit happier i imagine properly having a human being where you're like oh i have to dedicate my my life to this person it's beyond me at this point i have a feeling that is that can be very inspiring and that's why i think a lot of like 35 and 40 year olds who are childless and are like getting messed up on psychedelics all the time and feel depressed i'm like dude just [ __ ] pop out some babies i bet like you won't be asking yourself how do i find myself you're going to say how do i just like make this kid happy and like when you dedicate yourself to others i think you're happier uh can i read you something cool by the way uh that i just do you disagree with that um no i think you're right in that in two ways so i think you're right that having a kid definitely takes the focus off yourself so that that eliminates like a huge number of worries that you have but it replaces them with new worries if your habit is to worry guess what whatever situation i put you in you're gonna find something to worry about it's just better to worry about other people though it's it's more reasonable it is an improvement it is an improvement the other thing is that yeah some [ __ ] just gets thrown out the window because you don't have that bandwidth you don't have that extra time to think about stuff and do stuff and make that trip to costco because it's just off the table you don't have the time and so so that's one thing but it doesn't fundamentally change the nature of the problem the root cause of the problem um which would be you know like a focus on minor things because guess what then you're going to start to focus on you know why your kids you know pinky toe is a little bit crooked and why they have this little rash on their knee and like why they're not eating why they didn't eat all you know a balanced lunch and like there's a million there's a zillion things you could worry about with a kid and you could even justify them further because it you're i'm a martyr i'm a great parent for doing so so you got to be careful with that i don't think it goes away but i do think it like changes the problem a little bit so what's yours um okay i'll answer the question i'm gonna read you this thing so the battles um the battles i should pick i should pick the battles i want to choose are um health so being in the best health that i can be and having a healthy lifestyle for me and the people around me is your wife healthy does she eat healthy yeah she she uh she's in and out she can be when she's on it she's super clean she doesn't have the problem i have of discipline like once she flips the switch she'll just never eat bad again until she flips the switch off and then she'll eat oreos all day and so it's like you know one or the other um and so but and same thing with working out she's like hardcore intense about that and hardcore intense about her diet um and like she doesn't waver at all so uh but it's just a matter of what mood she's in um like and the mood is like a year-long mood not like a daily daily fluctuation so i think health is the first one because i've seen that once your health goes a little sideways nothing else actually meant none of the other battles have like any relevance anymore uh i think the second one is like probably the probably the second battle to choose is like uh i don't know probably something around parenting but i don't even know how to phrase it like i don't know being like not constantly um trying to like rush through parenting parenting and like getting the job done uh that's probably the second one is like the battle of enjoying being patient with my kids uh and then the last one is probably like i do too many projects i have so many [ __ ] projects at once and they're all good projects but they're probably collectively together a bad number of projects that's probably the worst one i know i always say it but how many people criticize you about that uh i don't know if my friends and people who actually care about me like i don't know like the people who know me and care about me they do they do the people are like oh that's cool you do so many things and my friends are like that's not cool all these things could be cool but you got to do them you got to do them right and if you're not going to do them you got to figure out how to like hire somebody who's going to do that thing for you dude i would if i was you i would only do three things i would do the podcast because that's not that hard and it kind of drives the other thing i would do milk road and i would do investing yeah the problem is i'm too deep in on e-commerce and so i gotta like either hire my way out or sell this thing or i don't know what i don't know what the other option you got to sell it i think you sell it or something i think that everyone talks about hiring someone to run [ __ ] you're still like involved somehow like you're not actually i think that that's actually really hard to do i don't know when you did it for the hustle you were pretty good about it right yeah but i thought about it all i mean i still felt like i was working there but yeah i i didn't do other projects though um i want to read something to you real quick there's a thing from duvall that's i don't know you said something that reminded me of this there's a little i have a slack channel called wisdom and this is in there so he goes uh he says the only true test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life it's the only true test of intelligence is if you're getting what you want out of life it goes there's two parts to this one is are you able to hack reality to get what you want and the more important one was were you smart enough to figure out what you should want in the first place that's the hardest part that's the hard part exactly and like you know you read this and you nod and then it's like have i been smart enough to figure this out in the first one what do i even want and then do i do i like both you and i we have developed the skills of hacking reality but we get a little loose easier remembering what what we actually want and what doesn't matter what we don't care about and like remembering which game to actually play yeah bending reality is in my opinion the easy part what knowing what you want is the way way harder i don't know one other part that i really liked he goes um you live in a society which has a bunch of people in it so that will train you to play the the bunch of people game the multiplayer game but only only as an individual do you get to stumble on the hidden game the single player game and that is the real game and he goes he says a couple things he goes um he goes uh if you had no adversity it would be a very boring game so remember you got to play the game it's your game you get to design the board design the challenge you get to design the victory condition and that is the creativity that is like you know sort of you get to decide the purpose of your own life and in the same way you get to decide what game you're going to play what the rules are and what the victory condition is and if you where did you write this intentionally done that you're uh you know you're not you're not playing it you know you haven't actually started playing that game uh consciously yet where do you write that i know he he said this on like a twitter spaces or something like that this guy's zach zach pogrobb uh tweeted it out i liked it that's good ben let's do another question what's another one all right i think this is an interesting one um what are you letting in so in other words like uh he says turn off the news don't read the comments interacting with negativity think of it as mental fitness like what what things are you letting in what noise you're letting in that you shouldn't let in oh that you shouldn't i have a yeah what are you letting through through the window or the door that actually you know you shouldn't be should be getting through that what are yours well i had you had written something on the doc that i think is interesting it's about feedback so let's just zoom it in to feedback what was your question around feedback so i have a few ways that i go about doing this but you could do this when building a product or when um just asking people about your personality which i think you should do like what do i where do i suck where do i rock and what you'll notice and it's very clear i tweeted out what do you like about the podcast what do you want more of what do you want less of and for every person who says they want a longer podcast there's an equal amount of people who say they want a shorter one there are some people who say more guests there are some people who say no guest and that makes things really hard to figure out feedback and so i was gonna ask you uh how do you decide which feedback to listen to and which to ignore so i started off like i used to the way i used to think about this was dude feedback is the key you need a feedback loop you need to talk to your customers you need to know your audience and there was all these like you know books written about how important that stuff is and so i became [ __ ] mr feedback i would you know if i had a project idea i'm taking the designs out to a mall and i'm stopping people saying hey will you give me feedback on this idea and you know every co-worker i was like hey i would love some feedback what do you like about me what do you hate about me what's good about me to work with etc i was [ __ ] mr feedback and then i started to get what you what you just described which is information whiplash which is it's like information overload but it's not just an overload it's the contradictory information yeah and so then i'm like oh [ __ ] what to do so i got paralyzed so then i went to steve jobs mode [ __ ] feedback people don't know what they want why would i ask them what they want they don't they don't even know what they want for breakfast how can they tell me what they want out of this out of this app they've never heard of how could they tell me how to be a better boss blah blah people don't know what they want and i became mr steve jobs in the turtleneck then i sort of realize well that's not good either right because now i've isolated myself from actually getting feedback so i have no signal to go off of and so now i've come up with a better balance i think between the two which is i seek out feedback from people who i think are going to give me relevant feedback so i don't just ask everybody and then the last piece is the feedback is not the answer it's the question so when i hear feedback i'm not looking for the answer to what we should do more of what we should do less of how i can be better how i can be worse i'm just looking for the feedback to just surface a couple of questions so for example if they uh if the feedback said you know longer podcast some people say oh i want longer pockets some people said i want shorter podcasts it's just a question that comes up which is what do i think is the right length of the podcast what podcasts are great when they're long what podcasts are great when they're short you know what would be the what would be a great short version of our podcast so i use the feedback to ask myself a better question and then it's my job to come to the answer it's their job to just give me their opinion which which gives me a question that that can ask and so same thing with what goes with products which is when i ask for feedback we both like this book called the mom test and the central principle is i only get to ask them about their problems they i don't get to ask them what solution they want um and so similarly when i go ask for feedback now i'm just looking for them to say things that's going to get me to ask a better question that will get me to to come up then it's my job to come up with the answer to that um that's the main principle when in doubt there's one final thing which is at the end of the day i gotta like trust myself and i got to know that ultimately if i just do the thing i think is right over and over and over again i will happen to i might some people might not like it but i will ultimately attract the people who love what i do so that comes back to that saying my trainer gave me which is who are my customers the people that love what i do and it became that simple for me so that that's when i that's what i fall back to so it's like if it was like an if-else statement it's like if the if their feedback gives me a clear question and an answer that i know what to do with great i'll make an adjustment but if not then i'm just going to do what i do and i know that that will attract the type person who loves what i do i think that i i think you can i always call it like excel sheet your way to creating a big business so i think that like you could just say like where's the opportunity based off of like traffic demand and uh i just hired these people and you could create wealth that way so i i and i and i don't like when people say you have to be passionate you don't really have to you can just excel your weight to this but what i've learned throughout the years is like it's a lot more fun just to do things that you think is are cool and typically i can that's more the feedback that i'll listen to is just like do i think this is cool and the second thing when i get feedback is i don't actually care like you said what they're saying uh i i care more about why they're saying it and so for example when people say make the podcast shorter they're not saying make it shorter they're saying it's not always that interesting and exactly and and so the ques because if something's you know really long it doesn't matter as long as it's badass or if i did a made a three hour movie about sean you're sean's gonna watch it and so it's really not about listening to the actual feedback but why do i think they're saying it so that's what i listen to all right this one you guys get to talk about some other people um this one is am i surrounding myself with the right people who are the five i want to spend time with whoo powerful question that is a powerful question so let's just we'll make it i think it's a heavy question so let's make it light so tell me right now who are the five if you just said i spend my time the most with these five people who are the five people you currently just spend the most time with wife sarah uh neville medora my best friend and lives next next door to me uh ramon who you a lot of people know ramon van meer and then um jack smith that's four you got one more i wouldn't put anyone else in those categories no that's it your dog well you know i i like you guys kind of like that's pretty in depth but i would say that that's no i would edit there and all right so then let's let's let's just add one more who's somebody you wish was in that five that is that you're not spending as much time as as you like in an ideal world you would be uh steph smith i would add steph smith though yeah nice i think smith is is amazing just like what i was like just like our podcast listeners they also want more every time i talk to her i like damn she's brilliant she's a very special person uh so maybe her uh anyone else like uh i sometimes i do wish like i had like some baller baller baller friends a lot of my friends are like pretty great but like [ __ ] hanging out with like a russian oligarch just to see how like some of these crazy people think who are like extreme i would like i like extreme people so even though i may think they're a bad person i would like to hang out with some of these extreme people who are just on extreme ends of success or it could even be an athlete like what's it like to hang out with like the person who holds the world record in the marathon so it would be nice to to be around more extreme people that's a good that's a really good actually twist to this which is i think a lot of people have heard this idea of you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with and that's true but there's two other groups of people that i think really matter one is like the equivalent of a bender it's like you don't want to go on a bender every day or every weekend but like twice a year a bender is a lot of fun and if you don't do a bender twice a year if you're not really having one amazing party or you know just an all-nighter or some kind of experience that's like a little out there you kind of are leaving a little bit of life on the table and um and so there's some people that are amazing in that capacity that you just you would never want in your uh your everyday but they're amazing twice a year uh do i see your hangs with uh and i think there's some people that are like that the other one is who have you just not even encountered yet like who is just outside of your bubble that it's like you don't even know what you don't know yet because you just don't hang out with anybody like that and so you you have zero exposure and therefore you know it's just like it's not part of your world view it's not part of your mental model yet so i think that's yours two categories who are on the five or the those two two categories do the five and then the other all right so my five would be sonia my wife and my kids i'll just put it all together um my mom is the next one uh so i spend my mom comes over one week out of every month she stays with us um uh ben who's kind of like my my right hand man my my business partner across milk road across in the fund he helps with the podcast he does a bunch of things so i talked to ben hours a day um andre who i don't think you've met andre right no no andre is like kind of like the new ben he's like the next ben um so he's a new guy in the fold on that level and andre is kind of amazing because andre's got this story um that he had some illness that he had something he caught some bug he got us some infection that like he gave him like kind of like chronic fatigue syndrome or something like that like he basically like couldn't get out of bed for like i don't know like two years or something like that like he was in a wheelchair and nobody nobody knew what it was and it was just like and then he kind of like recovered from it but it was like this multi-year thing and so this [ __ ] is the most like grateful person you'll ever meet because he's like dude i walked today and i'm like you know like it doesn't take much for andre to be like high on life and because andre's around me all the time i'm s i get that secondary high you know the contact high right off of andre and like you know because he he kind of like was just battling and got out of it and so now he's like every day he like you could tell he's just savoring every day like as if you you haven't eaten in like two weeks and you're having your first meal that's how andre's like and so i love that about andre who and who are the other two uh the other one is suli uh who's our mutual buddy um and i don't hang out with him that much because he moved but he's a partner in one of my businesses and so i talked to him you know because that but the one downside is now that he's like an official business partner we don't really just like talk to shoot the [ __ ] anymore it's like we kind of anytime i'm talking to him i'm sort of talking to him always as he's as if he's my investor or business partner instead of just catching up you know so i guess that's probably the downside and then so those are the those are the five that i'm currently hanging out with the most i would put you next as we hang out you know two three hours a week doing this so that's more than most people and then the one i wish i hung out with more was ramon because ramon is like the best human on earth so you know the more ramon in my life the better human i would be just you know by default i completely agree when he teaches me a lot he uh he's a very thoughtful person i learned a lot from him and then the the category that i was saying that people i have no exposure to is like i basically have no exposure anymore to people that are in high school in college which is like actually pretty important as an investor and like you know person of the world to know like what it's like oh i forgot i used to think about these stupid things and they were the most important things in my life or like oh wow you know we didn't have phones so we couldn't do these things you know that they're doing now in high school or college so i have like zero exposure to that um you know like people in third world countries like you know when i went down to mexico i was like oh wow like i kind of forgot like just how simple and like different life is for most people on earth and like you know i used to live in indonesia in china and stuff like that so like i definitely was in it every day but now you know i'm just sitting in the burbs in california so it's easy to forget that so i think i have a lot like my bubble is pretty tight right now i think i should pop that intentionally once a while do you want to do one more question ben yeah we're doing five questions five questions seems like a nice uh round number and you bet you can remix it because some of these are sort of the same so you could just ask a different question you're a good question ask her in general i've been thinking about uh one of these so let's go with this one in what ways am i in my own way ugh i can say that one easy i lose my temper and follow my i get very emotional where i'm like no [ __ ] this this is wrong we have to do it this way uh and i have lost a lot of money for doing that for like uh uh let's just say like it's an employee who i think like has uh maybe underperformed uh even though they talk like they're hot [ __ ] i would just fire them as opposed like well we could definitely salvage this like there's lots of ways to salvage things and make things better it's just a net positive but more often than not be like well no i just i'm out i don't want to deal with the headache i'm over it or and that is a very emotional decision i make so many emotional decisions oftentimes it's sometimes it's ego oftentimes it's temper or but mostly if it's like oh i think this person is trying to get one over them on me like [ __ ] them i want to crush them no i'm not doing you know what i mean yes i make a ton of emotional decisions as opposed to practical decisions that's interesting uh all right i got two i have one that's real but but is that true have you seen that with me yeah for sure you've been mad at me sometimes and i'm like because you think i'm trying to like get one over on you and i'm like dude i'm really not and then once you realize i'm not like your whole perspective changed right away and i was like oh that's what you thought like oh i had no idea because i wouldn't like it's so different than the way i think so i i didn't i just never i couldn't understand it basically it's not like we can give a real example i got mad at you for being late and i'm like in my head i'm like he doesn't care he doesn't care about this he thinks he's better and it was reality was like no dude my baby was sick or like you know i like she was in the bath and it took forever to get her out uh and that's like a legitimately good excuse like even a bad excuse which was just like dude i just i literally like i was sitting here i just lost track of time i'm not doing anything i'm not more important i'm not like a diva i'm not uh trying to do that like i feel horrible every time i do like i sometimes i literally don't even have a good excuse uh but but even that was fine with you it was just like as long as you know i was sort of like actively doing it it didn't bother you you know what i mean or another thing that i do all the time and i think everyone should learn from me and i'm working hard at it and i made this mistake is resp replying really quickly to text based messages so whether that's an email uh anything where it's like dude it's okay if you sit on this for an hour or even a day or even five days sometimes i'll get [ __ ] like a text or an email and i'm like oh no fva and i quickly reply and i'm like oh i should have just sat on that for like three hours what was i thinking yeah i'm that's actually a great one that's a great answer for me too i'm massively disorganized um which affects everything so it's like replying like there are so many emails and text messages that like people are either like offering me something they're trying to help me and i'm just not replying and people take it very personally um as you know maybe i would too if i felt like i was getting blown off by this person or i'll just miss a deal that like it's just like a clear win for me because i just don't reply i don't see it i would say [ __ ] them you know i actually don't think you should i i've been struggling with that too i had and lately i'm just like i'm just not going to feel bad about replying to these people like and it's the most wait listen here's the most douchiest thing i could say but just subtract this by like a lot and that's the reality imagine you're justin timberlake and people like are always presenting you with stuff you're just like dude i don't care i'm gonna do what i want to do of course we are not that big a deal but like a much much smaller version where there's like lots of opportunities and i'm just like i'm just gonna adore all them i don't expect jt to reply to a dm do i yeah that's true but uh i'm talking about like people who i'm doing business with her but they're my friends or something like that like those are people i do intend to be replying to or i've asked them for something then they give it to me and i forget to do something with it but don't you say jokes what do you think laziness there like imagine my children imagine you're joe rogers how much is that i don't want to share the check on on screen but this is a 13 000 check that's just been sitting here for like six months and then it expired and so now i just had to go like get a new check and then i got this is the new check after the other one expired and i still haven't deposited this one another month has gone by like that's how shitty i am and it's just sitting here because i'm just disoriented for no reason or same thing with like my company's book so here's the bad way it plays out which is i don't like i've never hired a bookkeeper and so i'm like oh yeah like i don't know like aren't the transactions just like on the credit card no they gotta ask you they're gonna end the year i'll just i'll just cram for my taxes final and just figure this out and so now i'm like learning oh how do people do this oh they hire bookkeepers and then they like okay gotcha so like there was just things that are just messy in my world that's me getting in my own way um you know it cost me a lot of money to to have messy books or not reply to certain certain emails um so i think that's me getting in my own way the other one was just staying up late which is again this is so boring cliche almost embarrassed to even say it on the podcast because how late do you stay up nobody gives a [ __ ] like on average i was staying up until two or three in the morning and then i'd wake up at nine and i just started like last week i was just like [ __ ] i'm just asleep early and it solved like five of my biggest problems it's like my diet cleaned up because i no longer late night snack or eat like junk which is all i would do right if i had dinner at seven and now it's one am and i'm hungry like guess what i'm not good yeah exactly it's like my sleep was shitty my work was shitty i was editing the milk road at night now i just i sleep at like 10 30 or 11. i wake up at 6 30 or 7 in the morning i write the real road and it's our head at the milk road and it's done but and like by the time the kids wake up like i've already like finished my work day almost and so i just cleaned that up and it cleaned up like five other things but again so [ __ ] cliche to say sleeping early that i just bleep this whole thing out make it mysterious instead do you remember uh how regimented rob dyrdek was about tracking his time and like waking up at 6 00 a.m or 5 a.m or whatever he did i actually like like i i if that's what makes him happy do it and i also respect how crazy he's about that i think i like extreme people part of me was like oh but that's like you don't need to do that but then the other part is like that would be kind of cool to do for like two or three weeks just to see what would happen just what would happen if you do get up at 6 00 a.m and you are like you have a very strict schedule i i actually do think that that sounds kind of fun to try it once in a while what time do you sleep and wake up typically last night i couldn't go to bed i went to bed at one or two and i got out of bed at seven i you normally always get out of bed at seven are you like super regimented with your schedule i'm not productive though usually i'm not productive until about nine or ten my uh yeah so my baby wakes up at six in the morning usually so that's when i'm up and um i try and go to bed around like 10 10 30 and then once or twice a month i'll go to bed at like 3am because i need to get something done that's why you go to bed at 3am you're not like going on doing [ __ ] wait do you do drink do you drink or do drugs no well it's usually like i god this is the lamest trio ever when i when i do how to take over the world episodes i usually do a bunch of it in one sitting that i'll do from like 9 00 p.m to like three or four a.m i'll do that twice a month sean do you so let me recap these five parts i drink if like the occasion calls for it but not with any regularity no but do you get drunk i i used to but no like last five years i have not been getting drunk and did you do any drugs no god that's crazy what a bunch of fruits dude i just drink green smoothies bro i don't even drink coffee we are so lame all right go ahead all right i'm gonna recap the five questions so the five questions were in what areas of my life am i settling right now the next one was um am i surrounded oh no that's not it oh yeah choose your battles wisely what battles am i choosing right now and what what do i want to choose so what areas of my life am i settling choose your battles wisely what battles do you want to choose number three what am i letting in that i need to shut out that's noise and information and opinions from the outside world and then am i surrounding myself with the right people who are the five people i want to spend the most time with and what was the fifth one did we do five yeah question five was in what ways am i in my own way oh yeah in what way is am i in my way what are the things you're doing that gets in your own way um those are the five ben which one of those questions when we set them did you go off on a tangent think it for yourself what your answer is which one shook you one of these questions um i i the first question shook me in what areas of my life am i settling that okay so okay you guys are looking at me i i thought maybe i'd get away with not actually giving you the answer because like that's like that's one that penetrates your soul but you both were just like you're gonna answer right now and like for you both of you talked about like health and fitness stuff and one area in which i settle a lot in my life is like i get super concerned about environmental pollutants especially like plastics and microplastics and like stuff like that and i always feel like a psychopath when i talk about it because everyone else is like oh what what like plastics and i feel crazy because i'm like no actually like this isn't a conspiracy theory like the research is out there that like all these microplastics are like crashing our testosterone levels and like disrupting our endocrine systems and stuff like i'm not crazy but the fact that everyone else is like yeah whatever makes me feel even crazier and so a lot of times it's a weird obsession i just like settle i compromise and i'm like look at my baby like putting this plastic toy in her mouth and like a part of me dies and i'm just like ugh whatever i i settle i'm not going to fight this fight right now but it is something that you have plastic tupperware we have plastic tupperware that i wish we would just like throw away so just do it dude that is not at all where i thought you were going with that answer when you first said it because you were like so it was like weighing so heavy on your heart and that's what it was it matters a lot to me sean most [ __ ] random answer are is is is rubber it's like a like what they call like a binky with a pacifier thing the pacifier what what is that rubber i don't even know what that is that plastic uh yeah so most of the time no they won't do plastic in pacifiers so they'll either do silicone uh which is better or they'll do rubber yeah which is also better and rubber okay right silicone i like have my doubts about um but it does not have like the same proven track record of disrupting your endocrine systems the way plastics do do you do use water bottles um no in fact i try not to use disposable water bottles because a lot of times they leach what do i go watch or read that's gonna scare the [ __ ] out of me there's a joe rogan episode that i'll link up in the show notes where he talks with she's a the harvard researcher who does a bunch of this stuff and she's really good uh and it will it will scare you a lot yeah dude plastic's pretty bad then like i you don't know that sean do you mind you microwave plastic don't you only on this podcast yeah i i microwave everything and i everything's in plastic in my house so i'm like oh [ __ ] okay um so i've heard this but i've like never i never got shook yet where i'm like oh take action in this um but that's why i ask what do i need to go watch that's gonna like trigger me where i'm gonna need to i need to be like i i will go and you know make it like dramatic change i'll link it up but like the short of it is basically like our testosterone levels are decreasing at one percent per year fertility levels are just like crashing and it's not just people who want to have children less like people who are trying to have children are able to have them at much lower rates than in the past to the point where it's like and our plastic use is increasing so much that they're like in 50 years we're not sure that anyone is going to be able to have uh unassisted uh children anymore but how do they know plastics cause that right you know versus just because they do studies of with rats and uh they're able to demonstrate it the the correlation good answer that was a very good answer and um what do you what's what's an example of something you swap out that's like a big culprit for plastic like most people are doing this but if you swap this that solves like you know twenty percent right well so the biggest thing that she said was never heat plastic that is like if you can do one thing it's never heat up plastic so like if you have a water bottle uh with water in it like yes that will leach some plastic into your system it's not great but if you leave it out in the sun that heats up to 100 degrees you're gonna get like 10 times as much plastic so it's it's not eating things hot from plastic but how do you reconcile that fact with the fact that you smoke you told me that you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day [Laughter] uh yeah noted chainsmoker uh ben wilson that's what people know me for how do you do both well and how do you how can you have how do you have 24 newports a day do you tell me not to microwave plastic you know it's just one of those mysteries sam i don't know how to explain it and how do you um can you test to see how much i don't know that's a good question i would love to do it if you can i don't know that you can i got a new business that we're gonna talk about on monday that's gonna address that by the way i was all prepared for it today really did you say i don't wanna what is it it's called float uh did you see it in the dock it's called float dot is what is it what's the url is it called float bend where's my [ __ ] reap it's called um no it's called fount uh font found sorry fount dot bio fount it's basically a five thousand dollar a month concierge service where they test your blood and tell you all about your body it's very expensive but sounds incredibly cool for five thousand dollars a month you better be touching my body well we'll see maybe maybe it'll make women to actually want to touch your body maybe that's maybe maybe we'll do one better we're getting tested over here five grand a month why five grand a month that's such an absurd number you're doing this no i'm not doing it but i think it's close to beta uh five grand a month would i do it i would sign up for three months for sure i think you could do it in three months in increments i for fifteen thousand dollars yeah i would try that dude i had a concierge doctor one time for like a year when i was really sick and it was 25 grand for a year and it was mostly amazing also i understand why rich people and how rich people can get access to so many drugs because like if i wanted to i could just like text the doctor and be like hey can you refill this uh this xanax for me or like hey i need some more oxy like is like and you're paying them so much money that it seems like they're willing to do that it is kind of crazy this took a turn hey all right can i do we have to we're way over time do i have time to ask you guys one more question as long as it's five minutes okay i think it can be five minutes or less i'm just curious about this i don't know why this i thought of this as we were asking the five questions but if you were to like simulate your life a thousand what do you think the ceiling is and what do you think the floor is in other words like are there a few little things if they broke in the wrong way like sam parr is working at a mcdonald's in missouri right now or like a few breaks where if things had broken the wrong way you would uh be like a worth a hundred billion dollars one of the richest men in the world like what do you think your floor is what do you think your ceiling is and do you think you ended up about what your average is i think in my case i could tell you i think it's my favorite is that the ground rules the ground rules are same genetics and same like family not like i'm born in a different country like yeah it's just like a few little random variables get changed you make a few different decisions as you go through life but same family same situation same person i think i was not far from being like homeless alcoholic drug addict like i think that was actually potentially in the cards or just like in jail because i would con people and steal i think a lot of people honestly could say that though like if they like if they like gotta if you ever like do certain drugs like oh man like the it's actually i could see myself uh living on the streets uh the best of like the limit um uh i think like a really attainable thing is i could have not sold my company and i think it could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars and i could have been worth many hundreds of millions of dollars by the time i was 50. i think that could have done that i think i could have pulled that off if i was willing to put it in put the work in yeah but you'll probably end up there now anyways you're 30 now that's 20 more years yeah given where you're at now it's pretty likely that you end up over 100 million dollars it's very likely that i'll be working 20 more years it's almost guaranteed it'll be worth nine years i mean it's almost certain yeah so then [ __ ] it i don't know exactly so you peeked you got one of the good good rolls of the dice um i don't think i mean obviously there's some scenarios where yeah i end up you know in jail drug addict whatever but i don't think that's like the realistic floor for me i think the realistic floor for me is was probably like um working on twitch forever you know no not even like you know working at uh working as a lab assistant at [ __ ] you know uh you know greenville universities like biology department or some [ __ ] like that like you know basically some some job that was like i got on some track that didn't really have a merit-based system it was a time-based system um so like you know you basically just get rewarded for how long you've been in the game and not like how much impact you've been able to make and um and it might have been in a very kind of like complete i was very close to a complete non-business field right i was like about to go to med school so you know i was very likely going to be in a different thing but like even if i hadn't done the med school path you know just being a engineer somewhere or being a you know project manager somewhere was extremely likely for me um had i just made one or two different decisions kind of at some point the more interesting question is like how far off the peak am i and i think i'm pretty far off the peak to be honest with you and in fact you know uh ben you were there when we had uh david friedberg on the on the podcast and i told him sam i was trying to butter him up i was like dude so you've created not one not two but pretty much three billion dollar companies um if you know he created climate which is a billion dollar company he created metro mile which is basically a billion dollar company and he created the production board's a billion dollar company and i said you've done that and you know if i went back to you at age kind of 18 19 20 you were in college and i told you hey man this is how it all shakes out you're gonna create three billion dollar company three separate billion dollar companies uh in like the in this like kind of space science space uh what would you have said would that have been unbelievable to you would you could you have believed that because honestly i'd probably have been disappointed and i was like what why because i think two things like one is he wasn't really like money wasn't the like the driving force and then the second piece is like i don't think he feels like he's had a big impact on the world yet um like okay metro mile exists and okay climate exists but like you know what he's trying to do now with like canada and other stuff like that is like he's like trying to find it like be like the way we produce food is gonna change or like the way we produce pharmaceuticals in a change like that's about now the like the type of swing he goes for which is like the world used to produce things in factories and farming and blah blah and now we do it in a laboratory blah blah blah like that he's trying to fundamentally change the means of production and so i think that's what he meant but um i was kind of blown away by that answer and that's the type of thing when i remember i said like you hang out with that x factor person who like just sort of like stuns you into a different like what i said when do i realize i'm settling is when a guy who's created three billion dollar company says i probably would have been disappointed if i knew this was the this was the outcome um it makes me think wait what is this guy even going what is this guy scoreboard if he doesn't think this is a win and then what does that make me think about my scoreboard how could i update my scoreboard not to match his but to like let's let's definitely question it right like let's see keep it the same as it's been for 10 years is he a billionaire now he's personally a billionaire probably like 500 in that ballpark i i think he said on the podcast that he that he hasn't hit a billion so i think close but i don't think he's hit it yeah isn't that funny how you can achieve just what most every single person on earth would consider like the top of the top at the top of the top and you're like yeah that's funny once i googled my uh my mentor and kind of business my investors net worth and i remember being like and then i googled a whole bunch of celebrities like so i think i think at that time like his his kind of like my ballpark approximate like my triangulated net worth for them was like 700 800 million and then i googled like britney spears and it was like 25 or 50. and then i was like wait brit i was like he's like more than 10 times richer than britney spears i was like okay alex rodriguez i remember when he signed the biggest mlb contract ever was a 10-year 225 million contract or 250 million contract at that time and i remember being like oh my god he's getting three he already has three times a rock's contract and it's just like i just googled every celebrity i could think of like more than all of them did you know that you're richer than ryan sheckler i think i literally said that i was like you're 15 000 germaine dupri's dude he's probably even richer than denzel washington this guy's amazing that's what i'm saying oh easily watch you know denzel networth dude i bet you denzel's gotta be worth like uh a hundred at least been in the game for a while piss poor 280. he's a double denzel you know like come on man that's awesome all right i'm out [Music] you

why does everyone hate on getting rich quick get rich quick schemes are the best i want to get rich quick i don't want to get rich slow [Music] it's actually colder here than the arctic circle why do you live there well i mostly live in miami irs if you're listening to this but i'm sometimes in a mountain town in the middle of nowhere uh sam i saw you posted today that you've got about 20 acres in texas but i'm staring out at 95 acres of arctic winter winterland right now is that cool or no i mean i love i love it out here i'm from i'm from here so for me it's it's uh it's slow living it's nice um yeah i love it is that why you look like a pilot right now in the cockpit or what's going on here [Laughter] i mean sahil makes sao blue my co-host on my on on the weird happens pod we we do it together and he always makes fun of this but i'm a gamer so i'm not afraid i'm not afraid to admit it be who you are man be who you are uh greg so you're here because i don't even know why you were talking we weren't even i don't even know what we were saying we were talking about the will smith thing you had some hot takes sam had some hot takes how can we start with anything else but the [ __ ] slap of the century will smith [ __ ] slaps chris rock for making fun of his wife we i think we have a different opinion on each one of these things sam give me your first where were you when it happened how did you hear about it what was your first take i was laying in bed and i hear sarah goes oh my gosh you've got to come down and watch this this is crazy and i saw it and here's the thing by the way do you just go or do you wait you ask what is it no i go right away i can just go all right that's the good guy right there so here's the thing listen i tweeted about this right away people were like well what would you do the truth is maybe the same thing i maybe would do the same thing but that's wrong and if i would have ran up there it bitch-slapped chris rock i would have been tackled and taken away and he should too that's what should have happened i wanted to see him tackled and taken away or at least not allowed to be on stage for five minutes to accept an award that is ridiculous to me i could not believe that happened greg give me your where were you what was your initial reaction so my girlfriend texts me and she's like you're not gonna believe what just happened will smith just slapped chris rock and then she's like wait i don't know if it was a slap maybe it was a punch and so there was this confusion there was this like five minute confusion where people didn't know what it was so first place i go to uh is on twitter i'm on twitter and i i i looked at the video and i was like i couldn't believe it was happening right it was like you remember when um janet jackson with the whole super bowl thing yeah like i feel like i remember what where i was with 9 11. i remember what happens when the janet jackson boob incident of the super bowl it's unlike oj and then smith yeah now will smith so i wasn't happy with the videos that were coming out but i found the japanese and australian videos did you guys see those for sure the uncensored uncut versions yeah yeah and and that one where uh you got a better view of the punch you know i needed a better view it was it was a slap though i don't know how good your view was it was a slap it was yeah okay it was a slap but what bugged me about the whole thing and i'm glad you invited me to talk about will smith because you know that's why i'm here is i think that okay obviously it was a douchey thing of will smith to do but i was unimpressed with how chris rock wasn't able to make a joke of the whole thing and he could have made comedic history and he didn't and i expected more from him wow disappointed with chris rock that is not the take i thought was gonna come that's why we bring greg on for the the when everybody zigs you zag with the new take disappointment dude chris rock crazy impressive he took it man he took it he didn't tear up he didn't like when you get punched in the face sometimes you're not like crying but your eyes water none of that happened he kept smiling and he was a pro man sam you know what happens if you get hit in the side of the head what's the first thing that you feel right here you your ears hurt and you want to like grab your face yeah you you hear this ringing buzz and like the sound you hear this just giant ringing and then you've got to touch your face he didn't touch his face that you got to give him respect for the chin that he shared yeah the round was that was a 10-9 chris rock round but then greg's right actually he had i mean the world was his oyster with all the potential jokes that he could have gone with the one-liners like i can't believe i can't believe they had you and ali or something like that exactly you know i don't even know what the joke should have been you know greg what direction would you have gone with the joke uh i would have said and the winner to the biggest uh [ __ ] slap award 2022 goes to william smith yeah exactly could have given him the oscar for [ __ ] of the year wait but honestly what was your take though okay so i'm i'm outside of a cold stone just gave my daughter some ice cream we're trying to get back to the car i don't know if you know how it is getting kids in the car is like that's the battle every day that's that's the battle in fact there's a great louis ck joke where he's like the greatest moment of any father's day is the like 30 seconds from when you close the door and you have them in the car seat and you walk around the car back to the driver's car seat it's like the 30 seconds of peace that you have in that moment that's everything so i'm trying to get in the car and my wife is stopped she's stunned she's doing the like oh my god face looking at her phone almost to it was like a cartoon character and i was like what it can't like whatever it is it can't be can't be much and then she was like no will smith just punched chris rock i was like what and so then i watched the video she made me pull over we were driving i pulled over to watch the japanese uncensored version because we just had to like debrief it in the moment and um i was team will smith i thought it was awesome frankly the only part that i thought was not cool the only part i thought was not cool was that when they first said the joke he's laughing at the joke so bro you can't laugh at the joke admit that it's funny and then basically two seconds later build up this rage and then pretend it was so uh not cool when it was you were laughing like we caught you on camera laughing wait two seconds before that you don't think that he should have any consequences no no i didn't say that he should have come sure okay sure lock him up throw away the key whatever you got to do no no jail time i don't even think i'm not i don't even want i don't want handcuffs i don't want jail just like a hey will you can't hit someone you gotta leave like that would have been that would have been sufficient well the thing they showed uh in the uh i don't know the taiwanese cut they had the commercial break i don't know if you guys saw this somebody comes running up to him i think oh wow they're gonna be like dude what the [ __ ] we need to get you out of here sorry it's his publicist just immediately giving him notes on how to play this and so when he goes up for his speech what do you know the first line he says is you know richard williams was a fierce like protector of his family that's the publicist handing him the feeding of the line of how how are you going to spin this to your advantage who hates a guy who protects his family i think it worked i watch his speech i think he's losing it so in a way i feel sorry for him i i definitely feel a little sorry he looked a little off right he looked a little off he looked like he's kind of he's getting a little a little something's going on and i hope he could i hope he works through it and gets back and also there dude him and his wife man that's some weird stuff like what's going on like hey did you see that thing called red table that her show where she just like did a whole show with him on there talking about how she cheated on him and everything like that and then she went i don't know but i watch everything that's trashy like that so yeah i saw it i saw it twice man so like that's weird to me a little bit so uh there's like a butt this dynamic is was weird he's got a lot of pressure on him i think he just kind of snapped i think he's working through some stuff but dude but so i feel like everybody everybody knows a couple that's like this where they're like kind of toxic they're like toxically in love with each other it's like they got some weird bunny and clyde [ __ ] where they're like they kind of like they like make the wrong decisions sometimes they even like you know hurt each other's feelings but then they're like if anybody else ever tries to encroach they like will murder for them and it's like bro where's the balance here it's like us against the world they love this like us these us against the world couples and they're definitely one of them yeah it was messed up do you want to talk about uh alex hermozy her mozzie mosey yeah what did you do you were like bro i'm going deep on alex from aussie i was like we are so would have been nice to do before we had him on the pod you do it like 10 episodes later i had a call with him today greg do you know who this guy is i don't know who's that all right actually i feel bad i consider him a friend but i don't i don't know if it's pronounced mosey or mozzie alex hermosie is it no mozzie alex it's one of those things where it's like two like you've known him for a decade yeah and it's like you can't ask him now you no you got to be like i just call him moz i just go by maz because dude one of my best friend's name is sieve i don't even know how to pronounce his last name um so and i've been best friends with him for 10 years he's in my wedding um so anyway this guy alex so basically he had this company called gym launch and it was really interesting because some people and i wouldn't call myself totally on that side but i understand it is it appeared a little scammy but actually i don't think it's scammy at all anymore he ended up waiting sam you've got to describe the guys look first so he's got he looks like a straight version of the construction worker in the village in the village was it the village people i mean he looks like a construction worker so he wears flannel he's got this beautiful thick mustache long awesome hair like a like a persian samson and he is just yoked he's jacked he's huge and he's like good looking and he just he's like looks like arnold schwarzenegger a little bit and he created this business called gym launch and basically you would pay either four thousand dollars for one thing or twenty thousand dollars for another thing and it was for people who owned small gyms whether that's a crossfit gym or a personal training gym and he would basically teach you how to make your gym better because he owned gyms and he would promise you something like uh you'll gain at least 75 000 in new revenue but for a lot of people he averaged that they would improve by 200 000 in revenue but the business model that he had was crazy and the results were even crazier so the business was by the time the business was four years old he bootstrapped it and had paid himself 45 million dollars in dividends and then on the fifth year i believe he sold it and he netted something like 50 or 60 million dollars and so he was like yeah i paid myself 45 million so i had about 25 million just in cash in the bank then we sold and i netted like another 50. and that story alone is crazy is that right sean i don't know if those exact numbers are right it sounds like you talk to him so let's go with that i i don't really know but but yeah but you you got the the product right the the the kind of the hook or what's interesting is most gym memberships are like you know pay 20 a month and you get into a membership and like it's hard to sell people that and what he was ended up doing was he was like all right well people don't want a membership what do they really want they want to lose weight they want to lose weight in six weeks or less they want to lose weight so they look good on the beach all right so i'm gonna basically sell you a program that's going to make you look good on the beach in six weeks and he like he he got good at selling for his own gym where he's like oh i can get people to pay like three grand up front for like a fitness training package with nutrition meal plans and stuff like that and then someone pointed out to him i think like russell brunson or whatever the clickfunnels guy pointed out to him like hey dude instead of just opening gyms and doing this yourself you should just teach other gym owners how to do this like that's a better product is helping a gym like add 100 grand in revenue in 30 days is a better product than like trying to open your own gym and use that method so then he started doing that and then that's kind of how he went now we own something called acquisitions.com where he'll like buy your business if you're doing i don't know five million or more revenue something well so he's buying course businesses and like applying his methodology and so but basically what he sold was and this is where things got i went deep on i was like how did this work this is crazy so he basically sold not a franchise but like an operating system and so he used hubspot as his back end and he would get people to sign up to these ads that he was running and you do an on-boarding and you pay 20 grand you get four months then after the end of four months you can decide to stay in part of the group and it's 45 grand a year but you get this after you sign up uh you get this checklist of things that you have to do so it's like raise your price to this sign up for this software use these emails this shrimp campaign get them get this many people to sign up by doing x y and z here's the ad campaign that you can just copy and paste in order to use and then he had a facebook group where all the members could talk and that was it that was the business it was super simple and it was doing tens of millions a year in revenue and also tens of millions in profit and i thought this was crazy fascinating and i wanted to ask you guys what other he told me a little bit but what other niches would you use this for and also does this model even interest you it seems pretty amazing to me i've never heard of it i think that if you did this for agencies like digital agencies that this is a no-brainer so you know we're i run an agency called late checkout we're about 50 people uh so we're starting to really hit some scale and you say your revenue uh i mean i don't want to say my revenue but we have 50 people so you can do some of the math yourself um [Music] i will say that um yeah we work with some of the biggest brands in the world and it's very lonely to be like this ceo of an agency like i don't know if i'm over charging or under charging i don't know if i'm you know you know doing the right thing should i be doing more marketing less marketing so like would i pay two five ten grand a month to for like something like this like probably if the roi is there yeah it's basically a sales machine right so what each what he said was if you have a business and you have whatever number of customers you have if i could get you more customers that's clearly of value to you and i think he basically tried to get like capture 10 to 20 of the value that he was giving so you know if if i'm gonna if i'm gonna generate a hundred thousand dollars in new incremental sales for you how do i capture 10 to 20 000 and i and i'm taking the risk if i don't do that then i don't earn anything i think that's kind of how he started it at least and so agency is a perfect one like that because every client you sign is cash in the bank and uh typically the agency might be good at one thing but not necessarily good at going getting new clients so what uh you just read this guy's book sean alex's book i'm reading right now what do you think about it the book is good uh the book is good it's basically a it's like a marketing book right so it's a it's essentially a marketing book he does a good job of breaking things down being simple it's not all together new information but um but who gives a [ __ ] it's like it's good information presented well and if you're running a business right now it'll help you now the thing i think that he over indexes on is like he uses like the gym launch example really hard so it's like yeah this this is clearly he talks about basically he says you the secret to sales is make somebody an offer so good they'd be stupid to refuse you okay how do you do that it's like how do you get them to perceive that there's a lot of value and that they're going to get in a short amount of time with a with a with not a lot of cost and that it's highly likely to happen and so his model was like hey gym owner i on i work with 100 gyms on average i can bring them each 100 000 in new sales i can do that for you in 30 days and if i don't do it if i don't hit that mark i don't get paid how's that and so yeah that is what he calls a grand slam offer because it's gonna work and if if you have a grand slam offer you can win a lot of business you can grow very fast but i don't think that works in a whole bunch of other product categories so i think it works in the like agency consulting world which is where he was it's services i think it works services all services you know if i'm selling shoes online it's very hard to create a grand slam offer for selling shoes because uh you know i can't tell you how much more money this is going to make you right so already the offer is a lot less i'm telling you it looks cool you know that people might like your shoes that's just fundamentally less compelling so i just think it's like really really good for a service business um especially a service business that's in the business of helping other people make money but uh like if like for example i wanted to send it to my accountant and be like hey you're charging me like five grand or six grand a year you should really be charging 50 grand and if you did this method i think you would have you know like 10 times more clients and make 10 times more money off them if you presented your stuff this way because you're an accountant you're saving people money on taxes and you could basically offer a no-brainer offer like this and take more value and grow your business faster if you did it this way but um it doesn't work for everything it's kind of the takeaway i think i think the the pitch is is taking a consultancy from a consultancy and turning it into selling luxury like that's the opportunity for a lot of these people right like i think uh when you look at mckinsey mckinsey isn't a consultancy to me mckinsey is selling like a luxury multi-million dollar contracts like that you're buying confidence when you're buying uh right a luxury product yeah that's exactly right he talks about that uh pretty extensively in the book but i gotta say so i i am reading this book and i have two kind of like my two like my right hand man and my left hand man i have i've been and then i have this guy andre and i told him i was like guys is this good stuff in this book that we should be using uh and so i created like a little mini book club inside of our company to do this have you guys ever done that like have you basically and i've been wanting to do this with podcasts as well sometimes i'll listen to a podcast that's like [ __ ] amazing and i what i want to do is just stop listening to it myself and be like hey guys we're gonna do a meeting but the meeting is us listening to this podcast and every time they say something good i'm gonna pause and we're gonna talk about it and it might take us like six hours to get through this one hour podcast but i'm telling you it's gonna be we're gonna actually apply the thing versus just i share the link you read it i read it we each kind of move on with our day and we're busy have you guys ever done anything like this to like get more juice out of the fruit i haven't i haven't i've done a book club uh that i feel like book club is it's like you know a lot of people go in the gym it's like you start going to the gym and then you kind of like stop like it's really hard to create a really well-designed book club that keeps people engaged yeah we did book club it was the same thing no one [ __ ] finished the book so i actually think if we all just listen to a podcast together it might be a lot easier it's a lot easier it's like when you go to school and the teacher brings in the tv uh that's like how i would feel going to this meeting i'd be like oh hell yeah we're rolling in the t-bag magic school bus baby the um yeah at amazon they do this too where like uh people write all kinds of docs inside companies like memos plans whatever and then it's like hey did you read my plan and then you're like oh yeah either i kind of did or i didn't very rarely is it like i read it i remember it i took notes on it and i'm ready to take action from it and so at amazon they basically hacked that process which is the rule is you have to write if you're going to make a plan if you're going to try to do anything you have to write your memo but the memo gets read in the meeting itself so every meeting if it's an hour the first 10 to 20 minutes are silent reading everybody reads it together at the same time and there's zero expectation for you to ever read something beforehand or afterwards oh yeah it was it was huge uh like and also while you're reading your you know you're taking notes because you know right after this reading period ends in 20 minutes like it's a bit like school it's like i'm gonna have to have something to say right like i need to have i need to be bringing something to the table from this and so um yeah that was huge and i think i think way more companies should do that it was like one of the few big company things that i was like this is a process that is so much better than what i used to do at our startup yeah well i think that podcast idea that you just had is actually fantastic um cool all right we lost greg for a second but let's let's keep going um did you have anything more on hermize or you wanted it to go on no that's it what do you got i was thinking about doing like a kind of like a summary slash lessons learned because i have a whole bunch of like screenshots and highlights from the book i might do a separate pod that's just that if you want to do that um i just i just i just bought the book i've been watching a lot of his youtube videos there's just something about this person he's very interesting to me he's very interesting he's so transparent to the point where it's weird almost like it's like i i like he reveals so much i don't believe you uh no i believe him i believe him for sure but he's revealing so much that i'm like are you sure man you want to be talking about this this is crazy like you like it's just weird it's just weird right i mean he talks like i don't think it's weird i think it's smart and that's why i say like do i believe this it's not that i think he's lying about anything i think he's telling the truth it's that when somebody is that forthcoming it's sort of like well what's in this for you and i think clearly it's i'm trying to get you to trust me uh and so i'm going to be like kind of like explicitly transparent about something because i there's a there's a motive behind that and i think that's okay uh but i think a lot of people like wow thanks dude for the favor it's like there's no favors um people do things because they have a motive they want to build their brand in a certain way they want to attract more more readers or viewers or they're trying to build trust in a way so that they can get some advantage you know that's okay i think that's a it's a good thing i i do it too i do it all the time yeah um yeah i've gotten to know him over the past few weeks i'm a fan man i'm a fan of alex's but what do you got uh well actually we should so greg i i told you bring three or four bullets i don't know if you had time to do that but i have some if you don't have any but i'd like to use yours if you do because you're here you're the guest of honor yeah i mean i always have a notes file with some ideas i can tell you i'm not going to say they're great ideas but let's let's start with that and i love your feedback all right let's do it um so i went to a restaurant two nights ago saw that a bunch of kids were playing these like picture like an applebee's and picture a bunch of vending machines um like you know those games that you can play i'm thinking vending machines so you have to pay like 100 doge to get in you can win a board ape instead of winning you know collectibles you're winning digital assets is there a business to be created around that you're talking about the thing where you would like the old way is you you know you put your quarter in and there's a bunch of plastic balls you get one out you got this little shitty toy and it's like i think in japan they call these the gotcha games is that right like gotcha mechanic where you have this sort of variable reward you might win the good thing but you almost never win the good thing and then you kind of keep wanting to open up these boxes and see what you get exactly that but with doge and winning nft's inside greg do you own any nfts are you on board with us or no yeah i mean i've got hundreds of nfts that's crazy yeah i i think the problem is doge i think not enough people own doge um you know so i i kind of feel like it's like you need to apple pay to quickly like instantaneously buy doge and then use it use it in the game basically like you need some way for their phone to just buy the thing and then just keep swiping their phone yeah i guess like what i'm particularly interested in here is like what are you know in real life experiences that you can create that connect with crypto um yeah another version of this by the way because i don't need at restaurants anymore i just deliver everything so it's like um you know a qr code that comes with doordash that i just scan and i get to play the game on my phone right like why do they need to buy a screen when i carry a screen in my pocket so like really all you just need is a qr code to do this game you don't even have to build the you don't even have to build the vending machine necessarily it's true it's true um all right i got another one so i uh moved out of my apartment december 15th it's now march 28th and my landlord hasn't returned my security deposit is that in america or it's in florida yeah miami ooh there's a bunch of laws around that california well there's laws around it in in florida too and i googled it and there's a whole process you can go into it i'm sure it's probably not as intense as california but you know you have certain rights um there's a whole process that you have to go and eventually you go to small claims court et cetera et cetera how much was it uh it's a few hundred dollars but it's just like the pain to like go through it it's not really worth it my security deposit is fifty seven hundred dollars um so what i really wanna do is scare my my landlord basically right that's what i wanna do so i want him i need to get his attention that's what i really need to do um so i googled um you know sending a lawyer letter i didn't want to call my lawyer because i was like at 750 an hour or whatever it's gonna cost like two grand for this lawyer letter so the idea is a 99 lawyer letter on demand go scarif go scare someone basically what do you think have you um i love it so listen we got to talk about this shawn you know where where i'm going to go with this right do not pay you're going to petty court well i like penalties but i'm going to go do not pay great have you not heard of do not pay yeah so is do not pay that service that like if you have a parking ticket you like send it to them and they like they deal with it and you get a percentage of it back or something like that they do a bunch of stuff but that is one of the ways how they started how do you explain this company now sean now that it's kind of they have so many features yeah i think it's start it basically it's it's just trying to save you money from [ __ ] that you you shouldn't have to pay for you don't want to pay for so it started with like subscriptions you're not using all right cool unsubscribe me from a bunch of subscriptions i'm not using then it became yeah then they also added you know like go contest this parking ticket because like i don't know 20 or 30 of parking tickets are like filled out incorrectly and you actually shouldn't have to pay and if we save you money we will keep a little bit but it's just you do no work and you'll get they just keep a portion of the savings that they get that they earn for you and then they expanded into like 83b election like hey we'll do that for you for your startup so they're just like trying to do they're basically just trying to eliminate the busy paperwork that nobody wants to do and they're like we'll just take care of that [ __ ] for you how would that feel and a bunch of like people like us were like millennials were like i just don't know how to do it i don't want to do it i don't like printing things or going to the post office and like doing all this [ __ ] yeah please take care of this for me so it's a time saver company is how i think about it and greg i had a landlord i had a 16 000 deposit this was for our office uh when covet our office lease just so happened to end right around when kovid was happening so we got really lucky and we just cancelled it and this guy would not give me the 16 grand i found out dude i got crazy on him i found out where he lived did i showed up at his house and he wasn't there i found out where he worked and i showed up there and he wasn't there and i used do not pay to send him like a like a letter and finally he got back to me it was like oh yeah you know just slipped my mind like he was like no big deal about it and i was like dude i've been howding you for six weeks man where's this money and so they they have that feature where you just send a scary letter you send a scary letter and uh it worked and so uh we we i got my 16 grand but legally you're supposed to get 16 grand plus interest which i did not get and i uh i thought about like fighting over this just out of principle because i love petty [ __ ] so i feel like the idea is really you know do not pay obviously is getting really big it's like the unbundling of do not pay and it's taking this idea and it's like okay i'm gonna run a bunch of google ads against like getting security deposit back florida getting security deposit back california and i think there's a big business to be created here because then that's a that's a good wedge to sort of expand a bunch of different services and i think there's the other version i think we've once said which was like uh call my politician there's all these things where it's like ah this bill could get passed that's bad for crypto holders make sure you call your politician and let them know you don't want this it's like uh i don't know i don't want to call my politician and like who what if they pick up what am i going to say like there's like there's all kinds of problems with this idea of calling i don't like calling what happens if they pick up you know i really want to go down that road but i would happily you know sort of tip you know 10 bucks to just have someone annoy the [ __ ] out of my politician about this issue that i care about um like if my donation funded like 18 annoying calls like if there was just a website that said would you like to donate 10 to the cause and that will fund 18 annoying phone calls from sri lanka to this politician i'd be like [ __ ] yeah put me down for 20. and so i think that's the other version of do not do not pay is like go hassle for me that's awesome i'm on board with that can you what else you got greg my other one it relates to law actually a little bit so you know we've been and then sean i know you're into crypto um so i've been spending a lot of money on you know crypto accounting and crypto law firms um and i think that there's an opportunity to create a web three crypto accounting firm and a web three uh crypto uh law firm but all you have to do is basically you find an existing law firm that understands securities law and you're like hey you know you your shop of 10 lawyers and you're like you know you understand securities a law maybe there's some you know up leveling in terms of learning specifics about nfts etc i'm going to be the like marketing engine for you you know use things like the milk road and use things like lay check out and i'm going to send you leads so the customer is happy because they're like wow this is like a web 3 related you know law firm and i want to work with someone who's what does that mean i don't know what you're using you're using words that i don't have no idea what they mean what does a web 3 related law firm mean okay so let's just say you're creating an nft project but you want to make sure that you don't go to jail so let you don't do any sec violations do you feel comfortable calling up your regular lawyer who might not even know what an nft is or would you specifically want to talk to a law firm that lives and breathes web three it depends if they have um what's like for example if i what's the term if i follow something my lawyer says and they're supposed to be the expert and i get in trouble sometimes i can like blame them what's that called god i can't remember that i can't remember but scapegoating no it's like a it's like it's like when you hire a c it's like when you hire a c if you hire a cpa and your cpa screws you like blatantly sometimes you're not always you you can you know that goes you're taking to account like ah dude i thought he was doing it right he's a cpa so like your cpa can actually get in trouble not necessarily you so it depends if that lawyer has that but i don't know i'd rather just go to a legal for a lawyer that special yeah that specializes in this thing but i don't know why you'd call it a website he's describing it but he's had a web three the law firm yeah like they specialize and they they know the laws around they specialize in i think you meant like around this web three not a digital law firm yeah okay yeah all this is is like i mean this is a marketing challenge more than anything and you know one of the hardest problems about running a law firm is you know or an accounting firm is getting clients and we talked about this with the agencies the same thing is true with you know law firms and accountancy firms i think you know i don't know the like i don't know the margins of some of these businesses but i imagine they're quite big um so i think there's something there so i considered doing this with my before i did the milk road i was like all right what do i want to do like i got this audience that's growing right it's like twitter's twitter's pretty big now it's like i got a quarter million followers newsletter's growing i could just like you know make no money off this that's fine how big was your new ads in the newsletter that's what's that how big was the newsletter it was like at 30 40k or something at the time i could put something in there yeah before milk and uh and i was like i could teach a course so i did that i taught a course i was like all right that's cool it makes way more money than ads but it's more effort and then i was like you know what's like the highest value business what's like the best [ __ ] business and i was like so i started making a list of like places where i spend a lot of money that i feel like they're just kind of like rinse and repeating the same stuff for me um and so i i narrowed it down to two i'll give you the second best one was accounting um and i was like i could just start a bookkeeping firm for uh for startups and entrepreneurs just in my own portfolio if i invested in 45 companies last year just within that i bet i could get 14 clients of just companies that don't have a bookkeeper because most companies don't have bookkeepers you were considering starting a bookkeeping service that's like the worst idea boring thing i could do for you that's a horrible idea because i was just gonna be the marketing front end i wasn't gonna operate it i was just gonna buy or hire like a good bookkeeper and be like cool you're going to do the books and i'm just going to send you clients and you just close the clients and we split this 50 50 or whatever and um so that was one idea the better idea is insurance because insurance is like the best business of all time and because for insurance you don't even really do insurance you just broker the insurance with another like carrier basically and um and most businesses don't have most like especially like e-commerce businesses you need business insurance and you don't know like i didn't know exactly which insurance i needed how much uh how much coverage i wanted most traditional insurance firms don't cover e-commerce which is insane to me and so i was like all right well i could just do that and so that was another one which is you know startup slash e-commerce insurance was another one i basically did the math and i was like i could make so much more money doing that than if i ever did like ads in my newsletter if all i did in my ad would say hey by the way don't go to jail you should have a bookkeeper you know like hey um don't lose your business because somebody you know whatever chokes on a button what was your match what would your mat first of all i think that's i think you made 100 the right move doing what you did because those businesses do not fit your skill set or mine at all of like it sure like that like being on top of things like crazy amounts sweating the details i'm all right so what was your math behind it i don't know i have to pull up all the spreadsheets but basically just with my existing audience size i think they netted out whereas like i could be easily clearing you know three to five million dollars uh a year in profit if i like kind of like hit all my marks tell me more about this is actually really full capacity this is actually really interesting so what are we going to call it like sean surrents what was the name it's gonna be something i don't know the name was the last thing on my mind okay so i even talked to the i had this one one accountant who i really love there's this like ukrainian woman who's like this like amazing account she was the first accountant i talked to that felt like they worked for me and not like as a they weren't just like a narc and so they were like she was like have you thought about this you know like does your business need a vehicle because i think right now just last week of the year if you just bought a vehicle we can actually like depreciate that and use that against your books here like she was giving me ideas that were completely legal but she wasn't just sitting there and saying yeah if you give me all your paperwork and your receipts i'll i'll file your taxes for you it was the first person who was saying wow you're paying a lot in taxes over here and over here um let me just make sure i'm you know saving you money and so that was the first person so i was going to basically talk to her and be like hey should you do this like do you want to do this do you want to like leave start your own firm i'm sure you're scared of all that but guess what uh you just do the things you're really good at which is doing people's you know like tax strategy and accounting and i will get you all the clients that was you know the core premise but of course i i went down i said i created a free crypto newsletter uh because i just figured it'd be more fun dude i think these are great ideas by the way i think you made the right decision but these are actually this is crazy interesting i wish you would have told me that you're can i tell you about a [ __ ] genius idea that came out of that so um have you i don't know if you've ever like onboarded well like you've probably done some onboarding with some some software that you're trying to use or some company you're trying to use so for example with this with this bookkeeping company right the one i hired i eventually hired for my ecommerce thing they sent me this like super long checklist it was like all right um great excited to work with you do these 54 things and then we'll get started like that will be the start of your journey that'll get you to the starting line it's like go to shopify give us access to do that you need to go to view accounts permissions add us there add us as a bookkeeper blah blah blah now go to quickbooks do the same thing now go to stripe do the same thing now go to bank of america do the same thing like there was just all these [ __ ] steps it's like then sent us this then sent us this and it just felt and it was all done in excel right so i discovered this basically takes that process it just wraps beautiful user experience around it and i saw it and i was like this is so smart i invested in instantaneously didn't have a meeting with the founder i was like i totally buy it in fact any word you say is only going to make me less bullish on this idea because i am already convinced this is one of the best ideas i've ever seen so it's called doc so it's doc.us i don't know if you guys have checked this out um and uh julian julian shapiro sent this to me after i was like seeing this problem and then coincidentally he sent me the same idea so so here's how it works so basically it just creates like kind of like a notion space so the company who's trying to onboard you they just create this thing that's like it's like this is just a beautiful experience that's like hey sean so glad to have you on board first three things we need to do are these three click the check box when you're done with them so i'll know that you did it if you have any questions just put it in the comment thing here or click this to watch our tutorial from our library that we have about how to do it and so it just turns that like back and forth email or like excel spreadsheet like um janky thing into like like workflow for a client and um and a service to like onboard each other and i was like dude that's a problem that like i don't know like i don't know two million businesses a year have with every one of their clients this is gonna work i think this is gonna work what do you guys think of this idea really well i love it i just i just got a mortgage um after my landlord stiffness and you know i go onto chase's website and i don't know if you've done this but you go a gun chase website you go to a mortgage and there's like a thousand things to do plus you're like transported back to 1996 because you're in this like weird thing there's like javascript breaking everywhere there's like you like forgot about flash and like flashes somehow in there uh my my my uh banker calls me and just like you didn't finish this one thing and i was like what she's like i added it to your client portal it's like dude i don't get a notification i don't know i don't go check that i hate that place i [ __ ] hate that place yeah so yes yes this is one of those no-brainer ideas i i hope that they they actually embed like create an sdk they do okay i i i think that i don't know if they already do or they're going to but that was like a big part of yeah i was like this can live inside of your app or whatever so you know you uh you could just kind of like onboard people right there inside their experience this landing page is beautiful this is a beautiful website yeah so it is absolutely beautiful but i have a question for you for you guys um because it relates actually to this and also jim shark and even the the lawyer stuff which is you know sometimes when we're creating businesses you can do one of two things you can either like create something brand new which is like this um or create like a new gym like a new way of you know doing something or you could like help existing people you know do some marketing make some money that way do you guys you know and the silicon valley way is is very much like go raise a bunch of money invent something new um and it's really frowned upon to do you know the marketing piece of it and sort of positioning on top of it um what are your thoughts and you know do you think about that a lot you know because i've been thinking about it a lot say it again give us two examples i'll give you an example so um you know my last company the founder of 24 hour fitness invested in my company and he told me that before the 1980s there weren't membership based gyms like it was a new thing um and he invented the first one and it became 24-hour fitness i think they sold for three or four billion dollars it was a major success and then there's a lot of people who copied membership based gyms that's an idea of going zero to one creating an absolutely new product whereas what he could have done was created a gym shark of that era or whatever and consulted gymlock yeah exact jim long sorry um and consulted to you know add additional revenue to existing you know trainers etc um so the question is do you know how often you are thinking about creating something brand new versus you know just kind of a money making additional marketing layer on top of sam what do you think about that i don't think i think of it anything that i think of i don't think any of it's brand new i think zero is close to zero i think about that do you agree sean um no i think there's sometimes new things but it's extremely rare extremely rare extremely extremely rare but i would even argue that most anything that's new you could probably actually say oh well it's just like a different version of blank you could trace back right so like let's take a airbnb for example airbnb was clearly like kind of like this breakthrough product became this huge success and it's like the category killer the category leader for sharing economy and whatever um and now it's like bigger than hotels like than all hotels or whatever so it started off as a fringe thing but there was like couch surfing before that and like that was like a product that did a very similar thing um you know and vrbo and there was there's other stuff that's like around it so i think you're right that it's very hard to do something completely original but let me frame it slightly differently which is it seems like what greg is almost saying is like do you want to go for uh try to try to have either a new behavior or an existing behavior or another way of looking at it would be um do you want to create a product or do you want to have a service company right like it's kind of to me that in those examples is like 24 fitness was a new was like a new product you needed customers to go buy versus servicing you know trainers and and whatever whoever else um that was that's like a service business that's going to have great cash flow and doesn't require you to have this like winning brand and new product and new customers from scratch is that is that kind of is it more about the services versus product is that the yeah exactly yeah i think um you know sean and um sam like you know having spent time in sf i feel like when i got to sf i was all about new behaviors um that was really important to me and sean i know that was true for you too because like blab you're always pushing you know the envelope with like you know and bebo it's like new you know user interfaces and like new friend finding and new just like new ways of doing things versus now that we're in our 30s it feels like we're doing less and this is just an observation and correct me if i'm wrong but it feels like we're doing less of like the new behavior type stuff and more of like hey let's just like iterate on this thing and like focus it on this niche and and do that there's this guy named roger dickey i don't know him i think sean knows him right i never met him i think greg actually knows him oh right so i don't entirely know his full background but he used to do like a bunch of high-tech stuff he i know that he had the uh what's the startup that helps you code stuff it's like a new age new agency what's it called those are the g gixxer get gigster okay and before giggster greg what was he doing he was doing something like very traditional silicon valley right i just know him from twitter but yes he was doing uh he was the co-founder and ceo of giggster which was which was huge but he did it through a really interesting way i think he did it through a search lab do you guys know what a search lab is yeah and but i think before that like he maybe was that zynga or something like like a like he made like a mafia game or something like that yeah like something he made awards which at the time was cutting edge now his latest business i think it's called revolution is it called revolution made made made made and they are renovating bathrooms and as a recent homeowner who needs a new bathroom i went to the website and i was like this is sick i love this i bid and it looks from the outside like the company is just crushing it i saw another guy the guy who started casper his name's luke uh one of the four founders his name's luke i think he has a new business that's also renovating bathrooms or maybe kitchens and i thought it was interesting that these guys casper not exactly like cutting edge but kinda like kind of new behavior buying a mattress online uh roger dickey you know definitely new behaviors they're going to like these like older businesses and they're definitely using technology but at the end of the day they're not like re they're not inventing anything new they're just inventing maybe a a more efficient process and in my opinion those things are far more interesting and it's kind of intriguing to me that these guys are doing that as opposed to some new cutting edge thing so so i'll give you my my take on your on your question greg which is uh in my 20s it's like the way i traveled was i'd be like oh you know [ __ ] it i'll go tomorrow i'll spin the globe put my finger down all right i'm gonna go backpacking through you know eastern europe or i'm gonna go to australia and i'll be you know sleeping in a van type of thing and i wanted the adventure it was actually the right move to do at that time because it's like how do you get max adventure max sort of like discomfort and like out of your comfort zone you know max spontaneity all that stuff and um and then like now it's like where's like a sandals resort that i could take my kids and like you know i i just want to sit down i just want a place i can go sit that's not my house this is basically the extent of my adventure right now and so similarly like that's my hope my business career was the same it was like at the beginning it's like yo i'm going to build the next social network i'm going to build a a dating app where you you know you might die or whatever this is like these crazy ideas it's like every idea was like trying to be crazier than the last it's like you know and it all appealed to me that way and now i'm like cool i could um sell a product that i you know let me import a product from china and sell it through a facebook ad i click three buttons i can just sit in my chair and do that i don't really need a staff i don't really you know i'll just kind of outsource this and that all i was gonna write a newsletter um and i'll just write it in my browser and then that's it uh like i don't have to like become the next mark zuckerberg i just need to get to like enough people where i'm making a few million dollars a year and live in a sweet lifestyle um like that's that's a win you know and that's and i don't have to manage anybody and i don't have to like stress out about this thing and i don't have to know how to code i don't have to know any of these things oh yeah great and so i basically am now in the the sort of sandals resort part of my career and i mean that in the best way possible which was back then i was like almost like intrigued by the degree of difficulty and now i'm completely put off by the degree of difficulty and instead i just do the thing that sounds like what's gonna be easy simple fun for me and um and you know i'm just gonna go that route and so i am much less interested in like inventing the next big thing as i am like crafting a dope lifestyle doing something i enjoy and like me feels like but do you think that's gonna change when your kids get older so when your kids become eight nine ten maybe eight to like 16. they think that you are the coolest guy ever or if they don't think that maybe it's on the other end of you wanting to think that you're cool and you want to impress them um and i've been thinking a lot about that lately i'm like do i think that my attitude will change when my kids become five six seven eight and i want to impress them do i think like instead of just like having a sick lifestyle i'd be like oh man i want to do something like that they are proud of do you think that's going to change not because of that reason i do think it's going to change but not because of that like uh i don't think your kids think you're cool based on like your business success necessarily i don't i don't really think that that's the main the main way that kids think you're cool um and even if it was that's not why i would do something um i would just have more free time right like when my kids go to school that's gonna be like a [ __ ] game changer it's like i'm gonna get a third of my day back uh that i you know i don't have today and so when they go to school i have a lot more bandwidth if i want to do something more intense i can ratchet up the intensity and the difficulty level if i so choose uh at that time right now like dude before i do this podcast like i'm not uh i'm not like you know researching every detail for the 20 minutes before this podcast typically i'm like reading this book called goofy's adventure to my daughter putting her down for the nap you know like that's how i prep for this product 20 minutes before is like i'm literally reading disney books putting my daughter to bed in time to come back out here right so it's like there's a lifestyle i like right now that's doing this and so i'm optimizing for that i think in five years i'm gonna be picking a very different challenge than i'm picking today just because it'll be time for another chapter and i'll probably be like oh that lifestyle shit's boring i want to go do something big or i'm going to be like [ __ ] business business is stupid i'm going to go like try to write a comedy show and i'm going to like try to sell a show for tv like i don't know i'm gonna do something else with my life every five years i want to kind of reinvent myself in terms of what i'm doing so you've come a long way sean so one of the first times i met you you invited me to the bibo launch party and i invite i was like could i bring a plus one you're like sure i bring this friend who's visiting and we walk into this warehouse or something in san francisco i remember we had to like walk upstairs and like where was it sean it was in a uh you know like a car manufacturer car uh repair yeah like like a garage just like for car repairs whatever i don't know i forgot how to speak english but like basically michael had bought one of those like got rid of all the like car maintenance stuff and just turned it into like his man cave and he hadn't filled it up yet with his his like fancy cars and cool [ __ ] yet so it's just an empty warehouse in the middle of san francisco downtown san francisco and we threw our launch party there before he filled in so i'm there with one of my buddies from this small town in quebec the guy has never left his town basically in his entire life so he had landed san francisco he's staying with me he gets into this you know car shop or whatever and it's like dark and there's smoke and there's lights everywhere and then you walk in and there's all these people and there's lights everywhere and he like literally whispered to me and he said is kanye west coming to this [Laughter] did he say yeah he should have said yeah and it was like one of those moments like i'm sure a bunch of people have like watch the social network when it's like justin timberlake is like talking to uh i guess it's mark zuckerberg in the club and it's just like it's intense and it's like larger than life and you were kind of like living that lifestyle in san francisco not like i mean i'm painting you as very playboy and i won't say you're 100 playboy but um in the sense of like you were living that lifestyle you were you were doing that like zuckerberg thing and now um you're you know you're kind of doing the complete opposite and my question to to to actually both of you but particularly for sean is if you could redo it would you have done more more of these product bets that are uh there's it's really less risk like for example milk road like there wasn't that much risk there yeah yeah let's be right here right so like i feel like people like we're now that we're in our 30s we're focusing on different niches and we're taking things that are working different communities and we're just pushing that out there with you know low product risk would you have done that or do you think that you needed to do these crazy bets in your 20s to to to be where you are today i have a very easy answer but i'll let sean go first no no go no i want you to go first i want to hear what you're going to say playboy sean well i was playing bullshot by the way for that i flew in this painter that i had met and he did i don't remember this he did a live painting where he he's painting this like abstract thing he's break dancing while he's doing it and this is a guy i had seen at a at a fair and greely colorado many years before that and i was like hey dude i have like a like i have a company that has like a bunch of funding like you want to just like fly out for this party and do something dope do that thing you did at that little town fair do it in front of like hundreds of people at this thing and he's doing it and then at the end he spins the canvas and what looks like this crazy abstract thing was he had painted like a [ __ ] bob marley upside down and it's like he does this like whatever he flips the thing and then he's like done and he slaps it with his hand it's full of paint and it was like that was the moment and i was just like that party was dope that was a dope party actually now that i remember it so do i regret it well now that i'm thinking about that party no i don't regret it that was pretty awesome i'm glad i did it because i'm happy with where i am now having said that there were so many things that i did foolishly during that time and i'm not just talking about like you know oh you know i wasn't as good at this thing as i am now it's like no like there was so much opportunity right under my nose and i was blind to it and like one of the biggest like scary things for me now is like what are those things today that are right in front of me that i'm too stupid to see just like i was too stupid to see it seven years ago when i was doing that other thing um for example greg you were in our early mastermind groups and the founders of calm were there and they were talking about how hard it was and how they're just you know it was just alex it was just kind of like yeah it's hard to raise money right now i'm trying and and we were just like dude it's cool app man you should stick with it he's like yeah i'm gonna just keep going and like that's a 2 billion dollar plus company now and we were helping him like dude why didn't we cut the check you were there too i don't know you didn't cut a check either did you i i remember at the time like if i'm being honest like i felt that it was too niche like i was like we were like sean you and i were focusing on like we were doing big stuff stuff that was going to be yeah exactly later he's got the huge company uh there was so many of those so in our masterminds itself i think uh loom was in there that's a billion dollar company and i remember kind of like trying to mentor shy and being like bro like you know that don't worry you'll figure it maybe it's not this one but like when you get to your real game you're gonna be like good because of this experience you were friends with him too like did you invest in that like i missed i missed it was called uh uh what was it called open test dot co and that's what loom was originally and it you know it felt like you know when you're doing your first startup and it just feels so shaky because you're it's your first time doing all this stuff like that's what it felt like and so it was you know and then also the the narrative at the time was don't invest in other people's startups you got if you if you want to make it in silicon valley you got to give laser focus so i you know my mistake in my 20s was i came to san francisco and you know i listened to all these vcs with all their narratives and i did it and if i were to redo it i would frankly just be doing what i now which is doing like what i'm doing now which is like focused on communities doing agency services you know focusing on niches and and and web you know yeah just build an experiment and not have the biggest exits in the world so there was like 10 examples like that like i remember alex mccall came over one day and he we were catching up and then he went on to start clear i remember thinking this guy's [ __ ] amazing i should invest in this clear bit thing and i like went over to his office and we like hung out i was like about to meet the guys i was like i love the energy of this office man like if i just couldn't do anything besides feel this office i would be like they're building a winner in here and that's also like i don't know if it's a billion it's multi-million dollar company um and he told me at the end he goes oh by the way i'm buying up uh i was like what else are you doing finally i started asking smart questions like what else are you doing he's like oh i bought up some stripe shares this stripe share is available for like two billion dollars so i'm buying a bunch of striped shirts i think it was him maybe josh buckley is one of them and he's like i'm buying up stripes for 2 billion let me know if you want in and i was like 2 billion to me i was like well that's like the most a startup is worth is like a billion is like the top of the mountain so like to me it was like oh there's no upside left you know i didn't like think from first principles about like everybody knew stripe was [ __ ] amazing it was like the best startup in the whole like you know in silicon valley and i had this opportunity to go buy stripes at 2 billion and i thought how late i was and i was like man i wish i could have got in earlier and now like you know the things i would give for stripe shares at 2 billion now like it's like that's already like like 100x you know from from there and that was proven right forget that then there was all the services we were using like furcon who's my cto he'd be like oh this is a cool cool product let's use this in our tech stack if i had just invested in all the bills we were paying for like software we were using like pagerduty and elasticsearch and so you know like one after another those were all huge winners that were pre-ipo um so first was investing the second was like project selection so like you were talking about greg i did the same thing i was playing by the rules of like i was playing by other people's rules meaning like what was considered cool in silicon valley was to be like a product guy who was building who had like cool product taste and was building like um you know like new markets and like going for the big billion dollar prizes and then i met sam who was like i'm writing this newsletter it's free i'm gonna have like newsletter ads and i was like yeah but like are you gonna do a startup someday like that's how i felt about it right sam's company sells for more than more than my company sold for in the end he goes uh he goes look you're good but basically like you're showing up to a knife fight with a knife and i wish you would show up with a magic wand that would just murder the competition i'm like sounded cool right i was like uh that's a great analogy that's a cool story but like uh [Music] i don't know man i think the math kind of i think it might achieve the desired outcome which i'm trying to do here which uh when i started i was just trying to be financially independent by the age of 30. that was the only goal um and so so like if i could go back and just whisper three things about like just just strategy like forget life advice just strategy advice i would have said um invest in all the smart people you know like it'll it'll work out if you don't have the money go convince somebody that you have a bunch of really smart friends that they should give you money to invest in that that'll be the first thing the second is invest in all of the expenses on your p l so go find all the places you're spending money and go try to invest in all those companies that will also do fantastically well you'll make more on that than your own company okay if you really want to do your own company beyond that fantastic that's great you're going to build up skills and you got a lottery ticket there that might work i would have just said like don't try to be mark zuckerberg from the social network like think about what like like basically just open your eyes to the problems and the opportunities that exist today and so like you know whether it was like e-commerce or shopify apps or like these sounded small at the time but they sounded small because that's where they were early and like at that time i needed a vc to like stamp their approval that this was a good market or a good opportunity which by that time is pretty late because what's the vc doing they're looking at what companies are raising huge rounds which means like four years ago those were great opportunities three years ago those were great opportunities and so i wish i had just kind of been more eyes wide open on like what projects are available to you and like the things that sound kind of nation funny those are actually better signals for you than the thing that the vc is saying is going to be huge or is already huge because it's often um you know those companies to start are like you're in a you're in an absolute dog fight and it's just like one winner out of 100 is going to emerge versus other things where like you could basically take um no no product risks no market risk so i had a friend vishal tell me this once he goes i invest in companies with no product market fit risk i had never heard somebody say that it didn't even make sense to me i go what do you mean like every startup is product market fit risk you guys know it's not like what he goes he was the one who convinced me to buy bitcoin initially as well he was like bitcoin's going to be the you know the biggest thing in the world he's like i just put up basically all the money i have in the bitcoin i was like what the [ __ ] this is like back in 2016 15. nobody was really saying that back then so for the product market fit thing he goes he goes for example i just invested in a company that's making a robot that makes pizzas and it makes pizza it makes a perfect pizza every time 24 7 at a lower cost than a human being can do it he goes i don't know if they can because there's a ton of engineering risk like they may not be able to technically do it but if they can do it there's zero market risk every pizza shop will want this over paying an employee to make imperfect pizzas only in certain hours call in sick and blah blah like it for a higher cost and i was like oh [ __ ] that's true there are things that have zero market risk and i was taking like maximum market risk before so like that's the other strategy is like you don't have to take as much market risk the thing you're doing now greg is like way less market risk the thing i'm doing with milk road had like zero market risk basically and there's just like there's a lot of money there's life-changing money that can be made and a lot of fun that can be had without taking on unnecessary what happened to that pizza company i think they're still in engineering risk mode they got like a big contract from domino's but then their ceo got was in trouble for some things that they hired a new ceo something something something you know like again these are legit engineering risks so i'm not like that doesn't mean they'll all work but like what i'm doing with the newsletter is like neither technical risk nor market risk yeah operational risk it's just are you gonna are you gonna be able or wanting to do it for a long time which is yeah you know that's a pretty good thing to try to overcome right yeah it's really tough you know i remember coming to san francisco and and hearing all these narratives and these bc's telling me this and also entrepreneurs sort of repeating a lot of this stuff and i will say it it's tough to go against what these stamps of approvals say to do you know like you have to tell yourself every day like and i have to do that too like when i started a services business all my most of my silicon valley friends were like a services business like an agency that's what you're gonna do after you know like and you just kind of have to push forward and really just um remember that you know just because some you know certain people on twitter say a certain thing or or sequoia or andreessen say a certain thing doesn't mean um you can't have a great like i would say you can have a better lifestyle not being mark zuckerberg than being mark zuckerberg yeah exactly the pope catholic bro a brown bear shits in the woods right obviously yeah what was that a brown bear shit's in the woods yeah that's a sampard special that's a vampire special is that the number seven sample specialty i just ordered because i think i got it the brown bear [ __ ] in the woods yeah that's why people listen to this podcast though for a couple of sam's parts and sample specials did you just what did you say did i did i just order a sambar smartphone number seven because i think i just got it yeah that's good by the way uh there i made a joke recently where shawn you go yeah so there's these short traders and i said oh yeah how tall is he and you just like totally skipped by it and the people in the comments on youtube were like i think the joke was funny but it was definitely funny that shawn just ignored him no people were like dude how did you not acknowledge that absolute gem on time on target you were you were quick with that one yeah it got no love and the commenters uh pointed it out you're the new chris rock man you're the new chris rock you're a better version of chris rock thank god this is digital he's gonna [ __ ] slap me right in the face dude i can't believe that happened i'm gonna like right after this i'm gonna go see i can't wait to see uh will smith apologize oh yeah he's for sure gonna come up with something by the way the form on his slap if you look at the photo full extension crossbody i mean like do you i've never slapped anyone if i tried to stop someone once i'm not gonna have perfect form that guy has to have slapped before because you don't just wake up with perfect form on a slap like that like the just look at the extension and tell me that's not the best 12 000 smith is a habitual slapper man he's a perfectionist this guy is slapped before we gotta we gotta stop this guy before he gets out of control i wonder he's definitely slapped before i wonder as he was walking up the catwalk there was like five seconds there so i wonder what he was thinking like was he like you know what am i gonna punch him am i gonna slap him like i wonder what was going through his mind i think he's always rocker a little right now i've done that before to my sister where like i knew i was mad and i started to charge she's five years older than me so i was like you know a kid at the time and i knew i was mad and i had i had a i have to do something but i had no plan and so i had like three steps to improvise the plan i remember this and she'll she always tells the story we were in the kitchen and i was pissed because she made fun of me and i'm five six years old and i was walking and i am in the kitchen i just grab a butter knife and i go nisha this is the end that was my statement and like she was like the end of what i was like like nobody knows what happened after that we both just blacked out she thought it was hilarious that i you know said like a movie line like a loser and i was holding this butter knife i don't know what i was going to try to do but uh it wasn't going to work she was she could overpower me pretty handily at that time special all right that's the episode by the way greg you said something don't edit yet i want to leave with with with greg got my wheels turning even while we're joking my wheels are still turning about what you just said about the narrative here's my challenge each of us what's one narrative that you think actually you should be going counter to that narrative like there's a narrative that we hear as entrepreneurs as people in kind of tech and like what do you think is the like actually i don't know maybe it's this other thing instead so if anyone has one do it but i otherwise i'll i'll give you one yeah go for it so mine would be um i'll give you two there's the inside crypto there's a narrative that's basically like oh there's all this innovation happening this it's like the next protocol the next token the next whatever i'm pretty sure that if you just buy three or four things like if you buy bitcoin eth um i put luna in there now just buy those three and you just chill either all of crypto is gonna work and those will work amazingly or crypto's not gonna work and no matter what you did like if those fail if those don't go up dramatically in value um crypto just didn't work and none of this [ __ ] will work and so i think actually a basically like for a while the best strategy was bitcoin and chill and now it's ethan chill i basically think it's still the same i think it's like buying two or three tokens and not even needing to know anything more just chilling on those is probably the best investment of the next like 10 to 15 years gonna outperform everything during that time i so i think like going deeper down the rabbit hole and like learning more is actually going to [ __ ] up your returns versus just buying the the main ones and just holding for for like 10 years not thinking about it that's one and then the other is i think that angel investing doesn't make much sense anymore and i say this as somebody who angel invests like the valuations are so high um that like if i think about like that same money going into like one of these sort of boring cash flow businesses is so much better for your life so if you're like an individual angel investor and you have let's say a hundred thousand dollars you know or three hundred thousand dollars that you want to go put into like a basket of 20 startups it's like are you sure you shouldn't just buy like like get an sba loan and go buy like some random website that's already producing profit and that'll pay itself off in two years or less and uh and now you own this cash flowing asset like i'm pretty sure that's just gonna do better dude i agree than a basket of angel investments the the the our friends who have all crushed it on angel investing you know it means they made their investments five or eight years ago and it was different it is it's outlandish at the moment so i agree with that i think for mine that i think that it's actually i think that i think that you only have a few swings in your career and a lot of people are like oh you should be patient and you've got a lot of time to do certain stuff i actually think you should try you should dedicate your 20s to getting your first significant win because after that life gets a lot harder you get a lot less energy you're a lot smarter which is actually bad you actually it's kind of good to be kind of ignorant um and not enough people i think all often times people go the other route where they go well just go join something for a little while and learn in my opinion f that your 20s dedicated to getting a win and getting even if it's relatively small and do it as fast as possible because after that life is a lot easier i'll give my what sean i was going to say give the moyes quote about getting rich quick he goes why does everyone hate on getting rich quick get rich quick schemes are the best i want to get rich quick i don't want to get rich slow i got i got two real quick so i got off the phone with a friend of mine who worked at facebook he told me this morning he told me that he works roughly 90 90 to 120 minutes per day on average i thought you're gonna say 90 to 120 hours a week he yeah it's the best when you measure your work in minutes he's texting me he texted me today he said it was 9 12 a.m he said 9 12 a.m finish work for the day 12 12 minutes and so you know put us in a group chat i want him to text us every day just the time stamp of winning so that's what that's what i told him to do i said you need to create like a twitter a non account a twitter that's and so i'm gonna stay tuned do that um but i think that in your 20s like potentially go work at facebook go work at google get those high paying jobs i think that by the way i think i think that's a good way to get a win get get you know do that for a few years while you're you know do you're doing your you're learning on the side like join a tao build a community build a newsletter do whatever you want to do it really speaks to you while you're you're not you know yeah so you're making money and you're learning what more could you ask for and then my and you know just because you gave a crypto uh one sean i think that and i spent a lot of time in nft land and web 3 land too i think that nfts are going to 99 freedom it it's going to be a free freedom and thing i think the the idea of selling nfts uh will be a very small thing okay so what what happens why why would i give away something for free or what's my incentive so what happens after it's freedom in so yeah i mean you know okay so the idea right now it's like people are selling nfts and projects for 0.05 to 0.2 let's say on average for some of these you know 10 000 pfp projects i think that um that's going to burn out at some point and i think we're starting to see it burn out a little bit and i think that you know did you see the hundred thieves drop yeah they uh what do they do exactly they did a much smaller amount so they basically first of all it was in gaming and gamers hate nfts so the fact that they did a successful gaming nft launch like obviously kudos to them but basically they won this championship and they were like okay in order to get this like collectible you can go grab it it's free we're not saying it's going to be worth anything and they got 700 000 people to collect this collectible and and there's like a trophy right and then they make money on if there's value right so if it grows in value they get royalties and i think that's what you're going to see a lot of is like creators and and big communities basically doing freedom ins um even though people seem you know people today think that selling nfts is the future i don't think so right by the way i'm going to change mine to just simplify it instead of starting a company buy an existing business i think that is the most overlooked obvious thing for a smart person to do is how do you take your market risk to essentially zero um you buy a business that's already working and profitable and you just say cool i'm a better operator than this person or i know about a different form of operation than they do and so i can grow this using facebook ads or i can grow this using outsourcing or i can grow this using you know code or whatever it is so you you hear almost no narrative uh you heard tons of narrative around the genius visionary startup start a new thing building a new project launching a new thing and like you hear like one or two examples of people buying businesses and i think that for most smart people buying a business is a far better idea than starting yeah but when you're in your 20s my pushback to that is like when you're in your let's say early 20s like do you know like you're saying that now but i think like yeah um you do need like that operational experience and that's where my point is um you got to like it's worthwhile to to just potentially take a high-paying job and then on the side kind of like experiment and do stuff yeah that's true i'm not really limiting mine to the 20s i think uh i'm still making mistakes in my 30s so i'm assuming other people are dude i guess it's more like what narrative do i hear now that's easy to float along with that i'm like you know what actually i don't i don't i just think this is true and like that's the one for me which is like for most people who want to be entrepreneurial they default to starting a business and i think actually maybe it should be the opposite maybe you should default to taking on an existing business and growing it and only create a new thing if you like actually have a new invention in mind a new idea that really you can't shake in your head versus like just starting a new startup i like that because because you want to be an entrepreneur right um all right i think we lost sam we got to go all right greg thanks for coming man where should people find you twitter at greg eisenberg or on our pod where it happens or uh in the mountains of canada or the mountains of canada unless you're the irs in which case he's in miami at least 180 days out at least all right [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
i have this uh student her name is denira and she lives in la single mom three kids really small house not enough rooms for everybody like she is definitely doing it her herself she was working two jobs and she was baking and people would come to her house they'd pick up a birthday cake or a celebration cake or whatever and that's how one way she was making money long story short cut to creating a digital course and she became really good at caramel candy apples so how to create caramel candy apples and the thing is the caramel was store-bought it wasn't like her special recipe just people didn't know what store to go to or what to buy and so she started to create these and sell a digital course now a lot of my students many of them have made seven figures and beyond but i want to talk about her because she's a woman who made um never made over a hundred thousand dollars a year and now in one digital course launch she made 260 000 selling how to create uh caramel candy apples and she literally was just doing live videos in a private facebook group and i always tell that story because a lot of people listening have never created anything in their life online and they would never even they're like my idea can't be good enough or it's not original enough or whatever and then i think of daenerys single mom living in la making 260 000 on the first time she launched anything now she's making way more money than that but that's the kind of stuff that i live for because it has to start somewhere [Music] so amy what's going on so amy porterfield you're you're part of the hubspot podcast network you're a newish addition right once you join right uh yeah just about two months um and so what would you say you do i mean you do a i've read your blog for years and years and years but we had john lee dumas on the other day and i was like i actually don't know how to describe him and he's like is he do i just call him a podcaster is he he's a blogger i'm not actually sure what how i would like because you kind of do a bunch of stuff how would you describe i sound like my mom and dad who have no clue what i do 13 years in so i totally get it i always say that i am an internet marketing expert and i help entrepreneurs still build businesses online and my expertise is to take your knowledge and know-how and turn that into a profitable digital course so digital courses are my area of expertise online okay amazing what kind of digital courses do you have your own course about courses i do which is so meta i know so basically here's the thing uh 13 years ago i worked in corporate i worked for tony robbins and i was the director of content development got to travel the world and work on content that tony did on stage at like unleash the power within and date with destiny and all those cool events and i was in a meeting and i was called so humbling i was called into this meeting to take notes and i walk into this meeting in this big san diego corporate office and i walk in and it's a bunch of internet marketers now in my world these are like the grandfather of internet marketers although that sounds very rude to to call them grandfathers but they're like the mack daddies so it's like frank kern brendan bouchard evan pagan jeff walker like big name internet marketers that are still doing really big things but they were the leaders in the industry i had no idea who these guys were and here i am at a side table taking notes and tony's going around asking them about their businesses and what do they do and how are they making money online and all i heard was freedom like these guys were running their own businesses creating digital courses about tons of different topics and i wanted a piece of that so that was like my first entry into this world i knew nothing about and about six months later or so i had left my corporate job and started creating my own digital courses so yeah i've got digital courses teaching people how to grow email lists how to create digital courses but ultimately my my mission is to help people leave their nine to five jobs start their own online businesses and i believe digital courses is a way to do that so that's their vehicle sean you have something to say because i i i just i just say forget courses let's talk about tony robbins i was gonna say that exact same thing i was gonna i was gonna say uh i was gonna ask you about a couple of the people you mentioned including tony and i was like how much does this empire bring in you think is does this guy just knock it out the park or what i mean it's seriously what i always say about tony is how if have you guys ever been to one of his events before have you ever seen him on stage i've been to two actually i've been to yeah i've been to two unleash the power within uh okay cool and i'm a kool-aid drinker i love tony robbins absolutely yeah so i'm a fan but i'm also super curious i don't know the guy or know much about him so i'm still a fan after all these years and how he is on stage like that huge personality all the energy super intense like how he is on stage is exactly how he is behind stage as well i often joke that i might have lost a few years off my life because that was the most intense job i ever had but i wouldn't change it for the world because i literally got to learn from the master give me an intensity story tony robbins intensity i love what you got so the thing is when before tony the beans wait what you gotta spill the beans you gotta tell us the stories here's why it's intense before he goes on stage he literally preps for uh unleash the power within like it's the first time he ever stepped on stage i've never seen anyone prep for anything and be prepared more in my entire life and so we have to write these like stage signs of everything that like he's going to talk about and the stories he's gonna touch on and they're all um handwritten i don't know why we would hand write these things every time but they're handwritten and he goes over all of them and then he gets on this rebounder and he's jumping on the rebounder behind stage getting all the energy in his body the moment what's a rebounder it's like a trampoline trampoline like a trampoline yeah yeah and it kind of gets the energy going in your body and he's reading your stage sign and making sure he's got everything going and then he just throws the stage sign and he runs on stage and he does his thing but the intense part is when he gets off he looks at who's ever in his proximity and he's like all right let's download he downloads every single time he comes off stage what worked what didn't it what we could make better what he liked what he didn't like he wants feedback from everyone and it's like you are on the entire time i still i'm nervous talking about it yeah you sound like it so he's been doing this for like 40 years that's crazy to me because i went to the two things and he does the same exact thing right he does pretty much the same script so i i would assume he's like you know knows it by the back of his you know like like the back of his hand or whatever by now um so it's not it's probably not the material that he's like trying to remember it's like he's just getting himself into that state what about exactly what about besides the performances i think performing is definitely like a high intensity thing what about just like work like the office or were you not around for that part uh meaning tony in the office yeah just like on a normal day non-performance so on a normal day non-performance tony's not in the office he was when i was there he was at his house he did all the stuff from his own house but he's always on so i think one thing i took what i learned from tony and i brought into my own business is that one always be prepared over prepare care deeply about what you're creating he cares deeply about his content so that's why he's always getting it in his body even though we've done it a hundred times and when he's not in the office he's still always always learning always meeting with people learning new things like that meeting that we had he just wanted to know how they were selling their digital courses online because he was gonna start doing that in a bigger way so he's always pulling from different places it was an incredible experience what about uh so sean i've told you about this guy before his name's eben pagan and we talked we're sean and i amy are good friends with um craig clemons and he was a copywriter and when we had john lee dumas on the other day i was like john tell me about some of these marketers they're so fascinating to me and you just named a bunch of them and i'm going to ask you i want to ask you about them but evan pagan's the most interesting so basically for the listeners edmond pagan i knew him as david d'angelo when i was 14 years old i was a nerd i wanted to learn how to meet girls he had an e-book called double your dating and what he would do if i remember correctly and amy you could correct me i think he would if he would send these really long emails like it felt like 10 000 word text based emails about how to meet women and at the end you could buy like a 14 book and i think craig told us that he was selling like 30 million dollars a year of this book on called double your dating have you heard about this yo absolutely i've heard about it and i know he's a legend in in that area and when he came to the table i think he had moved on from um that part of his business but that's how he was put on the map and the one thing that i learned from evan really early on is he teaches the strategy that you've got to coin your own content like you've got to name it you've got to put a title to it you've got to own it so one of the things that i've always done when i've created content in my own business is like i've got the portafilled process for outlining your digital course and the sweet spot for finding what topic to create for your your course i name everything and own it and it sets you up as an expert and that absolutely came from ebay it's like so me and sam both teach courses on maven and wes who runs the the course platform for maven she she has one that she calls she's like you need your spiky point of view it's like what what's your spiky point of view and she's like it's a point of view that stands out that not everybody would agree with it's like it'll poke some people the wrong way uh because it's different than you know everything that they've heard before and so you know that was like the core of when she's like if you're gonna teach a course you've got to have a spiky point of view otherwise like your course doesn't really have a a sort of angle to it or a hook to it um that you that other people are going to attach with yeah i love that do you um the other day sean and i were talking about this guy named sam evans because he he had this youtube video called consul uh he has a business called consulting.com and he revealed all of his numbers and he was like we got to 30 million in revenue and then we decided to just be really profitable and we do 10 million in sales with five million in profit with like a team of four people and we were just fascinated because that's just like a that's a great great business to own that um what are some other people who who you've worked with or that you know of that are like shockingly that you would tell people and you're like i can you not believe what this person does you would not believe how much revenue they make or that they sell a course uh in this space are there any shocking ones like that so one of the ones that always has shocked me i have this uh student her name is denira and she lives in la single mom three kids really small house not enough rooms for everybody like she is definitely doing it her herself she was working two jobs and she um was baking and people would come to her house they'd pick up a birthday cake or a celebration cake or whatever and that's how one way she was making money long story short cut to creating a digital course and she became really good at caramel candy apples so how to create caramel candy apples and the thing is the caramel was store-bought it wasn't like her special recipe just people didn't know what store to go to or what to buy and so she started to create these and sell a digital course now a lot of my students many of them have made seven figures and beyond but i want to talk about her because she's a woman who made um never made over a hundred thousand dollars a year and now in one digital course launch she made 260 000 selling how to create uh caramel candy apples and she literally was just doing live videos in a private facebook group and i always tell that story because a lot of people listening have never created anything in their life online and they would never even they're like my idea can't be good enough or it's not original enough or whatever and then i think of denira single mom living in la making 260 000 on the first time she launched anything now she's making way more money than that but that's the kind of stuff that i live for because it has to start somewhere what's her course name how do i google her um let's see if you did google de nira caramel candy apples you will absolutely find her i spelled daenerys d-a-n-i-r-a we call her the caramel candy apple queen she's got tons of press written up about her like she's she's a big deal how did she get her customers so who bought this course how did she go sell how much is the course uh i can't remember a couple hundred dollars okay and the way she got her customers this is what's cool she made a lot of videos she did a lot of social media where she'd show in her tiny little kitchen with not a fancy camera or lighting like what she was doing and the thing is so if you own a bakery a caramel candy apple is like 10 bucks or more to sell which is really good profit for a bakery and these bakers wanted to find more ways to make more money so she app she appealed to the small business owners who had bakeries or sweets to sell but she also appealed to a lot of hobbyists a lot of people are like i just want to do that that's cool so she had a mesh of two different audiences but her she basically just made free content and then tons of content lots of videos yep wow and then the way i teach people how to sell courses is with webinars so she she started to do webinars and webinars were away a new vehicle to sell more so she's gone on to do even more launches you would do a webinar for a three or two hundred dollar thing absolutely so back in the day my very first successful course was called fb influence i did it with lewis howes and together we created this course and launched it was 97 and i probably did 200 webinars to sell a 97 course and it was a huge success because we had tons of affiliates but i would do a webinar even for a 97 course amongst these internet marketers who what's the largest course i don't know a course info product what's the largest business you've ever heard of oh geez the largest business i've ever heard of um [Music] i don't know i feel like people yeah who crushes it the most that's a that's a that's a different way to vote well my girl marie forleo do you guys know marie forleo she has a program called b-school she's been crushing it for 10 years here's what's unique about her course she's had the same course obviously she makes it a little bit better every year makes the marketing better but it's literally the same course that she has sold for i think 13 years now once a year she sells this course two thousand dollars now it's 2500. um but she's in the game been in the game for 13 years with the same course that to me is badass because she's probably made like three million dollars a year in profit for like 10 years would you you think that's crazy yes i do she's very quiet about her dollars so i don't know exactly but i've seen the numbers the affiliates i've been an affiliate for a really long time absolutely she's crushing it and the thing is and what i learned from tony robbins is you do not always want to reinvent the wheel find something that works double down on it and stop starting from scratch all the time and that's literally what marie has mastered so she's someone that i've always followed from the get-go is there anyone else um i'm trying to think it's just that here's the thing sometimes i don't think people are totally forthcoming with their numbers i've been in the internet marketing space for a long time and sometimes i trust you know what i hear and sometimes i don't and sometimes people throw out numbers and i'm like yeah but what's the profit margin on that so i always am a little bit uh unsure about what the numbers really are the affiliate strategy so uh what because i think most people if they're like oh i'm gonna create my own first my first course they wouldn't think that oh i should be using affiliate strategy so explain what that works and how big of a tool that is for for you and your like marketing magics do you use that even do you even use that sean do you use affiliates no so i have made millions in my own business be an affiliate for other people but i've also had affiliates sell my own courses and to me i think it's one of the most powerful ways to build a business at least supplement your income if you have courses and memberships of your own so um for i think number one i think 50 50 is what people should be offering i've seen a trend recently that it's gone down to like 30 percent maybe 40 percent 40 60. i'm old school so i really do believe the 50 50 model is the way to go and i think that if you find a course that either you've taken or you know your students will get massive value from it but you don't offer something like that i think absolutely adding an affiliate offer to the mix can supplement your revenue like i have different streams of revenue one of my second biggest streams of revenue is being an affiliate for other people who's your biggest affiliate um so i the most the money i the most money i've made as an affiliate is through marie forleo's b-school that's why i'm really close to it and then um jenna kutcher and gabby bernstein are huge and stu mclaren all three are huge affiliates for my program digital course academy they do really really really well i think we need to do that sean huh it makes a huge difference it's like a whole other stream of revenue how many people work at your company so we've got 20 full-time employees and then some contractors on the side everyone's virtual we do a four-day work week and so we work monday through thursday and um it feels like a big team like i feel like that's a lot of people but i know it's such a small business still yeah i think that's a lot why do you why do you need so many people so we do so i have three digital courses one membership and then we do a lot of affiliate marketing and so everybody is just stays in their lane and like i've got one person that's 100 focused on my podcast so that's all she does she's podcast producer kylie you might talk to her your team talk to her and so we have a lot of people in specialized roles are you running the company and being the front person or do you have someone help them run the company while you're focused on content great question so for seven years i've had a sidekick helping me run the company she's a cmo and uh recently transitioned out as a contractor so i'm running it more than i normally do when she's running marketing i don't have my hands in all of that that's a lot of work god damn right now it feels like a lot of work but it won't it doesn't always feel that way what's the name of your podcast so people who are listening can go check it out my podcast is online marketing made easy how big are you guys we've been we've been we're getting in um a pissing contest contest with john lee dumas uh i'm a little like i'm jealous a little bit with uh jenna uh jenna kutcher's totally magic like she's got an amazing podcast how many downloads total do you guys have um i think in december on the podcast platform uh we had 1.3 or 1.3 maybe million on the podcast platform and then like another 400 on youtube 400 000 on youtube just for the month yeah yeah okay well that's huge we had a million in january that was our recent was a million in january so wow um we've had just just on podcast players or like uh yes yes that's huge that's huge so we feel good about it we've had 35 million downloads um i used to not download twice a week changing to twice a week has changed things for us for sure i do a 15 minute one on tuesday and a longer one on thursday and that changed the game for us so i'm glad we did that so your epis once was that was once a week before that or once a week before uh december i think it was that we made the change so then you have way more downloads prep so we get between 50 to 100 000 probably average we we we we have three episodes a week sometimes so we're doing well that's awesome i think we even we have four sometimes but so our so our episodes like that the episode the downloads per episode is the more important metric i think uh that's the real metric it's not the one you you brag about but it's still new if you actually want to grow that's the one you care about it sounds like yours is really big that's how you're also moving up in the charts i mean i know that there's like you can't know everything about that algorithm but one thing i've studied enough and i'm competitive enough to know that i'm not moving up in the charts unless my week of downloads are strong and so you guys are doing better than i am because you're always above me in the charts i pay attention to those things anyone who says they don't i think they're live oh we i we totally do i take a lot of pride in charitable numbers but it sounds like you get more downloads per episode than us for sure maybe in my back catalog we do we do a lot of um promoting to our own community about our podcast like we embed it in a lot of things so um we did something really cool in january where we had a quiz and basically you take a quiz to figure out where you are in your entrepreneurial journey and then we gave you 10 episodes that are going to help you along that journey and that blew up so you're smart okay gotcha you're smart and you do smart things and then you get good results i understand now this is the secret yeah we uh the the we'll wrap up a second the best promotion we did recently was we just announced that we're gonna give five thousand dollars to some person who takes our clips and turns them into tick-tock videos and gets popular and tick-tock and we got i think 30 million impressions on tick-tock in uh like 20 days that is incredible that is super smart that was the only smart thing we've ever done whose idea was that one neither of us in fact i literally called it a dumbass idea and on air wait does it fall ben just popped up this is my chance to come back into the episode yes it was my idea shout out to mfm cuts who is uh killing it and and there's many others i follow them all now on tick tock my tick tock feet is now just clips of myself and sam uh you know over and over again it's great that's awesome i'm going to check that out wait how do i find it yeah so here's what we did but we screwed up or i screwed up so it's uh what was the hashtag ben mfm shorts and ms all right so if you go on tick-tock and you search mfm clips with an s you'll find it but you'll also find because i read the what we were announcing it i accidentally one time i said clips with an s and then i said clip without an s so you if you if you search both of those words you'll find different ones and also if you just google mfm clip you're going to get porn because it stands for male female male and so you'll get a whole different set of clips if you go to google so that you know it's right there's something for everybody over here we're very inclusive when i was just starting out my name i think it was my maiden name now that i think about it it was a porn star a ballard so i think it was someone named amy ballard was a porn star when i uh like 13 years ago or something and i was like mortified every time i searched my name there she was does this sound familiar ben does that ring a bell no comment ben saying no comment i see yeah that's crazy the yeah that sucks that definitely sucks it's not an issue anymore i've got a new last name i used to file this guy on twitter named jeff f stein um and so it could be worse no i tweeted at that guy i was like ah brutal name and then he got so mad at me i was like you can't be i can't be the first person to point this out to you like don't be mad at me i didn't do it to you oh my gosh well thanks for coming on amy this is this is awesome yeah thanks guys so much it's nice to talk to you and i know you guys are coming on to my podcast so i'm looking forward to chatting with you too sounds good take care all right bye guys [Music] you

comes on sits selma on his lap and like is clearly flirting i think he's like kissing her neck like it's [ __ ] embarrassing it's what it is and i whenever i saw that video i was like oh i don't look up to you anymore that that that was pretty bad you watched that video yeah i did you sent it i watched part of it it was kind of uncomfortable so i just stopped watching it because he kind of like like are they friends are they cool like you know dude even if you are cool that's weird to me that behavior is weird to me and then i'm like was this cool in 1998 did people do this type of thing in 1990 no man i really remember even the crowd it was like it's it's uncomfortable and it's on live tv and she's trying to like be polite and not make a big deal out of it yeah you could tell she's not like down with that and i read his book i read his book and like so i'm not on board with him anymore actually so that's what that's i'll leave it at that is that a fair assessment no hold on hold on what what did you read in his book or is that irrelevant to what yours oh he was just cheating on his wives and and he just seemed like a guy who um it's okay that he has his lifestyle but i could see how that could put a lot of people uncomfortable and easily cross lines even if his intentions aren't to cross a line you know what i mean like he was like a hippie a little bit you know what i'm saying so this is truly the play i hate this ball because you're hating the player here right like yeah this guy you know like richard branson first of all the guy looks like he's always having a great time you ever watch this guy on necker island you go see these dudes videos i think that's part of the shtick yeah there's definitely like once the jeffrey epstein stuff came out you're like oh wait what are these really rich people doing on these islands like what's going on over here do i need to like you know like make a note you know tell my daughter like never ever go with a billionaire to an island like you know what i think that's a safe rule i think that's a safe rule right that's a good rule i'm down with that i'm gonna write that one down yeah put that on the refrigerator i'm okay with that one yeah so i i don't know like i don't know what he what wrong doing he's been accused of he's pretty inspiring as it goes and that's what i'm saying i don't know if there's any accusations i've got zero proof of anything i'm saying other than just one video and just a vibe it's just a vibe it's just an energy yeah you're coming in strong with a pretty wild uh wild portrayal of no but no i'm saying it's all energy i'm saying that there's zero proof other than this one video that i saw that's it that's all i'm saying um okay and the second one so there's this guy named naveen jane do you know who this guy is he's always on like the cover of ink and he's always on like these tony robbins things and he's incredibly charismatic he's got a good smile let me tell you about this guy so do you know anything about him i know a lot about him but i want you i want you i want you to say the story because i don't think most people know anything about him all right so even to this day he's considered a billionaire and he's like i said he's on the cover of all these magazines as this like wonderful entrepreneur so i'm going to give like a high level summary of his background so started at microsoft in 89 probably got wealthy from that uh in the early or mid to late 90s he started a company called infospace uh infospace went public and he eventually was worth like eight billion dollars what infospace dud did was it's kind of hard to explain because it's so old and we don't even use that anymore but like they like help to make like directories and um maps that you would put on your website so like just stuff that isn't even relevant anymore but it was just like a dot com uh business and the stock went public and crushed it was at 138 and then it completely crashed and in march of 2000 it was now worth a dollar 56. and infospace they use a ton of controversial uh accounting methodologies and so they said that they made 46 million dollars in profit but they got sued or and people got angry at them and because in reality they actually lost almost uh 300 million dollars and a ton of their employees filed suit along with a lot of their shareholders filed suit because they uh promised employees like different stock options and it just went to [ __ ] and it was kind of built on like a bunch of lies and a little bit of vaporware so that happens in 2003 he this guy jane is uh ordered to pay 250 million dollars for violations i don't know what uh sure i don't know if you i don't know if you said this but basically the the stockholders so the employees the stockholders they all lost their money but he ended up making out rich off of infospace you said that part or no no but yeah that was like the biggest part uh so like he sold a lot of his stock and he made a huge sum of money a lot of the other people did not right then after that he starts this other company have you heard of this other company called uh how do you pronounce it intellis intellius the best way to describe it and i think a lot of people know what this is but whenever you get like a scam phone number to your phone and you google it and you search on google and it says like which number came up and you type it in and it's like well and you get all these ads like for the background check of this person just entering their information and you inevitably enter in your mom and dad's information to see like oh have my parents ever been arrested let's find out and it says like well we found donna parr in missouri you could for only 18 you can get her criminal history report and you're tricked into buying a 19 a month subscription and i actually posted in a picture if you look at the picture on the doc of the actual scam but basically this company grew to be really big hundreds of millions in revenue and then it came out that they were getting sued constantly because consumers were like i didn't know that i was signing up for this and i've been getting billed twenty dollars a month twenty dollars yeah twenty dollar subscription i'm getting billed for because the font in like size two underneath the this check box said like by the way this is gonna charge you money every month yes and the actual landing page that i sent to you it's a screenshot and it says something like get ten dollars for giving us information about yourself but then also underneath that in a really small writing it says and after that we charge you 19 a month like for this and that and so it's pretty scammy now here the reason one of the reasons why he's on the cover of all these magazines is he's starting a company that helps uh mine minerals on different planets that sounds cool and everything but the fact that like he has had this history of of shadiness i think i'm not on board with that yeah so just to kind of like recap here i think the uh the story is he um he was found guilty of insider trading he then tried to sue his law firm saying you didn't provide me adequate legal coverage blah blah blah and then he ended up getting hit with a 247 million dollar uh i don't know if you've got 24 247 million dollars or he made 240 no he had to settle he had to pay he had to pay a hundred million dollars i think um i'm not i'm not 100 sure on that i gotta go look for that um and then antelius just sold to a private equity company after all that kind of like uh you know after all that that hot water um and then now is he so he's doing the moon mining thing i've seen that he and he has another thing that measures like you're you're i think it just like measures your poop doesn't it it's like your gut stuff and um i don't know much about that yeah yeah that one uh the you saw that one like the the fbi or somebody they get the whole company's got office got raided because the founders were like um you know like basically lying or cheating or some crime basically and then the founders got kicked out this company had raised a bunch of money um i don't know the exact story here let me let me look that up no i think you're thinking of biome versus volume oh okay and i think they did the exact same thing but uh so that's why i said i i thought the same thing i was like i remember this couple they looked like a couple and they got a couple okay so that's biome not vyam i think but that doesn't even matter i think that if you are like this prolific in terms of like even if you're accused this often of stuff it doesn't mean you did it but it means like hmm like why does this what's the common denominator here it's you right what's going on here yeah so anyway that's that's my list [Music] you

[Music] ari emanuel is the guy who runs runs uh wme which is what the show the who's the show entourage they based the character ari gold off of our emanuel so he's like this hot shot agent or whatever i've heard ari emmanuel in a couple articles they say that's what he does he'll call someone every single day until he gets what he wants and i think that's a i've been picking this up as a thing like i'll give you an example of you you you actually do this when we were like all right we're going to make like our own podcast studio it's like yeah cool idea and everybody kind of nods and okay what's one level better than that somebody's like oh you know i'll take charge of it i'll come up with a plan and then that person usually goes around asking what the budget should be like you know they kind of push the ball forward nudge it forward with their toe and then somebody else is like okay i'm going to get this done and i'm going to get this done in two weeks which seems like aggressive right you go from no studio to a fully functioning podcast studio no i'm like let's go yeah you were like okay what are you doing right now and i was like i'm on the phone with you and you're like cool what are you gonna do like right after this you ready to go i'll kick i'll pick you up and i was like what uh i guess i could find a babysitter for my child and like i guess i could and so we and then all of a sudden an hour later i'm in the car with you we're driving to [ __ ] ikea and you walk in and you're like hey um ikea guy we need like an awesome studio couch and he's like okay and you're like um here's 500 in cash where do i spend this like to get the couch and they were like what the [ __ ] is going on it's a different level of intensity and sure enough by like the next day we had those two red couches that were like you're like i need a couch you got a vision you're like i need a couch yeah that's gonna pop in the thumbnail of a youtube video and so like i want it to look like this and then we had it and you're like cool you know our accounting person is gonna paint the room today and then like you know this next person's gonna do this and like all of a sudden like the world just bent to your will and i'll have another i'll give you another example me and my buddy suli we invest in this company and i put 50k in he put slowly put like 100k in and so we were like all right great um now a couple months go by and we're like dude these guys like are they what are they doing and so we like check in with them and like nine months later and we're like hey what's the latest and they were kind of like you know doing their thing but they they weren't they didn't have like a clear plan and they wanted to raise money so they were like asking us for intros and we were like cool send us your deck and they sent us the deck it sucked and we were like hey guys this deck kind of sucks like i don't want to make intros like let's work on your deck and they're like oh thank you we'd love some help so we get on a call and we get on a call before we get on the call okay that was like they're like let's do a call your what times are free for you next week silly goes i'm free in like 45 minutes can you get to can you get to a computer by then and they're like uh yeah in the 45 minutes between then he sent three emails with like slide one this sucks slide three what is this picture this is stupid side five present it this way slide nine and he just had it but like before the meeting he'd done the meeting then we get into the meeting and he's like all right guys i sent you guys a bunch of stuff uh like let's open up powerpoint right now and just fix it and they were fixing it and he's like okay cool um there's like these three things that are missing um like all right let's do a call like in four hours with the deck fixed with those three things that we're missing and um let's do this call every morning and every afternoon we're gonna do two calls a day for the next five days or until this deck is amazing and these guys are just like what and i was also like are they what's the reason what's the result of that well they've they've gone on to raise money though honestly the result of that was i think by day four they were just sort of like i hate you like we disagree or like you know this is just too much for us they kind of like backed off and we're just like because by the end of that we were like not only does your deck need to change your business strategy needs to change because like the deck can only just tell a great business story but you don't actually have a great business story so we need to fix that too and like you know and it was like we were are kind of like you know the delivery wasn't the softest so i don't think they loved the calls at first it was like wow this is really constructive feedback and by the end i think they were just beating down and like like was dan was dan porter a guy who took it to a level 12. is that what you're saying that how he pushed so he told me the stories of ari doing it he told me a story of richard branson doing it and then he had stories of him doing it he was like because we were asking about the milk road he reads the milk road every morning and so we were like all right you know what would you do about this and this and this how did you do that early days of his latest project so i should introduce that so he after the wme thing he's like he started this new company called overtime which i don't know if you've which has like taken over the world but i don't even entirely know what it is but like their social handles are all over the place they're huge on social so basically it's like if you're into bat i started with basketball now they have like football and other things but it started with basketball and basically what they did was they just create like a media company but instead of the way like okay espn is a tv channel and then like bleacher report and others were websites and then there were some newsletters and these guys were like no we're just gonna be like an instagram account and we're just gonna become the biggest instagram account for basketball culture and uh what does that mean it's like crazy dunks like high school prospects that's really where they like found their foothold was they were like okay forget the nba like like hoops culture they're really interested like who are the next who's the next lebron and it turns out there was this kid zion williamson who was this like tank looking guy in south carolina that people had heard of he's got a cool name called zion the guys built like a [ __ ] you know crunch bar right and then he can fly like he's like you know he's like a flying bus and so a crunch yeah like a double crunch i would have thought like thicker than a snicker but all right we're gonna go i'm not perfect okay um so he so they started so they were like okay they put up a video of this guy and it was like it immediately went viral he's like okay cool people want to know about zion espn they're not sending a reporter down to like greenville south carolina to like cover this guy's high school game against west bishop baptist like it's like but we can do that and so he he basically and he said this thing when he when i was talking to him he was a very calm guy but he had that that level 12 intensity i could tell because he goes he goes i decided i was going to do this and then i just applied my will against it and i was like only somebody who is like knows they're a force of nature would even say something like that he wasn't pitching me he wasn't selling me he was just i was trying to figure out how the [ __ ] did you build this into like a household name in such a short period of time and i've seen so many people how do they and how do they make money do you know uh they have a couple different ways so i think they have like you know probably like sponsors or whatever but they now have their own basketball league so he's like he basically created his own version of like a like a instead of the ncaas it's like you can come play in the overtime league so right now he's like living in atlanta where they're doing the season and like and i told him i was like dude you look like a high school science teacher well yeah so if you if you guys look up dan porter when i hung out with him he was like dressed cool and he looked like the cool guy but he looked more he's more similar to malcolm gladwell that he was a basketball fan yeah yeah yeah yeah he's more of a gladwell than an x that's for sure like you would never think this is the guy that's like steering you know street culture and hoops culture at the grassroots level but he is he really is like maybe he would have launched a poetry league over a basketball league and i asked him i was like no actually i love football and i was like what and he's like yeah you know like and so he told me about the approach that he took of like he's like i was at wme and um he's like you know i i we heard these stats which was basically like the foot the nfl was really worried because they're like kids choose their favorite team and league at like um age 10 or 12. um and then that's like who they're a fan of for life it's like that's my team i think that's my player and then like they're fan of them for like decades and he's like then we've asked like how do you decide is it because of the city you're from or whatever and they're like no madden like whoever's the most fun to play in madden or like whoever's colors i like and he's like oh [ __ ] and the nfl was also like oh [ __ ] and the local sports owners were like oh [ __ ] because if if every kid in philadelphia isn't growing up an eagles fan if they just like michael vick cause he's fast in the game of bad and then like that's a fan we just didn't get they're not gonna buy tickets jerseys they're not gonna like come to the games like this is not gonna work the model will break at that point and then also tv networks were like yeah kids aren't watching tv so um like we gotta figure something else out what are they doing they're playing video games they're on social media they're on instagram they're on tick-tock and so his theory was like oh okay so we need to build the sports media brand on those networks and then we just have to find the thing that clicked and what clicked for them was these like young up and coming basketball players um and then he like came up with the craziest like they would basically he's like all right we need um the clips like we need those clips faster than anybody else and so they came up with crazy ideas like crazy ideas which was like they would find they would in their social media they would be like hey who lives in like south carolina we need a photographer so like the number one zion clip submitter to them these clips that got millions and millions of views basically built their brand which is like a multi-hundred million dollar brand now was done by a guy who was like i think like a plumber on like weekdays and he would go to the games and like the number two clip submitter was a student at zion school who had broke his leg and because he was in a wheelchair they put him like courtside every game like instead of going up in the bleachers so he had like the best spot and so that guy was submitting like these amazing clips on his iphone and like that's what was going viral right away and then he's like espn or whatever would hit us up and they'd be like hey um like can we license your videos we'll pay you for this license like it'll be like getty images and he was like [ __ ] me dude i don't want to build getty and he's like how about this hpn you can have it for free you just have to tag us and put our watermark on it and they're like idiot done and so then they ended up promoting the [ __ ] out of overtime like overtime was everywhere because of that it was like seen as incredible because it was on espn all the time [Music] you

[Music] they are buying like can we talk about what they bought they've come on the pod before uh and they're pretty public about stuff so they're buying companies like cool pool construction companies so it's like uh you know pools are this like amazing business that you could you could do and they bought one and like i think it's called dolphin pools or something like that they bought it in arizona it crushes it they hired this one operator who's like really good who took it over from the original owner the boomer owner and basically it's grown like crazy and that's like one of their cash cows now and i uh and they also bought a internet web like um i got in the country like they don't have like a t or time warner or whatever they they have like local providers and they bought one of those and it's doing well and i have family members so my dad is an entrepreneur like five as kids they bought five different yeah a bunch of internet service providers and they're all doing i think pretty good um and so my dad owns a small business that none of his family is taking over my father-in-law owns a small business who and it is really it's a killer business i mean um and they uh he somehow the uh our new brother-in-law is now gonna take it over and seeing the turmoil that he had to go through in order to he was like well i spent 40 years building this thing and i guess if no one that i love wants it i'm just going to shut it down and it was like kind of tragic and it's like i'm literally willing to give this to a family member and they can make many millions of dollars a year if they wanted to do this it's just it's free you could have it and people didn't want to do it and so i've seen this process and it is like an emotional it's it's a really is it's a huge challenge and this is very a very interesting market there's some stats about how many do you know how many boomers are retiring and like that's like some absurd number it's absurd it's like it's like it's like a quarter of the country like or or a third of the country biggest wealth transfers of all time is about to happen it's the like that that group of people when they pass down their hair it's gonna it's like many trillions of dollars i think i don't know if that's that might be hyperbole but i think it's something like that some ridiculous number and then that's like a lot of people that are just not gonna have to work but also don't know what to do with it and similarly there's many many businesses that was when enduring first pitched it they were like they just showed me the stats they're like there are this many boomer businesses where they want to retire they don't want to run their business anymore and their kids don't want to take it over and like those businesses are up for grabs and they're like too small like they're not sexy as a startup and they're too small for big private equity and so we're going to be like basically like permanent equity where they're going to be they're just going to buy it and hold these amazing businesses for a very long time and they keep doing that one after another uh like i think sieve and xavier they've rolled up like almost 100 million dollars of business equity off of a two million dollar starting equity amount like we [Laughter] it is crazy i i invested in what i didn't have a lot of money when i first invested in so but at the time it was like 10 or 15 000 or something like that that i invested it was like that was a big deal it's just been like it's just been growing and growing and growing no so they so they were like they're like sean like you've helped us like think through this idea and like they do like i like this stuff i'll be helpful along the way so they're like you know we want to offer you like if you invest we'll also offer you like an inves an advisor or like like an advisory grant that'll just match your investment and uh and i think they thought i was gonna do like you forgot to file the paperwork no no no i think they thought i was gonna put in like 25k or like max or like 20k something like that so they're like okay cool you got like 20k of equity we'll give you 20k worth of advisory shares but i was like a big believer in what they were doing so i put in 200 000 and then they were like they're like oh and i was like look you don't have to like i get it you don't have to give me 200 000 of advisor shares but xavier was like nope a deal's a deal and um like i was like we didn't sign anything and like dude i'm totally okay with it but he's like no like like we will we'll honor that and also like i know you'll like you'll deliver and so since then i've had this like immense desire to deliver on that it was actually the best thing he ever did because he got me to basically work for him for free uh for this one like for this act of goodwill i am like i will i see your goodwill and i raise you ten times goodwill on my own side it's gonna that's gonna end up being a great one of your better investments i would think depending on i don't know when you got in if were you with very we both were you both yes then that's gonna i think it's gonna crash exactly like i think already let's say conservatively that's probably up 20x you know like something like that in valuation you think that's up 20x because if they go raise now they basically have i don't know exact numbers but like somewhere between 25 to 50 million of revenue closer to 50 million in revenue from these businesses now um that they've acquired off of 2 million [Music] you

Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) talk about helping doctors make more money, and how to make money my helping boomers who are looking to retire.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Music] can i pitch you two ideas and you tell me which one you like better all right these are two kind of like side hustle ideas that i think could turn into something big but they're businesses that are not hard to do they would immediately make somewhere between 500k to two two and a half million dollars probably within a year or a year or two of your business of doing it profit i like that all right so the first one is i'm gonna call it um baller doctors okay what's baller doctors baller doctors is you're gonna go to med schools all around the country and you're gonna put [ __ ] you know ads slash flyers up and you're gonna say hey before you graduate do you wanna know how doctors become millionaires um you know faster you know some you know the average doctor becomes a millionaire in 12 years i can show you how it's done in five and you basically host a seminar and you you definitely lean into the get-rich-quick stuff because you know people are curious but you you build in enough trust but you don't bury the lead you're like look even doctors are greedy even doctors agreed even doctors like money might be the the better name for the seminar um and and you're going to host a seminar and basically you're just going to break down the business of most doctors spend all their times with their all their time with head and you know heads buried in books and think about customer you know patient care as they should but at the end of the day a lot of these guys want to go out they want to own their own practice or they want to figure out should i be joining a practice should i go to a hospital should i um you know start my own how do i get the money to do that how much money did this make and i think if somebody just made a sort of business in a box uh seminar where they just explained look here's how it usually goes you put in this much it takes you this long here's a sample p l with what your costs look like here's how you make money in your practice route here's how you could do a group practice here's how you join a if you join a hospital here's where you are after five years um like did you know this by the way if you're a doctor and you work in a non-profit which most hospitals are non-profits for 10 years all of your student loans that's amazing same if you're a lawyer if your my sister did it if you're a lawyer for uh the government you get a lot of you get for loan forgiveness right so basically you just do like a personal finance slash business crash course for doctors and you do that all around the country and then some percentage of those they actually are going to go to you for like you can create there's they'll pay for the session or they'll pay for like the upsell so you might do the session for free and then you say by the way i have like the detailed guide with all of the business like templates in the in this thing uh you know plus like you know whatever i got all your i got all your docs and templates and it's all fleshed out in detail this is you know four thousand dollars and you know you could buy that mastermind thing and with it comes like a coaching call whenever you're ready you can always you can always hit me up and i'll help you with this stuff all right that's business one i could play off this so let me tell you about this so there's this blog that i read it's called the white coat investor have you heard of it not that but i'm in a facebook group called white code investors which is i think probably the same thing it's dr doctor's investments so if you go to it you'll see it's a little uh stale like it's probably been around for a while and it gets a lot of traffic i read it because if they just talk about people earning high income and like the like the lifestyle and i just it's fun and a lot of my doctor friends read it and it's incredibly under monetized and interestingly you know how much traffic i looked at this sheet like 400 000 a month oh my god i mean look at this thing maybe six maybe six hundred thousand maybe maybe more i think a lot but if you look at the draw the traffic source it's like a good ass mix yeah it's like six hundred thousand should we bleep this out this is a gem bro this is a gym why are we why are we giving this gym oh here here let's find out how much traffic here's how you do it so you go to the very bottom you see where it says advertise with us click it oh man this is amazing so they get um a million page views a month so i think and interestingly if you go to um i looked at the stats for the fastest growing youtube creators this year as well as the fastest growing tick tock creators and something like three of the top 10 were dentists and then a couple other were doctors and it's usually young doctors who talk who make jokes and lifestyle content on tick tock all about like the doctor lifestyle so they make jokes out like you and i probably don't understand but i don't know maybe like a joke about like sleeping at the hospital or something um and they they've gotten millions of follow followers so i think there's a world where you could do that and sell a high-end membership that's thousands of dollars and do exactly what you're saying i like i completely agree with you i think this could be a good business i don't think you could do it i think it'd be real if you did it full-time you maybe could do it in a year but uh yeah it's a this is a good business you're part of a white coat investor yeah i'm looking at their facebook group you're part of this facebook yeah i love joining random niche facebook groups like this and just see 77 000 members i can i i would bet my life i could make three to five million dollars a year with a facebook group for doctor investors oh it's a okay listen it's even better it's a closed facebook group that gives physicians dentists physical therapists attorneys uh pharmacists and other similar high come high income professionals uh it basically helps them but dude how did you get into this did you tell them that you're a lawyer yeah i just said i was a doctor but look at me i look like obviously because you're indian yeah that's awesome this is uh i agree with you winning winning ideas so if somebody wants to make a play on this white code investor site i would love to you know buy this website and do something with it or if somebody wants to make a group that's like this and go for it uh dm me or email me or email sam uh and let's let's this is a good one yeah and he they also have conferences so they have a uh a uh white coat investor conference right um it's a this is a good this is i completely agree with you you know who could have crushed this niche and they didn't want to was our buddy uh what's the youtuber ollie uh what's his last name yeah he could have done this yeah i agree um yeah he chose like a worse market he's like i'll teach people how to become you like youtubers how to be better at youtube like teach doctors how to be better at money like way better way better if you if you if you're not passionate about the other one all right okay second all right so it sounds like you like the first one here's the second idea the family i would say i love the first family legacy summit okay so basically there's a huge number of businesses that are owned by you know kind of like boomer generation that they would love if their kids would take on their business and like kind of grow it kids maybe maybe interested maybe not the kid kind of feels like i should i guess that's a smart move but i just don't care about you know where the you know making treadmills or whatever we do you know like our family business um so they're kind of one foot in one foot out but but even then they're like okay the parent's like all right no problem you don't have to take it over but like i gotta do something with this and you should know how this works in case i croak and like you know you should know how the books work and like you should know some things so basically what you do is through some kind of cold outreach to uh boomerang businesses you're gonna offer them an invite to the family legacy summit it is a two-day conference in florida where you're going to have it's got to be orlando or jort lauderdale exactly um like you know for obvious reasons the local george lauderdale or orlando yeah we get it there's gotta be a buffet understood exactly the family legacies of it all you can eat of course yeah with new balance white sneakers as a sponsor out loud [Laughter] yeah sunday loungewear no socks no service you gotta have your socks basically you invite people out there and it's just education it's just a give give give maybe there's some ticket thing to cover the calls maybe of sponsors i think you could cover the whole cost of sponsors but it's just invite only your business has to be of a certain level of maturity so it's you know doing over a million dollars a year you're a family business who's thought about this question of should we pass it down or not you and your kids come out so they come out and at that you're going to do a couple things this is now this is now the door that opens more doors so you could upsell them some services so estate planning accounting uh whatever that sort of thing you could um offer like upsell masterminds or like a kind of a master's program which is like for the kid to like take it over or whatever something like that you could uh just buy businesses that like uh the kid's not gonna do it this is lead gen for amazing businesses that you could potentially buy out and you sell those leads to private equity or you buy them yourself and um and yeah it's a way to build a power network in like one year you'd have like some amazing connections because there's going to be a guy who owns you know a fur you know wood a wood furniture company in tennessee that makes 22 million dollars a year and like those people you'll be your buddies because you're actually helping them with like one of their core life problems that they have which is what do i do with my business and this like stinking kid who's not not taking action do you remember brent bayshore he came on our pod um what's his what's the name of his thing permanent equity i think something equity permanent equity he's based out of columbia missouri he has this conference every year called capital camp which is a great name uh and how is he doing he's basically doing this is it well he's buying boomer businesses how's that going i think it's going phenomenal i think it's going absolutely great and our friend sieva of which i think we're both investors enduring ventures is doing a similar thing um it's maybe it's a little bit smaller but it's just new also newer yeah and they are buying like can we talk about what they bought they've come on the pod before uh and they're pretty public about stuff so they're buying companies like cool uh pool construction companies so it's like uh you know pools are this like amazing business that you could you could do and they bought one in like things called dolphin pools or something like that they bought it in arizona it crushes it they hired this one operator who's like really good who took it over from the the original owner the boomer owner and basically it's grown like crazy and that's like one of their cash cows now and i uh and they also bought a internet web like um i got in the country like they don't have like a t or time warner or whatever they they have like local providers and they bought one of those and it's doing well and i have family members so my dad is an entrepreneur they bought five different yeah a bunch of internet service providers and they're all doing i think pretty good um and so my dad owns a small business that none of his family is taking over my father-in-law owns a small business who and it is a really it's a killer business i mean um and they uh he somehow the uh our new brother-in-law is now gonna take it over and seeing the turmoil that he had to go through in order to he was like well i spent 40 years building this thing and i guess if no one that i love wants it i'm just going to shut it down and it was like kind of tragic and it's like i'm literally willing to give this to a family member and they can make many millions of dollars a year if they wanted to do this it's just it's free you could have it and uh people didn't want to do it and so i've seen this process and it is like an emotional it's a really it's a huge challenge and this is very a very interesting market there's some stats about how many do you know how many boomers are retiring and like that's some absurd number it's absurd it's like it's like it's like a quarter of the country like or or a third of the country biggest wealth transfers of all time is about to happen it's the like that that group of people when they pass down their hair it's gonna it's like many trillions of dollars i think i don't know if that's that might be hyperbole but i think it's something like that some ridiculous number and then that's like a lot of people that are just not gonna have to work but also don't know what to do with it and similarly there's many many businesses that was when enduring first pitched it they were like they just showed me the stats they were like there are this many boomer businesses where they want to retire they don't want to run their business anymore and their kids don't want to take it over and like those businesses are up for grabs and they're like too small like they're not sexy as a startup and they're too small for big private equity and so we're going to be like basically like permanent equity where they're going to be they're just going to buy it and hold these amazing businesses for a very long time and they keep doing that one after another uh like i think sieve and xavier they've rolled up like almost 100 million dollars of business equity off of a two million dollar starting equity amount like we [Laughter] it is crazy i i invested in what i didn't have a lot of money when i first invested in so but at the time it was like 10 or 15 000 i or something like that that i invested it was like that that was a big deal let me tell you what happened it's just been like it's just been growing and growing and growing no so they so they were like they're like sean like you've helped us like think through this idea and like they do like i like the stuff i'll be helpful along the way so they're like you know we want to offer you like if you invest we'll also offer you like an invest an advisor or like like an advisory grant that'll just match your investment and uh and i think they thought i was gonna do like you forgot to file the paperwork no no no i think they thought i was gonna put in like 25k or like max or like 20k something like that so they're like okay cool you get like 20k of equity we'll give you 20k worth of advisory shares but i was like a big believer in what they were doing so i put in 200 000 and then they were like they're like oh and i was like look you don't have to like i get it you don't have to give me 200 000 of advisor shares but xavier was like nope a deal's a deal and um like i was like we didn't sign anything and like dude i'm totally okay with it but he's like no like like we will we'll honor that and also like i know you'll like you'll deliver and so since then i've had this like immense desire to deliver on that it was actually the best thing he ever did because he got me to basically work for him for free uh for this one like for this act of goodwill i am like i will i see your goodwill and i raise you ten times goodwill on my own side it's gonna that's gonna end up being a great one of your better investments i would think depending on i don't know when you got in if were you with very we both were you both yes then that's going to i think it's going to crash exactly like i think already let's say conservatively that's probably up 20 x you know like something like that in valuation you think that's up 20x because if they go raise now they basically have i don't know exact numbers but like somewhere between 25 to 50 million of revenue closer to 50 million in revenue from these businesses now um that they've acquired off of 2 million in equity [Music] you

[Music] tailgate guys have you ever heard of this business no so this this came up at farm con so i go to this dinner with this guy he listens to the pod and he was telling me i was like you know uh i was trying to make small talk at this dinner where i was like okay i hate normal small talk like i'm not just gonna oh yeah how's the conference going good yeah good how about you good good and i also don't know anything about farming so like it's not relevant to me so you know okay i can ask them a bunch of questions you like corn too yeah exactly you know i don't have much to add so what's your favorite type of corn so i was a bit of an ice breaker i was like um i was like first job like what's your first first job first first first i don't know i asked did you have a side hustle in college and uh i went around the table i was like did you have a side because everybody was doing something different now and they're all established now but did you when you were in college have a side hustle and everybody had an interesting one so this i put that in my question bank of like ah interesting uh you know fun little convo when you're in a in a kind of entrepreneurial group so one guy tells the story he goes yeah dude i um i think he went to like ole miss or like what alabama or like one of these like southern football colleges and he's like i created a um like tailgate in a box it's like what he's basically like yeah like tailgating is huge before the football game people go to the parking lot they want to grill and drink and play beer pong and do all the stuff and um he's like you know for he's like my family used to like to do it so he's like first my family it was so competitive so you had to go wait like kind of overnight to get your spot he's like so they would send me i'd have to go down to the i forgot what was called the grove or something like that and i'd have to wait in the parking lot and hold my family spot then i started to be like okay cool you got the spot well like well you got to set up the tailgate for us like come on we need a tables for beer pong and we need this and that so he's like okay i'll get the stuff every week and i'll go do it and he would create a good setup and then the space next to him was like hey dude can we next week can we just will you set ours up and he's like all right uh give me like 200 bucks i'll get you guys some stuff like yeah sure and then the price goes up and he's like oh my i can basically charge each little tailgating square like each little group of friends 500 to just set up a cool tailgate spot for them turnkey tailgating and so he did this at his college and he's like dude i was making thousands and thousands of dollars every semester running this um and i was like is it i googled tailgate guys did it get acquired so so that was their competitor so there was a nationwide version of this he was doing this at small scale that was his college side hustle just to make a little bit of money he's like yeah tailgate guys tried to come in but uh they couldn't break into our market like we owned our market and i was like who's tailgate guys he's like oh these guys basically took this idea and they started doing it nationwide and i was like that's really smart he goes yeah but how does it work do you have like you just hire college kids and you say we'll give you 50 50 an hour for three hours on saturday we get 50 you get 50. exactly and then do they do the kids go to like walmart and buy the stuff i think either you give them the supplies in bulk or um or they have to go grab it and you tell them hey you need to get this table and these bowls and this beer this whatever and you use like a company credit card exactly something that has exactly and so tailgate guy and what they do the key is they would partner with the school they would say hey we'd like to be the exclusive tailgate provider for the school and the school would give them the license and so they had a monopoly and i was like what and it's like yeah actually this is pretty common that schools will basically pick one vendor provider they'll sell the license rights basically they'll let you become the official you know north carolina you know you know the tar heels you call it tar heel tailgate and it's like their thing and you pay them a fee or a revenue share of what's going on but in exchange you get a monopoly you get to be the only provider of this [ __ ] and it's like super viral right because you're just like everybody sees wow that setup looks not bootleg what is that oh they use tailgate guys or whatever okay cool we should use them next time and uh so tailgate guys apparently like i think they got bought out by private equity or something but they um they were doing like i don't know 30 to 50 million dollars a year doing this what and um and i thought what a great example of a college hustle that you then scale up you say all right if this works at my college it's going to work at every college and every college that has a football program that has tailgating and then we have this repeatable sales model of going to the university and we tell them hey these other eight universities partnered with us we'd like to partner with you you get extra income and we will provide a safe uh you know convenient way for your your fans to do this i thought that's pretty this is a really cool little niche business and then i started thinking well what are the other ones what are the other businesses that use the same sales tactic of basically partnering with the school and becoming the exclusive provider so we had a little mini brain mini because the guy listens to the podcast so we had like a mini brainstorm session at dinner where he's like dude this is happening also with scooters uh when like bird and lime came out in cities companies decided oh shoot we should become the exclusive scooter provider on campus like we'll go drop these scooters all everywhere it'll be branded by this with the school the school will get a rev share for every scooter ride that happens and we get a captive market that nobody can compete with us in and so this started happening with scooters and i was like oh damn what else could be done because scooters is cool because it's a new category right tailgating worked because it was a new category so you just have to think about like what's something today that they don't even really have a um like an option for like they're not really there isn't really like a market for it [Music] you

it's it's rooted in like trauma like just fear it bothers me so much like for example um cometier coffee um i they sent me some for free it's so good but it's a dollar fifty per cup and compare that to like you being coffee i'm like a dollar fifty sometimes i don't even drink the whole thing and so like i've been really struggling with like is that worth it is this worth it [Music] can i tell you something uh interesting i saw so um the one the 0.01 rule so nathan barry came on the pod and he was cool so he's the the founder of convertkit he came on he was telling us about some blog posts that either he's written or the other different that he liked so i went back and i read one of them and i saw this thing called the 0.01 percent rule have you seen this no okay so he's pretty amazing i'm gonna pull up this uh where's the blog 0.1 rule wealth let me see if i can pull it up here um okay i'm not gonna be able to find it real quick here but i'll put the link in ben if you can find it or search nathan barry wealth ladder 0.01 so basically the way the guys think he's like he's like you know um he's like he talks about price sensitivity he's sort of like you know as you get more rich you um you know the way you think about money should change right this is like when i came to your house and you had like cvs receipts in the glove compartment because you're like saving them for like the three dollar thing you're like hell yeah and i was like dude you just sold your company for like many many millions of dollars uh what are you doing with these cvs receipts you're like i just like to do it it's a habit and so this guy talks about like the richer you get um you should sort of he's like he's like this works for when you sell something to somebody or yourself as you get to that level basically below 0.01 percent of your net worth so that's you take your net worth you multiply by 0.000 whatever you know one so it's like uh 0.01 of your net worth so let's say you're worth um let's do 100 million so 100 million what is it times what use five billion right they'll use a little bit more of a approachable number here so um so that would be five hundred dollars for if you have five million dollars a net worth five hundred dollars at the threshold below which you don't really feel it you don't really care or feel it you can become a little bit price insensitive below that point so that might be like you know opting for the you know the nicer hotel or like you just really don't give a [ __ ] you can just ball out at a restaurant you really don't care uh and so he draws this little curve and he's like at um at the first level of wealth it's like he calls it like level zero level one of wealth where it's like you know your 0.01 is like a hundred dollars or less than a hundred dollars at that point a million dollars yeah a million dollars would be a hundred bucks yeah so he's like you know at that point like you know if you're at the grocery store and something costs an extra dollar like you care you don't want to buy the eggs that cost 1.99 more you care he's like then the next level the next jump up is you're like well i don't care at like you know it's the way he draws the chart it's like what are restaurant prices then the next one's like what are vacation prices like you don't even really care about how much your vacations cost the next one is like you you know you could fly first class and then the final one is like you know or the next one's like you can buy a crazy house you know you don't really get you're not really feeling uh house prices as much and then the final one is like you know what are prices anyways like you know this is when you're worth over 100 million dollars like at that point most things don't cost anything to you and um you're pretty insensitive to the cost of it so i'm sort of summarizing the idea the exact you know you can quibble about what you should or shouldn't care about but i thought it was kind of an interesting number and the reason i bring it up is very few people that i know are like properly price sensitive so there's a lot of people i know like my dad who no matter how wealthy they've got like these sort of like the trauma of not having money is so deeply ingrained in his body that like you know starbucks he's just like he's like pissed off when they charge even if he buys the coffee it like he's angry at the price he's like oh my god 4.99 like i could make this for so much less and they're like sir you're welcome to do that and he's like oh like what's going on and you know he's anchored to prices from like the 80s when like you know that's where like he thought movie tickets should cost x and also you know it just like hurts him to spend more than some amount regardless of what's in his bank account and so he's kind of on one side of the spectrum too cheap and then there's another side spectrum which we're more where i am where it's like dude you should really kind of pay attention to this you're kind of spending like pretty crazy and uh you know completely price insensitive is on the other side and then there's like whatever the sweet spot is and then school they don't really teach you how to how to like gauge that or what what those kind of like what even should be a good number for this what should i spend on things so you you don't get nervous like i i freak out a little because as an entrepreneur like some years i just like knock it out the park and make so much money other years i make nothing uh i mean hopefully i don't think nothing will ever happen again but like there's times you don't get nervous about running out no actually like two months ago i was like oh my god i have like no cash left no cash on hand left i was i was investing in everything i saw i was putting money into startups and to crypto into stuff i was then i was spending a bunch like my payroll expanded and i was like oh my god i have like so little cash i thought that way too it was under i had 60 grand in cash and i was like i feel low yeah i think it was like 38 000 was in my like whatever wells fargo checking account i was like where'd all the money go this was like and i was like oh yeah i guess and i looked at the like out outgoing thing and it was like it's not that my spending had gone up i was really just investing a lot of money but i was like wow i should uh i need to manage cash for most of the time for me it's like i need to send my invoices for like things you know like i was like all right i'm gonna teach a course and i'm gonna invoice you know for the podcast and i'm gonna like do the things that bring in like cash today versus most of the things i invest my money into are like long-term illiquid things or my own businesses right like uh maybe i should take a withdrawal out of my business and like put money in my bank account and so so you know it was just like a reminder of that but no i don't really get too worried about that um and maybe you know again i think i'm too far on the dial of like willing to spend on whatever ramit safety this is pretty much what his entire uh not course but his entire image and content is about which is like he's got this podcast where two people couples argue like we have we're worth three million dollars and he got into a fight with me because i spent eighty dollars on this silly thing and ramit's all about that it's i have i'm more like your father than i am like you like and i think it's just rooted it's it's rooted in like trauma like just fear uh i've got the same thing we're just like it's like it bothers me so much like for example um cometeer coffee um i they sent me some for free it's so good but it's a dollar fifty per cup and compare that to like you being coffee i'm like a dollar fifty sometimes i don't even drink the whole thing and so like i've been really struggling with like is that worth it is this worth it or the backsplash on my sink in my kitchen we need to replace it and it's eight hundred dollars and i've been fretting over it for over a year now i'm like ugh eight hundred dollars to replace that i can't so even though it will add value to the home and also make me happier i understand why your dad thinks that way it's really it's real i think it's challenging when you're it's like it's like you know it's proper trauma i think of like you felt one way for years and now you suddenly like things are different yeah maybe we actually need money therapy uh money therapy specifically i think that's actually a good idea here so therapy is this broad thing that has like a bunch of associations with it and mostly it's like stigmas and blah blah blah i think somebody needs to spin off and remember it sounds like he's kind of doing this which is just a great idea financial therapy um and it's like yeah have a money coach or you know you probably need to switching therapy to coach is the hack to like oh i'm focusing on performance and not like uh you know fixing a pr broken part of me uh but in reality it's that i tried finding people like this and when i met them i was like look we're just getting knowledgeable not a financial advisor different thing no i know when i go i would go to therapy for a lot and i would and i would go when i whenever i was trying out a new therapist i'd be like so i'm not going to like i'm not trying to sound like a douche or big-headed but like i'm a high achiever like i want to like conquer the world and like do cool [ __ ] and so i don't want to talk like this is this is the the place that i'm coming from like i'm high octane baby can can we can we make this happen do you have the tools necessary or no or do you like specialized just in like you know like traditional way what were you really trying to tell her you were trying to tell her that my problems are not like i'm not broken i'm trying to like just achieve a higher level of success or were you trying to tell me what i'm going to have a player therapist is that what you were trying to ask her what were you trying to ask him no the blunt way to explain it is i've got rich i'm i'm complaining about some rich people problems okay and like i'm just like mostly just insecure about certain things and i want to like use that to like conquer the world i'm not very good on twitter yeah and like i'm gonna complain about stuff that sounds super weak because like on outside like everything's going great but i need you to like empathize that like i'm trying to like go places and i don't need you to tell me that like well you made a million dollars that last year isn't that good enough like no dog that's not like i need you to understand like what like what's at stake here you know what i mean i said what is at stake here that's like you're better i'm gonna be i'm gonna be i'm gonna be your money therapist but you know what i mean like it's so like i would be people and i'm like oh you've only worked with like a certain type of person you have like i don't think you unders i don't think you'll be able to help me yeah yeah exactly i know what you mean it's the reason tony robbins gets paid a million dollars plus per client because it's like his clients are serena williams and ray dalio and you know or whoever he's crazy yeah and he himself is successful and his other clients are you know objectively very successful but everybody everybody um you know can improve the you know the little voice in their head [Music] you

so i started angel investing almost one year ago well i i did it five or eight companies personally before that i forget and a couple of them have turned out to be like meaningful like turning 20 grand into like 300 400 500 000 and i'm like holy [ __ ] this is how it works and like but like it it sucks for a while right because you just invest it you're like well that's money's gone and you don't ever hear about them and then you're like oh nice it works and so i'm like in some of those cases those are huge markups in other cases i'm just now experiencing like two and three and four x markups and i'm like that's awesome what would happen if that was had i invested in this company at a 10 million valuation instead of a 50 million evaluation that would have been wild [Music] i've noticed that your angel investing is on a tear our friend suli just said whatever sean what did he what did he say whatever sean joke he was like oh i got this new brilliant investment strategy uh sean invests in something and then he tells me about it two weeks to two months later and then i paid 10x price for the same item for the same company yeah it was great which is and he's like he was joking obviously obviously that's not great he's like making fun of himself because that's literally what's happened in like i think six or eight deals now where i'll i'll even tell him about it but he just delays responding for a couple weeks or i forget to tell them and i tell them or he tells me about the company a few months later i'm like oh yeah i invested in that he's like awesome can you make an intro and i make the intro and but the price has gone up like dramatically because the company has more traction or more whatever so that's what he was joking about but how are you getting such good [ __ ] um i don't know like dude it's amazing so i feel like there's i think the easy answer is oh cool i do this podcast and because of this podcast people come inbound right the bigger this podcast gets the more people uh want you to invest and there's this great um thing my buddy vishal taught me when she goes startups are the only asset class like real estate doesn't work this way stock market like in real estate if you want to buy it you go buy it if you want stock if you want to buy it you go buy it startups are the only thing where even if you want in you don't just get in the security selects you the asset selects you just as much as you're selecting the asset and that one insight is pretty important it basically means you need to build your brand and your like reputation so that people want you in deals um because the best deals are all like kind of like super competitive to get into um and you want people to when they're first thinking of an idea to reach out to you because they know oh you know like for example i did a great deal recently and it's so funny you're going to hate this it's going to piss you off so much you've been talking about short-term rentals somebody came to me with a short-term rental startup idea because they thought i was you or something or somebody who was like hey bro why didn't you say that to me well the by the way the subject line that she reached out with was last one in it was like hey i have the smallest bit of allocation left in this a company called motherboard you'll love it because it's it's literally exactly what you're doing you should get it i'll enter you you will get in uh but but basically what they're doing is you if you own a bunch of airbnbs which is kind of like a new market uh it's basically like you're a property manager so you're more than just renting out your home or one home so you have multiple properties but you're not a traditional property manager who owns a multi-family you know like uh building of like 32 units and so this is for people who run multiple airbnbs and it's just like it makes your life way easier as the as the owner of that and they have like few million dollars in recurring revenue the valuation was great founder was really impressive so i was like oh yeah great sas software for people who manage multiple vacation rentals and then you're over here building short sam short-term rental club building this community doing this thing and i got the benefit because people thought i was you that's that's one answer the piss you off answer that's ridiculous that is a piss me off answer whatever it is what it is send me what's the company called can we talk about it yeah hostfully host fully well then i can just email her it's uh is it uh do they have a bunch of uh vcs behind it or all angels um i think this rounds a lot of individuals i'm not sure it was like i was kind of late to the party so i was just pretty quick to just be like okay this makes a lot of sense uh you know the once once you have revenue and a few million dollars uh that's recurring and they really haven't even like figured out what their marketing strategy is going to be yet it's like okay that's a pretty good signal that this is going to work and uh it's a pretty indispensable tool for a property owner so i like that one but i would say okay here's here's some of the things that have happened one is when i share deals with you you share deals with me my buddy julian shapiro's shares like some of the best deals um he's just very active he's very like consistent with it meaning like every week he's sending me some good [ __ ] um that's i would say 40 to 50 of the portfolio is relationships with friends who themselves are experts and specifically people who are experts in one niche so it's like we've been doing a bunch of like sales person software and it's because we like have a relationship with craft ventures who it started by david sacks he's kind of like the enterprise sas guy he built yammer sold it for a billion dollars his fund specifically just focuses on sas companies and what you're do you talk to so david sends you stuff dave not me particularly so my partner romine who runs my fund he basically has a good relationship with somebody at graph so for example when they're seeing something good they're just trading notes all the time and so we're getting to get in on a lot of their deals so if even if are they giving you the deal but do they do are they giving you the deal because they like sean or they like romaine in this case it's rameen because uh he has that relationship he's catching up with that guy every two weeks goes get coffee or whatever it is and but then i do the same with my guys right so i do the same with the people in india or people in southeast asia because i'm like i think that's where a lot of opportunity is and that's where i have the right relationships so we're sharing stuff uh just amongst that so and then the other thing is like themes so for example once i decide that a theme is correct uh like worth worth betting on what i learned from suli actually is the level of aggression you need to have once you decide x is a good idea you need to go invest in that company and then like the five other companies that are like adjacent to it so for example um there's this trend of of banking like neo banks right so this started several years ago uh where people basically were like look banks are something everybody uses but has super low customer satisfaction scores like their apps sucked uh their marketing sucked so basically people were like look we can create like a digital first bank and this started like new bank is is probably the best example of this it's in brazil they're like oh look yeah and they're about to go pop people are under bank there so they started a new bank uh a friend of a friend of mine uh was like led their investment and now it's a 10 billion dollar company and it has like millions of customers in brazil and then the same thing happened in the uk with revolut and monzo whatever so this idea of neo-banking basically of can you make super slick cus like slick app for customers digitally market to go get customers and basically you're building um you're actually not building the banking part you usually go partner with like some bank like bbva or something like that under the hood it's bbva but the customer relationship is with uh with a company that's really good at at taking care of customers and building good user experiences anyway so that's the the short answer is like okay decide that that's a good idea um and that takes many forms so like we talked about this before like ramp or brex these are like brexit i think was the fastest growing yc company in the last few years and you look at it you say is this a good idea you say well what are they actually doing they're basically giving credit cards to some group of people that were dissatisfied with current credit card providers brex did it for startups and they get a portion of every time that card swipes oh interesting so if a million people are spending a thousand dollars a year on it and they're keeping 1.3 percent of the interchange fee of the debit card or whatever you can come up with some number you say wow this company is going to get big pretty fast so we did that math of neo banks how much is the neo bank customer worth and how much is a credit card customer worth and then we went and did it in every niche we could think of so we we invested in keep which is doing this for canada and then we invested in uh pluto which is doing this in the middle east but but did you holler at them yeah then we go search and destroy basically it's like how do you go hunt for the best companies that are doing this in in either this geography or with this customer base so for example and you just dm them on twitter probably yeah exactly we just reach out cold dm and say hey i'm a believer in this for this this and this reason what you're doing looks super interesting would love to invest and sometimes it comes inbound sometimes it's oh you got 100 things inbound but you know what you're looking for so you quickly pounce on the four that fit your your thing aren't you out of money at this point from the fun though i raised more money because i was like i was like before i thought dude uh you know will i get a million dollars worth of deals every quarter that are good deals i'm not just trying to invest in crap so i need to invest in good deals so i i was like i don't know how many high quality deals i'll have and now um i realized that like whatever i whatever i had before was too low so now we're doing almost two million a quarter uh we raised more money because we just had better deals man i because i'm starting so i started angel investing almost one year ago well i i did it five or eight companies person the last before that i forget and a couple of them have turned out to be like meaningful like turning 20 grand into like 300 400 500 000 and i'm like holy [ __ ] this is how it works and like but like it it sucks for a while right because you just invest it you're like well that's money's gone and you don't ever hear about them and then you're like oh nice it works and so i'm like in some of those cases those are huge markups in other cases i'm just now experiencing like two and three and four x markups and i'm like that's awesome what would happen if that was had i invested in this company at a 10 million valuation instead of a 50 million evaluation that would have been wild and like how do i do that well one of the reasons so i hated startup investing for for a while because i was like you know is this the best use of time and money dude it feels like an expensive hobby i'm just spending money and not getting anything in return and then i then i realized two things which is bezos has this quote which i believe he goes one of the biggest competitive advantages you can have is being long-term oriented basically if you prioritize like if you have a 10-year view where you're like okay i'm gonna maximize what i can do in 10 years and the other guy is trying to make the most they can make you know for their quarterly earnings call right this is what this is how amazon worked right amazon was basically like we're willing to lose money to invest so that we provide two-day shipping instead of seven day shipping or free two-day shipping or a larger selection but it's going to cost us more because we're going to have more inventory or whatever so we're going to go into all these other verticals books cds whatever they basically said like his strategy was long term this is going to be the most valuable strategy short term we're going to get punished by the market because our quarterly earnings are not going to look great but that turned out to be the like magic you know the sort of like the biggest competitive advantage amazon had was their ability to be long-term oriented i think this is true just in general which is if you're competing in somebody who they need a result in one year and you're willing to be patient and get the result in five years seven years or ten years you can make bets that they can't make so that means you get to have lower priced bets um that will pay off bigger just over a longer time horizon so i think if you have the luxury of a long-term present that's a competitive advantage that's how startup investing works is if you need money or you want you need to see positive growth in one year startup investing sucks if you're willing to play a 10-year game this could be an awesome game to play and so do you think that well but do you think you told me you're like man i think i could three and a half x my fun because that's average now it seems like it's going to be significantly more yeah like you know you think about kind of like what's the floor you know i think a three and a half x would be you know a a solid outcome but you know nothing to write home about um but like with a small fund like ours you know you could see things where you can get a 15x you can get a 20x there are literally crypto small funds like ours that that have had 100x the 100x the fund in in the period of time right so so you know you shouldn't really the ceiling is high um but but the floor is is pretty reasonable so the first thing was okay long-term oriented is a competitive advantage i i like startup investing for that reason the second one is um you want to do things that compound so for example if i wanted to beat the market in the stock market right i want to beat the s p 500 i need to have proprietary like intelligent i need to be smarter than anybody else about something and i think just being smarter at a game where money's on the line is just really hard to do whereas if you do um if you basically say hey my advantage comes from my reputation or my my network of people that i know that's just gonna compound every year the more deals i share with you the more deals you're going to share with me the more companies i have that are winners that's going to make it easier for me to get into the next winner or for founders to come reach out to me because they'll say oh i saw you did these five indian unicorns i'm an india i want to be the next one of them so you should can you invest in me so compounding also comes into play here in a way that doesn't happen in the stock market and doesn't even really happen in real estate real estate has it to an extent but but not in the same way as how fast your reputation can compound and start investing so anyways those are my two reasons why i now actually view startup startup investing as a as a game worth playing because it it uses two of the super powers that uh that i believe in that i think most people undervalue is it gonna what do you think will earn more the ecom thing or this angel investing thing uh probably for me personally the ecom thing because i just own the majority of that company so you know if it sells for 50 million dollars or 100 million dollars you know i'll own the majority of it but uh whereas with startup investing you know it's like my fund invests a hundred thousand dollars we own point eight percent of this startup i personally have twenty percent of the carry but then i share with romine and ben and zach so i personally own 14 point something percent of the carry or whatever sure so it's not like you know you're owning a slice of a slice of something big versus just owning them you know how it is owning the majority of something that sells for a decent chunk is is just better financially it's so much better and yeah i think that whenever people raise money i'm like are you sure man you might be able to sell this for 50 million dollars and you'll make more money than if you raise money and sell for 500. yeah exactly now you know but i have to operate that other business whereas startup investing is like you know a joy right you just read about cool ideas you meet awesome founders and you say yes you write the check and then they go do the hard work so it's you know just a different thing [Music] you

[Music] you seem like a grinder when you were building these businesses were you just like uh doing 80 hour 100 work weeks and what about now because you're like yolked you're a huge you look like a bodybuilder so so like how did you balance like uh being fit and getting married and you but i don't know you well but you seem like you'd be grinding hard so my wife works in the business with me so we are true 50 50 partners like it's very rare i like i recognize how rare it is she actually is 100 matched with me and like should just as much be on this call because she runs the other half like she from a work standpoint she has more output than i did um she is the operator so she builds the infrastructure she does the recruiting she sets the they are the hr stuff she does the culture she like she does i mean she runs everything um i just you know occasionally come up with a good idea and try and stick with it long enough um to see it come true but in terms of grinding we this is what we like i love business like i love this and there's nothing that really stimulates me like this and so i do as much of it as i can and if we want to go to dinner we'll go to dinner you know but like worse we're i was just saying we're single so we don't have kids and so we work from like five-ish to four ish you know um and then you know usually in the middle of the day we'll probably go to the gym for an hour or two and then come back and keep working and go out to dinner at night and that's that's kind of our lives you seem pretty um this isn't i would say i'm a little bit i'm definitely this sean has a little bit of it too like manic's not the right word but like neurotic maybe is a better word um where it's like uh you're there's something that's deep rooted inside of you that's kind of it's not like you want to do something necessarily it feels like you're it's more compulsive um or obsessed you're obsessed about stuff which i am as well um where if that's true what's that rooted in what are you trying to get done so i think originally the drive was from just crippling insecurity and needing approval right um and then i think from like a behavioral conditioning standpoint i got immediate feedback that was positive and then i was conditioned to continue those actions now uh i continue to do them without the original catalyst that got them going to begin with so i don't i don't think i suffer you know from the insecurities as much as i used to i'd say i'm probably 30 better than i was at the beginning and it might just be because i have this massive big pile of money that i can use as an emotional crutch to why i'm not a piece of [ __ ] um that would help i'm just being like i mean if it were all disappeared i'd find out how much actual growth i had or if i just compensated by circumstance and you know compensate for the division yeah i don't know you can send it to me and we'll we'll find out we'll see let's run the experiment i like so there's the compulsion and like this last year i pretty much took off like i did not work that much um and so i saw the difference and like i have i have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote do like this is my life and this is what i like doing and their ideals that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are irrelevant to me you said you took last year off what'd you do what'd you get up to we went out to dinner every single night to a five-star restaurant for seven straight months we went to i mean we we moved to vegas temporarily um we traveled a lot uh went to cabo went to scottsdale went to sedona went to flagstaff traveled all over um went out did stuff um felt honestly pretty empty like you can only eat so many times like there's just not a lot to do um it feels good having that rest though i mean when i sold my company which was a year ago last week the first six six months i was like i need to decompress it felt good to have it and then and then i was like and i'm in that phase now where i'm like all right now i'm ready for war again you you can't like i i like you can't be in the trenches i think like or rather you need breaks from from being in the from being at war i think and maybe even phrasing it i'm just throwing this out there like phrasing it is instead of a like a break is a shift in how you're thinking because like it's really like it's going from dirt to clouds but i still think it's high leverage activity you know what i mean or like output it's just a different type of output you said something on one of your videos that um you're one of the only other people that i have heard say this phrase i use it a lot which is yeah i had a season like or this season i'm doing this or i had a season where i was really just focusing on x and that's been like a game changer for me my personal trainer and kind of coach he's like my mindset coach plus trainer he does this all the time but he's like he's like i'm in a season right now where i'm i'm just uh he'll be like you know i'm practicing not waiting and he's like hey he comes up with these little themes or he'll be like right now i'm in a season where i'm going to eat whatever i want and it's kind of like in the entrepreneurial world it's like time boxing's like all right i'm going to give myself two hours to get this [ __ ] done or i'm going to launch in the next two weeks no matter what right like we i've used time boxing for productivity and now this season's thing it makes every like decision you're making less heavy of a commit because you're like it's okay yeah because there's yeah there's beginnings and ends and this season is gonna feel a little different just like winter feels different than summer that's how i use it do you do you use it like that i just noticed you said that phrase 100 yeah and maybe it's a fitness thing i have no idea um i i've yeah i i have no ownership right like a season yeah i mean i i think about it in terms of entrepreneurial seasons um and i at least for me might have been like five year chunks and so this is gonna be my fourth season um and they've roughly been about the same length so i think that it probably takes me like three ish years to like really see something through and then two years to figure out how i'm going to transition from that thing or realize or mod you know whatever um that's what i it's kind of like a pe cycle almost [Music]

[Music] there's this guy named sam evans do you know sam evans sam ovens uh is that the uh very like slick-backed hair guy yeah what's his thing consulting.com so he talks all right so this guy named sam evans he rubbed me the wrong way for a long time and looking back i think i was actually wrong and he seemed like an alright guy so he had this website called consulting.com which if i had to put it at its worst it was basically a course that was like two thousand to ten thousand dollars that taught you how to start a business at best it's like it like it's an accelerator and the reality is it just like is a way to like it's like a community and a course on starting a company and he scaled it to like 30 million in revenue and it was just him and he hired all these people and built this office in new york and he was posted on social that they're doing 50 or 60 million in revenue and then he vanished and he had a youtube video come out today that says and he and he just says i'm back he's like for the past two years i hated life we scaled too quickly and so we were spending like 50k a day on facebook ads and we weren't even making that much profit so i decided to change everything and over the last two years we've crushed it he goes for example in january uh this course he goes we got rid of like there was three courses now we only sell two or one and last month in january we made eight hundred thousand dollars in revenue and our expenses which includes payroll and buy and paid ads was sixty thousand dollars and so basically this guy and and then he launched this new company called school which is basically like a facebook groups alternative because when he was launching courses he was like you stink so that is a different story that's actually cool but this course business this guy has now basically let's just times it by ten so eight million in revenue with six hundred thousand dollars in expenses is that nutty or what is that crazy yeah but it depends is that sustainable and also is that gonna grow so for example i know i don't think it's gonna grow but i think it could be sustainable when i did the like all access passives like i was making whatever 50k a month off of the newsletter i paid newsletter making 50k a month what were my expenses it was like you know 300 a month for convertkit uh you know like a va for 500 a month whatever so it looked nutty but like that's because i had an audience so i could just sell into that if i wanted to grow it i would have had to like you know my expenses would have had to gone way up right you know like so it depends where yeah maybe his ad spend is really low now is that because his ads are ultra efficient or is because he had a long a big list no they said that they don't they don't spend ads anymore but previously they had spent millions and tens of millions of dollars of ads so the website definitely already has yeah uh traffic traffic yeah so yes it's not like i talked to somebody who worked there um pretty early on so i was like this guy legit like he's legit he's good um they're like he he lived in new zealand or something like that he's a digital marketer uh then he has consulting.com which is basically like they had a course they had a consulting accelerator and they're basically teaching people how to start their own business their own consulting business and uh they said they told me at the time that there was like 10 million dollars of free cash flow a year and they said that um there it was about 30 million or something in revenue they said like half of that so like 15 16 million was coming from one product which was a two or three thousand dollar course about how to start your own consulting business and then from there they upsell you into the five thousand dollar course about how to create a course and then uh once you get to five hundred thousand dollars in consulting revenue then you get to join a mastermind that will help you get to a million dollars plus and that'll cost you 25 or 50 grand or something like that and so that was their you know that was their model but you know half of it was coming from that kind of like entry level two to three thousand dollar course um where they like kind of sell you close you on the phone to like get you to buy the course which is yeah i went through the funnel to like so i got him to sell me online or to do the phone call and i was like i want to figure this out it's pretty good man and i gave the guy a hard time because he's just kind of weird he just comes off serial kill he kind of patrick bateman he's kind of like the patrick bateman of our of our friend jack smith like the american psycho version of our friend jack smith and so he's like just like a little off but that's actually really incorrect of me to say because i don't i think he's just an oddball which is totally because i don't know the guy yeah i don't know him and i think that my judgment is just totally wrong i think he's an all right guy yeah i think it's wrong because it's all based on his haircut no i watched a lot of this guy's videos and i was like something is off here and i he was he was aggressively selling he is it was the type of guy where you selling like a private jet uh like a video on a private jet right so that's not wrong but it's it's it's you know your cousins with wrong um and so i think that it was just kind of odd [Music] you

cares for and so he he starts talking to him and his backstory is that he um his dad owns a diamond company and he's the son of a billionaire and if you google you see that this guy's a son of a billionaire so he kind of like had created this profile around that and um and then you know sure enough a month in he's like um hey you know like he's he's like oh you know he sends a picture of his body he's always with the bodyguard he's like my bodyguard got attacked oh my god she's like oh my god is he okay he's like yeah but you know they're telling me i can't use my credit cards anymore because they're tracking my location you know like these are our enemies for our company the diamond business is a ruthless business and he's like uh can i borrow your credit card for the time being while i uh you know because i can't use mine yet and she's like uh okay and he's like cool just make sure you get your limits raised because like i have business meetings and all this stuff so these women end up going like 150 200 000 in debt as he racks up credit card debt then he's like hey go get a quick loan and send me the money i need it because you know my enemies are after me and he's like my enemies are after me and so you the documentaries the first half of the documentary is these women talk about how they fell in love and the second half is like how they got conned basically and he's like a ponzi scheme so he's well he'd fall in love with one woman or he'd get them to fall in love with him get them to start giving him money and credit cards he'd be using that to wine and dine the next woman and then he would be doing this with multiple women at once telling them all the same things and then he was living this like extravagant lifestyle on all these women's dime and uh and then you know so that's that way that's the score of the movie quick reaction to that and i'm gonna tell you some other stuff well what happened to him so how does this end it ends with he gets exposed so the women are like oh my god you know they they go to the credit card company they're like look i have to be honest like my kind of boyfriend you know or i don't know what's going on this is the guy he's tricking me and like they sh he's there can we see a picture of the guy and he she shows a picture on her phone and that the two like agents from like amex or whatever just look at each other like it's him and then she's like what it's like we've been after this guy for years uh he does this with tons of women they're like there's other women he's doing this too and so it's like they feel cheated on plus conned and um and so he but technically what happens is is he breaking the law he's not breaking the law they are giving him money they're sending him money willingly and they are um you know they're giving him their credit card and they're calling the credit card company and saying no no it's me can you please raise my limits yes i'm traveling i'm in i'm i'm in ibiza right now and so they're like uh you know you're in a kind of a sticky spot you can't really say he stole it you clearly gave it to him uh in fact you kind of committed fraud but like well whatever we'll leave that aside but like yeah you do owe this money like this is not um this is not you know a stolen credit card and so anyways how much do you get he ends up getting a 15 month sentence for not even for this it's for like something else that he did like associated with this um he serves five months he gets off free he's out there living he's got a new model girlfriend he lives somewhere else um the girls kind of like exposed him in the press because they were like okay look law enforcement's not doing anything or it's gonna take too long he's gonna keep doing this in the meantime they go to the norwegian press where they're from and they they they kind of like expose it the netflix turns it into a documentary and uh and so the guy's still out there and one of the things in the movie is he goes to a plastic surgeon and he's like i want my eyes cheekbones chin mouth all restructured and this guy's like i'm not gonna do this only a criminal would want this surgery and so he's like trying to change his face so he could keep it going but he can't change his face and now he's like you know kind of like public enemy number one but a lot of people who watch this are like dude these girls are stupid you yeah you were just with him for the money and then he can't do for the money you got what you deserve so the girls are getting a ton of flack for it which is really crazy that's that's that's dumb but i was just thinking what a waste of talent by this guy yeah like that's pretty amazing it's like it's like a you know what's funny is like leonardo dicaprio played the same character and catch me if you can and it was awesome yeah he became like when i see this guy i want to punch him in the face yeah exactly that was the problem it was a documentary instead of a movie about the con man itself where you sort of fall in love with this smooth guy uh yeah if a different if if like a lovable if like if like matt damon played him i would be all about it but super punchable face this guy yeah um and the memes are just amazing uh around well i saw the meme with you with your face on it yeah yeah yes i had somebody i was like hey photoshop my head onto onto this photo where it looks like i'm with the guy and i just tweeted out like i'm with my sister's new boyfriend like is he american no this guy's israeli uh dude screw this guy man i i i'm happy they made a documentary about him how did he get all the uh so he's in a private jet in a bunch of these pictures how did he get that because he's using the previous woman's money to fund his his lifestyle so he would fly private yeah yeah so he's actually flying private i don't know all the time but at least some of the time and uh it was just really wild in fact a lot of the numbers don't make sense like he must have been running this on like tons of women at once to fund this lifestyle because these like the jets and the stuff that he was doing like okay he called this woman out of 80 grand but 80 grand funds like one month of this lifestyle you know like that's not very long so he must have had a lot of people at the same time or the documentary's a little inaccurate i don't know but how much money did he get they said that he had conned women out of millions of dollars uh over over time um they didn't say exactly how much they don't know you know how much of it what was there but but i just feel like he did this all wrong like if you're gonna do all this effort you gotta be more intelligent right like okay what could he have done um could have just married rich could've just seemed rich married rich divorced took half right like that that would have worked uh wait wait you know put more wood behind fewer arrows here and he could have just caught one very wealthy person if he really wanted to do this that's my first critique of him uh my second critique of him is bro all this money to just party partying's exhausting like why he just wanted to fly private and go to these clubs and do table service like you know you couldn't pay me to do that i don't know you got to diversify your assets dog yeah you should uh you should own some crypto like buy something buy buy a home do do something with this money you just blew all the money on overpriced you know like bottle service at the club like wow all right that's critique number two um number three go b to b bro corporate swindling would have worked way better so you know he could have been like you you heard about the guy who just started sending invoices to microsoft and apple and stuff just got paid like millions of dollars just he was just sending an invoice to accounts payable or whatever and uh and then they would just pay some of the invoices like ap at microsoft.com yeah and he was like he's like hey you know this is for the uh blah blah and like and then they went back and they're like what the hell is this who is this vendor that we paid 1.1 million dollars to this year like nobody knows who this is i don't think that's illegal either uh i think it is because he was like you know uh well whatever they were going back after them you know these companies a lot of money so that's the downside of going b2b i feel like there could have been a b2b way of doing this should have actually just started a diamond company could have made a lot more money if you're this good at getting women's emotions tied up in your your lifestyle just actually sell the diamonds it would have worked use their money to fund a diamond company that actually could have worked this guy needs to be needs to be on the facebook ad manager instead of tinder that's my and i'm just make your tweet i'm looking at them now the all those these women who we scammed like a lot of them look like models like he was killing it also like you forgot the other option which is like just marry one of these ladies if they're rich enough to like if they're these beautiful women who could wire them 200k like i don't know man bro maybe you got to keep her well in this case he's like he was telling him like go take like a kind of like a collateralized loan or a payday loan and like super high just don't worry he's like i'm gonna wire your money back in four days and then he would like not wire them back and then they'd be like hey did you wire the money he's like oh sorry they are like the bank was closed okay and then he would like show them a statement he'd be like i sent it should arrive in a couple days she's like hey it hasn't arrived yet what's going on like the interest is building up on this like flash loan you had me take he's like oh my god let me call the bank another two days go by he's like called the bank they said this thing got frozen i gotta i gotta deal with this i'm so sorry here uh you know i'm gonna send you one of my watches in the meantime you could just sell this watch is worth a hundred thousand dollars sends them a fake watch and you just buy time doing that it's like these women didn't have the money but like i think he could he could have totally gone for a richer woman and then been like you know what baby like i love you i'm not going to make you sign a prenup you know me i'm a billionaire uh i come from this lineage but i'm not my dad says sign up prenup i'm not gonna do it and then she would feel a little bit of pressure and be like okay i guess i can't really ask him for a peanut anyways this guy's richer than me all right i guess i also won't that would have been a more effective con if this guy were in jail do you think he'd be popular or hated i think popular sadly you think popular i think i think popular i could see this going either way man i could see this i could see this going either way i think like dude in prison would he like all right so bernie madoff i heard in prison was like a god which i get i get that you know like he could teach people how to like corner like the chocolate chip or the chocolate uh hot chocolate market like in prison like he could like you know or he could like you know dominate the commissary and like teach you about markets i get that and also there was it wasn't a violent crime so no children or women would hurt like this guy is he i would see this guy being unpopular uh i don't know that's a good he's got kind of like a douchebag aurora to him so that's the problem that's that's where he's gonna get in trouble but uh bro the swindler this window would do well in prison i guess i'll watch it how many episodes he's not in prison he's out and about he's living a nice life right now i'll screw this guy man and he sold a couple million dollars yeah i think i think about i think this documentary is good punishment though that's fair i'm okay with you not serving time and you have this documentary our buddy jack butcher pointed something out that i was like oh wait a minute that's true he's like yo netflix is gonna make a lot of money off this documentary pay off these women's debts they have like a gofundme going it's like yo netflix you need to pay off this woman's 200 000 debt that's true you did well on this documentary so that's the that's the real call out here netflix cancel netflix if they don't pay off these women's debts that's a no-brainer you don't think they're going to well nobody said anything these women are doing interviews everywhere there's a gofundme out there i feel like i feel like they could have said or they're just you know swindling people one good thing that you know we didn't make a lot of money off this but netflix actually generously did agree to pay off the debt you know uh blah blah blah that i feel like that story should have come out if they did it if they didn't then fire your either fire your pr person netflix or pay off this pay these debts [Music]

[Music] um can i let me ask you a quick question before we wrap up getting wealthy like we're talking nine figures liquid net worth wealth getting wealthy is it is it really hard to do it just from cash flow or do you think you have to sell it sell something sell a business sell real estate sell something capital gains versus income you're saying liquid so not paper not not your paper net worth liquid which includes things that could be traded in 30 days um very hard very hard to do just off cash flow i believe um i think you know it's just much slower right because you can i mean just look at the basics right like when you sell something you're going to sell it for some multiple of the free cash flow that it's going to generate for you right and so so just by definition 10 or 20 years sometimes it's 5x sometimes it's 10x sometimes it's 20x sometimes it's 3x whatever there's different multiples for different industries but like fundamentally it's a multiple which is a multiplier on how fast you're going to get the money the value out so let's say to get to 100 million uh whatever number of years that would take you then have to divide that by five and that's like how fast at minimum you could have got there just selling the asset um and getting and taking the 5x multiple right so so you know of course you can get there but do i know ways you can get there with the same speed i don't think so because even those are like i take the cash flow i invested in a thing and then that thing grows faster and like i can sell my stake in that so you know because it's like you you have a choice so you could spend your time you know you could spend your time building a service or some type of business where you can make significant cash flow two three million dollars a year not work that much but it's not necessarily an asset that could be sold so there's a few businesses like this or it could just be like um like the way the this podcast gets paid like it's not like a particularly maybe but maybe the podcast isn't a good example but it's not you know what i mean not necessarily an asset like your maven course your maven course is not an asset that could be sold but it could potentially make many millions of dollars a year versus you just say you know what screw it i'm not doing that because i have to build a business that could sell so do you prefer do you think cash flow or or or an entity an asset that is independent of you and can be sold um i don't know i don't think do i prefer is really the right way to think about it it's like you need both right like for example um i you need both for two reasons one is maybe you're going to use the cash flow to invest right maybe what you're going to do is you're going to buy great assets and let them compound over time well where are you going to get the cash flow to begin with right when we had andrew on that last week he's like i i took the cash flow from the design agency of meta lab and i used it to buy majority stakes and all these other businesses and then let those compound over 10 years and like boom you know so he reached you know that goal and more uh doing that and so you you know maybe you need the cash flow to make those investments right like if you have no cash flow how are you gonna invest in anything and secondly um i like to live a good lifestyle so sometimes casual businesses are great because it's like yeah sure compounding is awesome but so is you know like [ __ ] gucci shoes or whatever i choose your choose your thing you're into like yeah gucci shoes like sometimes those are better than like this yeah dude whenever i hear an old asset whenever i hear buffett talk about the long term and like patience i'm like [ __ ] you're like 95. like there is no long term there is you don't have pain you shouldn't have patience anymore you should have like you should immediately spend whatever you want to spend there is no such thing as a long-term view for you at the same part let's see like the headline sampara colon to warren buffett [ __ ] you're 95. there well i'm just like you know like if you want to do the mix you have to be fine but like and bezos talks about those two he's like i'm like i mean you don't really who cares like you know just live life how you want to live you got it yeah so i've always like why are you delaying it it always pissed me off i'm like why are you delaying to have the best time of your life when you're like old and don't even want to do [ __ ] like you you don't have to do that anymore yeah yeah for sure and you know some people are happy along the way that's that's fine but like uh yeah i feel like you had it i feel like you asked me this question because you had an opinion or a story so let's just skip because i think you have a good opinion or story on this i don't have a no i don't have an opinion yet but i'm like with my life now it's like i can i think that in i think in six i think in a matter of six months i could probably create a business from scratch that does a million dollars a year in profit it would be based off of like my image i'm not saying i have that i'm just saying like i'm sure i could do that plus with like a couple other side projects i think i could very realistically have two or three million dollars a year in cash flow easily but very but yeah easy and maybe i do already have that i don't even want to say i do or do not but i but like if you did that would have been a weird way to say it would have been a weird hypothetical but okay let's continue on i got some cool [ __ ] going on i'll say but and i'm thinking about where do i spend my time and i'm like is it actually worth it like or should you just not care about cash flow and build something that's like much bigger that you could sell i don't know i'm just trying to figure i'm like where do you actually spend time the real answer is what gives you most joy yeah exactly and and like uh whether you don't work backwards from do i want cash flow or do i want long-term you know capital gains that's not like the starting point of a decision um you kind of just need to make sure you're winning in one way or the other uh don't be weak in either area or like don't be weak in both basically is like the way to do it like for example you could buy a home in san francisco you're going to have terrible income from that property it's not a good income property because in most places san francisco your rent the rent you can charge somebody is not going to out pay the mortgage plus yeah it's going to make a three percent cap cap but you can go buy you know some home in whatever you know houston or something like that it can cash flow thousand dollars two thousand dollars a month and it's good income property but it's you know gonna appreciate super [ __ ] slow whereas the san francisco home you know in 10 years is going to have you know whatever more than doubled in value and so you know it's there's appreciation properties and income properties the same thing like i think you just do whatever gives you the kind of whatever's whatever gives you juice today and you think might give you juice going forward and then you got to say all right before i do this i got to make sure it's going to be strong in either one of these either it's got to be awesome for cash flow or it's got to be awesome for for appreciation and if it's awesome for cash flow basically i'm just going to use the cash flow to buy assets that are going to appreciate with somebody else doing the work instead of me doing the work it's you kind of end up at the same point either way yeah i don't know i just been thinking about like how to spend time you know who's killing it and has done a really good job of like putting off making cash is our friend nick huber i am an investor and so i get to see some of the numbers of his storage deals and i don't think he crushed it like in terms of personal cash flow for a long time but like the way that things have compounded i'm like oh holy moly if you just eat [ __ ] for like six seven years and pick the right asset things look really cool yeah yeah i think he's done great and also i think he is like i think he personally has great terms for with his investors meaning like i think it's quite favorable to him yeah incredible in a bad way but like he makes sure he gets to eat right whereas at the beginning if you have no capital you like you know you sort of make a deal with the devil in a way where you're like all right i'm going to take no management fees no acquisition fees and a low carry i think now he's like look i'm good and i know it so i'm going to take a higher fee higher higher acquisition fee and i'm going to take you know my healthy carry um so you know good on him i think a lot of people in real estate are able to do that pretty well uh i know somebody's crushing it in real estate and they they do just that they they have like a you know fifty percent carry on the deal or something something crazy and they're like yeah because my deals are big hits and i win so like it doesn't make sense for me to do this at any less than that there's this uh that's like next level winning all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are there's this awesome you know who foo fighters are you know dave girl dave grohl's the lead singer foo fighters yeah and they've been writing hits forever before that he was the drummer nirvana so he's like just wrote hit after hit for a long time and someone asked him about uh he's like um you know you write hits and and what's your process and like uh a a fan was asking about old music and but and he stopped he goes wait a minute let me cut you off here he goes i don't write deep cuts i write hits and it was just like he's like everything i write i read it to be a hit sometimes it is sometimes it isn't but it's all meant to be and that's like your real estate friends he's like i write hits that's why he gets that 50 carry exactly exactly and respect i i respect somebody who's like i'm playing the game and i play to win the game you know i'm not playing something else i'm not going to tell you i'm not playing the game i am playing the game and playing to win that's actually like uh i really respect people who just clearly play the game and they're like open about it like yeah i play the game i'm playing to win and here's you know like good if you if you dislike the game or dislike me that is your your choice and i actually dislike people that are the like uh virtue signal types where it's like they are playing the game but they'll do anything in their power to like make it look like they're not playing the game and there's a lot of that like in silicon valley there's a lot of that here's how that plays out that i see there's person starts the company bullshits about like why they're doing the company or why this problem is the problem they decided to spend their life on technology like you're you know you're doing this because it's good business not because you really wanted to help you know small to medium-sized enterprise businesses save money on whatever right like that wasn't your actual intention you probably like that that you have happy customers and that they're good you know you're helping them but like let's be real uh taking away the money have you ever seen on silicon valley we're saving the world one cloud processor at a time or some [ __ ] exactly it's like yeah and then they're like they're like they're like uh someone calls them out they're like dude this is all rich guy like kid rock just was the singer for the for the uh for the show and he's the poorest guy here yeah exactly and so so i think silicon valley you see that a lot you'll also see that with the origin story about like you know why they decided to do this you're like oh are you sure you decided to do this because you know your cousin got diagnosed with this you know rare thing and that's why or or was it that you ran paid ads at five different products and this was the one with the highest click-through rate because i'm pretty sure when i was talking to you it was this was the highest click-through rate cool that's my company right like there's a lot of that um so the other one is the guy who started dollar shave club um i saw an interview with him and some of the times he's like i started dollar shave club because i was just sick of going to walgreens and i had to ask them to like open up the razors and then another interview he was like he's like man my father-in-law is like crazy and he likes us to buy random stuff and one time he bought a shipping container full of cheap razors and we just had to figure out a way how to sell them all yeah exactly that's why we did it exactly and you know i'm in the two percent of the population i think you are too where we're like oh sweet respect for trying to flip the storage container and then realizing there's a business there versus like you know you know the kind of like the shark tank version of the story which was like we were just so fed up with our options right and like i get again i get it i've done that i might do that again but am i a little bit disgusted by it yes uh same thing with the same thing with i'll do that usually when i have business partners not when it's my own business um like when i'm when i'm the only when i get to just be a cowboy on my own i'll just do what i want be like yeah i don't care if this is bad for the business it's fine the other day i ate a i ate an entire jar in one sitting of peanut butter from it was the jiffy cheap [ __ ] and i just felt so bad about myself but i didn't regret it and that's kind of like how you feel but i wanted to do her stuff for my friend mission statements are like a pint of and jerry's like if it feels good doing it and you may not regret it but but you feel guilty about yourself the the other version of this is like people who on twitter are like uh they call this like [ __ ] posters or they're like you know they basically they basically try to signal like you know i'm not gonna just i'm not one of those investors who blogs about content and tries to yeah i'm a cool man i'll tell you the real deal and i'll i'll make jokes and blah blah it's like they're the ones trying to carefully curate their brand more than anyone if you actually meet these people they're like so conscious about their brand uh and like you know how how many followers they're getting and like how viral their stuff is going and like they are you know like uh they're they are so meticulous about that stuff while trying to give off their appearance it's like bed head right it's like oh no i just woke up like this it's like oh are you sure you don't use a product called bed head that like you know like makes it look slightly messy but like you know you're actually carrying where every strand of hair goes and so you know i have more respect for like um people who are like yeah like you know like pomp or sahil or they're like yeah like people really like to hear about bitcoin so i just tweet bitcoin [ __ ] all the time it's great like i like bitcoin and they like bitcoin so i'll just tweet like i'll just set up a calendar i'll be like yeah i'm gonna tweet bitcoin stuff because i figured if i get a big bitcoin following that'll be really really good for me or like you know sahaja's like yeah i put it i put out these threads about these like finance topics because i think i'm good at it and they go viral and then it gives me all these dope connections versus like you know i just want like i feel that knowledge is um you know knowledge needs to be accessible for all and free and that's why we need to democratize knowledge yeah i want to democratize financial knowledge like i used to work on wall street and the insiders know things that the rest of us don't so i quit my job and started writing twitter threads about finance to democratize finance it's like no no no no no you didn't do any of that you wanted followers and so you did what it took to get followers have you noticed how the word democratize is the new disrupt democratizes like you know what is democratized uh it's the new democratize is the new like um no offense but that's a democratized democratize is like about to fool you this is good for me and not good for you but i'm going to fool you by saying i'm democratizing something for you buy my service buy my product yeah by the way i do all that i do this myself i again i know it i spot it because i got it right i've done all this before with my e-commerce brand i've done the origin story thing with uh my fund i do this too like my fund is called the all-access fund because i wanted to give access to every access to all to be able to invest in the deals i do do i feel good that other people get access to good silicon valley deals yeah sure is that why i did the fun [ __ ] no that's not why i did the fund right i did the fun because i was writing checks and i wanted to write bigger checks and more checks into more companies and more and that was more than my personal bankroll would allow so i raised money from other people to do that and i get you know like so now i get to write more checks into more awesome companies that's why i raised the fund not because i wanted to democratize access to like you know angel investing for like you know a a middle school teacher in uh tennessee i can't stand democratized we're gonna democrat democratize this by only charging you fifty thousand dollars for this piece of clothing instead of i'm like i've seen people like we're gonna democratize knowledge and it's like a five thousand dollar course like [Laughter] you can democratize these nuts what do you think ben was today uh were we with it or what i thought today was a hit i thought today was a huge hit this is uh yeah other than like the steph smith episodes or robbed your dick this is uh this is a plus territory ah great are we gonna have to cut out my uh democratize these nuts [Laughter] and then so we have to plan the mfm summit so uh i agree that making a destination is cool i have a thing that i uh you're gonna have to bleep bleep out what i'm about to say but i know the thing i know the thing yeah yeah i got the guy i got a really like famous house that person might be interested in hosting us i don't know if that's just gonna be a dinner right like that's gonna be like no no no no no no no no we might be able to do a proper thing there but i don't know if the logistics are going to work out so i think but but i think that we could do like something outrageous you know we have to think about what outrageous means but i do think we can have something outrageous i think a cruise ship i like it that's a it's not a bad idea a cruise ship or like some type of famous venue or [ __ ] we could just go to hawaii just do it like in the beach in hawaii we can figure something out but we do need to do it people fly out like if people are gonna have to travel for it i think to get the value again the the easiest hack is first make it a couple days where people get to hang and meet each other so do it make it like a two day thing and then and then secondly um just make it already fun if it was just a vacation if there was no content on top but it's like then you combine some content uh getting to meet us and getting to meet other people in the community plus already it was a good like kind of vacation type experience then that's cool right and like i don't know let's do like bring a fitness component bring a like let's bring all the components of the stuff we talk about where there's like you know experiences beyond sitting down and listening to people talk it's like why not do a group workout or like let's get an mma guy to like you know take us through a set like take people through a session or something i don't know like something like that down all right let's schedule it i i do do you like that 500 price mark price point this i mean we should do this as an nft no doubt we should make this an nft and then only nft holders can attend and then they could flip their nft to somebody else if they want to but make it a limited number of nfts uh for this down all right that's it all right that's the episode [Music]

[Music] so there's this book that i've been meaning to read it's on my uh uh to read list and it's called [ __ ] jobs and so it's this premise that like i i think was a professor some guy from school of economics of london or something like that and his whole like i i again just remember i didn't research this much uh his whole idea here is that most jobs out there in the world like at least in white color world like it's it's just kind of unnecessary like and and to summarize it it's like take a company like hubspot amazon twitter like what would happen if you like laid off two-thirds of the people like would it would anything do we do we think anything would change other than the company would just make more profit and this guy says in in most cases yeah it would actually it would it would run just fine and most of the jobs that you have are just worthless and i i kind of agree with him i i i i agree i kind of agree we don't have knowledge of of it other than just personal experience but i don't it does sound like it and it's hard because there's no counterfactuals so you don't get to run the test and actually you know run you can't split test and run run both versions and see which one ends up better um but i've had this inkling for a while when we were getting acquired and i we were getting acquired by twitch and as part of it they're like hey you got to like you know basically like your whole team is going to come in for a day of interviews and that's going to decide kind of like if we take your whole team or not and i had to do my interview as well and so i'm going in there and they're like you know the classic job interview question a job interview structure is like i ask you a bunch of questions for 95 of it and then the last five percent of it i'm like so do you have any questions for us and then you're supposed to say something that's also just you showing off to like you know yeah show some other strength of yours you know in a different way and um and i had one genuine question i asked it to every single person and they were kind of like taken aback slash they thought i was kind of a jerk um some people thought they reacted kind of well like oh that's refreshing i don't know i hadn't really thought about it um but i could tell other people were slightly offended by my question and my question was i would say how many people work at twitch and they would be like uh you know i think we're at 1800 or 2000 people now i said um and how many people do you think i forgot how i phrased it but it's something like how many people do you think twitch needs to hit its goals and i was like how many people do you think should work here all right that's how many people do work here how many people do you think should work here and people are like so i asked the ceo this question too and he was he i give him credit because he's someone who like prioritizes the truth over being right like getting it right is way better than being right but he's also like a kind of a fierce debater so he's not just gonna like lay down and be like oh you know yeah you're right i changed my opinion about things like so he like he took the question he didn't like i would say nine out of ten ceos would get quite offended by this question because it basically implies you've mismanaged the company by bloating it's a great question i would not be offended he was not offended either and he was like he was like that's a good question he's like i think like 2 200. so he was like yeah i think we're a little short of what we need to hit his goal and he's like he's and then he his take was basically like you know i'm not saying we have all the right people or the most talented people or that like there's not people here who are under utilized or just kind of you know the fat i wasn't really his point it was like i think we can be this much this ambitious and to do that we would need you know like 2200 awesome people like working in unison um i still think he was wrong i think we i think you know the company kind of operates i would have followed up with a few questions the first one would be okay but do you think that you need to hire 2 200 people because you know that only 10 of them are going to be actually value-add and you just have to hire the the rest in order to find that 10 and then i would say and also is it possible that you only that you think you need 2 200 because you really only need like 20 effort from all those people and that's what your expectation is and then finally how much does redundancy come into play here how much do people are you just paying them and you just don't want to mention to them but you're paying them to sit on the bench and when the person next to them quits they just are ready to roll right uh yeah i didn't i didn't follow up that hardcore about it uh but i think those are you know very like valid valid points and also you know one thing i i kind of learned from him was like let's take that redundancy one right it sounds bad right it sounds like oh man you're paying a bunch of people to kind of do nothing just sit around no it's insurance and he's like that was exactly his take which was like i think it was on speed i was complaining how slow we were going and he's like speed he's like going slow sometimes a feature not a bug here and he's like um or like innovation it's like oh man we're not really innovating everybody else isn't he didn't say this outright but i you know i gathered this through our conversations which is like there are some things we're going to innovate on but actually the optimal strategy here is to let a bunch of startups go out and try to innovate and then if anything works either buy them or clone them like that is actually the best way for us to innovate it's like it's free we get way more experiments done by super caliber you know super hungry motivated people like startup founders and their teams who are liz are focused on just that one thing and they'll try radical experiments that we would never otherwise do and we don't have to fund it but we can sit back and watch it and then when we're ready we can either go try to acquire them partner with them or if they don't want to do any either of those we can build our own and just use our distribution and our brand which you know we have if we have you know x millions of users then we should be able to outcompete them from there and my issue with i think that's actually is the optimal strategy i agree with emma i think on most things i i imagine i would totally by the way i should say i'm not putting words in his mouth this is like what i gathered from a bunch of bunch of different conversations i'm sure he would disagree with like you know forty or fifty percent of what i just said uh paraphrasing him poorly yeah and it's just like your opinion on your takeaway my take of his takes and i uh i think i would agree with i bet i i would agree with a lot of what he thinks my issue is when you're like a small company like under 50 people you're all in it a lot of times you're in it for a mission you're in it to achieve something i think that you can get away with just being in it because people just like being in the thick of it with their friends uh like they just like the action when you get a little bit bigger i think it's less mission oriented and you're and it's just a job but you still have to put on this face like this to inspire people and it kind of sucks because the truth is is like well you know i i know that you know a lot of you are only working 40 and that's i'm okay with that i baked that into this i know that a lot of you aren't working at all but you're really just here in case the guy next to you quits and then hopefully you're gonna train the next person and i know that a lot of you want to innovate and try these new things but that's not really what we're gonna do we're gonna keep doing the same [ __ ] just a little bit better and then maybe every once in a while i'm gonna have a team that makes something totally new and i know all this but just tough and figuring out how to navigate and but have that like to say what i just said but in a really inspiring way or unfortunately just lie you gotta lie saying it is actually the best way yeah just act you got to just act and pretend um and be a politician a little bit i find that to be incredibly challenging but i think it's incredibly necessary yes you're spot on um you're spot on with that you are spot on with with what you just said do you think you could do it um you know the i think the thing you said i said have you ever heard of dunbar's number yeah what's it mean again so dunbar's number is basically it's a 150 that's the number and it's meant to represent the number of different like how many people know you know like how many people you are familiar you like know their name their face how many people can one person know actually right like somebody's like i got six thousand friends like now well you don't really know six thousand people and so dunbar's number was was used to be 150 it's like in a tribe you could know 100 up up to 150 you could know everybody in the tribe past 150 you don't know everybody on the track and then tools like social media and stuff came out that kind of like it's like a tool for the human body to like do more so like you might be able to know and keep up with more than 150 people now because facebook makes it easy with a news feed and photos and their name is listed there and whatever you get to see it all the time i think what you're saying is like your version of dunbar's number which is 50 and it's like below this is dumb pars dumpar's number i'll call it below 50 below 50. um the people who are there are like you know down for the cause like yeah the the the larger prior obviously they care about themselves but like a bigger like one of the top factors either number one or number two can be like the cause and then like or even just like just like you know like that kid who said he wants to do hood red stuff with his friends like that that could be the cause like i just wanna i just uh there was a viral video uh like uh years ago and they interviewed this like nine-year-old who um stole his grandmother's car and crashed it and the guy was like why did you why did you steal her car that's that was really bad of you and he goes he goes i try to be good but sometimes i just like doing hood rat stuff with my friends like smoking cigarettes and driving cars play the video play the video bed you got to play that really quick can you play it along the way he ran over two mailboxes hit two parked cars in a costco parking lot and struck two moving cars near walmart i want to do it because it's fun fun to do bad things drive into a car but did you know that you could perhaps kill somebody yes but i wanted to do her stuff for my friend that's how i feel about startups the youtube feature for this podcast just took us to a whole new level already the first one is great second we need to pull the clip um yeah just sometimes i wanted to reshape with my friends and that needs to be a sound clip ben that you can just play when mirrored sam is talking about something dumb that we're doing uh so just just go ahead and cut that one out that's the best part about that's the best part about startups like i don't care if it's ad tech i don't care if i'm selling clothing i don't get like it feels like when you're when you're like pulling [ __ ] off and you're like kind of fibbing to people like yeah you know we've been you know we really care about our customers our team is it's like just three of you and you know it's like you're just like trying to pretend that you're a big deal like that's hood rat [ __ ] and i love doing that with my friends but i wanted to do her stuff with my friend by the way have you struggled to do that uh at now that you're a big enterprise you know sas company that's like worth billions of dollars and hood ratchet is now frowned upon and you're like i just yanked it i yanked it um you can't and they're like you just yanked it sam why did you do that we have a process for that because i definitely could think of like two or three examples where i was bragging about something i did that was like the startup scrappy thing twitch well i would just be like yeah like you know uh like for example there was like a competitor and i like went to i talked to the founder and i was like yeah like you know i basically found out a bunch of their numbers and i was like oh yeah you know they're growing this fast this other doing blah blah and they're like well how do you know that and i was like well i talked to my i told them i was interested in blah blah and they're like oh [Music] uh i was like what and they're like well you know we just usually we don't we don't do good wretch basically it was like the the reward i thought i was creating was like well we're going to need to talk to legal and also corp dev is going to have to you know we have a guy whose job is to have those conversations and we we typically sign a letter of engagement before like whatever it was like not the exact example but like things that in the startup when i was doing my startup i would be so proud of my hack about like whatever or like i remember once i was negotiating a partnership deal and like basically i was like really negotiating for like every like every inch which as a startup i used to love winning a deal like doing it getting a good deal for ourselves and um and they were just like you know they're like you know what like we'd rather just use our standard deal and it's more favorable for him so he'll be happy and we don't have to like you know let you like negotiate deal by deal on these things and like you know in general we don't really want you negotiating directly with the person we have like partnerships with people who do that you're like yeah but they were not negotiating you're like the big lebowski guys like dude you need a toe i'll get you a toe i'll get you a toe if you need a toe [Music] you

[Music] my bad investment strategy that i hear often right now and this is gonna sound weird because i'm doing the milk road clearly i'm bullish on crypto is um i'm gonna give you two categories one is nfts in general um i think that so much money is gonna be lost and made but lost the losses will out far outweigh the gains um for for in nfts uh when we look back like five years from now um i think it is nuts what people are doing with nfts uh they would you know like um if you if you basically just described the same asset class but without the word nft um you know you would you'd say like yeah cool how much money are you putting into baseball cards how much are you putting into you know works of art how much how much money are you putting to these why do you believe that this digital art that you put this picture of a penguin you bought is the better investment than those or how about let's just simplify it i'm going to give you 15 seconds to describe why you bought this nft and the only thing you're not allowed to say is that i think it might go up right and like you know the the answer for most people is this sucker's going up right and then the second worst answer they give you is the community it's like oh you really you bought it for the what does that mean what is the community tell me about this community oh it's a community of people who all want this sucker to go up oh cool so you're all cheering for the same you know like you know greater full outcome and so i think for a huge number of obviously there's going to be winners in nfts right people are going to do well um some projects also if you like it buy it yeah if you're literally buying because you like the picture of the art and you really want to own that penguin fantastic but be honest with yourself almost everybody who's doing it right now is doing it because they think you know i'm hoping that this is the next one that goes up like crazy and um just call it what it is if it's a lottery ticket it's a lottery ticket and just say you're buying lottery tickets for you know thousand dollars pop and uh if that's really what you want to do do it but i just think it's generally quite a bad strategy for people to do you were the first one who told me about nfts and you bought one that i thought was awesome and i'm not even a basketball fan but you bought this kobe one and he like was dunking and turning into an angel and i was like oh that's pretty awesome that's sick um but you sold it and you made a profit like ten thousand dollars in profit right yeah i bought it for maybe like i don't know six hundred eight hundred dollars and then i sold it for ten ten grand like a month later what's it worth now it trades for about twenty five hundred dollars now um and i actually the reason i i actually think that might be an nft i'm like proud of that one that was a just for to learn and be i thought the art was cool but i thought that was so cool that i almost went back and bought it again yesterday i was like i actually really like this like this is just a really cool i agree a piece of art and um this time if i buy it it's not to you know learn or to see if it'll go up it's because i actually like this one but i have so many other nfts in my my like in a wallet that are just like you know you know i bought it because hey maybe this is going to be the next one that people pour their money into and i get this fabulous run-up um but those are scratch-off tickets and like do i really want to be buying 300 dollar that eight hundred dollar scratch off tickets like seems like a pretty bad idea it seems like it's not investing at all actually it shouldn't even be called an investing strategy how much money um what what i'm i sound so ignorant what's the w when you say that like when someone says um you know they've bought uh a thousand dollars of bitcoin although it's now worth a million dollars what do you call the thousand dollars your uh your basis yeah your basis so what was your basis for um how much did i put into nfts yeah so these uh probably in total maybe like five grand stuff like that five ten grand i didn't buy any of the like super expensive nfts um and uh yeah so you know i did well because i early on there was this thing called nifty gateway and they were doing curated drops so it was like one of the good things that around was like yeah yeah they're doing well still um so that's where the kobe one came out of there's this artist that i had followed for a long time it's got bosslogic he makes all the ufc posters so you've you've definitely seen this stuff because uh um he's like joe rogan will repost his stuff uh from time to time so he boss logic did the kobe one so that's why i was like oh i actually like this artist i follow him i've bought like uh you know like a print of his before i'll buy his nft so that was a good move and then the other one then i got caught up in the hype and bought like five of of this like thing called the aku um it's just like a whatever you can google it aku and uh i bought those just thinking like oh are these all just like you know positive flips and so i bought five of them for i want to say like 700 each and then i've sold four of them uh each one for about fifteen hundred dollars now two to two thousand dollars so i basically like doubled my money on four of them um and then i kept the last one just to like just to own basically um so i did well with those and then i have other ones in my wallet that like you know i bought for a few hundred dollars and they're worth i think zero like i think they literally like you could not i could not give it away if i wanted to just give it away to somebody our friend so nobody would pay the gas fee to pick it up our friend jack was selling a uh it was like a lock box it was like a box that was like and after you bought it it would be unveiled like what the art was and i thought that was actually kind of neat uh i'm not like jack's my homie i'm not like if it was like if i was like someone who's like i'm a true fan of where i was like i'd be honored to own anything you've made then maybe i could see myself doing that but people were doing that with him and it was pretty amazing yeah yeah i think nfts are cool they're gonna have a place i just think that most the way that most people are investing in them right now is scratch off lottery tickets and i think that that's a bad strategy [Music] you

you're good at doing this which is you identify these lifestyle trends you like pick up pretty quickly on like there's a group of people that are deciding to like live under a different paradigm or different motto or creed and actually that's always like one of the best ways to build a business around that lifestyle because you can speak to that audience you can differentiate a product super easily to that crowd [Music] dude have you ever been inside factories you probably have but i think most people have have you been inside like any kind of why do you think that i've been in the factory you're going to be like i don't know like my [ __ ] cousin bubba has like a bubble gum factory and you're going to be like i went fishing for i went fishing recently with my father-in-law and he's like hey so how do i set this hook up what do i do i'm like dude i don't know i've never gone fishing he's like why don't you just assume that i know how to do this dude you look like a guy you just look like you seem for sure like a guy who's gonna i've watched documentaries on it do you or do you not have a favorite place to fish no of course i don't have a fishing hole that i go to um but no i've i've i don't think i've been to a factory not really like what type of factory it doesn't matter any factory whatever factory you go into it's [ __ ] mind-blowing how like even to go to a warehouse like go to every you've been inside like an amazon warehouse or like a yeah like a food warehouse like how the food gets to restaurants um it's insane in the same way that like going to a farm is like slightly crazy and you're like whoa i eat these these i eat these animals like oh wow uh you know that doesn't seem right but like basically a factory it is kind of stunning like if you take any object on like okay i am holding this microphone this is sitting on my this is the foam cover of a microphone there's some like huge factory that like is churning them out if you just go back trace the process of how this got to my desk so okay i just go on amazon i just microphone uh i don't know maybe this one i click that i buy it right so it goes from an amazon warehouse onto a like amazon warehouse packs it into a carrier carrier brings it to my house puts the package on my doorstep okay great how did it get to the amazon warehouse well first it was in probably like another warehouse before it even got sent to amazon before that warehouse it was in a factory being made by human beings all right so actually before that before it got to the warehouse it was on a boat in a container like sailing from [ __ ] china on a boat with human beings just living on the boat as it sails for months you know two months to to the coast and then it gets like un you know like docked and separated out of a container ship and like humans beings are there in the factory there's human beings you know i don't know how how many you know small children died making this foam cover but it's like the amount of work that goes into everything that's sitting in our house just arriving there is insane to me like just the materials so where did the material for this foam come from right there's like a you know if you have cotton right that starts in a field somewhere it gets puck it gets plucked and it's pulled and it gets processed then it gets shipped and then it gets manufactured then it gets printed then it gets manufactured again it's like that is insane yeah to the point where i'm kind of like we're kind of ruining the earth and also people's lives like you know like to get i can't feel my t-shirt well i cancelled my amazon prime membership i was like man i feel guilty i order something and it's like so much energy behind the scenes when to ship this of course i only see they ship a dongle to a computer a small ass thing with bubble wrap in a huge box and i'm like oh this is horrible and then i have to pay money to pay a truck to come pick it up because i it's too much you know by constant yeah yeah then the truck you know burns gas and then takes it somewhere else and [ __ ] dumps it somewhere and then someone else's problem right like so it's just kind of like on one hand i'm amazed that the system even works like the fact that the package gets from the factory in vietnam to the warehouse and then you go to the warehouse and there's like an unbelievable number of boxes and then they get sort of picked and packed into the package and that gets shipped and you if you ever go to the post office like if you go to the post office and you you should just ask them be like hey can i see what it's like behind the the door there they'd be like what why i just never seen a post office they'll open the door it is like santa's like you know elves factory basically it's like the most unbelievable number of packages and you're like where's the system like aren't there conveyor belts and they're like no we just got these like trolleys and then we just kind of keep them like you know the ones going over there they stay over in this area then we hope we don't lose them it's like wow this is insane that this system even works it is pretty crazy it's like an incredible achievement it's crazy you can mail something from california to new york for like 45 cents and it gets there in like four days yeah that's what i'm saying pretty reliably so i'm like it is on one hand amazing and on the other hand is horrifying the amount of like i forget the environmental side right i'm not even that environmentally conscious it's not like something that i think about all the time or i feel super guilty about i actually feel more like the human energy and labor and just the amount of effort and resources it took to get this thing to me it makes me think like you know we had that guy david friedberg come on the pod you you weren't there for that one but the thing he's doing which is basically like hey he's doing the same thing in the drink industry which is like instead of you know putting 20 liters of water to grow grapes then crush the grapes turn it into wine add sugar add alcohol pack it up put it to a you know send it to a bottling factory then send it to a warehouse then put it on a shelf and a store and then drive it home and put it on a shelf in your home like he's like why don't you just like manufacture it in your home using this little printer that'll print a drink for you and um and it's like oh yeah that cuts out like 90 percent of like the the you know this like energy and like kind of resources and time and effort that goes into bringing this drink to my you know you know to be able to drink this drink so i just feel like more than ever that was like that was the big wake-up call that was my going into space moment was realizing for every single product every shirt every pair of boxers every sock that i own how much goddamn like effort labor travel resources goes into it and realizing that that's not gonna be the way um that's not gonna be the way forever and like this kind of like 3d printing you know like sort of basically manufacturing just in time at the end point and cutting out a whole bunch of these like factories and warehouses and all that other stuff that needs to happen was my big wake-up call i want to ask you about then what else is there that you can do that for but before that have you ever gotten into the buy it for life movement you have i told you about that um no but i think i understand it from that what is it it's like an eco-friendly way of like buying yeah well i don't it doesn't have to be rooted in eco-friendly uh it's not for me but it's a perk there's a subreddit that i subscribe to it's called buy it for life and what you do is the the idea is just how do you just consume less stuff and how do you just buy the best of something that hopefully can last forever so an example uh do you remember as a kid did your mom ever have a kitchenaid mixer yes okay so kitchenaid mixer kitchenaid's a brand the mixer like it's the thing with the bowl underneath it and like the arm that goes above it and spins those are like six hundred dollars they're really expensive but they're famous for lasting like a lifetime like you can use an antique one and it works just as good and another example is if you're gonna buy like a a coat like there's like um you can maybe buy a really fancy leather coat and you're willing to spend two thousand dollars as opposed to buying a 300 one because it could like last forever as long as you fit in it or patagonia it actually does that too they'll fix your stuff forever or um there's like a bunch of furniture there's a bunch of shoes like different types of shoes you can buy it instead of them whenever they wear down instead of throwing throwing them away you can just get them fixed and so it's the idea of like how do you buy one thing forever and it hopefully can last forever or buy one thing one time and it'll last forever i feel like you do stuff like this ben do you do you have like objects that you uh stuff that you buy that's like meant to to sort of last i don't know why my hunch just tells me you do the funny thing is my dad does this but not out of like um like environmental justice ideas but just like because he's crazy that way of like he drove the same car for 22 years and just like couldn't bring himself to buy a new car and always shines his shoes because he's owned the same shoes for like 40 years and so that like kind of got ingrained in me as like a good way to live and so i do do this a little bit it's awesome it's fun and also like some of your [ __ ] as you wear it patinas it actually looks cooler right now you're good at doing this which is you identify these like lifestyle trends it's like do you know there's some people that are like you know not eating food anymore they're just drinking whatever uh soylent or you know like you know there's people that just micro dose lsd every day and like these are kind of famous examples now but i feel like you've told me about like 30 of these in the time that we've been friends and they're like dude have you seen this like you know subreddit called you know fat fire or whatever it's like you always have these like you you like pick up pretty quickly on like there's this weird not even weird it's just like there's a group of people that are deciding to like live under a different sort of like paradigm or different motto or creed and actually that i think you just like because it's interesting but that also is like one of the best ways to build a business around that lifestyle because you can speak to that audience you could differentiate differentiate a product super easily to that crowd and i i seek the i seek those things out so there's a bunch of things that i i don't agree with or i don't i don't want to live my life that way but i love just like seeing it i like seeing how basically i love freaks i like weirdos i consider myself a weirdo and i love a good freak show i just love i'll see it like i remember the first time like three years ago i went to my friend's house and he didn't have a microwave i'm like what you know microwave he's like well it's bad for this reasons and i was like you're a freak like mike we all have microwaves you're the weirdo and then you start thinking about i'm like well okay tell me why why do you think you might be right and i'm like okay maybe there's a point there or like uh my friends a lot of my friends now refuse to use plastic tupperware or plastic anything that you eat with and i'm like well why i just put my thing in microwave who cares and so like there's a bunch of little things like that that i love learning about yeah i remember when justin mirrors came on you you were like let me guess you don't have a microwave in your house he's like yep and i was like that's a [ __ ] weird spot-on question to ask somebody that i don't think you knew the answer to ahead of time and then that got me thinking about that this this exact lifestyle you're talking about in fact moyes um so moyes started native deodorant which was around one of these trends which was people wanted an all-natural paraben-free aluminum-free deodorant and he saw that on etsy that was like a really high selling item but it was like in the etsy kind of handmade artisan goods like bubble and his bet was that people once you kind of speak to that value system of like not having x they might be willing to pay more and be become a like switch deodorant brands if you like built a brand around it he recently tweeted something he goes billion dollar idea water that has not touched plastic so it's a water brand that has only been like in glass containers or like you know basically like from the whatever the mountain that this was gotten it hasn't touched plastic until it's reached your lips and um and i thought that was funny it's like this this plastic thing is is uh real a lot of people are anti plastics uh yeah so that means like for every product where plastic is core there's going to be a alt product where plastic is not not like not used so whether it's tupperware or like for me i drink water out of you know we get those big five gallon jugs or whatever delivered the house out of a dispenser that that's a plastic container it's sitting in the whole time until i drink it right so it's just a giant water bottle and so there's like there's there's these trends where you can look at okay where is there like if there's an anti-plastic tran where is there plastic and can i create an alternative if there's a plant-based vegan trend how do i make alt milks alt meat alt whatever right that becomes like a blueprint to building a great business so there's a few companies out right now you might know their names i'm going to try and look them up but basically uh there's this trend amongst products that you use daily that you run out of so like toothpaste laundry detergent uh advil bottles things where the bottle isn't is just like a way to get it to you but it's kind of [ __ ] that you have to throw it away and so they're making all these products where they send you one package and then they send you like whenever you need it just a re something to refill it like lit or like literally something you pour into it um do you know what they're called you know what i'm talking about but i've seen this for toothpaste um and i think it's a great idea i think this is incredible i love it there's this idea um and i at first i thought it was small i think moyes was the one who told me i'm pretty sure he said it's like killing it um you don't know what i'm talking about i forget what it is uh no i don't know the name uh i'll have to look up what it is but they're crushing it i know there's like um four cleaners i think there's one called blue land i think doesn't blue land do this is it blue yeah i know you're talking about yeah and it's like chemical free containers and then they send you one container and then they you you order something and they i don't know exactly how they send it to you but you just like pour it into the thing right send you a plastic pouch that you throw away yeah yeah i think it's like less less bad um by the way speaking of these kind of like niche crazy people i got two for you so one is we talked i think about um anti-r anti-work did we talk about that on the podcast i don't know i don't think we talked about it but it pisses me off so there's r anti-work which you should explain that and then i have another one that's the the counter to it so first explain anti-work i don't even entirely know how to explain it it was i'll tell you the background from what if i remember correctly it was started eight years ago but uh like in the last three years since the pandemic is when it really got popular it was made up of a lot of people who were waiters and waitresses and they were pissed off at how they were being treated and it started out as like a labor movement thing like we need higher wages we need this now it's like got 8 million 10 million subscribers on the subreddit and it's people complaining about like you know my manager said that like they fired me because i told them i was busy when i needed to come in and they just basically [ __ ] on anything where it's like demanding of of workers and so i think so so here's their here's i think their stated thing ben you tell me if i'm being too harsh on it if you find a more generous explanation but here's what it says it is a subreddit for those who want to end work are curious about ending work and want to get the most out of a work-free life the subreddit has cracked over 1.4 million members by the end of 2019 which has got to be a lot more than that by now it's eight million now and it went it was one point oh my god i think one went viral after a warehouse worker posted a screenshot of a text that they sent their boss and then that basically made other workers the other workers like kind of like saw that where inspired did the same and it was part of this like you know the great resignation that people were talking about and there was like this funny clip where they put they took a mod from arsenal's anti-work and they went on fox news i don't know have you seen it yeah and this the person got destroyed it was embarrassing it's like anti-work person gets destroyed by you know fox anchors like the video which i didn't like i hate when they do that this person clearly like is not that smart i think and like it's very easy to set them up to look silly in that in those cases the subreddit also didn't like it because they were like dude horrible representation of us on tv um did not articulate our points and um you know why did you go on there like this movement is not about you getting your personal fame you know to like do this um we kind of i think they had some rules around like we're not going to do appearances or speak to the media unless we kind of agree on what the message is um and so this person went rogue i guess and did that but but they basically embarrassed themselves but they were like yeah i just don't want to work and then guys like okay cool so like you know you don't want to work at all or like no i like i want to be able to do what i want to do so what do you want to do it's like i want to teach people i is going to be i want to be a teacher and he's like you want to be you want to be a teacher you know should we let you teach basically was kind of like the the end point that they were kind of making but anyway so this there's anti-work which went viral then there's have you seen r overworked no what's that it's the exact opposite it's people who are using the pandemic that kind of remote work lifestyle to be like they call it having the multiple jobs at once so um like their lingo is like oh yeah my j1 which is like my job one it's like j1 has great benefits and so i'm just picking up my j2 and j2 i'm just going to do 10 hours a week with this this and this and i'm going to use that to invest in these things right so it's people scheming together about how to work multiple jobs at once and as remote workers oftentimes it seems like without the employers knowing that there are other jobs so they're like being simultaneously employed without being super overt about i think that's the message i could be wrong on that and um it's people who are trying to get to financial freedom faster by saying like yeah like actually i have the capacity to do like multiple jobs um you know instead of sort of spending 40 hours a week on one job it's like i can actually do a good job in 20 hours a week on two jobs and get paid that's the optimistic way to look at it the probably realistic way like i'm looking at the top title and it says j my j3 job forgot about me today and they say i started my j3 yesterday if i started i mean i was giving an orientation on zoom and no one showed up so now i'm just sitting here on the payroll right yeah yeah there's other people are like yeah let's beat the system um and so there's like basically a counter movement but that kind of always happens there's like a there's like the movement and then there's the counter movement that comes shortly after and like it kind of polarizes and then there's a mainstream which just does things the way they've been doing them and they don't really pay too much attention to this stuff and so um you know that that's kind of common for for many many uh many many of these movements i think subreddits are a great place to look for that [Music] you

[Music] this one comes from dylan dylan asks how do you negotiate the value of the company you're selling so how did you come up with the price how did you get to a price with you with your company when you sold it i made a huge mistake i made a classic mistake i said the number first i said these companies typically sell for blank x and blank x and of course the first offer they asked you like what's your what are your expectations or what's a brain what do you what price would you be happy with what are they how do they ask it i don't even know if they asked it but i said oh you know i think i said like look like it's i'm not i said i'm not gonna mess around like so these companies typically sell for blank to blank so if you're in the market let me know and the first offer was the low number of that and last offer was it the high number or somewhere in the middle in the well so it was in the middle but like the thing is is that when we sold the company the hubspot stock was 350 and basically a week later it was like you could look it up it was like 550 and then like three months after that it was like 850 right so like it changed the sale price was one thing but it pretty much changed quickly but it was like right in the middle of that number but um i made a huge mistake i should not have done that and as soon as i said that i was like [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] and you say you get an email did i say it an email i think you said i think i don't know it sounds like the story you're sending it you saying you said it in an email i don't remember uh no i think i said it on the phone and there's the woman who i'm now friends with who was doing the deal [ __ ] lashed onto that like a shark and she told and i knew it and afterwards i i i'm friends with her now she doesn't even work out spot and i'm like you you got me a badge like yeah like you said the number and the great thing to do is after you negotiate a deal go talk to the person once you're once your pals and you're on the same team say look we're on the same team for sure uh but man negotiating that was so you know confusing for me uh what did i do poorly you know like what would you have what do you think you would have gone up to make me hate myself what would you what do you think you could have gone up to and you just ask a bunch of questions to try to suss out what got them interested what made them hesitant how they figured out the value what they were willing to negotiate to what mistakes you made in negotiation because you get so few reps at negotiating it's important to do that but it sounds like to answer dylan's question you did two things you said first you looked up comparables so you found out comparable sales so that's how you got a range and then you made the [ __ ] up in your actual negotiation of that range to like you you you actually set up the proper range and it probably cost me it cost me many millions of dollars right it's like that one decision you made actually was more important than like the previous two years of operating probably yeah yeah how did you do it um we i did not say a number right away um i [ __ ] up in one regard which was i let my emotion so when we so the way we decided to sell was there was nobody coming knocking on our door saying you we need to buy you you're the best uh we we we're we want to be in the business of you i was basically frankly i saw the writing on the wall for my business i was like okay i think this is not zero but it's not gonna be huge so what do i wanna do do i wanna ride out a middle of the pack like small like medium sized outcome for the next five years or can i just go flip this thing now and i decided i wanna go flip this thing now i was also really tired because i had been doing i've been trying to find product market fit with different startups in our idea lab for like six years i was ready for a change in general and so i told my investor my co-founder i said hey i want to sell this thing i think it's time and they were like okay if you want to sell then let's sell and i said all right let me let me run a process i'm going to try to sell this in the next 45 days so first that was good because i time boxed it but i also you know like uh it added a lot of pressure and so the mistake i made when i was figuring out how how to sell i was i let my emotions of the day dictate how i sold how how hard i sold the company so what does that mean at first i was super confident they're going to want to buy us so i went to two or three companies with my super like swagged out uh like cocky cocky like pitch basically which was sort of like yeah everybody wants us but like you know so if you guys are interested you know you you basically like uh you got to let us know because this is moving fast with you know these other people so you we we got approached we're interested we might go that path you're either going to get on the train now or you're going to miss it so i was like kind of cocky confident that was like working but then like two days would go by where like somebody you know they didn't text me back or they said they were gonna review the thing and email me and they didn't email me so then i started to i have doubt creep into my head a little bit so then i would like kind of like it's like a booty call like desperation reach out to some other company and so one of them was i reached out to facebook through somebody i know and i was sort of like hey like you know we're going to sell this thing i used the word aquahire which was like the wrong word to say because aquahire means a specific range of what outcome you're going to get and it basically means don't value my company just value my talent and um i shouldn't have done that i should not have said that there i was luckily able to recover because it was such a big company that by the time he made the intro to the person who made the intro i had like changed the narrative completely but the third guy was like yeah you guys looking at aquarius like i don't know where the [ __ ] you got that no and it's like i literally had sent an email and you know with myself saying that but i luckily was able to change it and actually they they came in with the facebook camera with the highest offer and so we and so i ended up recovering from that mistake but that could have been critically bad would you wish you would have taken the facebook offer no uh like the amazon offer ended up working out great but um you know whatever it was a good deal uh in the end i guess but but that was the main thing and i didn't have a comparable i didn't have comparables really i kind of the comparables i heard were such a huge range but i was like okay i just need to forget i heard any of those numbers because it's too wide of a range it just means like it depends and so then i started negotiating i didn't say the number first and we waited till we got offers they tried to get a number out of us but i was like not gonna do it and um i was anchoring in other ways besides saying the specific number i was like leaving little hints or kind of just like you know just making sure they knew that we had other interests and eventually once we got one offer i was like okay that's a ballpark and then i basically just texted the ceo of twitch and i was like hey i'm gonna take this other offer unless you can match and uh he's like you know give me some time let me give me some time i was like i don't have time he's like give me an hour and i was like okay i'll give you the hour and uh and then he came back with an offer that wasn't quite a match but it was good enough where i said okay all other factors considered we think this is the best because they were going to take more of our team and other stuff that the other one wasn't going to do it's such a stressful period yeah it's such a stressful period yeah nobody teaches you how to do this and it's like the most important thing you'll do as the ceo of your company is land the plane but it's like being a pilot and you learned everything about takeoff and flight and you've never heard anyone mention how the [ __ ] you're supposed to land and so you're like just kind of pointing downwards and you're trying to land the thing based on like instinct and then like a few fuzzy messages you get from mentors or you use like if you use an investment bank it's different but we were not at that size you got to be doing like 50 million to 100 million minimum in your sale price to be um to have a banker who does it for you dude i had this roommate named james and like he was like a stoner pothead and like like the first day of work at his new job he went and he had a teacher that said i heart weed i just really think i love wheat instead of i love new york and uh he um he was negotiating a salary for a company vungle jack's company that i introduced him to and he'd been on unemployed for 10 months and he'd been struggling to find a company that he wanted to work at and i think he was using like his mom's credit card to pay the bills because i would get like uh his statements and like so i thought like maybe things were going south for him i'm like dude i don't know if you have much money left i don't know how you're gonna pay rent and vungle made him an offer for like a hundred and ninety thousand dollars to be an engineer at their company and he told me and he goes are you are you gonna take it and he like exhales weed and he was like i don't know man i'm not sure if it's worth my time i'm going to make him sweat a little bit and he i was like james are you kidding me dude i'm like you don't have any money you've been interviewing and talking to kids for 10 months you're screwed he goes yeah let's make him sweat and i get a phone call from the recruiter who i introduced him to and like he goes dude james is like a hot engineer right now like i don't know if we're gonna be able to land him like he's just bargaining so hard and i don't think we're gonna get this guy and i was like i put the phone down like oh james do you hear what they're [ __ ] saying you better come to an agreement soon and i go well you know just give him what he wants like who knows give what he wants you just gotta land him and i hung up and they ended up upping his offer and he negotiated from a place of having nothing and you didn't care at all and i learned from him that day that that's actually a really good place to negotiate from so long as you're willing to accept these horrible consequences yeah i got to actually say that that was the most useful thing like how we sold our company was i was totally okay if nobody bought it because i was kind of excited about just ending it and going and doing something completely different like i was kind of like a maniac in that way i was like okay look if i got zero millions out of this if i got zero dollars i'm actually kind of excited about that path too so i was like pretty free in that way whereas i think you had a real business that was producing real revenues and profits you didn't have that option of like not a good like you know not getting a good offer you needed i felt that way though where i was like i'm done i'm out i was like like i just i need to get out of here so i i felt this the same way as you uh and i'll learn a little bit differently how to run things so you don't get burnt out [Music] you

i don't know if you know this but warren buffett made like 97 of his wealth after the age of 55. um so so it all happens very slowly he started in his 20s or whatever and he wasn't really well known until the 90s and the same thing happened with us where we didn't really talk about what we did people would meet us and they'd be like oh you're some schmoes from victoria who owns some digital agency you seem to own all these really boring businesses you know whatever and so it requires being kind of underestimated and dismissed and playing a very boring game while watching everyone else go and make you know tens of millions billions of dollars taking risk in startups meanwhile we're just going how do we take you know a hundred grand and make 10 15 20k a year on that money and just keep compounding and so basically the mental model was take 70 of our profits and constantly reinvest take the other 30 live a nice life and that number went down over time and yeah you do that for 17 years and it turns into a you know a big number [Music] and something that you wanted to talk about today was whether it's better to own 100 of something and bootstrap it or to give up equity for to partners whether that's for sweat equity or money or money but you uh we were talking about that and i asked my audience companies that were bootstrapped and quite big and there's a few that are doing billions a year in revenue and i noticed two commonalities one a lot of the things that were bootstrapped to be really big they were things that were easy to take bake loans against so it's a lot of restaurant stuff so maybe they took like loans against some equipment or they took loans against a building they owned things like that the second thing was i've noticed that there's a lot of agencies that were bootstrapped and became pretty substantial size agencies or agencies or service-based businesses so like recruiting uh companies um um it services things like that where it's basically you bill out people's time for 100 and you charge 300 or something like that well think about it you don't need especially if you're a young person and you can cut you got enough money to live for a year you can go and start an agency because at the end of the day it's you go and sell you win a contract as soon as you win the contract you go and find a developer or you do the work yourself and then before you know it you're cash flowing and you're always able to hire people just in time for the work and so at the end of the day there's really no burn and it's very capital efficient and you don't need uh you don't even need an office anymore i mean we we almost never had an office and oh you know over time we had you know a couple small ones or whatever but the big [ __ ] up a lot of these big agencies make is they start starting like these fancy humongous five million dollar offices in new york and san francisco and spain and you know whatever um they're they're great businesses if you run them right and how many people work at meta lab now i think it's about 170. how often do you say to yourself i'm not sure if the the headache is the headache of having 170 employees is always worth it well it's very abstracted for me right i haven't been in the business for five or six years and the way we run tiny now is that we meet with the ceo once a year and otherwise they check in whenever they need help with anything and so when i was running it like first it's exhilarating running an agency is awesome when you're starting out you get a seat at the table and all these places you don't deserve to be right i was like a 22 year old pip squeak and i was meeting the founders of pinterest and slack and you know all these amazing places and they were asking me for my opinion right it was it was crazy but at a certain point you get so exhausted you're making a good amount of money you don't want to get on a plane to san francisco every second day to go and sell and at that point you know it starts to become a much more intensive business and for me personally i don't enjoy running businesses after about 15 or 20 people and so once i hit that point i knew i needed to transition to a ceo so when we were in the document you say the pros and cons of bootstrapping and owning 100 what do you have under those well i mean i think that i've changed my opinion a lot on this like when i first started i was like a jason freed david hannemeyer hanson acolyte like 100 every business should be bootstrapped i now think that's crazy and stupid and i think there's certain businesses where it's insane not to raise money right like if you have an opportunity to grow your business it's like the analogy i always use is if you own a bakery and there's a line out the door and you have a single oven and you need to buy three more ovens but you don't have the money and in order to service the people in the line you need to buy two more ovens it's crazy not to raise money or go get debt or something i just was never in that position and i think you know owning a hundred percent or owning majority in your business it's like a dictatorship and dictatorships can be very good uh like lee kuan yew from singapore or they can go terribly like kim jong-un right and the question is what's your personality and what's going to work for you i mean you can move insanely fast there's no board there's no committee you don't owe anyone anything you don't have an outcome you know you don't have to ipo you don't have to sell and you have total integrity like when chris and i buy a business we can look people in the eye and be like we're cutting a check like this is us right that's very different on the cons i mean you're on an island you don't have anyone to really who's aligned and cares and can tell you you're being an idiot and so you can really drive your business off the rails and then you also think in a limited way i mean i know so many entrepreneurs who could 10x their business but they're so addicted to their dividends or they're conservative and so they don't so what about this transformation [Music] i raised money for our podcasting software company supercast i'm going to raise money for our news business like there are situations where it's logical [Music] all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are what about that conversation of employees employees saying they want equity and you don't get well it's just there's certain businesses there's certain businesses where we do and there's certain ones where we don't right and the big question is what i always say to a to an employee is equal risk equal reward and if the business is going to sell at some point or we think it can ipo great we'll love to talk about equity but there's a cost to it right if you want to make 300 grand a year and you don't want to give up any of that 300 grand in order to get stock options or buy equity then it doesn't matter so i love i love giving people the option and saying look you can either give up some of your comp or upside or whatever and we'll give you stock options or you can get the big salary and prioritize cash and a lot of people prioritize comfort and cash i find at least you know outside of the bay area by the way andrew you mentioned the guy from singapore sam do you know this guy leak on you uh i know a little bit about him i didn't realize he was a dictator i thought they called him like the ceo or something no he's literally a dictator so like a good the good dictator andrew can you give us like the two minutes uh two-minute kind of summary of who this guy is and why he's awesome so effectively he took over um singapore is like an island tropical island state um in asia and at the time it was like rice paddies poverty like a bog and he literally took it over you know had an autocracy had total control and he basically thought like a business person and was like okay how do we make this the most business friendly place how do we optimize taxes how do we ensure we have hyper competent government how do we pay government really really well uh how do we incentivize the whole world to manufacture and export you know their products from here and basically built it into asia's kind of outside of hong kong i think it's like the central banking and finance uh hub in asia so it's a pretty incredible story and i think he his background is like he's like a math and computer science guy right like he he doesn't come from kind of this like you know uh political background like he came from a different sort of background and i think that's why you got different ideas from from a leader in charge totally you want to tell me you also had something i was going to say you had one thing you tweeted out uh that's related to how you run the business at tiny which is this this higher one higher 10 uh framework what what is that because that sounded interesting to me and i think that that's like uh from what i understood it was a pretty useful concept so explain that yeah so our ceos get super annoyed because i say this all the time it's probably the number one thing i say uh and it's probably the biggest hack that enabled us to build tiny over the last eight years um so i mean think about it like this so if you had an army general who is commanding a thousand troops but he's still telling individual soldiers what to do and he's personally restocking their ammunition and he's shuffling people around you'd be like what the hell is this guy doing right but i think a lot of people operate their business like this i mean i certainly did in the early days i would swoop and poop and you know instead of hiring a vp marketing i would go and i'd hire a whole bunch of marketing people and just kind of become the vp of marketing and or i'd bypass people and tell people what to do and what i realized is you should never ever hire the 10 people you should always focus on hiring the one person so that could be a ceo who will then go out and hire all the executives or could be hiring an executive who will hire an entire team but uh it's just it's such a hack right it's like 80 20. how do i do 20 of the work for 80 of the result um and uh yeah i mean it took me ages to figure this out i feel like i've only cracked this in the last like five years and i still chris will still catch me in this he'll be like higher you know higher one to higher 10. but when you hire that mistake all the time and when you hire that one person how much so let's say your business is doing uh let's say 1 million in revenue it's small no let's say a little let's say 10 million in revenue 2 million in in like actual cash flow you have you hire that one person you pay him a lot of money 250 000 do you only hire that 250 000 person when you know for a fact you've got budget for like two more people yeah that i mean that's my approach that's why i've shifted to is like i hire you know here's an example is like we hired the ceo of aeropress and he asked me questions oh you know what do you think about this higher that higher and i just said that's your you know that's your hire you know i hired you i trust you 100 you make those hires right and so it's complete delegation of you know when i buy a business i make two decisions who runs it and how are they incentivized and unless they do something dirty or horrible or the business goes to [ __ ] you know i just leave them to it what's the trick on the uh how are they incentivized so so what's the how do you think about that when you buy a business and you say all right the business today is here and i think naturally it's gonna get to there and i'm bringing on this person to get it to be some inflection above that and i also know that things can go wrong so how do you think about that incentive structure is it is it case by case you're coming up with very unique patterns or very unique uh you know packages or do you have kind of one base that you that you go off of it's so different i mean like everyone's incentivized differently there's there's certain people where for example they need to be able to say they're a partner and they have equity there's other people who don't care about that and they want just targets to hit i mean we've done everything from saying okay let's say the business makes a hundred million dollars and it's growing at 15 percent you anything you do over 15 percent growth you get five percent of right that's in its simplest we've also done things where it's like you know hey when the stock price hits x you get a payment and i remember um i got to have dinner with charlie munger like two years ago and i was like what's the perfect you know incentive structure and he just said i've done hundreds and everyone is different and i still don't know what works i think it's really an art not a science because you know different people are just so differently motivated and you actually like steak so you sorry one more sam when it's usually usually when it's like ah it depends there's there's that what that usually means is the winning formula is different a lot but there's usually a common losing formula so what is the common losing formula for incentives the common losing formula is them not being aligned on risk so for example if they're able to use my money and i can keep injecting money into the business but it in no way hurts them so for example they don't get diluted or they don't have to pay a high interest rate or you know if it goes bankrupt they don't lose anything that's a huge problem and i've learned that over the last five years and so now what i try and do is if somebody wants equity i always make them write a check right or or i loan them money and it's literally a personal loan guaranteed by their house or something right and it's got it doesn't i don't want it to be so much money it's going to ruin them or be a problem but i i if someone wants equity i'm like okay you got to put up something because if the business fails or goes down you gotta have a sense of loss people feel a lot that people feel lost more than they feel gain i just imagine the wilkinson moving truck coming in from the house they're like no honey it's all gone wrong you have to come when you put your own furniture your own art on the walls they get to live there but they have to know that it's your house now and they truly we have [ __ ] we have done it we i obviously you know i never want to do that and it's always structured in a way where it's not you know we're not going to have to take their car or something but i just want i want a feeling of like there's got to be some downside you know sam is going to take this like way too far he's going to take their car and it's like a punch plus like i get to punch you just because if you lose my money i'm going to punch you [Laughter] yeah i love this game you uh you also speaking of that of risk you also hire people really early you told me um i don't know if you talked about those but you were tinkering around with this bake do you want to talk about the bait can you mention the bakery or no yeah well the bakery is kind of sad no sorry not the bakery the ghost kitchen ghost kitchen you tinkered with this thing where you hired a baker and you were making stuff to sell on doordash and ubereats and i don't know if it was entirely illegal so we don't think about it but the point i'm bringing up is that well no i can i can i can tell well tell the story then let me ask my question sure so basically you know i'm pretty interested in health and stuff and i was trying to get off sugar and so i went to a baker friend and i was like look can you try and make like like sugar-free cookies using modern you know there's always like crazy modern sugars like you guys have heard of magic spoon yeah yeah like magic spoon uses uh allulose and stevia and monk fruit and stuff so he started making these and i was like okay these are like not as good as a chocolate chip cookie but they're like 90 percent there and i bet you a lot of people would be into this as like a replacement like think about halo top it doesn't taste as good as ice cream you can eat a [ __ ] load of it and it's not bad for you in the same way so i basically made that we started making all these treats we were cooking it out of our office which is not technically legal um and what happened was um i got a call from island health which is like the local health authority and they just said hey you're using an ingredient that's not approved in canada and unfortunately allulose has not approved in canada and so you just legally can't serve food with it even though it's generally regarded as safe and everything um so i'm still gonna do it at some point i think but i just legally can't it sucks and i've never it's insane to me you can hit up against these regulatory issues like imagine being a real estate developer and like you have this amazing vision and then city council is just like nope yeah like that is insane to me as an internet entrepreneur and that's what i was gonna ask so you like hired a baker to do it but then also with your uh newsletter business your local news business you hi i forget the guy's name but he's i've talked to him a bit he's a nice guy you've hired him to be the ceo and so you you hire people pretty yes and you you hire people pretty early on and hiring someone to do something to me is a huge risk because in my head i'm like man if this guy's got a kid like i'm like his kids now kind of my kid too um you know like it's like a big risk if he's quitting it that's how i felt when my when my one of my first employees got married i was like oh i've got a family now um because i was like some of the decisions i make are going to impact this entire family and that's really stressful and it's also a huge conversation to convince someone who's in their 30s 40s or whatever and they're even in their late 20s to leave their fancy gig at salesforce to bail and come to my company that i'm going to pay them 45 000 that's a huge thing i i go when i go to bed at night that stresses me out but you seem like you overcome that pretty easily you hire people relatively early and you're like yeah it's no big deal i'm just going to hire this person what's that like like what are you thinking when you do that [Music] all right what's going on just a quick break a quick interruption scroll down into the description box on youtube and you're gonna see a link to the hustle the hustle is a daily email it gives you all you need to know about business and tech news i started it years ago um and it's awesome it's kind of how this podcast got started so check it out the hustle scroll down do it well i've lost i've i've messed that up a lot and i think you guys know my whole story about losing 10 million dollars building project management software like that was a perfect example where i got ahead of myself the business didn't make sense and i threw a bunch of spaghetti at the wall and none of it stuck and i had to let a whole bunch of people go and it was really horrible and sad and you know it was like a 10-year slow death right so i've been through that so now it's more with the amount of scar tissue i have i've enough i have enough signal where i can be like okay i'm going to try this and with the bakery i was just contracting a friend right that was the best example i said this is an experiment with the news business i actually ran it for three years before i partnered with farhan and he took over as ceo and by that point there was enough signal it was slapping me in the face i was like this is a big opportunity and is that the case with all with all the things that you start we take that yeah usually like if i if i go and i i hire a ceo i'm pretty high conviction that there's something there or there's already a business that supports has cash flow what i would never do is be like hey there's uh you know i have an idea for this i'll just go hire a ceo like i i would never do that andrew i feel like you've reached this point and i used to be like how did these [ __ ] do this where i remember i was doing a startup it was so hard to get my one thing to work and then i would meet people who were like oh yeah so i have that past success then i have my current success and then here's my three side successes that i had this idea and then we just started doing it and then guess what the lines out the door and then this other one it's like kind of cool we just started it you know like i accidentally you know my hand just fell on my keyboard and i accidentally wrote this app it was amazing it went viral and this other thing that i just tweeted about and then this all coming together nicely and i just remember being like what do they know something i don't know is there just like extreme luck component and i felt that way for many years five six years straight when i was pushing the boulder up the hill with my startup and then i now have experienced exactly what the thing that i was most jealous of and i have no idea what switched in between where like the last five things i've tried have all worked and all worked pretty much immediately and it doesn't matter how big or small like you know whether it's like the podcast or the course or uh you know my e-commerce business or my the new milk road newsletter business like each of these has just worked straight away in a bigger way than anything i'd ever done before um with less work and less stress than like the old stuff i used to do and i have no idea what changed or i have a kind of an inkling but i don't really know sam have you ever thought about this or you know what i'm talking about what do you think i know i know exactly what you're talking about and i completely agree you're on a roll right now um and what's your inkling i i have a feeling my my my answer is it's kind of like a shitty it's like a mindset like abundance attitude and being on being on offense versus defense but what's your what's your what's your inkling so my inkling is that i switched up my situation so like i was in one situation for a very long time like it was a nice situation very nice situation but it was like where i was going to this office every day working with these people in this hierarchy with this boundary box of like what project or projects we can work on and like what success might look like and as soon as i got out of that i was just me i was like oh okay so now that it's just me that i have to look out for i guess i could just do a podcast i didn't have to have like this big venture billion dollar outcome i didn't have 20 engineers to go tell what to do i had no engineers so i just did what i could do with no engineers which was like i'll do a podcast i'll do a course i'll do i'll just try to get big on twitter let's see what happens and oh you know like five tweets go viral and boom got 200 000 followers it's like there's these things that i just wasn't doing before because i think before i had a really set thing of like here's what i need to do like here's the only way to win and i had like almost too much ammo i had like too many people at my disposal too much funding too much everything and because of that i had a very narrow window of what could work and so i was just trying to come up with ideas that might work versus oh let me just try this because i'm i just kind of want to try it and then when once i got into i just kind of want to try it and i didn't have it i didn't have to worry about what other people thought or i didn't have to come in and manage anybody in that day and tell them what to do i didn't have like investors to go pitch to i just did the thing and then all of a sudden i feel like you know sort of like all the talents and skills that i had been building up over the past 10 years like finally got to just do them yeah don't you think it's like dating or something though where it's like you know you date a couple crazy girls and it's really exhilarating and then over time you're like wow that was horrible and there's pattern matching you're like okay when i go to a restaurant and a girl is rude to the waiter that's a no right and in the same way with business you go oh okay like i used to think i wanted to build all these kinds of businesses but those were 10 foot hurdles i don't want to jump 10 foot hurdles i want to jump one foot hurdles and so if you think about it all the stuff you're doing they're in your you know circle of competence and they're relatively simple to execute they don't require a lot of people they don't require funding i think learning that is like a 15-year overnight success kind of thing where it just clicks suddenly right and i'll catch myself occasionally getting pulled down rabbit trails of like oh what if i did this crazy you know drone ai startup whatever but then i always go back to base hits and i and i think there's this third component well go ahead you go ahead all right oh my god what's going on all right i'm gonna go there's this third component of of confidence and so i think that because of like my work i've been more confident and i understand like well if i invest a dollar here i think i can make at least uh three dollars the next two years so like just understanding how machines like money making machines work investments but then also i think sean because we get to hang out with we hang out with each other we hang out with andrew we hang out with our circle of friends we hang out with all the people we've had speak at our events we hang out with our um podcast guests it becomes more normal like succeeding has become far more normal than not succeeding actually and not succeeding is just like oh yeah it's going to happen but then you just move on you do the next thing and it's like and then inevitably it works so it's not if it's not when it's if and i think that confidence has actually helped a ton where so for example now if someone wants to like real estate's an an easy one because it's so predictable but with real estate you're like oh man putting a hundred thousand dollars down on this house is a lot of money that's a you know that's six figures it's like well dude but it's going to make 12 it's like well i don't know that and i'm like yeah i know but it's going to do that so you actually want to invest more so like that confidence of just knowing the emotions and knowing the routine and process has actually helped a lot totally yeah the other thing i was gonna say is uh which is what you guys both just said but framed differently is i was taking a shitload of market risk before and now i basically take almost no market risk i just take execution risk and before even if i felt like i executed great which i did i feel like i did and a couple of the projects that we had done and during my like kind of like the the previous startup um the market risk was too high like there was just no it was like inventing a new [ __ ] like a new science you know on a new land and it was just the market risk was way too high now i'm just doing things that are like oh i knew i just know that this works and i just need to do it well so it's like ecommerce is nothing there's no fancy science to it um and i had buddies who did it and i just used their model and i just did my own in my own lane of their model milk road is the hustle but in the crypto lane which is the crypt the lane i like right it's like i just took your blueprint for the hustle and i just copy pasted over here from there i know dude i saw that you literally copy and pasted the twitter handle it was hilarious your twitter description is literally copy i sent you some old resources from the hustle and we call themselves this your smart good-looking friend or something who tells you everything you need to know about you just copy that and you put in a business attack you just put like delete crypto or something like that and actually the thing is it wasn't even you know why it did that uh i remember seven years ago or eight years ago when you first said that to me and the very first like you know like you kind of sat me down you're like look people are not people our age like we don't watch msnbc and like cnn and this stuff for our our information that's not the brand we trust and you you said it you're like i just want to be like they're smart and i remember you said it i shouldn't be like you're smart no [ __ ] friend who just explained tells you what's going on and i was like i like it clicked with me eight years ago and so when it came time to do this i was like that's the exact description the smart no [ __ ] friend i think one more thing andrew is that i look at i i used to you kind of said that andrew and in terms of like financial success which is a big but not only uh measure of success andrew you're like a grand slam at the moment you know you're you're i imagine you're incredibly wealthy and you've built businesses that are incredibly large so by that measure of success you are like way out there and for a while i think i like admit you're like mystical to me where i'm like how is he doing this now it's changed to where i think i acknowledge that you definitely have talent that makes you special you for sure have skills that make you special but really a lot of it is also i don't know what percentage of it is each but let's just say a third a third a third a third of it is well he's just been doing it for like 15 years now or a certain amount of time and he just like took the risk of raising or building the business and then he raised the money a little bit for the fun and so it's not a matter of like how is he doing is doing this it's just like well if i want that life like i probably could do it i just have to dedicate 15 or 20 years and go through the same motions that he does and that may or may not fit the what i like the interesting thing is i don't know if you know this but warren buffett made like 97 of his wealth after the age of 55 um is so so it all happens very slowly he started in his 20s or whatever and he wasn't really well known until the 90s and the same thing happened with us where we didn't really talk about what we did people would meet us and they'd be like oh you're some schmoes from victoria who owns some digital agency you seem to own all these really boring businesses you know whatever and so it requires being kind of underestimated and dismissed and playing a very boring game while watching everyone else go and make you know tens of millions billions of dollars taking risk in startups meanwhile we're just going how do we take you know a hundred grand and make 10 15 20k a year on that money and just keep compounding and so basically the mental model was take 70 of our profits and constantly reinvest take the other 30 percent live a nice life and that number went down over time and uh yeah you do that for 17 years and it turns into a you know a big number um ironically i still feel just as at risk and terrified as i did 15 years ago that's real and i think it's the classic thing of you you're not you're not actually scared i'm scared are you because i have liquidity now and i'm i'm scared but i'm like am i as scared as when i only had twenty thousand dollars in my bank account i can't just say oh no no but it's it's maybe it's different for me because you know i have a an un for if you told me 10 years ago how much you know cash we have or what our cash flow is it would blow my mind and i'd say how could you ever feel at risk the problem is that the stakes are bigger you know we have almost a thousand employees now right so there's a lot more um you know there's the stuff that can go wrong do i feel that i've built out a castle with a whole bunch of moats and stuff yeah absolutely and i'm better diversified than i was 10 years ago but there's still that kind of dust bowl farmer mentality right it's actually something i want to talk about um like just we all kind of have this feeling of like the way i'd put it is i started chopping wood just because i was anxious right like 15 years ago in my backyard and my neighbor pokes his head over the fence and he's like hey can you chop some wood for me for my fire i'll give you 20 bucks and i'm like okay amazing i didn't know this was a business and then before i know it i've hired three or four buddies we're all chopping wood in the backyard we're a merry band we're selling to the whole neighborhood it's awesome i love it and then one day 15 years later i wake up and i'm in a sawmill and i own 15 sawmills and all i do all day is file papers but there's still this part of me that beats myself up for not chopping wood right i still have this mindset even though all the machines do all the labor there's still this part of me that's constantly saying you need to chop wood you need to chop wood and so i think you're gonna you know you you guys have this for sure like it doesn't matter how much you have how diversified whatever it is you have a need to do labor and there's an anxiety that you're harnessing to perform that's a good ass analogy i'm not gonna lie the first 30 seconds while you're explaining it i thought you legitimately took up wood chopping as a hobby and i was like oh that's cool it must be uh cathartic and then i realized i was inside of a charlie munger uh or warren buffet analogy like parable um you have this thing on here that's that's pretty cool bad guys usually win as a bad guy myself i would love to hear yes uh what you mean by this oh man okay so do you think you're a bad guy i've got a story i don't think you're a bad guy go ahead i think a bad guy is a full-on con artist who lies i call myself a bag rather than calling myself a good guy and having all the comments on youtube tell me i'm a bad guy it's easier just to call myself a bad guy and have people tell me the opposite or bad meaning uh not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good that's how it is so i'm sure you guys have had this experience and i'll kind of anonymize this story in this case it's a bad girl bad girls usually win but um so this this happened to me like almost 10 years ago i was really overwhelmed i was running like five businesses i got introduced to this older woman and she had just sold her business for 20 million bucks super successful and she kind of says hey i'll mentor you i'll help you out and so she comes over to my office we start white boarding and i'm just like holy crap this person is a genius she could help me so much and so first she's an advisor and mentor and then eventually she's like hey how about i come in and i'll help you with marketing and sales and so i inject her into the business she starts killing it like business takes off everything going great um but i did zero diligence right she legitimized herself by being this super successful person and because she was so successful i was just grateful to have her she was like a miracle and made all these problems go away for me and then suddenly the cracks started appearing so people started saying she was lying she was spending money in weird ways there you know her expenses were out of control you know staying in crazy hotels all sorts of stuff and it turned out that she was lying and like falsifying documents she hadn't sold her business she wasn't rich or successful and when i called a bunch of people that she'd worked with in the past like a bunch of them had had terrible experiences right so we fired her we move on and i'm in this very odd spot where ethically you know i want to be like okay this is a bad person i want to shoot up a flare and i want to be like everybody watch out right and i'm thinking like okay you know people will diligence her they'll call me you know she she won't be able to keep you know pulling this off um but legally i don't know what it's like in the us but in canada when someone calls you for a reference call you're quite limited you can basically just say you know i wouldn't work with them again and do your diligence and so i usually say and i just want to like i'm not allowed to talk about it and they get the hint right that's smart i i said a bunch of stuff like that like you know i i would never work with this person again it's one of the worst professional experiences of my life whatever but almost always those people go on to work with them and you realize these people are just incredibly charming and they always assume you're the bitter ex-girlfriend right because they've obviously buttered you up and told some story and so this woman you know i see her on linkedin and she's still succeeding and going every year she's somewhere new and you know people like this they don't get super rich they're so short term and if they only knew how much money you could make by not being a crook they would probably be ethical um but it just it was so sad to me and i wanted my sense of justice was like i gotta put a stop to this and you just realize like no like you just have to let go never wrestle a pig you'll both get dirty but the pig will enjoy it and so you know these people are out there and they continue to succeed and unless they're elizabeth holmes and they get you know in the wall street journal they're fine i want to know who the person is i will never say [Laughter] you had another example of a guy at a famous company who you know you had some fraud or you had some issues with people not being honest as well remember you told me that about that one folk i don't know i don't know which one that is i mean look at like you guys talked about um navi and jane uh on a podcast maybe like 10 episodes ago and i mean like there's a perfect example right there's this guy who basically did a pump and dump that's my understanding alleged alleged pump and dump um but these people go on right unless they're criminally indicted and even you know people who are criminally indicted look at michael milken michael milken was literally uh front-running his own investors committing tons of like outright fraud that if you were his investor you would hate went to jail for 10 years and now he's lauded as a philanthropist i mean or how about him always win i mean you know the guy do you guys know uh i think his name is gerbash he's g is what people would call him he's a i think he's indian an indian guy indian american and he started a thing called gravity something what was it called gravity gravity four and then he started another one called like radium blue radium is that what it was and radium radium one and he got arrested he was on oprah as this like you know uh 150 million dollar man under 30 or something like that like the best bachelor most available bachelor all this stuff he's good looking guy he got in trouble three two or three different times both times he basically locked his girlfriend in their apartment and it was there was a camera there i don't know what he was thinking and he was hitting her and just being an i mean just a horrible guy got arrested spent time in in in uh jail months got out raised money again for starting the same company now he's overseas because he's kind of burned all of his bridges here in in san francisco in america he's overseas i think he raised money again for another ad tech company this is the hard part is if someone is a i mean typically someone who does bad things like truly unethical things they're either a psychopath or a narcissist and they're very very charming they're very compelling they're fun to hang out with they're fascinating they're great to listen to it's hard not to like them i mean one one actually heuristic after having that experience is i actually had a company that i looked at investing in and i liked the ceo so much and he was so compelling that i didn't invest because it made me suspicious right or wrong i was just like i left the meeting and i was like i would buy anything from this guy and i just want to give him all my money right now and i stopped myself and i was like this is that feeling don't invest right i probably made a mistake but you know maybe i'm too concerned but it's crazy the same i'm the same way and i'm willing to throw out the good with the bad just to steer clear of the bed because i know how intoxicating that type of grifter is um and you know i've actually put in some like you you talk about air gapping for like you know security purposes i've now done that on on decision making for some investments as well like so andrew you sent out an email to to uh to me say a couple others about a business that you're raising money for and it's a really great email like it's a truly great email i gotta give you a lot of credit and i actually wanted to ask you sam some help me with this i was gonna ask you what goes into writing an email like that it wasn't like oh the writing wow this this uh sentence structure was so fantastic right obviously that helps but it was the thinking it was the way of framing the business and the opportunities telling how you stumbled into the opportunity what time you know like your your analogy to you you can bleep this if you want to chipotle like you really did a good job of framing this business and it was so good in fact that i said i am not going to reply to this for like at least 48 hours because if i read this email i'm going to say give this person my money instantly like rega it was almost like whatever out of 10 the business opportunity was it was a 10 out of 10 like pitch and i actually when i look back at businesses that i invest in that that go on to do well it's usually actually a nine out of ten business opportunity um with a you know sort of five out of ten pitch and in fact it's only midway through the conversation with this person that i'm like oh wait so you basically have x and they're like yeah i'm like well why didn't you just say that and they're like well no i did kind of right and i was like oh dude you have no idea how to pitch your own business but that to me once that happens i know wow i'm actually like i underweighted the opportunity because the pitch was so bad versus overweighting a business opportunity because the pitch is so good and that's become like a standard practice yours was just one example but that's become a standard practice for me of like beware of the 10 out of 10 pitch be aware of the 1010 charm person that you want to hire or that's gonna help you with your business the biggest one that i've seen is you get this uber charming pitch and then you say okay what could go wrong and they say nothing right and you're just like no this is insane this is terrifying i've had like five or six different pitches where that was the one signal and it went to zero or bankrupt or criminal how's the news business going um it's good it's really good actually we just uh hit a profit in my hometown in victoria our first market uh we're now in eight different cities and i'm super stoked about it as you can witness uh based on that email that email how how quickly because you might have a knack for just understanding and framing businesses that's probably a superpower of yours i think he has that how quickly did that come together for you uh how quickly did i write it um well i mean it's something i've been thinking about and kind of talking about a little bit publicly for two or three years now so i had all the analogies and stuff formed um but i mean i wrote that in like an hour or two and then sam just helped me touch it up and then my typical writing structure is i'll write something in the first draft and then i'll sit with it for two weeks or something like that so i sat with it for a week and then finally i sent it out um but it's crazy like i don't know if you guys get this something that drives me insane is i get all these emails from people who are raising money and it's literally just a template like it almost looks like they're sending it out with salesforce or something the formatting is wrong it's generic it's not properly addressed to me and i always think like what i was trying to do with that email is i wanted the first sentence to hook you and so i think the first sentence in that email was in 2019 i was pissed off right and then dave you know line one you're like what's he pissed off about what's going on right there's a bit of a hook nobody knows how to use those copywriting tools to pitch in written form i think a lot of people are very good at pitching um you know in a in an actual pitch setting or whatever um but yeah it's been it's been a great tool to be able to do those tweet storms and emails and stuff the most important sentence of of anything you write it's the it's the first sentence well i love that one what's the line that you said um let me be very clear right you're just like oh [ __ ] like this person means business what's going on here [Laughter] yeah sam is [ __ ] good at this and in fact i made the criminal mistake when i asked you this question which is if you go to michael jordan and you say mike how do you jump so high he'll if he's being nice he'll try to answer something something but it's not going to actually tell you in the same thing how do you know steph steph curry how do you shoot your jump shot to be and how do you shoot better than anybody else uh people who are truly great at something they have very low awareness to the actual like how why and what is making it so great um and there there is a way to ask questions about greatness but it's not how do you do the thing you're great at uh because people will sort of fumble around and they'll try to tell you something but it really has nothing to do with with how they do the great thing like for example what you did great in that uh email was first you decided to not make it a template that decision probably comes from you some of you you're some way that you view the world and like that you know observation you had about pitches that we're coming to that most people just don't have the second thing was when you framed the business you used the analogy of like these local franchises that was because you had studied other other great businesses just for fun you probably studied the business of chipotle and mcdonald's and other businesses not that you were ever going to start a restaurant but you stored that somewhere in the recesses of your mind and so when you saw something else that was a local franchise you knew how to like apply that and and so like you know it's very hard to actually describe what goes into the art of making that happen right um well not only that but being able to communicate emote you know why does this have a competitive advantage and in this email i kind of go through the history of the news business local news why local news is so much more uh white has a better moat right and you think about it you go why would that be interesting you know 50 000 people to 300 000 person cities that seems like a small market but in reality it's the stuff nobody wants you're fishing where the fish are off the beaten but and you can dominate a local market you've always done this so i actually read your email um when i was when you sent it to me in google drive and i was like oh this is really good i'm gonna because i was putting together this course where i just like aggregate good writing and i send it to people and i was like i gotta i'm gonna use some more of his stuff let's see what's out there and i went and read all your stuff on medium and i think there's like 10 or 12 things or something and you follow the same format over and over again which you it's it's you clearly are influenced by warren buffett and uh you're influenced by like traditional storytelling techniques but if you go to your medium you're actually uh pitching your business on medium constantly you're just not actually there's just no call to action so you don't actually care if it seals a deal but there's like things where your cat you have a headline called so you didn't mean to do this but you could have done this so it could have been we're raising a million dollars for our company but instead you made the headline we're um uh you you the headline was joe rogan could be the world's first podcasting billionaire is that what it was that was that it no it was he got rid of joe rogan first is joe rogan got ripped off which is funny because he just signed 120 million dollars yeah that's what it was counter so that was it was a good ass headline and then you explain so that the emotion there was shock which always does really well so you're shocked like what the hell you're saying that he got low ball a hundred dollars is so much money and you're like no you see it's nonsense you see howard cern does this rokin could have done this it just so happens that we have a company that does that that's how i know about it and then like if you wanted a call to action so you have your attention interest desire already there if you want your action to make this a full ada formula you could have been like ps4 of course you can't do this it's illegal but you go to the ps we're raising money for our company and see this is this is like you've you've always said like the most valuable skill is copyrighted i think both you guys have said that like a hundred percent i i chuck up the only reason meta lab worked was because we would pick fights we'd write these controversial articles and we knew how to like we i i if there's one thing i'm good at it's just like taking um taking a boring topic and just finding a wedge and getting people going on it and that always results in people knowing of you and passing your name around and you become a topic of conversation and it led in our case to lots of client work and other stuff so i if i think everyone needs to read the book made to stick that was the book that like really clicked for me i don't know if you guys are very chip heath out of stanford we talk about this totally and it's that one that first line the first line just has to hit you the um the best thing you do so so i think uh if i was going to break it down the middle of your writing is is like inspired by or influenced by you know some ways warren buffett but you're his stuff is very dry right warren buffett grew up without the clickbait generation he doesn't need to to do that uh but like 37 signals so like dhh or jason freed like to me your writing is so similar to theirs that i can tell you know that was like a you know pretty major influence on it and one thing that they do amazingly well is they they will basically pick a fight while simultaneously taking the moral high ground and i think you do that amazingly well too what i mean by that is you'll say like you know joe rogan got ripped off but you're not you're not criticizing joe rogan you're actually saying uh you know joe you you sold yourself short and you know an artist and a creator like you should not sell yourself short for some to some company who's gonna take advantage of you here and so you're taking the moral high ground while picking you know going against the grain and like sort of doing a call out which is amazing most call outs just basically it's somebody you know slingshotting from the crowd and you know they're sort of a sniper that's like you know angry at them and so i've never been able to do this but i've noticed that you do this and thirty seven students does this amazingly well they say facebook is overvalued and they'll talk about why facebook is overvalued and then they'll talk about you know like we're sorry we're just the kind of guys that like businesses that have actual revenues and profits but oh you know call us crazy and so they're taking the moral high ground and they're saying that this facebook valued at the time remember it was famously like why billions of dollars i would i would argue i would argue those guys would not be where they are today without copyright i doubt and i think that's like the sawdust from their sawmill right it's like hey we got [ __ ] on the app store what would most people do okay we'll just go in with apple they used that as the biggest marketing opportunity ever they were on every talk show they were their names were everywhere i mean they also got kind of canceled as well so there's a cost to that but um they've done an amazing and that's 100 where i learned it i worship those guys for years i call it like the malcolm gladwell effect so with malcolm gladwell you um read his books and you have to remember that a lot of what he's saying is just theory there's no there's some proof that it's real but it's not proven and um but he's such a good storyteller that you think like oh what you're saying is just a fact like have you heard a story about david and goliath it's wonderful and he likes it he's like actually david goliath wasn't that hard of a contest because it turns out goliath was like mentally uh challenged or like had some issues where he like and he's also blind he couldn't see he he like he had this thing where he was so big that it ruined it it had like giganticism or something like that and so and then also like david was a shepherd and they're actually so good at throwing these rocks that they could take a bird out of the sky so it's really like just basically taking a a big dumb blind giant and shooting him in the head with a gun that's not hard and like that's his argument about he's like david goliath it's nonsense and is he right i don't there's no proof who knows is david goliath even real we don't even know that but you like hear this story and it changes you but the problem that i have with base camp and other good writers and this is something that you have to be really careful of i i work on all the time like i can be such a good storyteller that i can get you to think that something's real even though like i'll tell you but there's no proof but like i'm gonna write it in such a way and base camp does this all the time where they say well they'll write something and i'm like oh this is the truth this is how the world is like well no let's let's not forget this is an opinion right totally and there's lots of nuance and going back to what we're talking about with bootstrapping i i read all their stuff i drank the kool-aid and i you know i love those guys they built an amazing business but you can't just have that perspective it's very nuanced there's there's you know like i said there's so many situations where it is logical to raise money and if you talk to dhh 10 years ago he'd say salesforce and facebook will be bankrupt in 10 years and this doesn't make sense and again i love these guys and i know them both they're awesome guys a huge fan wouldn't have built my business without them but um i do think they they present everything in a very black and white way which i think benefits them in a because it makes them more compelling no one wants to hear nuance this has been a good pod what do you think sean yeah it was good there's i mean there's a couple others we wanted to do but we're way over so we should uh we should wrap it and do another one soon i know we didn't really yeah i think we got like we have like we have like 20 topics to do so it's like here's the five pillars of happiness like do i want to be happy i should probably ask about that one like i would like to be happy and then the jamie dyson thing there was the whole you wanted to come on because you're like i read this book about dyson i want to come talk about it we didn't even talk about it oh man i'm so excited to talk about him he's incredible all right well let's do it let's do another one unless you have time i don't know we could keep going if you want but otherwise let's do another one and uh we'll do dyson and smothers yeah i gotta i gotta roll i got a lunch in 12 minutes all right man good good sweetie okay see you guys that was fun [Music] you

dude it just comes with a territory that's when you're in your creative man you're gonna be crazy you gotta accept the craziness [Music] do you wanna talk about kanye i do want to talk about kanye yeah so i only watched the first episode because i have this rule i've got two rules the the first rule is if there's a movie that involves animals as the protagonists protagonist i don't know where you're going with this i don't watch it i don't watch the animals always die so i don't watch it i have a rule i don't want like if there's a war movie and it's set in a period where they had horses like braveheart or or the patriot and the horses die in the war i don't watch it i i just it's too much for me i don't like seeing horses die i don't like seeing the line get trampled i don't watch that [ __ ] the second thing is if it's generally either scary or sad i don't watch that either i'm not paying money to get freaked out right i'm paying money to be happy yeah like my life sucks sometimes anyway i don't need to like i want to pay money to like make it not suck so i knew that in episode two that was when his mom died so i was like nope i'm not gonna watch that so i only watched episode one uh but by the way i've watched episodes this bomb doesn't die yet uh that that part uh so they made it i thought they made it they were playing the song hey mama like over the preview so you haven't seen any of the scenes with his mom because those are the best scenes well yeah where she's like he's like i bought a she's like uh you don't own a house but you bought this chain and she goes okay i like the chicken kanye's nice this is nice yeah she was very supportive of him yeah so um dude okay so let's talk about the mom all right so this kind of documentary is frankly great and i'm kind of mad more friends didn't tell me you gotta watch this like i can see why maybe some people don't like it but this is like this is up my alley this is this is my app dude did you see the idea about how they're basically it was just a guy you because you asked yourself why is this where's this footage from why is this guy just walking around like he's got a cam it's like a camcorder on his shoulder why is this guy with kanye when he's like on the street and basically this guy was like i saw i forget the movie that he saw it was called like there's a movie where yeah hoop dreams it follows four young like high schooler kids or eighth grade kids he's like let's see if they're gonna make it to the nba and he's like i was inspired by that and i thought kanye was gonna be famous and so i just decided to follow him around and this was before youtube was around so it was weird that a guy was with like a shoulder candy totally weird what what luck for all of us that that guy so shout out to cootie the guy who did it um he basically and by the way i think they explain this more later i haven't seen the whole thing so i might not know something that's like said in the documentary but like i've only watched the first couple parts so he basically sees kanye and he's like this guy's cool and then drops everything is like i'm gonna film this guy i'm gonna film this random guy from chicago who wears a retainer and is trying to be a rapper and he's like a cool producer but like you know who knows right like you know most people don't make it as kanye says in the documentary he goes yeah where i grew up there's a whole bunch of guys who were who who were just finna get signed and guess what they're still finna get signed they're just they're always finna get signed and so like you know that seemed like the the most likely path but like that's amazing so this documentary is amazing because he's got footage from before everything when he's when he's got nothing when nobody believes in him and he's like you know trying to make it and because because of that he's got all this footage and other people also view it as harmless it's like oh i don't know why this guy got a camera what are you doing with the camera out it's like i'm filming a documentary for kanye all right that's weird all right but i guess come on in like who knows and so you see jay-z you see pharrell you see all these like legends in the game early on because and in studio because they just have this footage it's amazing it was awesome i loved this documentary it was cool that he looked up to a couple guys like most deaf and common and now those folks aren't even in the same stratosphere as what he is exactly he does and he surpassed them they asked for his honor and he would yeah and they were like um all right fine kanye fine i'll i'll come with you to this thing right and it was awesome and it's easy to say like when i watch it now i'm like oh this is so obvious this guy like has the it factor and of course that's easy but there was a there was one scene where he was in a record label like reception room i think and there was this woman just standing there and he was like hey can i talk to whoever and she kind of ignored him and then he just started rapping he's like well let me show you my rap and he plays um he plays all falls down right i think and which is like the hit of hits and he's rapid and she's like get cameras up for a minute and then eventually she just like starts making phone calls and she's like working and then she's like excuse me like has to walk by because there's something at the door and he's playing all falls down before it like became a thing and it made me think of two things one that's crazy that he kept getting after it and two even though all falls down is a total hit i understand how if you heard it it's just some crazy guy you'd be like oh that's stupid yeah and it really makes me respect people whether it's people who invest money in a product or people who find an artist or find art or a trend people who can spot something and be like i think that's it and if we position it in the market this way this is going to be a home run and it really shows you how hard that is because that woman and there was like three different ladies walking around the room were 100 fans of that song they were like they were like looked like young people that were in the music industry and they're working the way up they 100 were about that song when it came out but then it didn't click and that is what i try to imagine i'm like what what is my all falls down today did i skip over anything today and i found myself asking that after i saw that documentary 100 because you just see people who are writing them off people who are just too busy doing their work that they missed this absolute gold mine that's like literally he's putting it in your face saying please please like check me out right and like and it's easy like when something's popular it's easy to appreciate it's greatness when something is some random guy in your way it really takes something special to spot that talent and it made me want to be that guy right it made me want to be that parent so like i wrote down a bunch of notes which is weird because like who writes notes while documentary but i was like there were things that stood out to me that were like real life lessons or just amazing moments that were in this so i'll give you one he's rapping with his mom his mom his mom was an english teacher and she's like what's that one you used to say like i was at the playground and then they said boys came around and then and she's like doing it and he does it and she's like oh i love that one kanye like an audience of one it's like all he really had at that point was one fan it was like his mom and she's like that's a million dollars right there she goes i always used to tell you that right that's a million dollars right there and he laughed he goes ain't got a million dollars yet and like now he's a billionaire right and so it's like and she's like no i'm telling you that's a million dollars and then he he tells her some good news he's like mom uh mtv is going to film me for their like you heard it here first thing for emerging artists like unknown artists can you believe that they're going to film a documentary okay can you believe that and she goes i can believe it the way you are she goes you writing tracks it's like watching michael jordan shooting free throws and then she goes and then she goes um she goes you know you you work so hard you kept going you keep going up it's bound to pay off so yeah i believe that kanye for people like you you're special kanye and like and she's not saying it there's no difference when you say you're doing a really good job with this yeah this is good you've got me bought in this is really good and so so she was you know there's a difference when somebody says something like you're great versus like when somebody genuinely believes in you and they're not just trying to pump you up and they just have a quiet confidence about them like she wasn't going overboard and wasn't saying like don't worry you're gonna make it she was just saying like of course i believe it like yeah i'm not surprised and she wasn't critical so he comes back and she goes kanye when are you gonna buy a house and she he goes i don't know yet but check this out and he pulls out this chain i don't know what was on it but he was like i could have bought a house but i bought this instead and she goes well that's it's all right it's pretty nice good job i like that kanye yeah yeah and she's like so again so supportive and such a believer and that's like you know a thing that moms do but it's just like you know that's mad respect on that and um and so most moms don't do that by the way i don't think most moms do that i feel like you know you know like a lot of people like dude i have the best mom it's like well you know yeah yeah trust me there's a lot well i i i think that there's a lot of shitty parents out there and then i think that most parents are just that most parents are just are okay it's just like a distribution just like everything else uh and she was very special and right single mom too right no doubt single mom and uh hey you know he opened up her fridge and there's like literally like like like wine and milk well there's a quart of milk and like a quarter a quart of rose or something like that by zinfandel and then like he's and he uses that like in his song later or whatever and so there's a couple other things so that so he goes um uh he so i'm just gonna can i read you to some of these notes i just keep going so there's one scene where he's he's um oh no she goes she's trying to warn him and so she goes you have this confidence that kind of like um you know but i want you to make sure you stay humble and and like obviously that's you know been a challenge for kanye over time as he's like i am jesus now and so and she's like remember a giant looks in the mirror and sees nothing and like i still to this point i don't know what that meant and kanye clearly also didn't know what that meant in the moment and then she tries to explain she goes she goes don't she goes don't make yourself less of a star a star is going to look like a star you can't be a star and then say i'm not a star you can't have you she goes you got to have some oomph about you i just love that like that's a there's a that's a phrase to live by it's like i have something about me like that can mean anything in any situation and it's the right thing and then she goes she goes don't just go to the mirror and say no i'm not all that thank you very much i'm not all that i'm not a star like yeah you'd be a star but be humble at the same time and she goes you and he goes you're saying i don't do a good job of that she goes no you do a good job with that but you got to make sure you keep doing a good job of that and like those are like you know kind of like that's a seed that's been planted right and so gosh he's great so there's that one and then there was like all these moments where all right the importance of identity right so he says from the be so at the time he's known as a great producer he produces the beats that jay-z uses on his big blueprint album and people know him as that everyone loves him as a producer everybody wants him as a producer but he wants to be a rapper yeah he was upset about it he's upset and so he goes into this one he's in the hallway at the record label which which by the way a lot of people forget do you realize how much he produced before he actually got famous no that's kind of crazy it's pretty crazy like the big one was h to the izzo right and there was like there's like dozens more i can't think of anything off the top of my head but there was dozen more where you like wait you did that and he did it before he had his own thing yeah exactly exactly and he was great at it and then he's like he talks about he's like yeah people want my b say oh oh i want okay can i get one can i get i need a b give me a beat he's like and then then they hear my song yo i hadn't heard this where'd you get this he goes that's my [ __ ] i use that for me and he's like he's like trying to like on one hand he needs to sell beats to pay for life but every time he does it's a step away from where he wants to be in a way like to be a rapper and so he's in this hallway and this guy's trying to hype him up because he's like oh you got the documentary crew so he puts his arm around him it's like the the managing director at rockefeller records and he's like you know this right here kanye west he's the best rapper producer in the game best rapper producer in the game period and then kanye's like kind of like upset and he's like what he goes why you guys say that man that's like saying i'm the best kid rapper in the game he's like what man i said you're the best rapper producer in the game he goes i'm just a rapper if i'm the 50th best rapper just say he's the 50th best rapper don't call me the best rapper producing the game that's whack all them are whack i'm not that i'm a rapper and like think about what's going on at that moment right he's like fighting to get a record deal where most people are in desperation mode like they'll take what they can get and instead he's got this identity and the whole world is trying to pull him to just be a producer because that's what's in it for them like that's proven and that helps you know helps them make hits and you know why aren't you just happy pat you on your head say you're a great producer and he had this identity in his head so strong that i think 99 people out of 100 in his position would just become a producer because the whole world was pulling him in that direction and it was a faster success and the money was there and the success was there and he didn't have to grind as hard as he did to try to prove himself as a rapper but he had it in his head no i'm a rapper and if i'm the 50th best rapper i'd rather be the 50th best rapper than the best rapper producer and i just it was such an example to me of like people will stay consistent with their identity and so you kind of got to ask yourself like what is my identity like if i said sam are you what's your job sam what do you do uh right now my job is i do if i just say what like who are you what do you do for work what do you do for a living i'm a business person okay you're a business person so if all of a sudden it doesn't matter what hubspot offers you right like okay you're vesting out your deal you you that's great but let's say any company comes to you and say sam we'd like to make you the vice president of marketing operations at biggest company in the world and you're going to get this and that you're not going to do it because it's not consistent with your identity you're like i'm a business person i'm an entrepreneur yeah so entrepreneur i can't be an employee if i'm an entrepreneur they're two separate things and like in the same way you know you're not gonna do heroin because you're not you're somebody who doesn't do heroin you don't even have to weigh the pros and cons of it it's just really not a discussion for you it's not part of who you are it's not like i'm trying not to do it it's no i just i don't do that i do do this and i don't do that and so those lines you draw for yourself are so important on identity and i would argue so there's this book called 48 laws of power have you read it no but i've heard of it all right it's awesome so he's got this one chapter where he says you always have to reinvent yourself and he gives a bunch of examples about that and the reason why you want to reinvent yourself is the person who you can't peg down typically can become the most powerful because there's something about changing your self that it does a couple things first this whole act as if thing it's real so if you like act like you're gonna be an expert artist or something and you work harder you can eventually become that but you kind of gotta act as if second it kind of reinforces habits so you see like no i'm a healthy person therefore i don't do unhealthy things and third it gives you this aura of mystery and people who have mystery surrounding them typically are powerful right and uh and there's a ton of good examples about this like a really interesting and easy one because she does it so clearly is lady gaga so like oftentimes she'll reinvent herself so at first she was this like kind of just normal like white lady playing on the piano if you see her like when she's a little bit younger then she becomes like this weirdo person where she like puts meat on her body then she transforms and becomes um she starts playing jazz with tony bennett you're like what the heck lady gaga's doing that what the hell is that now she like just got done doing some acting and she was a great actor so like constantly reinventing themselves i think arnold schwarzenegger has done a really good job yeah you just you've got to reinvent yourself consistently and kanye has done that where he's actually changed himself and i think inventing reinventing yourself you actually need to make the decision you could be like i am this now i am this exactly that's okay and then you got to choose that identity and after a while then you could be like all right great i that season was this season had a beginning in the middle and now it's come to the end what's the next season of me and you can actually pick and choose what those inventions are and i when i read that when i was a little bit younger that kind of changed my perspective on things when i went to the tony robbins event it was a perfect example of what you're talking about so he he tells the story he's like you know he's like yeah there was this kid i was working with or this kid i met and kid was overweight and he wanted to be fit but he was talking about oh you know it's hard i'm working so hard on time to exercise blah blah and he's like he wanted to be in a relationship and we saw a woman beautiful woman i said well go talk to her then and he didn't want to go talk to her well why would she want a guy like me i'm too young she looks older than me you know i don't have a good job she probably wants a guy you know who's got you know something going for him look at my clothes i don't look good so he didn't want to go talk to her so he talks about all these aspects of his life his health his relationship his career it's like what do you want to you're working as a busboy right now at a restaurant what do you want to be going and doing i want to be over there i want to run that dealership over there you know all right so why don't you go apply for it why would they hurt me i got no college education right like coming up with all the reasons why like labeling himself all these identities that he's not right i'm overweight no college education too young too dumb too fat two whatever right and people do this all the time and so he's like he draws he basically talks about the turning point for this kid he's like he drew a line and he said um no experience like no experience what are you talking about yeah no experience yeah yeah i don't have i'm not stuck in all the old ways like all those other [ __ ] right like i got fresh ideas i got the energy of a young stallion i'm not like some 50 year old guy who you know is dragging into work every day yeah i got no experience i got the best experience no experience right or like why would this woman want to be with me because i got that you know he just turns it around like what's the truth is the truth that you have no experience or the truth that you have fresh ideas and young energy and you'll you'll hustle harder than anybody else to prove to prove yourself because you have this is your your track record right and so he does that for each one of the things and then it's like oh you know at the end it's sort of like you know that kid's me and he shows a picture of himself before and where he was living and how he was working and how he turned himself around that's good and he says in this thing he goes you know right now you guys see me on stage and i got this i have energy and confidence and i have all these like this inside wisdom or all these things that people praise me for he goes what people don't realize is i created this tony robbins [ __ ] i created him and uh like and i just thought that was so powerful of a way of thinking like you can create that that thing you want to be that the ideal version of you you get to create that and the people who've done it they just created it they chose that identity and then they just lived up to that day by day and like you know there's a the kanye's like a you know a great example of like literally speaking it into existence he says a ton of stuff on there like people are going to know me without my last name it'll just be kanye at some point and he's and i go ahead no go go for it when i was watching that it also reminded me of this other thing and here's a really small example so you sean are you're you're i don't know what you are i i don't create creative is one word but that's not the most effective word i would say your whatever it requires to be a good like storyteller and podcast host that's what you are so it's like a mixture of creativity performing and a bunch of other stuff and what i've come to accept is like so i always joke that sean is always like usually two minutes late he's usually always two minutes late to stuff and at first that made me angry it doesn't make me angry anymore now because what i know is in order to be good in order for you sean to be sean and be good at these things that means by nature you're gonna be the opposite of good at these other things right like that's just what that's just what it comes with like so like if you want someone like so it's like well you know you can't be this amazing athlete and have time to do all these other things like in order to be an amazing athlete you gotta train all the time so like i just accept that like well i want him to be good at this therefore i accept that maybe sometimes i'll just he'll just be two minutes late and when kanye acts like a crazy person online and he says all this crazy [ __ ] about kim kardashian and he types in all caps on twitter and [ __ ] people are like this guy's crazy like what's he doing and i'm like well that's what we need being crazy is good like that's why we got all this gold and i love those crazy people and you ca and so what i've learned is like in order to be great you're going to be messed up in some other in some other categories the um the mr beast thing i was talking about the beginning he said something just like this he goes uh like joe rogan asks like you know what was it like you know what would your friends think or whatever he goes uh he's like at first my friends just thought it was weird like nobody that wasn't a popular thing to make videos and then they just got sick of it because all i ever wanted to talk about was making youtube videos they would ask me about other stuff or try to talk to me about other stuff i just didn't have any interest in anything else i was just obsessed with making great videos and it's all i wanted to think about and um i remember there's a there's an interview with conor mcgregor it goes on bbc it's like one of the bigger like it's like not just like an mma guy covering conor asking about him it was like bbc world or something like that was going to interview and they asked him some question or there was like some small talk you know about like about like the news or the game and he's like oh yeah you know both teams play hard he says something generic and then the camera cuts at his documentary crews filming because i have no clue who those teams are he's like i don't follow any i don't think i don't follow sport i don't follow news he goes um because i don't know anything about anything and i don't want to know anything about anything i just am obsessed with my with my craft i have lost my mind to my craft and um i've seen it and so you know it's like this kind of inspiring thing that you see as like a common what are the common denominators of greatness you i wouldn't say you have to do anything because there's many ways to win but these do these things do show up often right they sort of rhyme with success is like this obsession the sort of singular obsession with something or identity seeing yourself as being becoming something even when the rest of the world doesn't see it having that one believer like your mom right like so like if i was gonna say like the lessons from kanye which i think is what this episode is turning into it's like you know number one it's like you know the power of that one believer like his mom number two is like the power of identity number three is um is like so he has this moment where he goes uh some somebody said something they go um they go you know do you think it's harder for you because you're from chicago and because you have this background as a producer so people don't take you seriously as a rapper he goes he just goes he goes the way i feel is anything that anybody ever tells me is a disadvantage i'm gonna make it my advantage and then he basically if you watch the documentary that's exactly what he's doing he's like okay i'm pigeonholed as a producer well i'm gonna make the dopest beats for myself and i'm gonna use my beats as currency so he's like yeah i supply beats to jay-z guess what i get jay-z to do a hook on my first album which he's not gonna do for like some random no-name rapper but because i build this credibility i'm gonna i'm gonna use that as my currency or like he gets in this car accident and his jaw is wired shut it's like i'm gonna turn that to my advantage how did he turn a disadvantage like for a rapper having a jaw wired shut through the wire he creates a song called through the wire rapping about his time and then you know the first line is like you know about drinking ensure like you know other people make pancakes i just drink scissors you know just the syrup because he can't eat solid foods right so he writes his hit song when he's got the broken jaw and he only also says his other heroes i was laying there i couldn't do nothing back there there's no like cell phones or anything so he had no smartphones so he's just like sitting in the hospital doing nothing for seven days he goes i was laying there and i decided i'm gonna be the best dressed rapper in the game he's like because he's watching music videos so they they put music videos on there but they couldn't put the volume high so he couldn't like bump to the music was just watching other rappers so he turned the disadvantage into advantage which was he realized all these rappers dressed the same way and it's this one style i'm gonna address it back then and now he's a fashionable billionaire you know and back then rap fashion was horrible it was just like it was like a basketball jersey and like baggy cheese yeah it was the worst so he did a good job let me ask let me ask you a question real quick don't say their names because you might have to insult them but the three wealthiest people you know okay what is what around what do you think their net worth is each um about the ones like i know like i know well like somebody not just like somebody i've met yeah someone is like a friend who you know about some of their personality traits in their personal life yeah i would say like somewhere between like 300 million and 700 million i like i know them like i know about their like real life not just like the surface level stuff of those people how many of them have this trait of being obsessed and and to the point where if a normal person a non-wealthy person saw their life they would be like dude you're weird or the way that you're handling this is wrong you know you're how many would say something like that 100 of them um 100 of them what are examples of yeah so one of them uh they worked so hard on their business they were so obsessed that like their family members used to come to the office and say you gotta come home like you just you're working too hard we're afraid and when they sold their company like 45 days later they had like a heart surgery because they had like worked themselves that hard during that time another one i remember the day after they became worth over 100 million dollars i was i knew them well that that same night they were up till three in the morning working on their like new project that had like no no like you know less than 100 customers and like clearly they'd already made it and it's like for them to stay up fixing bugs in this like test flight product that was you know at three in the morning that day like most people would be chilling hard for it'd go on a bender for a year like wired very differently third person they're not just obsessed in their work life they're obsessed with kind of anything um so they they like it's like if they get into like some random hobby or sport they just take it to like a level that's not like common or like they're a hardcore gamer or they they just like get re they have an obsessive personality it's not just an obsession with work or money that just happens to be the game that pays out in a points called dollars but they just get obsessed with any game that like catches the catches their their their interest yeah that that rings true to all the people i that i know do you have an example i'm trying to yeah so um our our mutual buddy um um i i wonder if i could i'm actually not gonna say his name so well i'll say it yeah i could say it jack smith so the chair like he the building of the chair right that's an example well i'll give you a different one so he's obsessed with if he buys anything he'll buy 30 of them and at his house i've seen it he's got a google spreadsheet he tracks every item and every category of thing that he's bought and he ranks it so if you ask him about chocolate he actually has a spreadsheet with literally a hundred pieces of chocolate he goes i tested all of them here's the best one that i think is the best when we got married my wedding gift from him was roughly a thousand dollars of stuff that he considered the best and it was so weird like the best socks the best underwear the best lotion and he's so obsessed with this that amazon multiple times has banned him from having an account and so he has to create different credit cards just to continue getting an account and he's so he's just obsessed with stuff right um and he's he's incredibly wealthy and he probably got he probably got wealthy when he was 28 really young but he's just crazy obsessed with stuff to the point where like i i just i just that's i just accept that's he's just an oddball right so yeah that's one example let me give you another one that i thought was kind of uh like one of the lessons the lesson number i don't know what we're on now lesson five from kanye closed mouth don't get fed so i i don't know if you've seen this scene where he goes into he kind of like just like he there there's like a point where like the record label is not like paying for like the studio time because like you know they're they kind of like put them on the shelf they're like they weren't sure about them they didn't want to put the money into like promoting them and getting them to record and all the stuff so he's like pulling in favors some way somehow so he goes to like he he asks jamie foxx who he's like made beats for before he's like hey i want to come over oh you got the studio in your house yo you mind if i just record something real quick and like boom uses the studio and then gets jamie foxx to do vocals and that becomes the vocals on one of his tracks yes so jams then there's one with jay-z he gets into the studio with jay-z jay-z's recording and he's like yo uh you might have a referee real quick and he's like yeah okay yes you know i'm not gonna say no and he just freestyles on the spot with no backtrack for jay-z to his face like a one-on-one like basically just one manner finding a poem to another man it's like kind of an amazing thing that's happening and then jay-z you see him like start to nod his head he just starts to like he's like i like it he lets him do a hook on jay-z's uh like lets him do a verse on jay-z's track and then jay-z says out loud in the studio he goes i had no idea he goes but that's he goes that just shows you closed mouth don't get fed and like and then they and then they catch on the documentary the guy cootie the recording guy he goes uh jay-z is like leaving and cootie shoots his shot too he goes he goes oh man what do you think about kanye west and he goes he's a kanye west man he's he's got it he's gonna be big and he goes up and then he goes he goes you think so he goes i'll putting my money on it and he walks up and does like the jay-z laughter walks out the studio and they capture that and they're like yes we got like basically an endorsement from jay-z that's gonna help us keep going and it's just one instance after another of like in the moment of truth he didn't sit around and wait he shot his shot and like you know closed mouth don't get fed and i just think that's like how did you how did you remember all this were you literally just what the pen and paper take on my phone i would write notes i would just write like i'd write like it literally says closed loud because i misspelled it typing fast close laughs don't get meth don't get fed jay-z and then i and then i thought about it right like because is this this is on your on your iphone apps no it's app note and you do this for all your all things like that yeah i just have notes for everything like i have i have a thing called jokes and i'm like slowly building a stand-up comedy set over time like eventually i'll collect enough funny things i'm like oh that could be a joke i'll put it there god i find that to be amazing because i watch the same thing but you remembered so much more than i did i was just ups i was into it man i i just saw so many lessons and i i remember like there's so many moments of my life like i bet you have one too where's which is like do you have a closed mouth don't get fed moment like this one jump to mind or those i'll tell you mine and i bet you you have one i probably have a few but i i i you know as you can expect because i got big mouth i typically have always i've done a good job of speaking up what's yours like when i was in college i uh at the time i thought i was gonna be a doctor so i was pre-med i took the mcats i was ready to graduate and go to med school and just for fun i took a blow-off class the easiest class offered on duke campus was called getting rich and obviously that changed the direction of my life and one of the classes so the teacher was basically she would bring in somebody who had made it in some world and they would come and just talk to us so this guy was uh was this the most popular you told me about this was class to get into because it was like highest highest rated of easiness of fun and like that on ratemyprofessor.com that that professor had a chili pepper next to her name that means she's hot so it was like all the high scores so i got in and i was sitting in class one day and the guy was a hedge fund guy i think and he was talking about his career he's like all right enough about me like what about you guys who's doing something cool who's who's got a business that they're trying to try to who's got a business that they're that they're running or who's got a business they want to launch and he started looking around the class he basically scanned from left to right he goes pitch me like that's what i do i invest so so pitch me and he lives from left left right no witness crickets nobody's you know you've never seen a quieter group of smart people and nobody's that nobody raised their hand i'm at the very edge of the class on the right so i kind of had the advantage if i had a moment to like assess the fork in the road yeah and the the night before me and my friends had had that dumb idea for why isn't there a chipotle for sushi oh dude we can make that like there was a chipotle on campus and we want or there's a subway on campus and we we wanted to build a version of that fast casual thing for sushi i thought it was a funny idea i had been pitching it the night before to my friends where i was safe and now here was this guy saying pitch me an idea and nobody's saying [ __ ] and then i had this thing in my eye like back to identity i had this thing which was like you know you're the cool kid or something not the cool kid i mean i definitely wasn't quick at school but i just felt to myself like i'll take the sh i'll take the shot like in basketball terms like if in the moment of the clutch moment i'm not gonna be afraid to shoot i might miss but i'm not afraid to shoot and so i did it i raised my hand and he goes all right finally what you got and i pitched the idea and he goes that's a terrible idea he just like blew me off and like but he's like but you know let me tell you like he's like even if you go and do that and he like gave this lesson which was like this is america like it's the only country on earth where you get rewarded for failing like you can go fail at a business and people will give you positive credit for trying he's like most countries that's just not how it works and he goes he goes you know the other thing is a lot of you guys might want to work at a hedge fund someday or investment bank or whatever guess what the first three-fourths of your resume is all gonna look the same it's only the bottom the other section that's gonna have anything different between you and the next kid who also was honorable student did good on the sats and then you know graduated with a 3-5 gpa so like that's the only way that you're going to get differentiated so you go do your sushi restaurant it'll lead you you know it it'll help you in what you want to do even if it fails and that's like pretty much exactly how it played out this was a good conversation because of how much you care i i thoroughly enjoyed this i just i barely said a word but i enjoyed it what do you think ben i it's so evident when one of us is like incredibly passionate about the topic yeah and what do you guys feel like is the kanye pod in the zeitgeist like do you think that most of your friends are watching it right now well everyone knows what it is i think i think a lot of people are watching it uh like i've talked to maybe like i don't know it's like you know one of the big things on netflix is always like oh you're watching the thing on netflix that's at the top yeah like i am yeah wait ben you you haven't seen it i have seen it yeah i watched it yeah i think that like i'm the only one of us who finished it actually i watched the the third part is uh is not as good as as the first two though so you guys the first part was great so have you are you guys watching euphoria no but i've i've seen i've seen a couple episodes at the beginning dude that [ __ ] got me shook you gotta watch that like yeah apparently like if you're a parent like it's just like yeah nightmare scenario well it's this this lady what's her name she's like half white half black zedelia or something and she just knocks it out the park man this girl is so freaking good it just it was it was wonderful acting she killed it i was really i sarah and i both cried watching it wow and that's got like a bunch of seasons right like two or something okay yeah i think two you got to watch that it's so good man this lady's such a good actor then why'd you ask if it's in the zeitgeist you think it's not or where'd you buy jesse yeah i just like i would think that it would kind of reach like maybe not tiger king because that was like a phenomenon but i was hoping because i loved it so much that this documentary would be like the thing on netflix and that's true that like a third of my friends have seen it that's true it's not like as popular but his craziness is pop like the whole thing that he's doing with that with the guy who's dating kim what's what's his name pete davidson davidson that thing is like even that's because that's kind of overshadowing it yeah that could be right his crazy's coming out hard i think part of the reason i liked it is part of the reason it's not like getting that big which is essentially for the first episode for the first part he just like has old footage of kanye and kind of just lets it run with like a little bit of narration and it's so it's not that much of like a a narrative story arc that sucks you in he just kind of like lets you be a fly on the wall ben knowing what you know you had a podcast called raising a genius is it possible to raise a genius like i i didn't you're you're i i didn't like that podcast because you didn't do the best job of like just telling me the answer so like i listened to that also he did get tell the answer but i feel like it was too narrow it was like the guy raised three chess champions okay i get that you can raise a chess champion does that mean you can raise a genius or that you can out practice people at a game of chess right like you know so i think those are two different things well like okay can the encouragement that donna whatever donda west can the incur encouragement that she gave him be a huge factor or a small factor i think it's a factor um the polgar method this guy laszlo polgar had a very specific method and i don't think it would work all that well for rapping because it is oriented towards like outcome driven like it'd be good for raising uh like a guitar player or a chess champion or a swimmer or like those kind of like very discreet you can teach people exactly or a tennis player would be really good but like a rapper something more creative i don't know if you can like it's almost like if it's creative it has to come from within you can't have someone else come out and like try and raise it but do you think that that her encouragement of him made him confident or he was born confident i think watching that documentary it was crazy to see some of the mannerisms that were the same between her and kanye and i was like oh there's something genetic about this like yes it was her encouragement but it's also like whatever he has he kind of got from her and probably would have had it anyway i read this book called the blueprint gene and it kind of changed my opinion where like 85 of everything is genetics that's kind of where i am now i'm like even if she was rude to him maybe he still would have killed it dude when she was rapping she was good she's just like reciting his rap well yeah my mom would not be able to do that because she wasn't she was an english teacher right so clearly she was interested i mean it's very related and also he said he's been like making beats since like sixth or seventh grade like 11 or 12 and so it's the same sort of thing it's like yeah by the time you're 25 you're gonna be really [ __ ] good at something you've been doing for like over 15 you know over 10 years basically at that point um and at like a formative stage where you know when you're 12 and you get obsessed with something you can kind of just like do it pretty much non-stop and get really good at something because you can pick stuff up so fast you don't have any other things to go do right no that it was a good documentary there was it got me thinking a lot that was a good that was a good one i'm just not gonna i just i couldn't watch the rest because i i knew she was gonna die and it and it was i was being it made me sad just watching them together it i got i choked up a couple times seeing them together yeah it was she was she was like touching yeah yeah she was supposed to um the third part is like kind of interesting because it goes it's like a 20-year time jump and then goes into like a lot of stuff he's going through now and kind of the weirdness and running for president and like all that and like at the end cootie's just kind of like yeah man i don't know pretty weird you know like he doesn't really have anything to say about it he's just like kind of baffled as well dude it just comes with a territory that's when you're in your creative man you you're gonna be crazy you gotta accept the craziness he's so crazy do you remember when he went to trump's office to show him his version of air force one like he's he like drew up what air force one should look like he's he's always a genius he's a true genius all right that's the episode

[Music] uh dude right before this i was watching you you saw mr beast went on joe rogan i don't know if you caught the episode at all i didn't i just a couple of the clips where they said like what do you do with your money and he's like not much he goes i used to have a roommate up until recently and we each split our place for 700 but i got a fancier place because someone broke into my house so i needed like some security but it's still like pretty normal of a house yeah i didn't see that so i've only seen one clip and it was basically the clip of like how did you make it on youtube it's a great clip right like it's what's he saying so he goes so he's 23 now and he goes i started doing this when i was 11. and joe's like what eleven he's like yeah he's like i came home and i he's like i started doing this when i was eleven and he's like i sucked obviously at the beginning he's like so he's like he's like look at me now i don't look cool now like imagine me at like 12 like i was like you know pimply you know pimply face scrawny awkward mumbly kind of guy and like here i am trying to like make videos and he's like back then also youtube really there wasn't a thing like youtubers wasn't like a thing 12 13 years ago you know so it's like he's like yeah i just was doing it because i liked it he goes i hated school he's i never in high school i just never even brought a book home like he's like i remember doing zero studying my parents got so mad at me he's like and then like when i turned 18 um he's like he's like basically so he's winning three phases he goes from 11 to 13 i was trying to make videos but i was like super embarrassed because they were so bad and joe's like dude are they do they still exist he goes no i deleted my channel when i turned 13 because like i got like i don't know like bullied in school a little bit i felt embarrassed so i deleted all those videos but i like started fresh again at 13 and like whatever kept going he's like so then from 13 to like 17 or 18 i was just trying to make like videos all the time because my first video randomly got like 20 000 views he's like that was the best thing that ever happened to me i got like this instant hit and i was hooked and then like it didn't happen again for a while but like that first one which was about like he like hacked some video games like here here's how they beat this level in a video game or whatever he's like some obscure game and it just like people wanted to know how to do that hack so that's how i got popular right away um or he's like that's how that video got popular and then i got i wanted to chase that that that feeling again so he's like i wasn't making any money he's like finally i got to the point where i was making a dollar a day and he's like yes he's like see i saved up for like a few months and i bought a microphone and i was like yeah like now i sound good like here we go and he's like i just kept doing that i kept like making a couple bucks saving it and then like buy a camera or buy like you know like a better computer so i could like edit the videos or screen record or whatever and so he just kept doing that for like six years he's like my whole goal was that by the time i graduate from high school can i like just make enough money doing this because i don't want to do anything else it was not his number so it did not happen he's like by the time i he's like by the time i graduated high school i was making like 400 bucks a month or something like that and he's like you know it's 300 400 bucks he's like so my mom gave me this ultimatum she's like you know you're moving out or you're like going to community college like you're not going to do this video thing and so he's like oh [ __ ] okay he's like i didn't want to go to community college he's like it's like the worst thing in the world just sitting there listening to this lecture like that's not what i wanted to do he's like so i started skipping he's like every day i would just go to my car and instead of going to community college i'll just edit videos in my car he's like i do that all day and i come home and my mom thought i went to school he's like and he's like that created a clock because now she was gonna find out like by the end of the semester i had zeros as my grades like she was gonna know that i did not go to community college so i had to like i bought myself like one semester more of time he's like and in that time i pulled it off like i got to the point where i could like self-sustain i just moved out and then i could like do this like full-time moving on my own he's like and so that's kind of like the progression of how i did it and i was like how awesome is that how awesome is it exactly like a bet on yourself story where burn the bridge behind you right so so you know we say burn the bridges i don't know why we say that it's burn the boats uh like if you want to take the island you got to burn the boats and so he burned the boats when he when he did that and uh and knew what he wanted to do right because like school is great but school's not for everybody if you if you kind of know what you want to do um you're much better off i think competing in the free market on that thing than like competing for your teachers like love and affection you know with writing the essay they want to grade as an a plus right like writing the thing they want you to write about in the format they want you to write in a way that will get them to give you the grade right like that's like that's like not a real market whereas you make videos on youtube you're competing in like a real market or you want to be an athlete yeah it's just that most people think that they're like going to do something for life and they aren't willing to or they don't actually want to i think i think the the rarity here is not is someone 18 and capable it's do they actually love what they're saying they love enough that they're willing to dedicate 10 or 20 years to it right yeah like you know what i mean are you actually do you actually have a thing you love uh most people do not um i remember my sister when she was going to college my dad was like all right well like what do you want to major in she's like i don't know he's like well what's your favorite subject like what do you love to study she's like lunch like you know i just i'm not i don't have anything against any of them but like do any of them make me happy not really so what now what and like i think that's how most people's careers go it's like all right well i don't hate it but i don't love it but now what what am i supposed to do yeah yeah yeah so i think that's the rarity here is that he actually that he liked something enough um but anyway that's a good story i'll have to go and watch this podcast [Music] you

[Music] and if somebody wants to get good at selling what uh like you know there's a go out there and you know try to sell a thousand times it's one way to get get better uh but if you wanted to improve your rate of learning what books courses whatever what what youtube videos uh like do you remember that like that really clicked for me and that was like kind of like a game-changing uh thing for me and getting better at selling i have relatively stronger beliefs about the topic um so i think first off a lot of people read books before they start selling and i've thought a lot about it and i don't think that's the right path because you don't know what they're talking about yeah like you only know like what the concept of building rapport is until you've not had rapport and like oh okay now i understand how this works but like until you like until you confront the reality like you can't you can't bucket the knowledge into something that's actionable so i'm a proponent of doing first realizing the deficiencies and then going to find the information now to match the the real life scenarios that you have encountered um the second part of the question is like which books or things like made things click so um there's one moment that made things click which was i said this in the book sam which is like make people offer so good they'd feel stupid saying no which was the secret of selling right it's like if you just make it so good that they won't say no then it makes your job a hundred times easier and so i did work really hard on that side to make my job easier and just as a quick caveat to complete the loop from like 40 minutes ago you said like what was the book or training or whatever that so it's my belief if you look at belford you look at bradley you look at grant cardone some of the big sales trainers that are out there almost all of them invariably have the same story which was i started selling and was the best guy on the team by a [ __ ] mile and then i tried to figure out what i was doing and so i do think that some people naturally based on their childhood their upbringings their whatever or just have a higher proclivity for selling which yeah just a gift of gab and and empathy yeah and i think it carries over into how you recruit for selling too because we've built a lot of sales teams and i actually have a very short allowing for people to fail at sales cycle probably much shorter than most people and it's just because i've never had a killer sales person who didn't do pretty well the first week and so for me we you know we turn through this quickly but as a result of that the team is just killers and they know that so i like this quote from from grant cardone he says you know my sales team's a dangerous place to work and i i love that so in terms of uh sales stuff i think that i think people don't know how people are really freaked out about the idea of selling right and so i think the first reframe is like you're not selling you're helping someone make a decision that's going to help themselves and the the the front part of that is that i do think that the number one predictor of good sales is conviction and so fundamentally you have one person who should believe in something another person who does not believe it yet and trust is the thing that transfers that conviction so if fundamentally there's the two things you need you need trust and need conviction most times sales people don't have 100 trust sorry 100 conviction and so the also the idea of conviction as a binary is false so it's not like i believe it or i don't believe it is to what extent do i believe it right and so that's why like in terms of if i want to improve a sales team i can do the drills which we do and that's like blocking tackling but the thing that really juices the sales team is hearing the testimonials of the people that they sold last week and what they're doing today and how their lives have changed and so i noticed this because on my sales teams when we were in person whenever i did weigh out day which is when everyone finished their challenges and everybody was crying and so excited i tried to stack as many sales appointments as i could while people were weighing out and during those days we closed like 100 because people were like dude how can you not think this works it's right there and so the thing is is like you can either trick yourself into having the right tone or you can train yourself and i think that it's much easier to trick yourself into it by just simply believing because if you talk if you truly believe in the product you will talk about it differently and so in terms of an understanding of selling if you need to have conviction you need to have trust trust is going to come from expertise and some level of rapport right and so um i think that overarchingly to help someone sell we just have to ask the right questions to get someone to come to the conclusion on their own and so most sales conversations follow more or less the same framework if you know what you're doing otherwise people are just chasing their tail and trying to chase a prospect to an outcome that the prospect doesn't know how like we've had this conversation a hundred times they have only had it once we should be the one knowing how this conversation is supposed to go right we should also come in with a massive advantage to how to have this conversation go the way we wanted to because we do it on [ __ ] day right and so you know big big front end pieces is like why are they there what's the problem what have they done so far understanding where they failed seeing why our product is different from the things that they failed asking for permission to explain about the product explaining the product not in any way based on features but only based on the experiences that they will have as a result of it and using analogies to explain those experiences right um and then and then having a close at the end which the the tick tock i think that you he references like a no base close and i think a lot of natural sales people do this anyways like if i want something i might be like hey can you do this for me i'm like hey would you mind and they say no they don't i don't mind right like it's natural communication dynamics that most people who naturally know how to persuade people or at least influence do that on their own this is just retroactively looking at and saying what did i do different like why is this different and um in terms of like overcoming because people are afraid of confrontation right that's what they're afraid of and so i believe that you can sell without ever having confrontation and you can do that with what i like to call childlike curiosity and so if someone says um well my husband's not going to approve that i'm like why wouldn't he like huh that's so interesting tell me more about that rather than like all right let's like your husband's an [ __ ] like that's not going to work because in arguments no one wins right and so like why would he think that because because i would think that he wants what's best for you right yeah he wants what's best does he know you're struggling with this right now well i mean yeah he knows i'm struggling with it okay so he wants a special you know you're struggling with it so why do you think he would be opposed to solving something that that you're currently struggling with just so i understand would he be happier if you continue to struggle well no it's like well great then would you be opposed to moving forward today and that way and hey if you go home to your husband and you make a joke in the light of scenario then you close it right and so it's i think childlike curiosity is the immediate that you have to train because people get defensive so that is one thing that like fighters talk about when they're in the ring like in the beginning you breathe in too much right i don't know if like if you've been like sparring and stuff like you breathe in you breathe too much you hyperventilate and so the guys who've done it enough they slow down their breathing because when they get things get intense they can slow it down and so i think sales is a lot the same way where you're like your adrenaline kicks in start breathing faster it's fight or flight so you gotta be able to slow down and be like huh that's crazy i wouldn't have thought that okay tell me more about that and like now you're interested and then they don't feel like you're combating them they feel like you genuinely are interested and want to help them which is what you should be doing because you should be them dude only if it makes sense [Music]

[Music] sean you and i were sent something from our friend jack steph i'll fill you in so basically there's this guy named ryan cohen ryan cohen he started chewie.com which is a like amazon for pet stuff when he was young right sean i think he was like in his early 20s and he was aggressive when he started it he raised a ton of money he started out of florida so he was very much like an individual thinker he was like no we're not doing silicon valley we're gonna do this out of florida he raised like a billion dollars a huge sum ended up selling it for three four five six billion i don't know the exact amount then it goes public worth uh many billions but after doing that he made i think around like 600 million dollars like a huge amount of money and after he made that money there was an article written where he goes i pretty much put all of my money into two stocks apple and wells fargo so he put like all of it in there and since that article went live that means that the money that he put in there has gone up 361 then about a year and a half ago he noticed that there was a brand that he loved that wasn't doing so well and he thought these guys could totally revolutionize the game but they're just really like getting they're getting crushed right now i'm gonna buy 10 of the company which he did for 76 million dollars and that company was gamestop and when he bought gamestop that's when this whole like meme stock thing went down because everyone was like brian cohen bought it and he actually it worked he turned the company around or at least it's in the process but it's being turned around and his 76 million dollars he turned into 1.1 billion and he currently still owns like 13 of the companies on their board of directors now just this morning it was released or announced that he just bought 10 percent of bed bath and beyond so he's doing the same thing and this guy is a madman i think i'm almost positive he's still only 34 35 years old i also researched on linkedin i'm almost positive that it's just him like he doesn't have an employee maybe as an assistant but it's like just him like searching around for stuff so this man's crazy and i love him so his money's already up uh yeah okay he's amazing i feel like there should be like a ticker for just like stocks that aren't small that have fallen like 80 plus percent from their highs it's like what crazy operators want to like come in here and totally turn this thing around i feel like you could also have a podcast about that where you just like you find a stock like bed bath and beyond and you're like look highs were at 80 it's now at what was it before this like six dollars like what would you do if you were operating this business and have people like come on and battle like jeopardy style and see who comes out with the best strategy that's kind of cool yeah right now there's like a whole bunch of growth stocks that are down you know somewhere between 50 and 80 percent from their all-time high and you know stocks like zoom and uh you know vastly and a bunch of others and uh there's you know there's like kind of that one buffett phrase you know be uh be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy and uh it sure does seem like now is a good time to be greedy when others are fearful right like uh there's a lot of you know opportunity everywhere in the market and so you know if these are things that you believe in on a 10-year time scale then like this is a fantastic entry point uh here's another interesting one so i was thinking about this bed bath and beyond thing and game stock and my friend joe sent this to me so have you guys remember express yeah i don't know if they if they have that in canada stuff but express mostly women's clothes it's like it was like fast fa fast fashion before that was like even called the thing so look at what their market cap is i think their market cap is 250 million dollars right now but their ebitda is 150 million so i think express is an interesting one too yeah but you got to look at like the debt and all all these other obligations they haven't they have a ton of debt yes they have a ton of debt that's the problem they've got a ton of time jack was a ryan cohen is basically he's doing the tai lopez playbook of buying old retailers and spinning them into like you know e-commerce and sort of rejuvenating these big old brands you know he's doing the same playbook as tai lopez just without being tai lopez which is actually a great idea in general that's a great business plan to follow do the tai lopez playbook without being tai lopez is like a a great great idea when people talk about buying when the like buy buy the dip i hate that i'm because i'm like i don't i don't have any money to buy chew the dip yeah that's what i gotta do i don't know whenever people say buy the dip i'm like with what i i don't own anything what do you what do i do you don't keep any uh dry powder i feel like you always you're always mr like safety net with cash and other things you have dry powder why aren't you buying the dip i have a hundred thousand dollars in cash oh wow okay i think you used to have way more in cash now there's now that's your short-term real estate mobile you've deployed everything or what i've deployed everything yeah i don't i yeah i don't have that much cash i don't have enough what do people just hold like keep cash in a checking account yeah certainly people do that they do cds they do you know different like different versions of like a market neutral like you know cash position i own bonds i own a ton of bonds seven figures of bonds but i guess who told you to do that uh it's five percent of my net worth is impossible who told you to do that don't nobody buys bonds on their own everybody gets told to buy bots my my a lot of my portfolio is 90 10. so 90 equities 10 percent bonds you're not you don't play do you own a bond i don't know a single bond steph do you i don't own a single bond really but i feel like sean's right like what what rate are you getting on these bonds aren't interest rates at like zero yeah nothing like two percent yeah i don't know it's just like traditional yourself into a money losing position congratulations well actually that's a good question with with havoc going on right now sean from one is your net worth down from one year ago today if assuming you did not add any new cash yeah for sure one year ago because one year ago was like a market high right like uh if you're talking about right after the covet bounce so like let's say kovid crash then covert recovery all happened in like a three month period or six month period basically so let's just take the all-time high last year to today i gotta be down 25 30 percent easily easily 30 percent i would have thought it would have been a lot more because of you have more high-risk stuff uh yeah but like a lot of myself's in amazon stock and amazon stock has done fine you know it's down a little bit but uh yes that one's not so bad and i would say like you know that's a pretty large position so that's not super that's not very risky in my opinion and um you know crypto cryptos you know down one over 30 30 35 from last year most of it but i have a few like altcoin bets that have done really well so like uh i was on here talking about luna not long ago luna's up 100 so it's like you know that that doubled while other stuff went down 30 so it's okay you know we do all right but sean where's your psychology at because i feel like you know everyone knows the strategy like yeah buy low sell high but when this actually happens when all your stocks or all your investments go down it's like so hard to actually maintain that psychology and be like oh yeah i'm totally gonna put more more money in the market so are you like is your conviction still as strong as it used to be are you like yeah this is like awesome i'm going to buy the dip or are you struggling quick interruption do me a favor scroll down and you're going to see a link to the hustle so if you want to stay up to date on the tech and business news you need to know check out the hustle it's a daily email i used to help write it i love it so check it out scroll down below let me guess don't talk sean don't talk yet i have a feeling that this means nothing to you and you're totally cool about this uh it's actually even better i don't even look like i don't look at it because i'm like oh why would i look it's just gonna be down so i just don't look which means i don't think about it which is actually like the correct way i should have been doing it all together like waking up and seeing green put a nice little pep in my step but was sort of this like false uh positive and um and now i just don't look because i'm like oh yeah of course i'm down five percent again today like what i just lose five percent every day or two percent every day that's just like a an average day now so i just don't even look at it and because i'm not looking at it it doesn't matter because i wasn't selling i wasn't selling when it was going up but i'm not selling when it's going down so it doesn't really matter the day-to-day fluctuations of it so now it's just i just get some time back because i don't like want to go look at it because i don't want to see any carnage so i'll just like kind of ignore it and just go about my my day and uh you know i kind of asked i'll pause i'll ask myself you know has anything changed meaning do i view these investments differently now do i no longer believe that these are good good investments to be in over like a five to ten year period no okay so then you know what am i thinking about there's nothing nothing nothing to think about essentially at this time do i buy the dip uh that's one where you know sometimes i do like to just chill and just like sit on the sideline for a bit um because i'm a pretty like i've spent a lot of time in my life gambling like i literally played a lot of poker a lot like i've spent so many days in a casino and so i know the feeling of chasing a loss trying to win it back and um and so i just like to make sure that i'm not doing that so there's a difference between buying the dip and chasing a loss um and you know throwing good money in after bad and so just trying to differentiate between the two like am i on tilt or do i actually believe that you know this is a good good entry point and you know whatever else so i would say the one thing this does do is it heightens my focus on earning money because like oh i need to like earn money i can't just rely on my investments you know completely so like what do you know i got off my ass i taught my course and i like submit my invoice for for the podcast and i like i do things that like will bring cash in because otherwise you know it's easy to get lazy when when everything's just going up so much right there's many days where you could just look at your portfolio and just be like wow that was a whole year's worth of salary just today swing like swing up so that kind of makes you kind of lazy to like do the work that day in a way right because it's like oh well this if this just could earn that much money just doing nothing every day like why do i need to go hustle for that you know that next dollar i feel like yeah i feel like a lot of people are feeling that way they're like oh right i have to work like this doesn't matter which is very healthy very healthy position to be in [Music]

Steph Smith (@StephSmithIO) joins Sam (@TheSamParr) and Shaan (ShaanVP) to discuss why she still works for a company, and what the benefits of working for a big company are vs starting your own.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
they grow up so fast so i just want to cherish these but it's like my pre-billionaire days i just want to really own these because i know how easy it's going to be to lose sight of these when i when i do become a billionaire i so for the record i don't think that whatever i start is a guaranteed success but to sam's point my my point was just that what i want to do is focus on gaining as many skills as possible so that when i take my shot it's a good shot versus i see a lot of people who are like it's time to drop out of college because i think i'm going to be successful steph why are you not working for yourself why do you have a job are you working for these other companies why are you making guys like sam rich she's she's got a good answer so my answer let's see if sean thinks it's a good answer my answer is that currently i get paid well to do things that i like and i have the freedom to work on my side projects which i do and is like a prerequisite to work anywhere and so i personally like the financial stability and the mental stability knowing i get a good paycheck to do things i love and then that means all of my side projects are purely for fun like you know that like con or the comments saying where it's like you know a full-time job no full-time job is fun right so if i made my passions my full-time job full focus then i actually don't think i'd have as much fun so eventually i do want to work on my things alone but i'm pretty happy with my setup yeah but you're the second part you barely touch upon so sean what she told me one time and she said it very clearly she goes yeah i was like are you gonna start a business soon she goes yeah i am i'm just plotting because when i start it i'm going to become a billionaire and i just want to make sure that like i'm ready for all that to happen uh like like she's like very clearly told me like whatever she starts it's gonna become a billion dollar company and she was like so i'm happy yeah she was like she was like i'm happy just to be doing this what i love and building up like my bank account and savings but when i do start something um i think i'm gonna become a billionaire it's like oh i know but they grow up so fast so i just want to cherish these but it's like my pre-billionaire days i just want to really own these because i know how easy it's going to be to lose sight of these when i when i do become a billionaire i so for the record i don't think that whatever i start is a guaranteed success but to sam's point my my point was just that what i want to do is focus on gaining as many skills as possible so that when i take my shot it's a good shot versus i see a lot of people who are like it's time to drop out of college because i think i'm going to be successful and i actually learned this from one of my very first jobs i was like a contractor doing social media for a company and it was this woman who was just like so poised so put together and successful and she was probably around 35 and i asked her that same question i'm like why did you start your company now like why didn't you start it 10 years ago and she told me the same thing she's like steph a lot of people miss the value of learning for you know years in their career from people who have a lot more experience than you and who can basically like teach you all the obstacles that you can miss so that when she went into building this company which was a success off the ground she just knew what she was doing right she wasn't stumbling around so i kind of i'm trying to embody that that that advice from that woman i thought it was actually pretty wise i'm gonna disagree with that advice um and the reason why i disagree i'm almost hesitant to even say this because uh you know everybody should do what they want to do and i fundamentally believe that so you know and if you're happy doing what you're doing fantastic it's not like a career advice to you so i'm kind of talking to you but i'm really i'm just talking to like anybody who's listening to this uh which is the best way to build your skills so that you'll be successful when you go do that thing is to go do that thing now and just keep doing it until you figure it out figuring out other games to try to then parlay them into the game you want to play that works when you didn't realize what game you want to play right so like i learned a lot of skills in poker that helped me in business but if i wanted to be great at business i would do business not poker um it's just at the time i didn't know i wanted to do business i thought i wanted to do poker and so those skills yes they do cross over they will help me for sure um but like all the things you're saying sound good sound reasonable they're just a story that you're telling yourself like if you really wanted to go do that thing you should go do the thing and the fastest way to get good at that and to like you know be good right off the bat or like you know like i don't know sam you've done many businesses i'm sure each time you do one now you have a higher likelihood of success than you did before but it's not like you just do them and they just magically work now because you've you've you've crossed the magical threshold of skills and knowledge and wisdom that now mean businesses that you start will succeed no way right it's like and it's always changing every market's different every business is different timing is always different and so like the reality is if you if you're doing it to build up skills you're building the wrong skills the skills to build is to go if you're building up skills to go start a business the best way to build that skill is to go start businesses um these skills that you have today will help you don't get me wrong it's just not the up like you're taking the long path rather than the the direct path um that's kind of my my pushback i think i have something in my contract where i say uh first kids comments i can't persuade i can't persuade is it there don't i have like a thing of my contract where i can't like poach our uh our past people yeah so i i can't really say too much except uh i think steph should do whatever makes her happy but and she's pretty much capable of doing anything she wants and by the way all right guys i quit i'm kidding i'm done you know the other thing is that not everybody actually wants to be an entrepreneur there's a whole bunch of ways to have uh like the fun of business building without the stress of business building and so like for some people i think that's the honest answer is like actually i want to work in a small team i don't want to go to sleep every night worried about how to make the whole thing work i like that you go to sleep worried about that and i worry about my part and i enjoy my part like and that's the trade i want to make and i think that like more people should be honest with that's the case for them and they say you know right now at this phase of my life i don't want that stress that's that to me means more than like i'm building my skills up right it's like because once you do commit to doing a business it is you know there's no like kind of way there's you know it's not really an easy way out and um you know it's pretty full-on commitment and i don't think you should just make full-on commitments unless you like want to and we're ready to and are down to deal with like the pros and cons of that and so like i have a bunch of people who work for me that i tell them i say look there's like three scenarios here either you suck and you're fired um you're great and you're you're great and you're going to realize you're great you're going to grow here right so you're great and you're going to grow your impacts and grow your comp is going to grow your your rewards are going to grow here or we're going to realize that like you're you need to be doing your own thing in which case you know i'll be your first kind of like backer investor or i'll partner with you on something in some way and i just try to be honest with people like i i kind of only want you to land in one of those three spots uh there's not really like another spot there's not really like another landing destination like this flight only goes those three places and so you know choose which one which one you want i think that's smart though because a lot of businesses treat people like there's like 10 outcomes and they kind of slot people like oh you're pretty good so we'll keep you around or like you're not that bad so we're not going to fire you but really like if you're trying to operate a business effectively it should be mostly those three outcomes like you're either amazing you're driving value so we want you around we're going to incentivize you to do that or like there's probably somewhere better for you [Music] you

[Music] okay first thing super quick so have you guys heard of this twitter account it's called new york times first set have you heard of it no okay so it's kind of just like this fun little twitter account where they track all of the articles being published by the new york times and then they find words that are published for the first time and it's just kind of like a fun thing because i'll send you guys this or i'll post it in the doc this is a link to a couple of the ones uh that they publish so like dead ass for example was a word like first found in the new york times march 2019 doom scrolling may 2020 uh tech bro apparently was january 2022 like that surprises me so this is just kind of like a fun thing but i was thinking that this should exist for jobs so on indeed or glassdoor or something there's a really really quick transition period these days between like just completely new jobs coming to market and i think there should be an account that tracks these like oh this is the first time i've seen like i don't know where i saw this but there's like professional falconer like what who does that how much do they get paid i don't know but i'm surprised to know it exists and i'm sure there's many more practical jobs out there that are coming to market that people should know about and so someone should just create the equivalent of this instead of the new york times it should be for indeed how do they do this that's great how do they track every word and check if it's ever been said before i think it's just a scraper i mean i don't know exactly how they set it up but i don't think it would actually be that by the way this has 200 000 followers so for that person out there who's just been grinding trying to put out great content that has like 3 000 followers just know you could have been tweeting out like single word things from the new york times and got 200 000 followers i actually think that's a great idea have you guys seen the uh remember how we talked about this kid that was tracking elon musk's private jet on twitter now he's tracking all the private jets and private yachts of all the russian oligarchs great pivot and shout out shout out also elon offered him five thousand dollars and he turned it down he's like no i'm going to keep doing my thing but both of his accounts have a lot of five grand for elon stop tracking him yeah yeah because elon was like i don't want people to know where i am what a stupid thing if you're gonna if you're gonna come and offer someone money do it right five thousand dollars that's how you should reply grand um i think this is cool stuff i actually think this is a wonderful idea um i also think that companies would pay for this right as in like companies that have competitors want to know what their competitors are doing and so like we're launching something at hubspot soon and i've already gotten an email from someone who works at techcrunch who's like hey saw this on your site or like they basically dug something up that we publish and they're like what's going on here and imagine you have the same thing where you're like oh i saw like sales forces you know hiring for these roles or i didn't know that was a role at netflix i think companies would pay for that intel that's actually crazy fascinating if you could aggregate like let's say that you're in the me when i was at the hustle i cared about what like there's like 30 companies that i cared about what they were doing it would be kind of interesting to act if i would have paid a monthly fee and i would have gotten a daily email with like the movement and people's job job listings yeah that's that's what i was gonna say i don't think it's so interesting like the the falconer or whatever it's like oh whatever someone made up a random job but oh like we see this a lot where it's like oh netflix is hiring a web 3 engineer that means they're probably trying to explore something in that space and so you can kind of get a sense of what direction somebody's going oh they're hiring enterprise sales okay they're trying to go up market right so there's a competitive intelligence that comes from these but i think that i do think that exists i've seen people tracking these i don't know if they're just doing it for their own fun or if there's like a service that tracks that uh but it is kind of interesting i like that all right what else you got steph oh by the way i should say one more thing i love more thing about this hilarious story i went into work one day and my buddy neil who's like a programmer at our company he was standing at the coffee machine making a coffee it was like 10 a.m and i hadn't even said anything to him yet we were just standing next to each other and he just goes these are my first words he's like he did he realized he hadn't spoke that day yet he like got to work to the coffee machine and like he had started programming like his commute he didn't talk to anybody he was at his destination he just started these are my first words and i thought that [ __ ] was so funny and uh it actually is great when he said that i realized how funny neil is and so we've replaced our marketing person with neil he's uh our iphone programmer and he wrote all of the release notes for our apps because he was just hilarious and he was like loki hilarious but these are my first words i'll never forget that how does that relate relate to that because it's like a word tracker you know the first time the new york times said this word so that's how i thought of that first time neil it's interesting thing about what are your first words every day right like what's coming at your mouth for the first time every day mine's usually like like a grump it's like a [ __ ] when i say enough you know what i mean exercise or something and i'm like oh [ __ ] it's usually my first word well that explains a lot all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are all right what else doing uh i guess related to companies hiring so you guys are no mischief right it's this like company that does these crazy stunts they're on i think stunt number 70 and i their latest stunt i thought was really interesting and relates to this idea of just like creative hiring so if you scroll down tell me about what mischief is i don't entirely get it because they raised funding but when you explain what they are i'm like who what grown adult would trust this child with money it's like south park or saturday night live it's a weekly show it's like a weekly sketch uh but it's just done through code they make a website instead of like a video making a joke they make a website that's a joke yeah but is it exactly does it make money i think it does i don't know how much they've made they've raised three and a half million dollars so i don't know like you're saying i don't know who those investors are what they're looking from mischief but just to give like two examples so one of them recently was i think it's like called tuntin i don't know why it's called that but basically it's called the game of death online which you sign up you get an account and you pay 10 to join the game and all you have to do is log in daily to stay alive and the last person who stays alive gets all the money so it's just kind of like these silly quirky games but the last one they did was they also do like commentary through their game so it was a commentary on in this case the msat so they got people to pay fifty dollars to take the msot and the highest score one it's basically like a their version of the sats um and the person who got the highest score won the entire pot so they didn't actually have that many people did it they had 500 people who did it but it reminded me of something you guys talk about on the pod or have talked about on the pod which is you know the power of like crowdsourcing things like spacex if they want to develop some new technology they put out some competition and that tends to attract more interesting people than you know if they hire a bunch of recruiters to go you know find the people in theory they're looking for the example the example i think you're thinking about is they were trying to figure out some like were they trying to like decode some protein or something that helped with this aids um medication and they like turned it into a video game and they'd spent 10 years trying to solve it and then like a bunch of video gamers got it done in like three weeks yeah well there's the spacex what's what's the spacex challenge the one that everyone knows um is it about x prize it's just like they're that's not from space yeah but there's also yeah that's like a version of that where they basically just put out the bounty and then let people let anybody sort of enter to try to win okay there's a i feel like there's another one that spacex does but in any case like what i'm getting at is all i mean we work for hubspot there's all these companies that are trying to attract like quote unquote top talent and they're doing it in a way that in most cases like true top talent like are you going to want to be like dm'd on linkedin and go through like a traditional interview process like in most cases no and so my question is why isn't there like a really like mischief style recruiting agency that puts out these challenges that the smartest people on the internet are like stoked to solve just out of the sheer pride that um they then can funnel potentially into these companies maybe it's the case that these people just like would never want to work for these larger companies but i just wonder why there isn't a more creative route i have something recruiting i have something for you so this is one of the very first articles the hustle ever wrote i don't even know if you can google it anymore it was literally like we wrote it like two weeks after starting and it was about my friend named max and if you uh google uh ben the hustle google interview or the hustle secret google interview so my friend max was teaching himself some i i gotta remember all the details this was like six years ago he he was learning some type of coding some type of language it was it was like a rare language and he was typing in all these things on google like what does blank mean how do you do blank and after a while his his chrome browser like went like looked like the matrix and it said you look like you might belong to one of us and and it says we've noticed that you've been googling a lot about this type of language and we are hiring for that would you be interested in applying here that's amazing and very few people ever saw this but we wrote an article about this this article got seen by millions of people what's it say ben what was the language google has a secret interview process and it landed me a job that's the headline and and he ended up working there and it worked it worked and uh it was wild that's dope and you know only google can do that because they own the browser in the search engine but uh but what if you were just like what what if there was just like an app that just sat on your computer that basically just tracked everything you did i know sounds great but like gave you job opportunities based on what you do on your computer right like if it knows that steph is in all these different like subreddits and it's like and she's like looking at google trends and all this stuff that's like a signal for what type of person you are like it's actually like a much higher quality signal in theory than any job interview you could do where you're just trying to like present yourself as a certain way versus like what you actually do on the internet right like oh you spend a lot of time in excel or what you actually do on your computer it's like you spend a lot of time in excel you know so uh we've seen we've seen what your capabilities are okay if you're doing macros in excel you could probably qualify for certain types of jobs and so i wonder if there's like a thing you could do like for college students like hey put this on your computer and like do you want your first job out of college like we'll help figure out what that job should be we'll help get you like a job opportunity uh just by putting this like tracker on your computer quick interruption do me a favor scroll down and you're going to see a link to the hustle so if you want to stay up to date on the tech and business news you need to know check out the hustle it's a daily email i used to help write it i love it so check it out scroll down below sounds very naughty yeah i mean though yeah i mean i know it's always like a oh tracking everything on your computer thing but the reason i thought of this is because i watched the q on documentary and in it they have have you guys heard of like cicada3301 no no no it's they covered it in the documentary but basically it was like the epitome of these like crazy online puzzles i think there's been three of them the first two were solved the third one still has not been solved and they are like you know there's there's like a picture online and there's like a message and encrypted in that message there's a bunch of numbers and then you have to know to like go to another website and put it in the point is a lot of people thought that this was actually a recruitment tool for like either the nsa or the cia and so i was like man there should be something maybe not that crazy but something like that online for a company did you guys ever do one of those i did this in college we found this website and it was like you know it said some like vague thing it was like the game has only begun but have you realized it like have you realized that it's begun yet and it's like you have to like right click view source and then the source code there's a url you go to that url and then it downloads an audio file you listen to the audio file it sounds like nothing you listen to it backwards all of a sudden it gives you coordinates you go to those coordinates on a map the map deletion and it was like a 50-part game like mystery game and me and all my friends got totally obsessed with this we spent like hours and hours and now i don't remember what the name this is back in college it was like 15 years ago but like the uh i remember at the end the the last puzzle we could never solve and i think the guy just made an unsolvable puzzle like i just think there was no solution and his name was mr wiggles or mr squiggles or some [ __ ] like that and he um he had this puzzle that was like the unsolvable thing at the end but it was so much fun and actually now that i think about it that is actually a great like filter and barometer for who might be good at certain times of what types of work like the type of person that would do that for fun and solve that problem i would love to hire that person right because i know well could you could you be like uh there's this aw like if you're that game maker mr wiggles or whatever like could you like do that as a service for a variety of companies uh and like make these games like hey we're gonna try and find you but i bet it's like hey i bet we're gonna do this thing this and this thing and i bet you we're gonna get you 20 new applicants every month yeah these silly games but they're going to be high high quality steph what's uh what's newly so newly have either of you guys heard no of newly n-u-l-y i think with this is just a quick one but basically so it's this company that is part of the urban outfitters subsidiary so urban owns urban outfitters anthropology free people and newly and newly is a different take so all those other businesses sell clothes in a very traditional way what newly is is a rental business so every month they send you six items you choose those six items on your own they send them to you you get to rent them for a month and then at the end of the month you have the option to keep them at honestly a pretty discounted rate somewhere between like 15 to sometimes up to 60 percent and they've a ton of brands in there including their own brands and the reason i thought this was interesting is you know there's other rental clothing services out there but this is tacked on to existing businesses that weren't renting clothes and it spoke to me because it was kind of similar to what amazon's done turning a cost center into something that maybe in this case isn't a profit center but is way more profitable i think than the traditional clothing business that they have so if you guys remember i think was it mark lore or um one of your guests talked about just how many returns there are for clothing it's let me just pull up a stat right here 20 right yeah exactly and a return with clothing can cost up to 66 of the the cost of an item so actually a lot of these closing stores were just saying like look you can you can just keep the stuff you don't even have to send back the item in this case newly not only uh it doesn't have to like send items to people and not have them returned because it's so expensive i'm paying newly to rent these clothes so they're not losing money on the rental they're now making money on the rental and they've structured it in a way where it's actually really compelling and so i think newly i don't know the exact size of it now but at least where i live i run into like at my co-working space all the girls there are wearing newly and i just like i wonder how this can be applied to other businesses so like what are those cost centers that could actually be turned into a profit center sean what's the return rate on the things that you're involved in through investments or whatever this is way lower um way lower than the 20 so like you know more like and i don't know if that's i don't know if that number is uh like what percent of your orders get returned or what percent of your revenue what what what percent of revenue is the cost of returns so i'm not sure exactly what that what that's meant to quote but you know of course any return is like a drain on the business and so you you know any way that you could turn returns into uh to either a neutral or profitable thing would be would be kind of amazing what do brands do with returned clothing or returned items they kind of like so typically you sort of like there's like a it's like an er right so the patient comes in and it's like okay it's it's it's a lost cause you just gotta dump it all right right or it's like oh this could be patched up okay so you just need to like re-tag it it's in good condition re-tag it put it back in back in packaging it's all good to go sometimes you have to like clean it steam it whatever like and in fact uh there's a guy sonny who follows us on twitter and listens to the pod and he has this thing called rock returns so i think he had an e-commerce brand he had like a suit brand like a nice men's suit brand and returns were kind of like killing him because it's like a very kind of like heavy thing to ship and it's an expensive product and um he's like well what am i supposed to do with this and his 3pl or like his warehouse was not like they weren't willing to um like reprocess the suit and he couldn't he couldn't send out a questionable suit so he had to know that this is like if it did get if it is going to be set back out it's in good condition and so he actually created his own returns warehouse and he's doing it for himself and now a bunch of other brands right same as the aws model so he turned his cost center into a profit center and i think this business is better than his e-commerce business overall and he's just becoming an expert of like oh yeah like here's the efficient way to handle returns and now he's doing it for himself and a whole bunch of other e-commerce brands and uh and he's like nerding out about it hardcore he's like dude i found this new way of like steaming the thing that like makes it you know where we get extra 10 of them back into circulation because they're you know they're better now or like we could turn it around at this cost and they just charge like a cost per return processed basically for um for for the brands damn that's bad because usually what makes you good at processing returns is not the same thing as what gets you good at like warehouse a general warehouse with a bunch of pallets and boxes and shipping orders out it's like takes like a different skill set in a way can we talk about uh one other idea yeah so what you talked about sean reminded me of so there's all this real estate and i'm sure this is like an overdone idea but there's all this real estate that people have access to and not everyone knows what it can be used for so maybe it could be used for a fulfillment center maybe your garage could be rented out and there's a couple examples that i came upon that i thought were interesting and i wonder if someone could aggregate all of these different ways that real estate or parts of real estate can be used to gain some income so let me give you a couple examples a lot of people have heard of solar panels so companies will pay you so that you can install solar panels on your roof you'll get into a licensing agreement and they'll make money off of that that's why they'll often install it for free another example is churches so apparently due to the height of churches and specifically the steeples on churches different telecom companies will pay these churches for access to their steeple so an example is the national cathedral in washington is paid guess how much actually guess how much they're paid by motorola every single year i would have thought like a thousand a month so 100 000 a year just for access to their 234 foot tower and some churches are even building steeples they don't even have a steeple but they're like look i heard this other church is getting 100k a year we want that so that's another example one final example i'll share is surfline my partner he surfs all the time he uses these surf cams to check you know how the waves are every day well where are these surf cams apparently they're actually in people's backyards so if you have a backyard that is in a strategic area to see the surf you can either sign up yourself or you can recommend or refer people to be like a surf cam house and they'll come they'll install it and then i believe you get i'm not actually sure in this case how much but you get paid a certain amount to have that surf cam in your backyard so those are three examples i'm sure there's many more but i feel like there should be a site that says like oh you've got a house in this area you have a roof that gets this much sunlight or it's this tall or it's this much square footage would you go as far as to put this into cars too one time years ago shawn and i listened to this pitch of this guy who created a you know how cab cabbies have like advertising on top of their car he was doing that for uber drivers and uh i don't actually know i i see him everywhere but i don't know how the business what happened with the business huge valuation so so they definitely got some traction i think it's like a multi-hundred million dollar company now it's called firefly what um wow yeah and there's another one that has like the screens have you guys been in ubers where it's like a screen and it's just playing ads those ones are i feel like the execution on that has been terrible but like that's another example where it's like oh you actually have valuable real estate which is the back of this car seat because you have people i have an idea for you um new side project for you it's called the side hustle generator and we'll put it on the my first million podcast website and it's a side hustle generator oh it's a giant quiz that leads you into a list of potential side hustles you could be ethical for so you're like yeah you know in your thing it's like do you do you own a church you know do you do you live by the surf do you um do you have a car that you don't use all the time right like there's all these different ways because i think you know people um people don't realize the number of opportunities that are like literally at their fingertips it's like do you own a phone do you know you get paid to test websites for companies all you have to do is go to the website and just talk out loud as you try to use their website usertesting.com right like my mom didn't know that and then she knows that and that like kind of like changed her life a little bit right she like all of a sudden had this thing she could do every day that kept her busy that made her some money and she enjoyed it um then you know airbnb i remember telling my parents about airbnb it's like you know took some you know somebody had to educate them about it but now they make six figures a year airbnb being their home and so there's like how many of these your parents do yeah where do they go uh they'll just go like you know to a hotel they'll go to a vacation they'll just leave the city they'll come to my house they'll go anywhere like they don't care because because they can get like you know 700 800 a night for their home and they'll go rent a hotel you know if 40 minutes away or an hour away they'll go to wine country or whatever and rent a hotel for 200 and they you know they pocket the difference did you guys remember the company about stuff you do the penny hoarder yeah so the penny holder started as a blog it started by this guy named kyle he spoke at one of our events he's a cool dude and then his business partner is a friend of mine and anyway he started it in 2012 and he started it where he would just talk about all the side hustles he was doing so for example he would go on taskrabbit and like get people's groceries and we talk about how much money he was making he would become an instacart driver he would talk about how much money he's making he would do uber driver and how much money he was making and he got really good at getting traffic and eventually he uber goes hey for every new driver you refer to us we'll give you two thousand dollars instacart did the same thing taskrabbit did the same thing uh you user testing did the same thing and then like a person who like you need to answer surveys and so that's what he did and he built this business this digital ad business um he when he came to the event he brought his dog and i was like oh how'd you get your dog on the plane he goes oh i fly private and i was like what are you crushing it that hard he goes yeah we bootstrapped it and we'll do about 70 million in revenue this year and he owned 100 of the company and he recently sold it for i forget the exact number but it was in the hundreds of millions of dollars and the whole premise was just on like talking about ways that you can make it was mostly lower income people like people like like maybe a mom who's just trying to like make ends meet with just like 10 hours that she has available instead of taking care of kids and um he killed it this business crushed it you've never heard of the penny holder sean i heard i've heard it from you but i never went to it so i never like used it it's just a wordpress blog that's all it is uh sorry i was looking forward to stuff stock and realizing how many interesting ideas there are in here steph we have to do a two-parter so uh so yeah let's let her bang out a couple more let's give us one more i'll come back any time i mean that was the worst ideas in the middle of the list was the best idea so that's my feedback to you well why don't you tell me what's an interesting one that you you have you're right i'm looking at some of these like trend success stories i think those are pretty interesting um that's one i was kind of looking at just at the moment which one of those is your favorite hmm well i feel like okay so let's call out a couple of them real quick so last time i was on i talked about like this idea of like your listicle is my opportunity a couple people have actually taken action on that they've created these sites that identify the healthiest versions of not very healthy things so one guy started a tick-tock it got hundreds of thousands of views in the first few days and then someone else tweeted about this actually this just last night let me see what they did they're called fast food cravings where basically the headline says eat what you want not what you can and it lets you like put in a specific restaurant and find the healthiest version of the food at that restaurant we talked about insider trading at on one of the very first episodes i was on and this guy after that episode i think this actually existed before the episode but connor dm'd me and he was like so there are these sites that track insider trades but there are specific types of insider trades that are more interesting than others and specifically it's stock grants to executives it's not obviously a sure thing but he said he was like typically what that signals is the company trying to you know invest in a particular thing if the executives hit certain targets it's generally a good sign obviously not investment advice but he created this community called spring loading and what he does is he started a scraper that looks for all the insider trades but then specifically vets them for this particular aspect like is the company granting a buttload of stock to a group of executives and he just he's he basically shares these and then he i shared an example in the chat but he basically he sends the uh financial report he sends the grant details then he summarizes it he says look these people are getting this grant this is what i have you know what additional information i have and then he gives a conviction rating so some of his conviction ratings are like one like guys this is probably nothing maybe something if you want to take a bet go for it some of them he's like this is a five so i shared one again not investment advice but he shared one for example for cloudflare a little bit ago obviously cloudflare with all the other tech companies is tanked recently but he was like this is one of the biggest performance grants i've ever seen with pretty massive price targets i don't think there's any news in the near future but i do believe that cloudflare has massive potential and the stock is down 35 over the last month and then he shares again the exact grant values what targets they need to hit so for example these execs have different price targets similar to you know you guys discuss like elon musk's like crazy price targets if they hit i think um cloudflare today is at 95 or something like that their first price target is 156 dollars and it goes all the way up to 979 dollars so this is what these execs internally are tracking towards so i don't know i thought that was like another interesting example i think he's i think this community is pretty successful he's charging people monthly fees by this idea did you bet on this i haven't uh cal my partner he's been in the community he did actually i mean again not financial advice but he bet on one and i can't remember what company it was but it did one one day like go up but this was obviously also in the uh don't even tell me more actually just leave it there and i'm convinced don't even i don't i don't need anything else well i was gonna say i definitely like don't want people to be go going and gambling their money on on that one anecdote but it is interesting to even just like be in there and and what i've found because i'll just like dabble in the community i haven't placed any bets but to see um what like i'm learning about a bunch of different companies that i've never heard of i'm seeing like how these different companies are structuring stock grants and like why and someone commenting on it and then of course there's just like a bunch of um a bunch of people commenting like are you betting like oh [ __ ] like i'm 50 down like how are you doing and it's so it's kind of like a fun community as well you guys have this is awesome you guys have a uh like a like a degenerate budget or like a learner budget where it's like okay this is my [ __ ] around with money that i can i can try different things or do you guys not do that same you're shaking your head no i don't but but do you it sounds like you do i do yeah how much uh well let's talk about like in percentage terms so it's like you know what would that be it's like don't do percentage terms like literally how much like like 50 50 000 no more than that uh wow yeah for sure and so what will you do with that what's an example of your of a dumb of a risky thing that you've done uh like i think i've told this story before but i remember watching uh so the idea with these is um i'll just tell the story first i watched a youtube video of this guy no idea who this guy is uh some wall street some some hedge fund guy and basically he's a prolific short trader this is kind of like the vibe i got from this video couldn't tell you how to tell you his name couldn't tell you what his track record was uh white guy looked reasonable enough and uh he basically was like he's like yeah i'm uh he's like my short pick of the year is tootsie roll and uh and all these i was like well i was listening i was a white white tootsie roll i didn't realize it's a public stock he's like tootsie roll he's like first of all who the hell eats tootsie roll he's like do you think tootsie roll is growing he's like no the people eat tootsie rolls are like you know 50 and up their dying market kids don't want tootsie roll nowadays they want like all these other candies he's like tootsie roll has zero innovation they refuse to change their product and um they don't come out with anything new he's like and then it's also poorly run and not gonna be so it was like owned by some woman who was like i think it's owned by like a 92 year old lady she passed away now but at the time this was like five years ago or something like that like that that this happened i don't know where this was it was a while back and um i remember watching that video and i was like oh this guy's totally right titsurl is [ __ ] dead i went that day and i better get stitcher roll i made a bunch of money just on this like zero thought process zero diligence like just like take it take a punt and uh you know do something on a whim and so that was the first time i realized like actually i want a designated budget and with crypto this has become like you know kind of a necessity with crypto you basically have like you have so many new things that are all interesting and you can't get to high conviction because they're new it's rapidly evolving like the opportunities in front of you today and so you don't have time to diligence all these you don't have time to get to high conviction but you do know like where you know you can sort of sense certain signals like if a bunch of smart people are looking at it um if you see you know developer activity in that space if the premise is like you know interesting it might hit might not hit whatever you can basically take punts on things in crypto and you get paid off unlike the stock market right i think on the tootsie roll thing i made like i don't know 20 35 something like that in crypto you can make like 20 x when you're right on these things and so with krypto the odds just shift in your favor where yeah it's super fast moving and things can go to zero but the the upside when you hit is so high it pays for all of your other bad bets and so i basically created a budget because i was like i can't um i can't overthink this i need to i need to intentionally underthink this so what does that mean it's like there's been in the last five years there's been so many examples of things that i've come across my radar in crypto that i don't take action on because i feel like i don't have enough information to make an educated decision and actually if i had just made uneducated decisions i would have done far better than my like educated decisions turned out to be because the space is just um where there's a lot of progress being made and you can't keep up with all the different projects all different tokens so i basically set out a budget where i said if somebody tells me something that's interesting i have money that i could just like dump into that it's a small amount of money i don't care if that money that money goes to zero and i'm not putting it all into one so i'm taking like a portfolio of these and let's just see what happens and in doing so i get to actually learn how these things work um and so you know like i did one the other day and i put it in the milk road explaining literally step by step what this what this project was and why i'm why i'm going into it and how i have no idea if this is like a great idea a bad idea i didn't audit the security of the project like i don't have time for all that i'm just like trying to learn how these things work and i'm putting small bets in a bunch of different areas with money that i can afford to lose do you do that stuff so i don't cal does uh i think it's smart though because like sean saying these are the type of investments where like if you don't have money sequestered for this it's gonna it's gonna capture your psychology that's actually why i don't dabble in these things but uh he's done that a lot for nfts right so at first he was like steph i'm just gonna buy one obviously he's bought bought more since then but he he has a certain amount and like that's all he's willing to invest if it goes to zero he's happy with it um but he's also probably sold a lot too early because he has a concentrated amount so he's like oh i gotta sell this to buy another thing uh sean did you get into proof i feel like that was a big no i didn't i didn't do proof that's that's a great example of one where i'm like oh interesting kevin rose is doing this nft thing i should uh i should you know i should take a punt right like it's i'm seeing this before most people um i should go in and like again like with these things it's not gonna it's not like gonna go to zero quote unquote it's like you know so i can trade out of the thing if i want to and you know three months from now but like to weigh each to i don't want every decision to be heavy and um and i you have you guys seen this meme that's like the it's like the curve i think it's called like the midwit meme it's basically like there's an idiot on one side there's a genius like i said on one side is the idiot he looks like a troll it looks like you know it's like whatever shrek and on the other side there's like a jedi master and then the middle which is like the top of the curve is like the average person and it's like uh you know like for example like oh like the idiot would be like oh that monkey looks like that's a cool looking monkey i'll buy all right the genius is like oh this you know this has a chance to be an iconic you know like like whatever iconic nft bi i didn't think about it more than that and then the like middle guy is like you know but why would anybody buy this picture of a monkey and like how do the tokenomics work and they try to like analyze the whole [ __ ] thing and they're hey they're just paralyzed that's some sort of analysis paralysis where they don't they don't take action on anything and they overthink things so they miss the like the big simple opportunities that are in front of them a lot of times and um i heard the guy from yc who michael seibel talking about this he goes he goes this is often the case with startup ideas he goes a beginner like you know you out of college when you don't know anything about anything you just think it's all like you don't you don't know how hard it's going to be you don't know what a good you don't know how to vet opportunities you just be like oh that sounds cool like let me try that and then same thing with the jedi master the jedi master's like oh like you know would it be cool if you could take a rocket to mars let's try that you know like that's also the like you don't need to analyze it beyond that at the beginning it's like this fundamental decision is pretty it's very simple and then like the person he's like the person i hate talk to talking to is like the second time founder who's trying to like over optimize their cap table and like try to get like really complicated about the like the valuation and this and then that and then they're trying to do like this lean validation about every single thing and it's like that's the hardest person to deal with because they're they know too much but not enough to know how to keep it simple and uh he's talking about like the best ideas the best startup ideas they go to like that that idiot genius category where it's like you know like you should make cars that are electric you know like we should we should sell books online yeah it's like yeah what if we could buy a book online and it's like that's it right you don't need to go too much further than that what's uh what's that video called uh it's a it's one of the y combinator it's it's michael cyble and this guy dalton caldwell they do like a split screen side by side and they just talk about something for 30 minutes and this is one of them uh i don't remember the name of the video do you know the name of the title i can find it uh real quick while you guys talking but i don't know by the way believe in that like this idea of the sort of like idiot genius like don't overthink it thing well i just did the idea i just did the idea well go ahead step i'll let you go first well i was just gonna say quickly like yes i believe in it and yes i think it applies to like different things so i would say i'm the like would you call it like mid-twit or something uh somewhere in the middle for like midwit in in finance that's why i don't dabble because i'm like i over analyze things i hear one piece of news i'm out kind of kind of deal but um i think it applies to like with startups i think i'm maybe not that with other things i certainly am like just just terrible and so i think it i think our friendship applies a great example of this right like he saw nfts and was like oh that looks cool like i'm gonna buy one i'm gonna make one uh what should i make it of i don't know like this i don't know this diagram i already have like you know it's like the simplest [ __ ] and the guys did millions of dollars this year how much how much do you think he's made off those how much do you think he's made on is he do you think he's like wildly wealthy from those uh i don't know you know he he's done well for sure i think you know he he bought apes he bought he bought a punk i think he's bought some of the like the projects that went up from like for sure you know and plural like you said like apes not not like one ap he's bought multiple of all i think those were like priced at like you know i thought whatever like a thousand dollars like you know 18 months ago and now each one is worth like you know 250 500 000 so i don't know if he held i don't know what it was but even just the the stuff he made right like i know a lot of people are like oh web3 the metaverse i need to create an empty project he needs to have this and that and utility blah blah he's like hey i minted a picture of like a you know a thing that says not like not like right click save as you know it's kind of like just making fun of the space sold it for like fifty thousand dollars right like did that in an afternoon and uh that's like the mid you know instead of being the midwit over analyzer logical you know processor of all things you know he went to the kind of the genius zone and uh just took a punt and it because he's in the genius zone it's not heavy it doesn't take a lot of time or energy or money to like try it and so i i specifically carved out a portion of my investing budget to say look this is my my gamble like you know i'll get rid of my gambling energy i'll learn by doing this because i'll do things that i wouldn't otherwise do and i'll have skin in the game so i'll actually pay attention to it um and like who knows you know maybe i'll maybe i'll have some have some hits out of this and i bet i honestly think that that part of my portfolio is gonna do better than the the well thought through quote-unquote part of my portfolio by the way sam i think you do this really well when people like i've seen people come to you and they're like sam i'm thinking of like starting this business and like i want to cover this topic and i want to blog and all this stuff and you're like all right like what's your first step or like you you'll be like just right or something like that which just like simplifies to the like idiot jedi like just do the thing not like over analyzing the like 50 startup articles when sam says dying dog he just needed he goes randy jackson on him well i get i just get frustrated i think because i think that like i think that it's good so if like building a business is step 0 to 10 and 10 is like you're this billionaire or like your vision has been achieved you know you you you own all this property whatever it is it's good to have number ten and then a lot of people are like all right that's step number ten and then like steps three four five six seven eight nine i gotta figure those out in my mind i'm like no but the only thing that's important is ten and one and one after you get done with one you'll figure out number two just but until you get to number two don't even think about worrying about number three it's not important dude i have the same exact thing i i call it a b z literally like word for word your thing and i i went on jax to jack's community he asked me to give a talk into his like uh visualize value community and i this was the one thing i told him i go you you have you're at a that's where you are z is the vision it's the dream it's good to have that it's good to know what that is right that's like the north star and like without that you know you don't really have the motivation i don't really understand like what the hell you're trying to do but where everyone gets paralyzed is they think they need to know a step b c d e f g h i j and it's like and then they get paralyzed or they start thinking about step d when they haven't even done you know a to b yet and so i go a b z it's all you ever need it's like where you are you got to know that accurately the next thing you need to do you need to know that and then you need to know the end vision and everything else is irrelevant like just do that and so you just literally said the same thing with your own like with numbers basically instead that's awesome great great minds think alike i mean that's exactly how i feel because i every time i've ever had any bit of success or even when i've like done something and it didn't work out i just think that like if you just start and you're gonna see so many things that you didn't even expect or realize were an opportunity and or that weren't an opportunity you're like oh i thought this it's actually way different but that's cool or that's not cool we gotta quit uh you know what i mean and uh you just that's why you just have to do something um i have this and i get really frustrated with inaction i've been saying this lately uh i love thin books and quick silence and so what does that mean like i love a thing did you make that up yeah i love a thin book because a thin book is like a simple idea presented without the fluff and that's it that's the value you know don't try to you don't need a thick book uh for everything so i'm a big fan of thin books now and the other one is a quick silence which is i call my buddy sue leo about every business question i have basically it's like oh we're starting the milk road hey what do you think about this and then there's a quick silence like he says his thing it's obvious that's the answer and i was like building up in my head i need to like oh man i really want to sit down with him and talk it's like within three minutes we've reached a good pause where it's like well i guess nothing else really matters till we go do that right yep all right well i guess i'll just do that obviously yeah check you later like and so that quick silence to me is like now what i want was i used to want to fill that silence with more detail more analysis more planning more uh nuance more like if then statements and like you don't really need any of that like we talk by the end of my sentence he says his sentence uh sorry for i guess i didn't really need a call i guess i could have just done a text and you know like i guess i kind of knew this to begin with like maybe i didn't need to call you right but that quick silence is really showing me like that's when i'm on the right track is when i get either a thin book or a quick silence is like when i'm on the right track and when i need more answers uh typically i'm just i'm actually going in the wrong direction altogether dude yeah that reminds me uh from coding if you uh if you run into an error and you're on like stack overflow or something and you're just like you're you can't find your answer it's probably because you're googling the wrong thing like you've completely messed it up you're in the complete wrong direction um and i feel like that applies in in most cases if you find yourself asking like 10 questions it's like hold up like you are you're just like going in the complete opposite direction that you should be like pull back and revisit how many people reach out to you after each one of these episodes goes live stuff and said that they like want to pitch you on something or they want to recruit you to come join something well it grows and some of your buddies reach out which is always fun but i feel like um we're talking about what we're talking about i don't want to drop anything dummy that sounds like a story what's behind that no no i just mean like it's cool because well also i should say like some people that i've really looked up to i don't want to call out their names because i don't obviously these are like private messages but people that i've looked up to that i was like oh i used to read your stuff or like i've literally read your book or like we're from the same country i'm not naming eddie james but uh it's been cool and it's grown obviously because you guys have grown the pod a lot um so yeah that's amazing well there's few people i'll get a fistfight over you are one of them steph so let me know who uh you haven't broken your contract sam so you're good uh well good i'm happy you came you have so much more to cover i think we should wrap up here though yeah sorry i actually apologize i ever do listen to this because steph had a bunch of gold and i feel like i took it in these really random directions so to make up for it we're going to do a second part of staff if you'll come back and we'll do more of these ideas rapid fire and i'll shut up yeah i'm down let's do it [Music]

[Music] so listen to this you don't get out of your house so this maybe won't mean anything to you but have you ever heard of i know timeout i know timeout i've i've read timeout so timeout started in the 60s you know that it's from the 60s it's like been around forever and it started as like basically a magazine and then a blog whereas like local markets but what they're most known for now have you ever heard of the timeout market no what is that okay so they do like restaurant stuff right yes so tell me what you know about timeout so i lived in london and i think there i used to pick up timeout and i lived in boulder colorado and it's like you know if you want to see kind of like what new restaurants there are kind of like get reviews of restaurants it was like it's like your friend who's a foodie who will like tell you what's up like oh you got to check this place out oh it's great this is a great place for a place for a date and it kind of and then they would release it at like i felt like it a lot like maybe every week or month or something it was like pretty frequently updated and i think it's free right use it for that yeah it was like free it was just like sitting around everywhere and i just i can visually see that red it's like a red logo right timeout yeah so it's a pretty timeless brand it's been around for a long time it started in england actually so if you live in london it was probably most popular there but basically in 2014 or maybe 2018 they started doing this news concept called a timeout restaurant or a time-out market so google time out market and you'll see it but basically what they do is they went into i think the first one was in lisbon where i was this is i went to it when i was in lisbon but i've gone to it in miami they have seven markets now but basically what they did was they went to like a touristy place and they found like the 20 most popular restaurants based off of their blogs and like what all the touristy stuff like oh you got to go to portugal so you can taste the coffee from here a croissant from here and like some fish from here and they basically just created um a food court like in the middle of the city and they gave 20 restaurants different stalls and so when you go to this different city i went to it in miami um miami was cool because like you know miami they say you got to get a cubano from this place you got to try the cuban coffee from this yeah it's like i'm getting in a cab just to go get the sandwich yes and so what they did was they set it up so you can go to this one food court and you could try all of the famous vendors and the famous restaurants and i went in lisbon i went in portugal and it was awesome and it was packed this place was packed and time out i like you remember time out being this like free thing and i'm like that's kind of neat like i don't have brand affinity towards this but when i went this place was jammed packed with young people and like like young hip looking people and time out i didn't think as a young hip brand and i started researching this and so time out they're publicly traded and their market cap has been obliterated in the last three years because a their digital media like went to [ __ ] because it was mostly restaurants advertising with them and b the way that they a lot of investors thought that they were going to grow and get big was through these markets which also were basically closed down all of 2020 but they're killing it right now this place was packed and so basically they have 168 million market cap in 2019 they did about 70 million pounds in revenue so what's that like is that times two uh for dollars is that like 130. it was yeah i think i don't know if it's still there so somewhere north but in 2021 they only did 40 million in revenue however 0.3 x now uh 1.3x okay so that's they they were doing the equivalent of over 100 million dollars in revenue but check this out in 2019 pre-pandemic their timeout markets did 23 million in revenue 2020 only 12 million but they only have seven locations which means each one of these food courts does three million in revenue and the reason why so they have them in lisbon miami new york boston chicago montreal dubai and they've got some coming up in prague and a couple other places the reason why this is interesting is a this is just awesome i think this is an amazing example of a company that has a digital media presence that's doing a really good job of diversifying two um this is a really sick business because if they're only in seven markets and they're doing yeah you know 23 million in revenue like there's easily a future where you could imagine 50 or 80 of these in you know a variety of like you know touristy cities it's kind of cool right yeah this is one where the actual experience sounds [ __ ] awesome and so i kind of want it to be a great business and i bet in actuality it's like a good business not a great one but it also feels like something that kind of anybody could spin up as a side hustle um you know like if you're in durham north carolina there's every city has like you know 15 20 spots that are like oh the ice cream over here and the you know the the sandwich over here and oh you haven't tried the bon bons over here whatever right like every place has that collection of stuff and then it becomes kind of prestigious to be picked and all you're doing is basically making a pop-up tent that's like a food court but instead of you know sabaro and cinnabon you're putting in like cool hip places right in fact this place should actually just have a cinnabon every four stalls because that's what people really want but you know besides that you know i feel like this is a great this is a great little side hustle that i think anybody who's a foodie could create um i do pretty well with i thought it was so fun and when i went there i was like oh this is brilliant and so i ended up going there when i was in portugal i wanted to go there just like every day i'm like let's just go like i'd rather just go here every day taste all like a little bit of food i'll spend ten dollars here and i wish we had done this in miami like i would have paid a 100 all you could eat just to like walk through this and be able to grab stuff you know like all you could eat pass yes it's it's awesome and i went to this and i realized how much fun i had i went to i did the one in miami too um i would i'll totally do the one in new york but i thought this was such an interesting basic simple concept and they pulled it off and it was really fun and i think that this is actually i think it's like i don't know if this could be an amazing business i think that time out though they could be worth over a billion dollars in the next two years once they like open up right now they're only worth 168. um that's pounds so it's like 200 million um stock tip i feel like we got a stock tip here well i'm not saying that sampar is flashing the buy signal hard analyst sam sampar projects time out i i want this to get aggregated by like some random reuters you know like you know motley fools gonna like turn this into into a uh article here [Music] all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are would you buy so uh would you buy any russian stocks right now they're getting crushed obviously no just because like i'm not i don't want to make i don't want to like try to make money off this opportunity i know this guy okay off brand but you know i'm on board with that i'm on board with that but let's like let's say beyond that let's say like let's say you're a russian and you're actually in favor of this war and you're just crazy and you're in do you think that would you have faith in the russian stock market well a lot of these were getting close to zero like uh you know like like real businesses were like dropping you know 50 70 80 percent and so yeah you know you're getting tremendous value so if you're a citizen there and you're a believer and you know you don't want to be in the local currency anyway so you need to you'd rather if you just told me you can either stay in the ruble or you can take your ruble and turn it into something else i'm gonna always take something else and their options on something else got cut off like okay you can't get dollars you can't get crypto you can't get can get different things so what are you gonna buy and um you know so because they were limited in many ways across those some like there was like you know they stopped the amount of rubles you could sell and so you know if you could get into stocks hey it's better than better than staying in in the uh in the paper yeah it's interesting i i wouldn't buy a russian company just for the same reasons that you said but we did the episode in the oligarchs and that was like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where russia was going from communist to somewhat capitalist and in my head i'm like this might be another one of those opportunities where you could like buy like the equivalent of exxon in russia which hopefully likely won't go or i don't care about hopefully but it likely won't go away but you could get like a huge discount all right um i got a couple of things for you but first did you see this thing about the right wing site that went viral which one uh okay so check out this i wrote this thing on the on our job right-wing side goes viral it's a link to a tweet so this guy jed legume which is just a got to be a fake name judd legume he says a far-right website launched 36 days ago and it's already more popular on facebook than the washington post the dc inquirer has executed an audacious scheme to manipulate facebook's algorithm and ad platform and meta is letting them get away with it and so basically the article talks about um this publication that was created so let me uh um it's called the dc enquirer and they'll have articles that are like you know um you know like whatever the freedom convoy is on the verge of victory in canadian provinces right and they will get a bunch of people to post about it and what they showed was that um and so they so they got like all these right-wing pages that are like impeach joe biden or i love america keep texas red uh save america and they were all posting the same thing and so that should be kind of like a it's basically like a coordinated kind of like ad campaign or whatever and it started to get really really big so the page um this guy brandon gill created the page and you know it has like i don't know over a million um you know like a million followers or something like very quickly and it's all run under this like uh yeah it's basically like this this right-wing thing that got popular now you've told me about this before which is that cons extremely conservative or extremely liberal sites will get very popular very quickly especially on facebook but and i was pretty uh surprised to see this yeah there's a butt here liberals like yeah obviously polarized on one side does well conservative does significantly better because this is a principle that is always true which is a group of people that feel downtrodden like feel like they're underdog they band together and they get in an outrage does more for sharing and in america so there's like groups like minorities women um a lot of like far right conservatives because media is typically left they think you know our voice is being stomped out and so they band together so if you go to huffpo and you go and look at the comments section and then go to breitbart and look at how many comments if you go have you been to breitbart.com yeah i've been there go to breitbart and just like click a random article and look how many comments sometimes it's 20 000 comments it's crazy so i totally believe it with this website and i'm by the way i'm looking up um dc and choir i googled it i don't see a website is it literally just a so so basically it looks like what he's done he's basically created like a web of like accounts that are kind of all the same so so basically it's like there's the guy's personal account it's got brandon gill and his bio is like you know i'm the founder and editor of dcenquirer.com so that's the that's the url uh dc inquirer with a to e e n q um and it's like his bio is patriot period proud west texan period businessman financer rancher conservative christian dartmouth husband it's like bingo you know you get you hit all the words congratulations by the way sam you are also a rancher you're almost like a husband i like most all those things is he also a fan of fan of corn dogs this guy's like [Laughter] so then he's got like basically a whole bunch of other pages so i think red wave i love america all those pages i mentioned i think those are his pages so they've all been built up like ones at a million one's at six hundred fifty thousand one's at two hundred thousand and he's running ads that were are like if you go look at brandon gill's ads in the ad library uh so if you've never done this before by the way it's like one of the best tools available to any internet person is if you go to facebook.com and then you are just google facebook ad library and then you can look up the ads of any brand what ads they're running so if you look at the brands he's running it'll be like a picture of joe biden is like talking at a rally like kind of confronting somebody and it says if you want joe biden removed from office tap the big thumbs up in the right corner and so it's like you know it's clearly like running political ads that are not marked as political ads basically so this guy's point was like oh they're he's getting away with it you know facebook you know you need to shut this down what i thought was interesting was dude this would be an amazing little prank like if i'm mischief or i'm just like someone out there with like a [ __ ] with too much time on their hands here's what i would do i'd basically do the same thing i'd make a extremely conservative site and i would put out some articles i would get the traction and i would do this for like two months and then the third month i would just pull the rug on everybody and it would just switch to an extremely liberal lgbtq website with the same email list i'll just switch everything overnight once i get all these people subscribed which just for sure would make the news um yeah then and then that story of the prank pulled would create a new cycle of its own and then you could basically go get any job you want in any marketing pr or whatever agency because you could be like yeah i just i did this like so instead of sending your resume out and cover letter like do a stunt that shows your knowledge of how the internet works how media works how pr works how marketing works and you know you'll impress a lot of people with your ability to like pull off a stunt like that that's actually how buzzfeed started too uh was jonah peretti was pulling stunts like this i think he did it with nike nike yeah what was it again i don't remember exactly but he uh basically said he revealed like a a fake easter egg so he said like i think it was like if you do something with this pair of shoes something happens something like no no no no no it was it was an email thing it was like a sweatshop thing okay so here's what it is oh so he goes to nike had this feature personalized id where you could like write your name i don't know if you did this i did this i got my name yeah yeah on my shoes i thought it was so cool he goes so he writes an email uh you know from from jonah peretti to nike id personalize nike.com he goes greetings my order was cancelled because my personal nike id does not but my oh no my order was canceled but my nike id does not violate any of the outlined uh rules um in your message so the personal id on my custom shoes was the word sweatshop sweatshop is not a name of another party's trademark the name of an athlete blank or profanity i chose the id because i wanted to remember the toilet and labor of the children that made my shoes could you please ship them to me immediately thanks and happy new year jonah pereira and so then he sent that obviously that's not going to go viral as an email but he screenshots that and started getting it and put it out there and then that got like kind of like a big news storm uh going and he was doing stunts like this before creating buzzfeed and it kind of showed this guy knows how to make the internet you know how to tickle the internet and he uh he he did it well one of my favorite things to watch on youtube is these videos where people will do one of two things they'll go it's usually always political stuff and they go to someone and they say isn't this outrageous this person said this thing and they'll read what they personally said and go do you don't agree with that do you and they go oh no i don't agree with that at all like i'm a conservative there's no way i would be like oh well this is what donald trump said uh or like you know like they'll do something like that well they'll like make you disagree with something that you whatever and then they'll do or they'll do it and they'll say do you agree with this and they'll read out like um a speech from hitler and they're like yeah i totally agree with that i'm like oh hitler said so it's not it's it's and it's actually not that fair to do that but well they also go to 100 people and 96 have like a normal reaction and then the four that fall for it it's like they stitch those together and it just makes it look like everybody at this trump rally feel is dumb and makes this mistake and it's like they kind of make new yorkers or rally you know participants or teens or millennials on college campuses they'll make them look like idiots because they'll right all you got to do is you talk to enough people you're going to catch five people who fall for the the trick right it's like borat right like uh when he does these tricks or these stunts they do go viral and they do make you know the other party look bad but they don't show you all the people that didn't fall for it and don't believe that and didn't say something stupid in response [Music]

[Music] i got my drunk idea should we do some drunk ideas yeah let's do it all right so again to frame this these are ideas that i had that i don't think are good but i still want to say them so i call it drunk ideas even though i didn't have them while i was drunk i was stone cold sober but that's my cover story all right so drunk idea number one it's called and you gotta you gotta tell me i think i did this before and by the way one gem came out of it which was my lucky water brand uh that i i do intend to create so you know some gems do come out out of this so ben you're a participant in this one i need you both to give me your your idea your reaction what's what should the scale be on the reaction is it like you know uh you know so on a scale of sober to piss drunk or like on a scale of like you know horrible it's a good idea how do you want to write these let's do one to ten one to ten all right first idea is called very long distance girlfriend okay so i had this idea because i realized like i'm sitting there and me and my wife we like to watch all these dating shows right so we watch all of us blind we watch the bachelor and you watch these shows and this sort of like it's like the honeymoon period and i like i would say most people's homes are like ours it's like the scene is this on screen you see like two usually beautiful people living some kind of fairy tale date um and then like one person's kind of like you know there's some drama one person's being dramatic or one person's unsure and the other person's really good or whatever and then you and then if you if you zoomed out off the tv you'd see a couch with usually a couple sitting like six feet apart from each other because they're so sick of each other uh you know there's like you know in their sweats not dressed up with their you know double chin eating their popcorn and cheetos and being like pointing at the screen and be like ah she's not even that hot or like oh he's you know he's such a jerk and it's like judging these relationships right but like there's something to this of why we like it right we like seeing these other relationships but i also think it's like when we do that we do that with ufc like oh he shouldn't have tapped out yeah dude he's such a [ __ ] he's still weak he looks scared yeah dude he's so scared that's why i don't like him because he's scared it's like yeah he's not confident oh my god there's a spider in my room so so yeah there's definitely like a judgy there's a fun in judging it but i would also say there's a fun in the sort of fairy tale like i think everybody when you're watching these shows you sort of put yourself in the shoes of either the person pursuing or the person being pursued you know you're that you're the damsel or you're the prince whatever it is so the idea behind very long distance girlfriend is as follows it's a service or app i think it's just a service i think it's just a text message this is a phone number you put in your address book and we give you the perfect boyfriend or girlfriend you're never going to meet with this person it's not even the intention it's just somebody who's going to treat you perfectly because they're paid to do it and so so it's like prostitution it's like what's a prostitute a prostitute is somebody who's paid to love to love you right to make love to you but that's a lot not i don't want to cross that line that's a lot of work so this is like you know how tinder made dating easier because you don't have to like go date everybody you just sort of swipe left and right easily on your phone it kind of gave you this like flirting hit but you didn't have to go out put in a lot of effort so here's what you would get if you if you sign up for very long very long distance girlfriend this there's going to be a person that pretends to be your girlfriend they're going to text you they're going to ask how you're doing they're going to be emotionally there for you they're going to text you baby photos of themselves they're going to like you say that they want you you're like oh my god i'm this person wants me they're never going to nag you they're never going to get mad at you they're never going to get jealous they're never gonna do any of the things that real human beings do and that are the downsides of relationships only the upside none of the downside so for girls you're gonna get prince charming on the other side he's gonna be complimentary he's gonna be thoughtful he's gonna be there for you uh and for for guys you're gonna get sort of what you want as the perfect girlfriend and we're just gonna hire call centers of of just dudes and they're gonna behave as your very long distance boyfriend or girlfriend all right give me your give me your ratings i'm gonna start with sam i give that a 10. i i think that uh i i think that's great to be honest i think that surely that like if we went to adultfriendfinder.com or something like that is that what they do what is adult friend finder what is that like like webcam or you're asking the wrong guy i don't follow your questions i have no idea um yeah i mean this is brilliant how many friends do you have who you've only met via texting and you've like i've i've got like a bunch of friends who have only ever texted yeah exactly i have now most of my life is people i only text with maybe i knew them before there's a bunch of people that like i don't know just through twitter or through you know the podcast or through friends of friends we get a group chat together i know their personality they're cool like that's my actual friend even though i never met them so or even heard their voice or talk to them like through voice and in fact i have no desire to really meet them like i don't want to go out of my way to go like say hang out with them i'm getting all the benefits that i want out of just the text yeah so anyway i have a lot of friends like that and i consider them to be really close friends i i i can't tell you how tall they are what their voice sounds like but i love them and so because of that i'm in what do you think ben i give it a one it sounds diabolical it sounds like a wine zero yeah or just one zero honestly a big slow roll for a 10. there's this genre of idea of sean business idea that essentially is i went and watched an episode of black mirror and said actually that's a good idea and this is one of those but that's a great great idea those are good ideas yeah that's like where do you think they're getting their ideas they go to the great idea pile and then they take a great idea and they say okay let's put this to a logical extreme where it actually turns bad like have you remember that remember that tv show in disney called smart home where uh the the the it's like a smart home it's like alexa yeah and the smart home ended up being the mom and the wife so it kind of is like what we're describing now so i think that like yeah i haven't watched her i think her is something like this it's like a voice assistant that he kind of falls in love with i haven't seen that but again it's not even a fall in the love it's just dude it's fun to get certain types of text messages right it's fun to get a funny text from a friend it's fun to get something interesting text it to you that's kind of what the hustle does the hustle just sends me some interesting stuff every morning the milk road tries to do that here's some interesting crypto stuff right we're your friend but i'm not really your friend i'm just sending you some cool stuff you like getting that message but that's for the work part of our life what about the personal side ben are you telling me you would i mean i know what you're going to say you're going to say no but let me just put it out there anyways you're telling me you would not want to be getting texts from a woman who's so into you and it's not cheating you're never going to do anything it's not even a real person you're never going to see him nothing like that especially if you're single right like i'm not talking about like we're all i think we're all married men right so so it's not for us this is for 25 year old me not 30 i don't know how old i am 34 year old me yeah i uh obviously we're not the target demographic all of us because we're all married um but having said that like even if it was just like a as a as a a friend type thing i like i already have actual friends that i don't text back the last thing i need is another thing that's literally just a person to not text back i don't need another one of those in my life but fair enough maybe it's a bad idea but no no as a as a business idea of course it's a good idea of course it's like this has money-making potential as a thing that is good for humans you know that's that's why i gave it one oh i'm not i'm not in the group i just felt like i had to be the conscience here i had that one person had to be like sean you know this is okay okay it's good you know i'm the of the devil you're the angel on the shoulders we have to be there yin and yang that's how it works that's good uh yeah you know if you want good things you should uh you know go eat your vegetables work out you know wake up and pray do all the things right like that's cool don't invest in russian companies yeah don't invest in russian companies don't have the very long distance girlfriend servers for 19.99 a month don't um you know don't use tick-tock don't do any of the things that you do probably all right next idea it sounds related but it's not it's the huge beds company you kind of alluded to this earlier i've been thinking about the luxuries of life that i care about we all we all know what i do private chef personal trainer at my house i live like a king the one thing i don't live like a king with is my bed is only king-sized but a true king would not have a king-sized bed true kings have what's called a emperor-sized bed have you ever heard of these no so athletes have these i saw these because there's a woman who has this business it's already a great business there's a woman who makes beds for nba athletes and so shaq has a 24 foot bed i believe of like 24 foot like in diameter and um you know a whole bunch of ambulance players do this they have 12 foot diameter beds 18 foot things like that the room it's like it looks ridiculous but the whole family can sleep on there and still have their space uh like you know just to get to your spot on the bed you kind of have to crawl there like a small child just to your pillow like because there was such a long runway and so i've always saw these and i thought these look super comfortable and i've decided i want a very huge bed and i realized i wouldn't know where to go buy it so my idea is a ddc brand called huge beds name tbd we need we need a better name no no no keep it it's like it's like it's like uh the company big ass fans yeah it should be big ass beds okay that's the next beds big ass beds for badass people [Laughter] marketing slogan included with my drunk ideas all right so so big ass beds and basically it's just a dc brand that sells you this right like these are very expensive so these these run for like 20 20 000 on average i think is like the cost of these like humongous oversized beds and that's why athletes buy them because they're a the nba players are already very tall plus they got a lot of money so it's like the sweet spot for them and this woman who they buy it from this is one woman and she just sells it all through her instagram basically it's like some player posts a picture of his bed tags the woman people go look at hers she has like an instagram full of huge beds people go buy from her so i think that's just like a niche that somebody could go own big ass beds and i think you know okay athletes is one but we need to find a new niche we may need to go into a new sport or maybe maybe it's business nerds who are trying to optimize their sleep and it's like you know you make up some mono jumbo about this having a big bed is not gonna make you sleep better unless you're like eight feet tall have you tried it well maybe maybe it's like a free-range chicken maybe when you're not confined by this you know like maybe you have anxiety all night because you might fall off the bed right maybe just being able to stretch out is nice right maybe maybe not being so cramped is nice i don't know seems like there's some benefits there definitely maybe is but definitely probably isn't i mean haven't you been in a cal haven't you been in a california uh king-size bed before i have a california king-sized bed yeah you have a challenge you have a california king a california king is like the same size as a king it's just longer instead of wider it's the same overall size it's just longer so it's not the same overall size but yeah i don't know it's the same size but it's like less wide more long are the other ones more wide less long you have a californian times with baby that's a huge bed if you ask me that i think that's big is that not is it just you and your wife in the bed or do your kids stay there sometimes my kids stay there and my dog so it's like you know we got a full house in the bed i think that likely there's another thing that should be addressed than making it bigger yeah like don't let i would call it i would create it how about we call it uh i thought we'd create a little kid bed company or a dog bed yeah or we'll call it a crib or we can make like a dog bed business also a good idea i think maybe those are the solutions to your problem instead of making a 20 by 20 a 400 square foot bed ben what do you got here it seems like you might be on my side sam is so wrong on this but i i have a king size bed it is a good size uh i don't what is good good enough for you no i don't want to be anywhere near my wife when i sleep i want to have to shout for here to hear me like there's always like just some little toe poking me in the middle of the night and if you could just offer me i never have to worry about that a b you're right sam is it gonna actually give me better sleep probably not is it gonna be an amazing experience to just like crawl onto this massive piece of luxury that is 20 feet long yes it sounds like an amazing experience and i want it i want to feel that and you can see a third of your day on this bed right you're spending eight hours on this bed why not just the second that you said like a 20-foot wide bed i just knew i wanted it my heart knows that i wanted to see the pictures when you see the picture you're like this looks like lavish as [ __ ] all right so uh do you guys one question do you guys sleep with a pillow in between your legs of course i sleep with the maternity pillow same so i have a body i have a body pillow and so i like basically spoon the pillow because i need my my knees to be i i can't have that's just straight ergonomics that's just like that's proven that's not even like us being weird that's us being scientists so the reason i use my wife's pregnancy pillow is science do you really you use her what is she i bought two so i so i bought hers i bought her one because my buddy my buddy told me this my buddy goes congrats you guys are pregnant fantastic so happy for you hey get your phone out and go to this website you're gonna buy this swedish pillow it's 200 but trust me best pillow ever and i was like oh my god like never been so intrigued by a sales pitch took out my phone ordered it right there i'll never forget where i was i was in an uber in las vegas when this happened and i thought all right and it's like it says like five weeks to ship i was like oh my god this must be fantastic if it's like such a shitty experience and so uh it arrives it's amazing my wife uses it she's like it's good i was like only good he really built it up let me try it out i try it for a nap so good i ordered myself one and now she never just uses she never uses any of them i use both of them actually and i it's fantastic what's it called uh i'll have to look it up it's uh it's like some swedish name that i don't really know yeah i'm a big fan of those i'll i'll buy one i just had like a really long pillow that i just kind of spoon but maybe i should buy one of these it is called oh here it is bbhugme.com so the two letters bb then hugme.com bb hug me uh and it's designed in scandinavia so that's not swedish scandinavian and uh just look at it it just looks like it's gonna be good and then it is good it's really it's really great really great pillow all right i'm gonna buy one of these wow this looks huge yeah it's not that big but it's like kind of like it's like got like beads inside or whatever so it sort of like forms to your body it's great all right i'm on board with this i bet these guys crush it by the way yeah i can imagine the things really i think it's pretty expensive it's like 200 for one pillow which is a great site a lot um all right so here's my next drunk idea i got two more for you hoa court okay so do you guys have an hoa where you live no i'm no you one time if i remember correctly sean you had an hoa just for a duplex didn't you yeah yeah me and me and our other person we had a hoa with an hoa fee but we both as soon as we bought the place we were like yo we're not gonna put 400 into this every every day right like and we both just agree we're not putting 400 a month into that do you have an hoa ben yeah and i kind of hate it so my hoa has been harassing me lately i've been getting letters so i rent i rent my current place and uh we live in this neighborhood and there's some karen in this neighborhood that just hates me and she's like oh i don't like that you you know leave the trash bins out a little you know an extra day i don't like that you work out on the like street in the driveway like you no exercise no exercise equipment is allowed i'm like what is that are you exaggerating really no no there's three complaints there's that there's that and then there's another one which is um we get like water delivered like you know like kind of like a water dispenser so you get these jugs five gallon jugs and so they're like kind of like they're like the guy delivers it to our door but he tucks it behind this pillar so if you're looking at our house you can't even see it you'd have to like walk up to our like walk halfway up our thing to go see the thing and so somebody just keeps complaining to and our landlord's like dude what's going on is it look he lives in another state so he's like what is this like can you just are you like [ __ ] up things i'm like no i don't do anything wrong okay the trash i do leave out a little bit um but you know besides that it's not a big deal like when you're working out the street is it like just you and your trainer and what are you doing is throwing a medicine ball or something no we're doing lunges it's like dude i can lunge in the street there's nothing or like we have a battle rope that we'll put on a you know but that's my driveway dude i can do what i want in my driveway um and so in my neighborhood's like mostly really old people that like don't really do it do much so you know i get it but i'm not disruptive anyway so so this hoa thing and so i first was like i was like okay i have two choices i can either just quietly resolve the issues just listen just move the trash cans in put the battle rope inside the garage only move it out when i want and uh water jugs like i guess i could pull them inside the door uh it kind of takes up space but you know no harm done no you cannot do those though nothing no no no number one it's not happening right right this is war and so i went to war so i was like you know what i'm gonna waste my time and energy fighting this hoa who is this hoa after all i demanded names i demanded to speak to somebody i said they can call me direct next time they have a problem i said here's my number i put it out there i started to um i said i started to go take photos of other houses i said i'd like to file some complaints myself oh what is this children's swing in the front yard this person has violation why is this person's garbage cans outside violation why is this person riding their bicycle exercise equipment on the street violation and so i started fighting back i started saying is it because i'm the only brown guy in the neighborhood just i was i was waiting for the race that you had to do that you had i can only wonder what's so different because again i see violations all around me now and so i'm i am basic but there's no my my complaints are falling on deaf ears and i'm wasting a bunch of time i need hoa court it's a judge judy likes show streamed onto netflix and or youtube where i can go present my case and it's a place for petty people to do their thing and that's that's my pitch this is actually a show it's a tv show hoa court or petty court pity yeah maybe petty court maybe penny is the right way to do it i think that's beautiful but isn't this do hoa people not have uh what's that called where um before you go to court you can hire a um arbitration arbitra uh an arb yeah arbitration mediation yeah uh is there what do you do with hoa how do you know who wins you can't win that's the problem hoa is this like you know ambiguous force that just controls you even though you you you know you pay your hard-earned american money to uh to live in this place to buy this land to live free but the freedom's not there and that's why we need petty court to bring back our freedoms and to put put these petty people back in their place do you do you um like do you just like reply all to an email well no it's like they they use these agents like cowards there's like a there's like a random hoa email address with like one person behind it's like no who's complained is the majority of the neighborhood complaining maybe it's a democracy maybe we need 51 complaints for me to change the way i do things why does one person get to change my way of living right that said it sounds a little crazy to me so i just feel like there's no justice and then when there's no justice i can't sleep and that's what i i i want to dig deeper on this because i actually think that it's totally not worth your time to fight this this is this is a fight this fight always certainly not worth my time no it is definitely these fights are worth our this is what living is for i love doing this stuff i love fighting with neighbors and like trying to win and like rub their face in it like a dog who pees inside i love this and so is there a way i don't believe that's considered the best practice anymore by the way for dogs for dog training i don't deal with h.o.a i don't want peta coming after us is there is there a way that you can set a trap and figure out who it is um i don't know how i would do that um oh i know i put a unique letter under the doorstep of everybody in the neighborhood i say listen i heard about the complaint and i understand in fact i'm sorry that i did what i did um you know i would just love to make it up to you what's your favorite flavor chocolate or vanilla i'll send you a treat because you were right and i was wrong and i just need you to know that you were so right with your hoa complaint um so just shoot me your hey just text me your favorite flavor honey pot gotcha that's actually pretty brilliant and you can do one of two things you could either say this person's a flavor this person it's a what size t-shirt you are or you could just get a bunch of different google numbers and see which ones no no even better google i say hey have you guys seen this [ __ ] who lives over here guy keeps putting his fr he keeps doing lunges in the street am i right like violence in our neighborhood i think we should escalate this he's not listening uh i believe it was you who made the complaint but maybe i have that wrong if it was you i'd like to discuss steps of how we might escalate this issue to make sure that jerk goes down if you bring them in bring them close before i put them put them away i i i would love for you to do this how many people live in the neighborhood you think uh how many people are part of an hoa no it's a neighborhood it's everybody's defaulted in there's probably i don't know like 100 maybe 60 houses 100 houses or something like that it's a lot of time and energy you may have to like shut down one of my businesses just to do this you don't think you know who's doing this i have no idea really it hurts me because i know there's somebody who walks by smiling at me while i'm working out in my garage i just work out my garage with the with the door open just have some air right like it's no big deal i'm allowed to do that in my home gym you can't change your behavior you have to continue doing it well i've already bent but uh you know i've brought the water bottles inside and i moved the trash cans but you should buy lawn chairs and put them in your front lawn and just hang out there without a shirt consistently i think that's what the move has to be that's a gift to the neighborhood all right um last idea last idea all right the nba all-star game just happened and um and every sport has this and baseball has the home run derby uh football has the pro bowl nba has the dunk contest and the all-star game why doesn't this exist for business is that a thought that's ever crossed your mind why don't we have the tech all-star game why don't we have the business the business all-stars i feel like there's there's an opportunity here to bring together the who's who well i'm just going to use tech for now so bring together the who's 2 of tech just the all-stars honor them get them to compete for our entertainment and uh just make a weekend out of it right why aren't we why are we treating this like the sport that it is so here's here's how this might work tech all-star game is basically a hackathon and i get zuck and i can get larry page and sergei sergey and i go get founders of different mega companies and they're going to perform it's going to be live streamed onto youtube and they're going to have to build something they get 24 hours to build something so you have an all-star designer you got johnny ive working with mark zuckerberg all of a sudden you got brian chesky working with you know uh whoever you know sundar or whatever you get you pair these guys up into random combinations and they're gonna have to do a hackathon they're gonna have to build something and demo it and somebody wins the trophy for building something cool because you've seen that like darmesh loves to hack and build little projects i remember when covet happened kevin systrom the guy from instagram he built this dashboard that was measuring the viral coefficient the spread because he's like hey these politicians are just like making statements and we have no source of truth no dashboard that tells us how this thing's spreading and how it's not per city and that's what we need to look at and so he built this dashboard there and i just thought huh i wonder what would happen if you unleashed these types of brains the all-stars in a in a little competition of their own a little hackathon of their own what do you think of this idea i think if you can if it's if the if the idea is like an award thing then i think that's the worst idea you've ever had i think that's a horrible idea if you think if it's like a hackathon no one will ever do that but i think it's an interesting exercise and that and here's my question to you if you took let's say mark zuckerberg jeff bezos um the google guys and the ceo and you had them do a hackathon do you think any of them are actually still capable of making anything like making it but you it would be them on their own so you'd pair them with like every team is they also an all-star engineer so all-star technology person an all-star designer and an all-star ceo product visionary no that's [ __ ] if you want one-on-one if it's just that like for example bezos can't probably build anything he might you know he's gonna go build like a blog well like if it was if it was like you and me it's like you guys like you gotta go make like a business in the next like week i'm i'm very confident that just me on my own i could build something that makes money do you think that uh one of the google guys sergey and larry page do you think that they're capable of actually making anything maybe like i know zuck can so zuck when when snapchat came out i remember that uh he recognized the threat that was snapchat so early on and created facebook pokey literally wrote code into the facebook poke like their their competitor that they i think they released it in nine days or like 19 days or something ridiculous and he was one of the lead engineers actually writing code in the project now he doesn't normally do that but that was like the story at least do you think i think he could i think very few others could i remember so mike michael burch who who built bibo he was a programmer right he's a programmers programmer he built four or five startups that were all interesting and successful and we did a hack week and i invited michael i was like michael come hang out don't just be mr investor you know far away like come hang with us live in our like we're staying in your cabin so like just come hang with us and he came and i was like you wanna you wanna build something we're all building this little like you know apps and uh he's like well um don't exactly know javascript like the languages i know aren't really used anymore and i don't really remember a lot of it and i haven't coded in years my machine is not even set up to do it so uh you know i don't even know what i could build at this point and so he cooked us dinner instead and then later he got back into programming he's like oh yeah like okay now i got my machine set up i'm you know i'm using python i'm learning the new languages instead of the old stuff but he like ramped up over time and now he loves to code he codes all the time but i think when i put him on the spot when he hasn't been doing it no he was it was tough for him to just like go build something even though he was an engineer let me tell you something real quick this this isn't that shocking because i didn't exactly own a tech company but i made a i owned a company that made tens of millions of dollars on the internet when you use words like python and javascript or whatever you said i have literally no idea what those are like for real i don't know how progressive try to guess what what is python well it's like a language but i don't know like i don't know what you use it for i don't know what it does when people talk about like ruby on rails i'm like so there's like a java on rails like how like is there like i i literally don't know what the words are these rails you speak of yeah yeah or they'll be like well this is css and this is html and this is i'm like i don't know like is one of those like the outdoor sighting of the home and like like i do like an analogy does it i still to this day i have no idea what they mean this is like when i told you i you know i go into home improvement they're like okay so is it a dry wall or and i'm like it's not wet like wait wait what do you mean can you give me four or five types of walls with some photos and i can tell you which one it looks the most like okay can we do like a prison lineup here and i'll point to the wall that looks most like my wall like when people talk about this stuff so the way that we worked at my company was i would sit with the engineer and i would just draw i'm like the website it probably should look something like this and i'll write the words that i should say and once you click this button let me draw the second thing that you should see and i would give them i would give it to them and it would work somehow and i and i to this day i have no idea how any of those things work yeah and who who needs to i used to i used to be like oh i wish i knew how to code i'd be so much better if i knew how to code and i would love to learn how to code i'm still actually i'm still like kind of at night i'm taking this like you know udemy course on python or something like that and then our buddy suli was like he's like yeah people say that and he's like i used to know the code he's like uh he's like dumbest thing ever who cares how to code he's like you could pay somebody here here's a guy in india he can code whatever you want you just tell him he'll do it he's like knowing why i actually totally disagree with him i think that the key is at least you knew how to do it so then um and if you don't want to do it anymore that's fine but i actually think that when there's been times where i've talked to my developer and in my head i'm like well you just got to click this button and you see this and they're like well you don't even have to click the button you know like this technology the way it works is you can i'm like that works that's a possibility like i don't even know i wish i knew how to code so i knew what frameworks i could like work within because when as someone who doesn't know how to code i'm like how do you how did you i didn't know that's possible like you know what i mean it's like asking someone in 1800 to like explain to them how text messages work it's like whoa whoa whoa what the hell is a phone let alone you know what i mean and that's how i feel sometimes when we're talking about coding so i think that's true i actually agree and disagree with what he said so i agree in the sense that i used to think i used to have this story in my head that if i if i knew that then i'd be able to be do so much more and i don't believe that that's true i think that anything i wanted to do i could do by just you know hiring one of many many programmers out there or using a no code tool it is actually not holding me back and i can get the same result whether i do it or not the part i disagree with is i think it's really awesome to be able to have an idea in your head and be able to make it happen yourself because there's a huge lossiness in trying to explain to something else explain something that's in your head that's kind of fuzzy to somebody else having them download your fuzzy picture then they output it in an even fuzzier way it's like a telephone and it comes out very different a lot of times like when i write something or like if somebody says all right uh can you help me write this email i'm like yeah but you've got to give me the keyboard and they're like well i'll like i'll type it and i'm like no you don't understand like i don't just think of the email i write the email and while i'm writing it i think of what to say like i i can't create content in my head i create it while i'm doing it and i think most great things that get created are like that you're building it and while you're building it you're sort of like figuring out what you want to build and like playing with the idea live and that's what gets separated when you're not the builder yourself and so i i am jealous that i don't get to do that when it comes to building apps and let me ask you one more question so let's just say that we took um some of the big folks i i actually i won't use elon because he's proven it but like you take the guy who started snapchat ev evan i think uh yeah zuck the google folks bezos maybe not bezos because he's also proven it but you take them and you strip away like what they've done and they're the same age but you know they've just been like an insurance agent their whole life um do you think in one scenario do you think that they could still accomplish something great and then on the other side let's just say that they decided at the same time when they were young 19 and starting facebook let's just say that like you know instead of facebook i'm gonna focus on like music or or this like music app like still tech but just like a slightly different version do you think that they would be even remotely as big and successful as they as they are so the second question i think is much easier to answer which is i think all of those people would be very successful by any like kind of objective measure but would they be people that we know their name we talk about them and they're you know hundred billionaire you know status no you know i do not think that's true i think luck plays a part in the magnitude of the success but not the probability of success so i think all of them the probability of success for them is all 90 plus percent they would all be good at what they do positive impact you know make millions of dollars over their career and be like considered top of their field in whatever field they go to the magnitude of success the fact that they end you know basis ends up being worth hundreds of billions of dollars that i think is um much more luck of the bounce on which opportunity you took versus others um so yeah so that that's kind of my answer to the segment what would you say i agree i think that so for example there's this guy named david carp you know who david carp is he's the tumbler guy right he invented tumblr and tumblr basically sold to yahoo i think for a billion was it was it a billion it sold for a lot of money but he's totally then they shut it down tumblr's totally non-existent anymore and he uh he doesn't i don't even know what he does he just he's not relevant and i think that a guy like him who i've seen talk and i've heard and i've read his writing he's pretty brilliant and i'm like man if tumblr had not sold or if you were working on something else i think you could have been way better another one is the guy who created meetup um scott i think his name is he is amazing too but meetup is not that big of a that wasn't that big it wasn't that interesting i think if that guy would have worked on something else it actually would have he would have been significantly more successful and and some of these guys it's kind of like they're lance armstrong and they're riding the two to france in a mountain bike or with a flat tire it's like man you that was needlessly hard if you could have been way better if if you if you just picked a different thing level 10 hustle level 10 skill level 6 opportunity right meet up to me is like a level 6 opportunity it was just like a really hard space to go into he did the best of anybody who went into that space we all know the name because of that reason but meetup just wasn't as big as not meeting your friends in real life and only talking to them online through facebook right like facebook was just a far larger opportunity and i don't think it was that zuck knew that so i don't think it's that they're so kind of like um big brain that they just they filter out bad ideas like best idea i think you know like there's a lot of text messages that get leaked from zuck early on and he was he thought wirehog was gonna be the the real thing he was like you know still debating i don't know if i should do facebook when facebook was like already a thing and working and he's like he's like i think you know this is this stuff that we're doing right now is going to really help us when we do wirehog which is like a file transfer protocol that he just thought might be bigger and you know obviously at some point he recognized no this is the opportunity let me do this but like it's not like up front he just said i analyzed 100 opportunities and i've identified the one that's going to be this app that has like billions of users i don't believe that that's true at all i think you sort of look into the size of the opportunity and the era that you were born you know these guys if they were born before the tech wave they might have just been the best blacksmith in town and not had like any of the tools that let you become 100 billionaire because there was no leverage available to you you know 100 years ago or whatever yeah i uh by the way michael chandler and justin gaichy they uh they fought like a three months ago these are two ufc guys and they're both known for kind of being like big meat heads who just stand in the middle and bang and hit each other really hard and they don't there's they're just kind of crazy and justin gaichi at the end said something amazing he goes i love that he had just suffered this like three round war where they were banging each other in the head as hard as i can and you feel sad because you're like this guy is gonna brain damage and at the end he goes what just happened i love it he goes i feel like i was born in the wrong era i should have been a roman gladiator because i would have loved to fight to the death in front of all you people and i and i heard that it gave me chills i was like i believe you i your you and i are not the same you're you're crazy like you are built to be a warrior and sometimes i think about that i'm like who today like or i i think like who was like like alexander the great if we put him in like today's era like would he just be like too brutish and we'd be like dude you're an idiot bounce like get out of here you dumb idiot or like if napoleon came into play nowadays like it's kind of like a dating app yeah like what would like what would like the gladiators of them be working on now like were they just like well let's ask our historian ben you study these guys what do you think if you transplanted alexander the greater napoleon into this era or edison would he be like what are you a dating app really that's so stupid or would you think that that's the coolest thing ever and he goes i wish i could have done this i doubt edison would be into dating apps but i like i was on my alexander the great episode one of the points i made is i was just reading this book about alexander the great and it talked about a contract that he negotiated with one of his contractors one of his suppliers to move their baggage train from one area to another and i was just like oh this is like not that different like he had contracts that he had to negotiate and he had suppliers who provided his weapons and like logistics and he just contracted them out and he had people in charge of the contracts and like had basically kind of the same organization that ceos have so i think like yeah so alexander the great i think he'd be a his personality he'd probably be like a ceo uh edison would be like a entrepreneur kind of technical but moves out of it like a zuck like yeah yeah that's interesting i i think about that all the time uh about like what like the the you know people who dominated from hundreds of years ago what would they be like today and vice versa i'm like dude if if zuck didn't learn how to use a computer like would that guy have just been a dork like in the 1800s like what could he even have survived the plague like you know what i mean and so i think about that all the time um cool guys i gotta run all right end of episode [Music] you

this guy this ukrainian guy their their leader this guy is badass have you seen like him just wearing like green t-shirts giving press conferences yeah he he's amazing this guy's amazing this guy is uh i don't know much about him i don't know what's going on i don't know what's like kind of media portrayal versus whatever else but the guy does come across like a goddamn hero [Music] all right let me tell you a quick story i don't know if you're going to like this topic so i want to get it out of the way if you like it we could spend the whole time on it but i'm not sure if if you're going to be into this so yeah yeah so it's about the most popular thing going on right now the ukraine russian conflict it's not exactly about ukraine but it's about russia so something that i've always been interested in is the russian oligarchs so have you ever studied those folks not studied but you know okay tell me about it okay so this starts i'm reading a thing so you're going to see me look off this starts on november 3rd 1995 in a remote siberian town called sergot basically what happened in this small cabin an auction took place for the right to lend the cash-strapped russian government tens of millions of dollars so basically in 95 the russian government wasn't doing so hot and they needed money and so they got these banks uh to come to this meeting and they said we need some money we need to borrow some money and also as collateral we're going to put up shares of some of the large state-owned companies because at this point russia was basically going from uh being a communist nation to being a private country and so they still had some like state-owned oil companies mineral companies basically like if you think of exxon mobil they like the government like owned that and at this point they were trying to figure out how do we make this so private individuals can do this and so at this meeting uh basically only two bidders showed up and if more bidders wanted to come it was kind of a pain and they asked because conveniently there were no more flights the airport shut down and you couldn't even book a flight to come uh into into this small town by the way your cameras okay you're there um and so basically what happened at this like small cabin is one company made a bid to buy a or to loan money to the government they loaned it they loaned something like 500 million dollars and that was like a hundred thousand dollars above the opening bid so people were bidding to loan money and so this this bank loaned money to the government and then the government had to pay back the loan at a certain point like something like a year later and if they didn't the bank then was given the the collateral so the shares in this company to auction off and they could keep 30 of the prop profits so obviously the government didn't pay back the money and there's like a lot of like wondering why they didn't pay up payback basically the idea is that the current president was like obviously this is all like we're all planning this so we don't pay this back and give us a little bit whatever so they don't hate that you're saying it's collusion basically there was a a handshake wink-wink agreement basically of what's gonna happen here yes and so the government doesn't uh pay back the loans and so now this bank is basically now has uh a minority ownership and like 12 large state-owned corporations and they basically holler at eight to ten guys guys who are already relatively successful and they basically said do you uh you wanna make a bid on this company i'm gonna make sure no one else bids on this company but i'll give it to you you interested and that's exactly what happened and why would they do that why would they hook up these individuals in that way they did it for three different reasons the first reason and a lot of this is just like hearsay the first reason is the person who was president at the time who was it ben what was his name it was the fat guy who yelled at boris yeltsin yes he was basically said to these eight or ten businessmen i'm gonna hook you up you guys hook me up when i'm when i'm when i'm in office hook it up i'm gonna hook you up whatever so that's one theory the second theory is that they wanted experienced managers in in to run these companies and the third theory basically is even though these eight to ten oligarchs put bids on these companies and basically they bought the equivalent of exxon mobil so we're talking about like a company that's worth billions of dollars they paid a hundred million dollars for this company and so these managers these oligarchs these eight to ten folks a lot of them were mildly successful but they were all in on the government they were all friends and friends you know they're all homies they basically they did take on risk so like these companies did have debt and like they had to go and like collude with other people and fire the rest of the managers at the company so it was basically got almost like a pe thing but it was like pretty dirty all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are and the government was like yeah we need we want like these mercenaries to be in power because if they make these companies better our you know our government's gonna be better the russia's gonna be better and so they basically profits after after this whole deal profits to these companies grow by 50x market caps go up by 100x and so there's here's an example the reason i got interested in this is there's this guy named robin uh abraham what's his name uh ben how do you say his last name i think it's abramovich we're gonna call him roman so roman even knows what the hell you're talking about right now is impressive and he's like he's like a part of your brain that's like outside of your body and you're like uh brain what's that name oh yeah roman's famous roman owns um we're gonna call broman he owns chelsea the soccer team so he's like a famous guy and he owns like this like you know 200 foot yacht he's like a big deal and basically he paid a hundred million dollars him and his partner boris paid a hundred million dollars and they've just they came up a little bit of money and then they went and hollered at like other rich people and they said hey loan us some money let's buy this company they paid a hundred million dollars for a company that is now like the eighth or tenth largest oil company in the world so imagine paying in the mid 90s imagine paying a hundred million dollars for exxon mobil right insane and so the these companies explode now they explode partially because basically what these owners did these eight to ten oligarchs what they did was they purposely tanked the company so it sucked for a long time and then they bought out the rest of the minority shareholders so it's again cronyism there and second these were government-run companies so they're [ __ ] and so these private individuals they did a pretty good job of making them better and they became far more profitable and this created like eight to ten guys that were worth like up to 40 billion dollars so at one point one of them was worth 83 billion dollars and you know things have changed but it created so much wealth between these few folks and it also like trickled down so here's the craziest part is that a bunch of the managers of the company so basically there was like the pre there was like the the minister of oil or something like that as a government official he becomes he sets up this these one of these companies he eventually becomes president of one of the companies and now is worth 8 billion dollars even though he was like a a government official so i thought it was interesting because i actually wanted to read a book about these folks because i'm like oh who's this like rich guy that owns chelsea football let me like go and learn from him and what i realized is like i pretty much can't learn from him i mean i could maybe learn some stuff but like his process is not like replicable i can't replicate it because he was like 38 and russia had just fallen and he basically turned zero dollars into he's worth now like 20 billion dollars all through this cronyism but i thought it was incredibly interested have you not heard about these folks i've never heard any of that in my life um it's crazy it's like it's like the big bang for like russian rich oligarchs it's like there was this one meeting and it kicked off this series of events that like you know seems kind of unfathomable how that would be allowed to happen or just happen um but then they also consolidated power right like didn't putin basically like take all their money and consolidation so here's their power here's the second interesting part of the story and i actually learned this from listening to ben's podcast so basically putin was considered like the anti-corrupt guy for for a minute like when he was elected he was like you know i'm not going to stand for that nonsense and he made an example of one of the guys one of the billionaires his last name starts with the k i'm not going to try to pronounce it it's a challenge he um put this guy in jail for 14 years and he literally put them and so in russia for some reason they put you in these like cages and you could like take pictures of these folks have you ever seen that like a like a russian serial killer picture or anything like so it's like visible from the outside you mean yeah it's like the mug shot but it's like literally a cage that sits on you and people can come and like take pictures it's weird and anyway this guy was worth at the time like 15 billion dollars and putin arrested him for not paying taxes things like that and put him in jail for 14 years and he goes to the other guys he goes you want that to happen to you no all right let's play and so a lot of people think that putin is the richest man in the world and he owns one of the most expensive homes in russia and in the world it's like a billion dollar two billion dollar house and people are like oh how'd you do that it was a lot of people dollar house yeah ben was telling me all right it's a billion dollar house wow i didn't even realize that it's uh it's it's got like it's got script yeah it is like the account complex it's got private beaches it's got like pools on pools it's got guest houses basically got a hotel on it it's like a house is maybe not the right way to think of it but it is a house it's a private residence for putin and but basically like there's no proof of this but a lot of people because even when the panama papers released they couldn't find putin's accounts but basically uh a lot of people are like well so he made an example out of this one guy uh and he went to the rest and goes you all want to play let's play and and and now roman by the way really hoping you'd attempt a putin accent there kind of disappointed not gonna lie the story is good but it's just missing that little something i think that you are giving it a shot ben i think you have a little a little bit of the russian twins and you're speaking yes they say me i they tell me i speak good in russian accent i will try is this like racist can i do this is this okay i don't know it's borderline i don't think it's a race this we have the the cancellation vaccination you're allowed to do a uh a funny funny accent here and people as long as it's russian if you're listening you took that too seriously just swipe over and delete the podcast and go on with your life and to wrap this up basically the way that these guys all work now is uh a lot of these oligarchs are part of like the peace keeping like they're they're part of they're helping putin like negotiate peace so like the inner the way that this shit's intertwined is just bananas it's crazy and i was like trying to learn about these folks and i was like oh well like there's nothing to learn here i can't i can't do this like this is just crazy and these guys are so wealthy and and so it's trickled down but if you basically a lot of them when that happened were in their 30s like 35 uh 38 years old and that's why i got interested in this because i was i remember years ago reading about these folks i'm like how does a 38 year old become worth 3 billion what the hell how did a 38 year old become ceo of a diamond mining company and it was a stupid question what does the word oligarch actually mean uh i think it just means when there's a small group of people that are in power um but basically it's sort of like a cartel basically yeah not well it's like what do you say ben it's just like the typically the way that it is classically defined is over here you have a monarchy which is ruled by a single man over here you have democracy which is ruled by everyone oligarchy sits in the middle of like rule by a few handful right yeah but when we talk about russian oligarchies a lot of times people will say that just means like russian rich people uh russian wealthy rich people the way that i'm using it is that there's literally like nine guys who were given like these 12 companies and now amongst those nine guys there was like dozens more where like roman was like hey i need a homie i need a cousin to come and run this thing hook it up and so there's like it's trickled down beyond that and so now there's hundreds of them quick interruption do me a favor scroll down and you're going to see a link to the hustle so if you want to stay up to date on the tech and business news you need to know check out the hustle it's a daily email i used to help write it i love it so check it out scroll down below i'm on a business insider uh news story about putin's wealth right now just because i wanted to see the billion dollar house so the house 1.35 billion it's a crazy palace with three helicopter landing pad landing pads and stuff like that but the thumbnail was putin doing basically like a bowflex so he's he's like you know he's basically saying he's got both uh cables and he's like clearly about to do like a peck fly and that was the thumbnail they chose not one of his palace or his cars or anything like that that joe's putin wearing three thousand two no wearing uh cashmere sweats that cost fourteen hundred dollars and then a matching top which just looks like a hanes t-shirt uh for his workout outfit total which was 3 200 and then it's just like every picture is hilarious it's like him choosing with a champagne it's like only power photos which is really funny and keep in mind this is a guy who before this he was in the kgb so it's like the cia of america so this is a government salary person for the last 30 years so this is crazy yeah ben how did you feel so you did the how to take with the world episodes about putin and uh and i called you up about this i was like ben re-release the episodes a lot of people are curious about putin right now release the like just re-upload them as new episodes but you kind of research this guy a lot what i mean can we talk about this like russia ukraine thing for a second so like what's y'all's reaction to this and i guess like you know the disclaimers is we're not experts we're just friends talking about like yo do you hear what's going on what do you think about this uh so ben what did you think cause you've spent a lot of time reading about this guy yeah my reaction um is probably different from most people's um i think most people who listen to my podcast view it as like an anti-putin podcast like think it's pretty hard on him and i think in some ways it is it calls him out for some of the bad things he's done including murdering people and uh like maybe doing a false flag domestic terror attack on uh the russian people so like it's not a pro putin podcast having said that i think a lot of people's reaction has just been like putin is hitler he's gonna keep marching through countries until we stop him like all he wants is right more power more territory he's a megalomaniac who's doing this just because he's tripping and um i think that what they're missing a lot of the psychology of putin of um of this is someone who was as sam said a part of the kgb right so he's a part of the soviet empire when it's a big empire he watches it fall from grace and then he watches his country get looted in the in the mid to late 90s and kind of says to himself all right well america was supposed to come in and make the situation better i'm never trusting these guys again right and so then he's watching ukraine get pulled closer and closer into um the european union and nato orbit and american orbit and they're basically saying okay yeah they're aligning with us but that's their prerogative and don't worry about it this is not we're not gonna like invade russia or anything and he's basically saying no like that's his red line i will never trust you guys again and that doesn't make what he's doing right but i think it is important to understand where he's coming from so the motivation so that we can make the right decisions and what do you mean by america america was supposed to come in and fix what what do you mean by that exactly so you're saying post-world war or something no so it was essentially um as the soviet union is coming down uh i can't remember the name of it but there was some uh essentially like committee um with a bunch of harvard guys who come into moscow and are like hey we're the experts this is how you do capitalism essentially and initially there's like some optimism right of okay well america seems pretty great the soviet union has not been great and so we're excited about this capitalism stuff and it turns out it goes just they just wear the sweatshirts never went to harvard got him that's right they were they were pulling the bend they were wearing the georgetown lost sweatshirt but they didn't go to georgetown they uh and uh so things um the the russian economy really crashed during the 90s and so that's that's what i'm talking about gotcha okay so he's like i've you know fooled me once [ __ ] you know shame shame on whoever the [ __ ] okay so that was your reaction to this as you were sort of thinking about that sam what was your reaction as you kind of saw this all play out my reaction let's talk about this from i mean first of all i was like you know screw putin not a fan but let's talk about from a business or like a management perspective when i saw when i've seen all this go through or happen i've been watching a lot of videos on reddit and admittedly like that's a usa that's an american website so i'm trying to figure out like what the truth is i'm seeing these i'm seeing two things one i'm seeing videos of like pows uh russian pows and there's like i didn't want to be here they go we don't want to be here we were tricked we don't we thought we were going to practice we didn't know what was going on and they also say we thought you guys were going to open us welcome us with open arms we thought you were going to love us what are you what are you doing like why are you being angry at us and so um i see and they also show the tanks and the tanks are [ __ ] they're like from the 80s and 90s they're bad like and their weapons suck and so i'm seeing a i like they're they just and like and they were a little chubby and like people don't have like nice haircuts like they do in the middle like in america like they just like undisciplined like it just doesn't seem like it's like a well-oiled machine that's what i'm seeing in second these are the most random observations about this whole thing it's like reddit videos of guys being like i thought this was a practice war that's what they were like these chubby faces in 1980s tanks like what i mean look like when you see that you're like oh this you're like like i was afraid of you but like maybe i shouldn't be like you're out of shape um and the second thing is this guy this ukrainian guy their their leader this guy is badass have you seen like him just wearing like green t-shirts giving press conferences yeah he he's amazing this guy's amazing this guy's uh i don't know much about him i don't know what's going on i don't know what's like kind of media portrayal versus whatever else but the guy does come across like a goddamn hero when you think of the word a hero what do you think of it's like you know the president who says you know not i'm not just ordering you to war i'm going to the front lines and by the way this guy's the finance minister he's here this guy's you know this is my press secretary he here hold this gun you don't know how to do it you have it backwards doesn't matter stand here and like basically sending out a video being like you know hey putin you know go [ __ ] yourself or like bring it on basically like the only thing cooler he could have done is if he was like putin meet me at the border you and me unarmed hand-to-hand combat you win you get my country i win i get your country that's the only one level up this guy could have done as far as being you know the real life macho man randy savage which is kind of the way he was coming across as a when he's like a real hero like very brave incredibly and what i'm learning what i'm trying to you know when i watch the news i try to be on like this is bad and i want to help uh the the thought is like how can i use this to improve and my takeaway here is what putin has done they they say like he's like uh they showed him with uh giving a press conference and he was on this huge table and his generals were like literally 20 feet down on this table and he was kind of by himself and that was kind of a represent representation of him him being a little distant and whereas this guy was like literally on the streets toasting coffee in the morning and my takeaway is in order to get someone to do something you have to make them want to do it you can't force them to do it because if you force them to do it it's good it's a short-lived short-term thing right and with the ukrainians there was a poll where 90 of them support this guy and they are all in the streets they're all like pouring styrofoam into bottles with gasoline because that's how you make napalm and they're using it for molotov cocktails and they like it sounds weird but it seems like they're happy in the sense of like they have a sense of purpose and they have a community and they have a mission and maybe not happy is the right word but like uh purpose driven and that's the takeaway that i have from this is if i'm gonna convince people to do stuff like running work at a company or whatever you need to make them want to do it not force them to do it yeah that's uh that's a great point they definitely have like sort of the the spirit right now um and the morale in the rally it's sort of like a rally going on right now and you know especially under these circumstances you know definitely like adversity is something that pulls people together so you know it's definitely done that for them or it'll break you apart depending on what your sense of purpose is and so this guy's killing it man yeah this guy's it's been real it's been a it's a it's a really good i don't think we've had that in america for a while it's been it's a really good example of wonderful leadership this guy is killing it and he also uses really cute phrases like he says something like uh at least sound bites he's like i don't need he was he goes america offered me a lift to get out of here i don't need a lift i need armor-piercing bullets oh my god dude you are rambo you are wonderful he's saying all the great stuff and that shit's important and there's a reason why like have you ever heard about um where they describe all the roman emperors as uh orders you know people who could speak well like now i understand why yeah totally there dude i've been uh so i don't normally read the news or watch the news at all uh i like never never turn it on don't read the newspaper don't go to cnn i don't do any of it and uh and people sometimes like i don't know make fun of me or sort of tell me i'm an idiot for that uh just yesterday some guy was like you know terrible life choice you know you gotta you gotta be in tune with the world's realities and i just think you don't in my head i'm like if you think the news is the world's reality like you know you're watching the world's worst reality show and um but you know i didn't say anything to him because you know let him do his thing obviously you know the news is is making him a happy cheerful person so so i i've always had this mindset which is like don't get pulled like basically i find that when people get really into government and politics the phrase that my trainer said to me that makes more sense he's like these people can't govern themselves but they want to talk about you know what the government can do and it's like most people fail to even govern themselves you can't get yourself to do what you should do why are you so worried about what everybody else should do if you can't even get yourself to do it and i've always sort of taken that as like a way to not get sucked into like 2016 i had friends who were crying about trump and all this stuff and you know i said like i get it it's not who i would have voted for but um i just don't worry about that like this is not i don't worry about the government i worry about government myself the exceptions being oh there's a pandemic i should probably like figure out what's actually going on what is the recommended course of action um although that basically you know was was not really paid off because we got a bunch of bad information um you know at first the second thing was okay there's a war going on and this is my first experience really like watching a war break out like there's been wars that have just been going on forever like india and pakistan at the border like you know israel palestine there's skirmishes all the time and afghanistan like you know i didn't even realize we were in it until we pulled out you know like as ignorant as that sounds like it just wasn't top of mind and it didn't you didn't see it play out day by day this is the first time i've really seen it play out day by day so there's definitely like a kind of a crazy thing to see i mean just to see like um just to see people basically take a stand was like kind of like inspirational then to see like experts coming out like on the internet like being like hey civilians this is how you like do urban warfare from your whip your bedroom window and like there's this guy he's a urban warfare expert he's like you need to drag all your furniture out into the streets into this s pattern your goal is to make it so that their vehicles cannot easily like roam your streets they need to be making all these different turns everything desks lamps toss it all into the middle of the street secondly you know drink water because you know you can't go three days without water so make sure you're hydrating otherwise you can't find anybody third here's how you make a molotov cocktail fourth and he just had this like checklist i was like holy [ __ ] is this real life um and then you see crazy man you see like you know there's like what you see in the news versus i'm in these like telegram channels where people people are posting videos from like on the ground and so you see like different perspectives how'd you get in those uh ben had linked me to two i was i was sharing some links to them he's like check this out there's a telegram group where you can just get it it's all in ukrainian like i can't unders i don't read i can't read the text i can only watch the videos um or just like the heartbreak like there's a video that was going viral of this dad just like because you know they did a conscription right like everybody between the ages of 18 and 60 all men like you're now in the army and um there's a dad saying goodbye to his daughter like knowing he may not it may not ever see her again and she doesn't understand she's like a four-year-old kid and like i have a two-year-old daughter so that was just like you know i was just like you know shattered by that and just that was like you see that and you're like this is wrong this is so wrong what's going on like it just hit in a different way um and i had heard uh on the all-in podcast they were talking about this they go they go yeah like right now the us sentiment is like no don't don't go fight other people's wars like don't send our human lives into that and then the guy dave freeberger said he's something he was like you know i wonder how that will change as the like sort of media starts to come out as you start to see videos of like atrocities and kids and women and people are going to have a different reaction when they see that and that's exactly like literally the first video i saw that was such a heartbreak i was like we got to do something i got to donate some money i gotta saw that same video i gotta do something here and so it's just been crazy to see kind of how it's all playing out like crazy is really the only way i could describe it like it's crazy that this is happening it's crazy the way it happens it's crazy that like life gets turned upside down for people like all the things i care about on a day-to-day basis instantly would be out the window if something like this happened then you see the financial side like this is crazy that this war is like i forgot somebody said this like banks not tanks it's like we're basically fighting russia with financial warfare it's it's crazy it's way worse like because i was i was telling ben i'm like putin screw has he's gonna he's screwed up the only thing that really matters rule number one don't [ __ ] with the money yeah paper putin yeah like because because money is like the most important money is more important than lives often or at least you know that's a perception and so like yeah it's screwed up and i want to tell you a point i want to pump your ego so do you know who you you said something you didn't say it as eloquently as i'm about to explain but nassim how do you say his name kind of bad at names to leave okay so he tweeted something really good so basically he is the guy who uh anti-fragile i forget what else he did black swan black swan yeah and he's kind of an oddball but he's eccentric his better word and he uh basically says like don't read the news that's like what he said has said that he said that for a long time and he's like don't read things he says like don't don't uh don't read the news only read things if it's like 50 years old that's his whole point and he tweeted out this yesterday he's like except my book coming this march buy pre-order now yes and he tweeted this out yesterday and he goes most days 99.9 of the news is noise the last few days it's all signal newspaper reading is useless except in crisis and i actually totally agree with that and that's what you said i read the news every day but i actually think it's kind of pointless until it's like an urgent urgent thing and that bar the threshold of what's considered urgent is actually really high yeah and also there's a way to like you can use the news to inform yourself to gather information to like in my case it's just like have empathy for what's going on and just not think about this intellectually but the news can also use you and you have to like figure out where that line is are you are are you using the news right now to gather what you want to gather or are is the news using you as like eyeballs that they're going to drain for the like you bet your ass like you know fox and cnn every news channel like this is their like i'm not saying they don't care about what's going on but this is their payday right this is when they get their spikes this is when they say we have 24 7 news coverage stay here don't move don't change the channel we are going to send you drip by drip play-by-play updates and it's like that's actually not the healthiest you know like most productive way that you can live your life is by like getting hooked onto their 24 7 you know play-by-play update of this war so you know that's the kind of like caveat so this last point i'll make but basically one of my heroes he's on my wall here you can't see him it's ted turner and ted turner started cnn i think he started it in like 1981 but it was kind of a failure it lost a lot of money until 1989 1990 when america or sorry when iraq uh invaded kuwait and the reason why is he sent over a bunch of news stations uh news reporters and it was one of the first times that a news reporter could because of technology could film something and it be aired live and so it was one of the first war that was viewed live and it changed people's sentiment of the war and it made cnn a huge company that one year and that's kind of like what's going to happen now except instead of a news instead of like a a publisher it's going to be facebook and twitter they're just going to crush for like the next couple years because we're glued to it and dude there's uh can i give you the kind of like the finance or crypto angle of what's going on here so so basically the west is doing this like financial warfare and they're like okay economic sanctions so we're gonna make it hard to trade we're gonna make it hard to uh to buy and sell goods and then they're doing a form of like um you know they froze they froze them out of swift or kicked them off of swift okay so now you can't now you can't do international transfers and then they froze the central bank assets which was like the craziest move that was the financial nuke so that was where all of a sudden you know they had 650 billion dollars of reserves and they needed those reserves why because their local currency is crashing so i think the ruble lost what was it like 40 percent in the last day great so so you know the average citizen is the one who's paying the price right putin basically attacked his own citizens here because the currency is crashing um nobody wants to hold this currency anymore there's a bank you know people are lined up to get money out of the bank so normally the way the government props up their currency to prevent it from spiraling to zero is they will buy it back using their reserve assets they hold dollars they hold euros they hold gold they hold some crypto and they'll use that to buy back the ruble but because it got frozen they can't do that and so that's going to cause the currency to go downfall so i think this time crypto's not going to play as big of a story but you kind of have to bet that any country out there who's watching this is probably going to say well we probably don't want the u.s to be able to just freeze all our assets so why are we holding the dollar as reserve why are we holding any currency that one country can uh one country or an alliance can basically freeze our assets or cut us off or take us out of the banking system so i think you're going to see a pretty big move first by you know the quote-unquote bad guys basically first by the folks that are afraid of the west to get out of the dollar and get more get more heavily into crypto because this is a wake-up call oh wow they can just cut they would do this they'll cut us off completely they'll freeze our accounts and so i think in the next few years you're gonna see uh different regimes like switch over to digital currencies that can't be controlled by any one country for a bunch of uneducated dumbasses i think we did pretty good with this one yeah we probably just said one thing or maybe it's ben's russian accent like that'll be where everyone just decides you know we're [ __ ] and cancels us but other than that you know whatever i think it's good i thought the ukraine stuff was awesome did you do you agree ben yeah i thought it was really interesting i thought this is the most interesting news story this is all i want to talk about so i thought it was interesting and and i i think it's cool i think it's cool that we could actually talk about it it's funny dude i so you know people don't want it either way so you i didn't if you don't talk about it it's like dude how are you not talking about this what do you you know why are you uh you think your thing is important there's a war going on like i tweeted something else out i was like oh this is really cool how this is happening some tech thing and somebody this guy's like bro kind of insensitive don't you think it's a war happening i was like oh am i just supposed to not speak about anything else okay and then you talk about the war it's like oh now you're now you're a war expert well you you you wrote something in the milk road that was great you said um i think the opening line was uh we're not gonna mention the bitcoin price today because it's not really that important and i know what you guys are thinking like stay on your lane milk road and the truth is we know our purpose but we want to talk about and i forget uh you went into like the the a bunch of different stuff but i thought that was a really good line what did people say about uh the milk road writing about this uh let's see i'm gonna i'll open up the this thing is the like feedback thing is so uh helpful but also you know like daunting at the same time uh did you see while you're pulling this up i'll say something did you see when i tweeted out uh are there any pro putin people here what is your opinion i want to hear your perspective because everyone i know is is anti-putin and a lot of people got pissed at me for asking that and i thought that was crazy yeah i tweeted something else similar like that i was like hey so you know just trying to like you know educate myself like um what would be and i think i said it something like um i forgot exactly what i said but i was basically asking like what's the what would be the most kind of like pro russian reason for the invasion at first i was like do do the average people in russia does the average person in russia support this right um and then i was like you know second question is is basically like what would uh what would be the like strongest justification for doing this you know or you know if you're if you're like in russia's camp and um you know i didn't get too much flack for it because i like had to like hedge it like crazy but it's so crazy you have to like really um like soften everything so much i guess you don't have to but uh if you don't you know you're definitely gonna like the discussion becomes about you rather than just being able to be intellectually curious and say i'm trying to understand i'm trying to learn i'm trying to think for myself and i'm not saying i disagree with anything i just want to actually like understand all the perspectives that you know that exist so i said deal manning i want to steal steel man this shifter i wrote what would be the most pro-russian invasion reason basically if you tried really hard to think about why this is justified what would you come up with and uh and you know then i got a bunch of answers i got 26 answers to that and i was like okay that's cool that's helpful to uh to and what about the milk road what were the replies did anyone tell you to f off uh i'm opening it what are they what do they say to lebron james when lebron james gave his opinion on some stuff everyone's like dribble just shut up and dribble lebron yeah what did shut up and podcast what are they going to tell me to do shut up and type shot or i don't know i'm going to read the first i'm going to read the first three good like good reviews like we have a system it's like one one milk cup like the emoji like one milk is terrible three milks is average or five milks is great so uh the tone the analysis the new war in size humor this is this has it all that's five another five one i like the insight into the conflict going on right now another one i think you wrote this struck absolutely the right tone sam is that you or is that a difference um that's not me i i replied i said this is really good okay great uh great news later today way to have a perspective and a sense of humanity i'm glad you avoided the business as usual and dove into how crypto is involved in this uh and then they complain about one uh like i made this analogy because i said this thing which was like i love crypto when it's like helping the underdog right like when it banks the unbanked or people's currencies inflating and they can move into this to preserve their wealth but like there's an idea that oh russia could use crypto to get around these sanctions that sucks and then i was like oh [ __ ] uh how do i feel it's a moral dilemma in a way and i was like then i realized you know like technology is neutral it's neither good nor evil it's just used i was like you know the example of a car like you can use a car to you know drop off your mother at the hospital when she needs help or you could use a car as a getaway vehicle to get away from the you know crime scene it doesn't make a car good or evil in either case it's sort of like amoral um and so some people work and some guys like disagreeing with that all right let me see if there's a one star review yeah was there any negativity i literally wow this might be the highest rated one we've had oh here we go here we go here's one you should effing stick to crypto and stay out of politics okay um number one awful shut up and dribble no this one not one one milk awful oh i can't miss the opportunity to suck on some political ask [Laughter] i don't know what to make of that and they did the thing where every other letter is capitalized you know oh my god oh man reading your own comments i'm not sure this is even useful i might just uh leave this up so people have an outlet but it's like here go yell into this shoebox i'm not reading this stuff anymore i check all of it we have a v8 but right now we check it all because it's new but like we have a va who basically will just summarize the like here was your score and here's like the the like kind of valid criticism and the valid like compliments um so i'm just going to read that from now on and not the like the raw stuff unless i really need to go hate my life yeah there's a bunch of i'm actually for this maven thing i'm doing i'm talking about feedback i'm like not all feedback's important like for example um if people complain about pricing i'm like i don't really listen to that i don't care what they say about price because i'm not going to change um another thing is like um if they say like well i wish you would have sent that email this is what you see in the hustle like send that email earlier sometimes i'm like all right i'll we'll do it but then once we started sending at six a.m and i would get complaints i'd be like i'm not listening to this anymore i'm not we're not doing it um and so it is hard to figure out what is actually important and what's not and for a lot of feedback is actually not important totally it's all noise or it'll whiplash you you do one thing and then they'll say one thing you do the other i remember at twitch this happened we went to an exec off site and they were like all right so the feedback amongst the execs to the ceo and the ceo was like you didn't listen to our input enough like we felt out of the loop you guys just decided it was too top down and then the next off site was three months so they spent that whole offsite gathering like what do you guys think what are your opinions what would you do like trying to get like the bottoms up three months later it was like okay let's read out the feedback from last time you know what's happened in the last three months like god can you guys just make a decision already you're the leader you're supposed to just make a call like why do you keep asking us you're supposed to have the answers it's like wow it's like it's like really extreme whiplash of like you know you never never have it one way or the other and the best answer i got was like if you take 10 pieces of feedback they're all informative nine will inform you they'll like they'll tell you about the person it's not about you it'll tell you about them and then one will tell you something interesting or insightful about you you have to figure out what's the one out of ten and what's the nine that's just about this person like some guy tweeted some feedback about my course like saying oh it's going great like you know it's been awesome blah blah he was talking about like i love the energy like sean just it's like a performance it's not just like here's some slides and the guy and so some guy replies he goes oh it's a performance it's all about energy uh so basically you you know nothing insightful probably just a big motivational talk huh stuff you could have just found on the internet and then the guy the original guy responds he's like well yeah like you know 80 of anything you can just go google and find but reality is most people are not going to know what to google even if they're not going to go take the time to google so it's great to like have it all packed in and the guy's like yeah yeah yeah all i heard is i paying just i'm paying 950 just to hear sean pump me up it's like all right so that's that's about him that's not about it it's not about the course the biggest thing when when the hustle will me first i remember we we hired two it was just me and uh another guy and we hired two or three interns and so these weren't even full-time employees and we from the beginning we did this thing where every i think wednesday we would go out to lunch and i remember uh i remember the first time we had other people in that office i said all right well what do you guys want to do for lunch and i got three or four different answers and i was like oh lesson learned never ask and so from that point on it was we're going here uh i and and i said here's what we'll do every week someone else there's a decision maker um but you can't ask you just you decide right and i found that people are just happier that way and life's easier and and oftentimes it's like that with feedback we're just like i'll listen to sometimes but most of the time i'm just doing what i want to do and i'm just going to deal with the consequences right good night yep can i ask you a random question about milk road is who designed the the like milk jar who did that little graphic uh i don't know ben got that made uh or he found that somewhere i think he got it made from there's a guy who we featured their um their dao so it's pretty cool there's a bunch of designers that got together in this dao i think it's called vector dao it's basically like high level designers and they've basically created like a like a ad hoc agency so companies come to them they pay them and then like anybody in the dow can like take the project like form a little guild like a five people form a team and they'll go design the thing and basically it's like an agency that was like they don't have a hiring and firing process you just sort of join and you can either contribute or not contribute at the end of the day and so uh the thing is cool but it's pretty expensive it's pretty pricey so i think when we were featuring it we talked to some guy ben met some guy and then one of the people invected i was like yo i just like like i like the milk road and your thing's so ugly like i got it i got to improve it so are they indian are they indian i don't think they're indian no they uh and then and then every what ben does is he's like he'll just post something like hey what do you i made this design what do you think of this and the guy's like ben i know what you're doing you just keep showing me stuff that's so ugly that like i can't help myself but go fix it like fine i'll fix it again and he's done that twice now so i just did a reverse google image search and there's an article written in the india times and it's using your logo so so maybe so maybe that one is maybe that icon is one that had been found instead of the design but the guy designed like all the like banners and the the breaks in the like in the in the email itself like the format of the design of the email wow and like why do you ask one lady because i really like the formatting and and they're the design and it's really simple like it's basically just that little milk jar and like that color blue yeah and i i find it really simple but attractive and memorable oh thank you wow that flattered are you describing sean or the why am i blushing right now katie's gotta watch out she's gonna watch her back all right that's the episode i think right yeah we're 17 sam's like i got a hard stop at the hour and then i'm like just we just keep talking about random useless stuff [Music] you

all the work we do at TPB is oriented around how do we change systems of production on planet Earth so that um we can make things using less energy less land less natural resources um I I'm a big believer that sustainability in the 21st century does not arise from convincing consumers to consume less I think sustainability arises from Building Technology based solutions that let consumers consume more and dropping the price and dropping the environmental impact and that's what technology allows us to do so if you go back to the industrial revolutions you know of the 19th and 20th Century we built factories right we we put all this technology in a big machine and a big facility and we used it to make stuff over and over again and that dropped the price for consumers because we automated in a big Factory turns out that the technology of that factory as all technology does shrinks gets faster gets cheaper gets [Music] better let me brag about for a second cuz you're not a very you're a very humble guy you're not a very brag worthy guy when I first started hearing you talk um which is not on the all-in podcast I went on YouTube and I heard you give a talk back when you were doing Climate Corporation and I remember thinking this guy's pretty smart um you giving a talk at some school I don't know what it was and I started Googling you then and saw wow this guy's actually he did that and then he did some impressive stuff since then so let me just brag on you for a second so you were at Google 2004 2006 some some range like that so fairly early at Google like I think that's like around the IPO time that's just post IPO is that right uh I joined probably 7 months before the IPO so yeah we were we were working on the IPO or just started working on the IPO when I joined and then uh then you do Climate Corporation sell that for like a billion dollars to Monsanto you do Metro mile which is a pretty cool insurance company that backed and then I think ultimately ended up selling for a little bit less than it's back for to let and then um then you have this thing called TPB so the the production board and in that you're basically what do you call it a studio or uh what do you call kind of well yeah we're we're technically a holding company and our you know and we're a Foundry so we spend time kind of doing R&D and and research and and founding or building businesses so we kind of call it a Foundry and I feel like people know you we we do some investing as well but really our focus is on Foundry work um I want to start with this you are known for you know being a sort of a scientist or a science guy but I looked at your LinkedIn and your first job was investment banker so where did how did you go from investment banker to uh as you're called on the Allin pod the sulan of science well I went to school at UC Berkeley my major was astrophysics I spent some time as an intern at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab uh which is a department of energy physics lab up the hill from from UC Berkeley and I spent um you know a lot of time doing math mathematical modeling of stuff in a basement and generally found it to be kind of pretty disparaging in the sense that like you could spend years working on a project that never sees the light of day at the same time that I was at school the dot bubble was kind of you know blowing up all around me I mean there was even a kid in my dorm who started a company selling DVDs online and sold the business for a million bucks and that was such an amazing thing to happen you know I was mostly making money by playing poker and working you know jobs around school and getting paid for my internship and stuff so you know it was extraordinary kind of seeing just in the Bay Area the world changing because of the internet and so I got really kind of inclined and interested in um not going to grad school and and really going to go work in Silicon Valley so I you know I applied for a bunch of investment banking jobs that was kind of the the hot job to get out of school where I could focus on the tech industry and learn about it and um you know I guess I had never taken a finance accounting business class and so I guess my poker experience paid off because that's how I I put that on my resume I got a bunch of interviews and you kind of ended up getting a job working in a technology Investment Bank so focused on the tech industry and so I got to work with lots of tech companies for a two-year analyst program while I was there and learn about business and finance and so on um so so that that was kind of my first foray um you know into the world of business I tried to start a business when I was in college um never really talked about this publicly raised some money from some family family members some friends of the family but never really did anything with it um never really got off the ground it was um the idea was to let you buy all of your telecommunication services on a website so your you know everything from your cell phone bill to your you know your longdistance provider which was kind of important at the time and so on what uh what did you get wrong with that because that's actually not a bad idea especially during that time uh was I don't think it was probably the idea you just did you not know I still have I still have the business plan I keep it in my office I printed it up like 1999 or 2000 as a as a reminder or what yeah as a reminder it was uh originally called telebom dcom got bombed and then I renamed it in phone services and I registered it I set up a Wells Fargo account um there was a whole uh experience of starting a business um and yeah I mean ultimately I kind of got caught up in trying to get a job out of school and um and you know transition to to focus on on you know what's next in my life and then you know before I joined Google I started another business which was kind of like a research Q&A site online called Kanga k a d n konga.com so I basically taught myself like um PHP and JavaScript and HTML and CSS and I programmed the whole site myself and um and uh MySQL and I basically uh set up my own server and registered the domain and set up bank accounts and it actually made money um and so you know I advertised on AdWords and I got users to come to the website and ask questions and get answers and they'd pay for the the answers um and so that actually helped me ultimately get my job at Google because I had all this experience you know I was coding on my own till like 5: in the morning and then go to work at 7:00 a.m. and so like building this service and and building this whole site it actually Google had a service at the time called like Google research or something forgot what it was called but it is very similar to this and so I got the job at Google I think in part because of that experience so when you were doing that you were uh like okay listen today I think you've built companies I'm just going to use round numbers uh you know you can correct me if I'm way off but you've built companies now that I think in aggregate have are worth more than $2 and a half billion dollars now if if I went and I told you when you were building kaga or you're you know you're in college and I said you know hey that could that's something that could happen would you have been surpr like was that even an ambition of yours were you even would you have been shocked that that's even possible or were you like oh it all worked my plan could have worked if I had told you that that's how it played out um no I don't think I would have thought about it in that framework probably would have been disappointed uh if I think about it um still I I still am generally I mean I I guess you know maybe ambition um is uh you know an expectations I set for myself probably greater than um than than what I've experienced but um I would say that you know my my intention was stay on that for a second so you're saying you're a college kid and you had expectations of yourself that grand do you remember kind of what you were thinking back then um not specifically I mean I just feel like when you're young you have kind of unbounded ambition I mean you don't know the realities of you know when you build stuff and you face challenges and you face hiccups and you know everything from Team to technology to markets and all the issues that arise um you navigate your way through complexity and uncertainty uh you're naive in the sense that like the whole world can and should be different so we should change the whole world and let's go fix it make it different make it better and you know that blind optimism is where a lot of energy comes from that I think drives great entrepreneurial success stories ultimately you know there's friction and rubber hits the road and um you know uh in retrospect I think a lot of what's gone on in my life and my career is probably understandable um in hindsight but you know blind ambition gives you unlimited um vision and I think uh uh you know if if you're not um if you're not challenged along the way uh you know that that that can and should persist um you know but I I would say that my my orientation was never about starting a bunch of companies or making a bunch of money it was um you know much more about kind of impact and um and so you know and solving big problems and having great breakthroughs and seeing those breakthroughs really change the world and that's still I think really core to to my sense of of energy and things that I do and you were at Google at a time when Google was very ambitious and uh I think I've read or heard basically like Larry pagee is kind of a fan of yours I think he's invested in TPB and it sounds like you were there in you were doing Corp Dev there so so you were doing a kind of different role um what was give me a Google story what was it like at that time what what was it like around those Founders give me a sort of a story around ambition or or your time at Google well um so I joined Google uh there was uh just under a thousand people I believe and um you know we all kind of work pretty close together there was like two buildings or three buildings um that that were the main buildings at campus there at 1600 Amphitheater and um you know so when I joined uh there was three of us that started this corporate Development Group which was really like what's the strategy and things we can acquire and invest in and grow the business and had pretty kind of free reign to to look at things and I really focused on kind of The Advertiser or business side of Google so I wasn't interested in consumer products I was more interested in like what's our business and so you know in that context I worked on all sorts of uh ideas of like how do we take what we offer advertisers which at the time was really just AdWords and how do we think about other media we can make advertising available to those advertisers so you know can we do print ads can we do radio ads can we do TV ads can our advertisers use AdWords as an interface to access media across all these different uh properties and channels so I did a few Acquisitions and found a few companies one was called Demar that we turned into kind of this radio advertising business so you could go to AdWords and click on audio ads and create an audio ad and then publish it to actual radio stations and it would play in stream in radio stations and you could see the Impressions and all this stuff that's that's not a thing now right that didn't that didn't end up becoming part of it stayed for a long time um there ended up being a really nasty lawsuit with the founders and a very difficult um set of circumstances that arose after the acquisition I mean I'll tell you uh this story now given how many years it's been I think that was 15 16 17 years ago holy 17 years ago at this point um but you know I had real issues with negotiating with the founders and doing the transaction and you know we thought it was such a great plug-and play for Google these guys went out and all DJs and radio stations by these servers that they put into the um the radio station and they and they put the MP3 files of the ads on the servers at midnight every night and then when the DJ says okay time for R for ads they press the play button and starts playing the ads off the server so what these guys did is they bought the company that has all those servers for like $4 million and they connected it to the internet and they set it up so that advertisers could remotely create Dynamic content and fill in the unsold ad spots on that server every night at midnight and so they were buying what's called Remnant inventory and making money on it and so it was brilliant but for the $4 million acquisition and not a lot of Technology development thereafter you know they were trying to sell the business to us for $100 million so they thought it was worth a billion I mean the whole thing was crazy how we negotiated the deal so it ended up being like effectively a $50 million 75 $72 million upfront cash payment a $50 million uh Milestone payment if they hit a bunch of technical milestones and then up to $1.2 billion in earn outs based on the advertising revenue generated from all these stations and so that earnout structure was the only way I could really bridge the gap on the deal I had to go talk to Google's board about it we eventually got them to sign off on it and the whole thing ended up being like a really ugly uh negotiation and I didn't want to do the deal and I told Eric Schmidt I'm like look I don't think we should do this deal I don't think these guys are going to work out for us I think it's going to be ugly and Eric said we have to be in radio it's a $60 billion Market push the whole thing through despite my push against it we did the deal and uh sure enough we ended up in this nasty lawsuit that lasted for years I wasn't around for all that but um you know I think eventually it all went away and and audio ads kind of kind of died down so that was the sort of stuff I also worked on Google analytics so I pitched Larry and Sergey early on and the idea of like look our advertisers should be able to have analytics on their web pages to see you know how people are converting and why and why not we didn't have have a conversion tracker at the time or anything so um you know tell what that means I pitched Larry and Sergey so like you know Larry and Sergey are the founders of Google they so I I I I work I work with an amazing person named Megan Smith she's really well known in Silicon Valley she was Obama CTO um uh she's um she she's an incredible personality and a tour to force and Megan was really my mentor at Google and kind of showed me how I can just walk into Larry and sergey's office and walk into Eric's office she's like let's go talk to them about this and I'd be talking to her about like let's go see what Eric thinks and she' drag me over to Eric's office and he'd be like sitting there on his computer doing emails and she'd like barge in and be like David's got this idea let's talk about it and then like sit down and you know like and so she really kind of showed me that we can and should have this kind of dialogue with these execs cuz our job was to really help push and think about things that we can take Google you know what direction we can take Google and so you know I really um had I think great mentorship there and so I you know uh was in a meeting with Larry and Sergey saying like I think we should be in analytics and we should offer advertisers the ability to see stuff and and I met Wesley Chan who was a product manager at the time and so Wesley and I um uh kind of started working together after that because the first thing Larry and Sergey said to me was that's evil third party are evil we don't want to track users across different web pages and you know cuz then they'll know that we're tracking them and so it was fairly preent at the time that Larry and Sergey saw that this might be kind of an evil or or viewed evily by kind of consumers down the road and they were absolutely right I mean that's what's going on in the EU and and with apple and Facebook and all the the cookie tracking and so on that that's being kind of taken apart right now um but we showed them that like look if if an Advertiser can get analytics they can see an incredible Improvement in conversion efficiency which means that the user is having a better experience on the web page so rather than the user getting frustrated and leaving the website and wasting their time if the user is Happy the user will buy more they will convert better and the internet is a better place one of our guiding principles at AdWords was like our advertisements should be so good and the and the advertiser's website should be so good that 100% of the time when people are looking at search results they click on the first ad and then 100% of the time they don't come back so the bounceback rate is zero and that shows you that you've shown the perfect ad that's even better than the than organic search results and it's such a good result that the consumer stays there all the way and never comes back and searches again so that's kind of the guiding principle so everything is all about how do you improve the quality of the ads how do you improve the users experience when they go to the advertiser site and how do you get the advertiser to pay for that value um and so analytics ultimately turned into you know we found a company called urchin I took Wesley to SCS search engine strategies we walked around we met a bunch of analytics companies we met had four of them come in and talk to to us and we picked urchin and convinced them to to join convince Larry and Sergey to do the deal within a year I think we had shown through Hal Varian who was our chief Economist we had demonstrated that Google analytics increased adwards Revenue by half a billion dollars because it it so many advertisers were using it to improve their websites and make the conversions better that they were spending more on AdWords and so you could kind of economically show the benefit of analytics and that was like a $25 million acquisition so it turned into a great product I mean I don't know any web pages that don't have you know Google analytics on them you're like where's my bonus it was all good the um yeah I mean if you could if you can show that all right I'm buying a visitor it takes me it cost me a dollar to get the click but now that I can improve my funnel so that that customer is worth more to me I can convert more of those customers and I'll spend more right like that makes a lot of sense and the customer is happier because people are going to a web page that gets them what they want as opposed to going to a web page and getting lost in the content not clicking through and buying dead end so and my last Google question you know when we got acquired I got acquired by twitch uh which is like a kind of part of Amazon and I remember like the first or second meeting where it was like you know all the kind of exacts in a room and as a startup founder I remember always feeling a little bit not like impostor syndrome but sort of always curious like this is how I lead the company I have no idea how anyone else does it right even my founder friends I don't actually get to see them in meetings so I really had no idea what they were doing in my first meeting at twitch I remember looking at EMT who's somebody I really respect uh who was kind of my boss he's the original founder and he was sitting there and and like there's whatever 20 people in the room and somebody presents like this six-page paper and I remember uh he was like done reading it in like half the time of anybody else and then he had like scribbled down some questions on it and then the first question he asked like cut straight to the heart of the thing and I remember just thinking oh this this is what it would be like if my brain was twice the size like oh I could read twice as fast I could get to the heart of the issue you know twice as fast and I was just so impressed by him you know I think that great great leaders in some ways almost feel like aliens uh they sort of can they have some superpowers that that others don't and um what was it like with the Google Founders do you like were they just normal people to you or did you notice any special traits or sort of abilities that impressed you at the time or made an impression on you no I mean look um you know the culture is set at the top and um the team that Larry and Sergey built around them uh you know remain some of the most important and impactful people in Silicon Valley um you know Susan Wii solar kongar um ERS Hotel ERS is still SVP of engineering there he built all of the data center infrastructure which by the way I don't think a lot of people realize um is probably the core advantage of Google um or was originally like tell me about this my my co-founder who's super technical of my past company he used to say that he goes people don't ever talk about this but it was Google's server architecture or their choices that like allowed them to win what did that mean I never got to answer yeah so so so if you go back to 1999 1998 right um in order to search the web you had to have what are called Web crawlers so these are servers that are going out and scanning all the web pages on the internet and then indexing servers and then your web servers which are you know your indexing servers take all that data and classify and organize it and figure out what you know what what's the search term that each web page can represent and then F and and what's the ranking that would that would show up and then finally is these web servers which is the the website you know service um servers so when you go to google.com and do a search and so you know in order to search the web extensively and to have a high refresh rate so how much of the web can you search you have to have more servers in order to search it more frequently you have to have more servers so at the time everyone was using kind of Oracle servers that cost like 3,000 bucks and they had a pretty case and they had purple on them and they used a lot of power and they looked really nice and they would last forever you know all those kind of nonsense claims and so Google set out to basically build a really cheap webs server or really cheap web crawling server and indexing server so they built their own servers by taking commodity hardware and basically breadboarding this thing so taking super cheap Ram super cheap hard drives jamming them all on not even putting a case or a cover on them using super cheap power supplies and then they said they said look if no purple no casing and they made them redundant and they're like look we'll make lots of these we'll be able to search more of the web we'll be able to have a higher refresh rate and we'll be able to index stuff better and have a bigger index than anyone else because we're making it so cheap to do this and so their cost was like $150 $200 instead of $3,000 their servers broke every couple months but guess what it was so cheap to make it when it broke they threw the thing away and so it didn't matter they didn't need to have a 5year server they didn't need to have a high performance server they didn't need to have the fastest CPU and in fact when I joined Google they had a team that was working on a 10,000 Port switch so you know and and and they were making their own asex to do that their own chips and so the the depth that the um Hardware engineering team went into the data center and infrastructure engineer in team went into a Google to create a full stack of technology that was advantaged from the ground up meant that they would always be able to search more the internet always be able to do it better always be able to do it faster always be able to have a higher refresh rate and that advantage and then they made their website super simple and they didn't have to sell ads against it because it costs so little to run the website and so you add all that up and they create this huge Advantage this huge structural moat more people come the network effect more people show up they've now got more people that they can sell ads to they can now reinvest in building more servers search more of the web and so on and so forth and then you know the AdWords architecture was just perfect it was an auction and so advertisers would bid for Search terms they wouldn't do paid insertion or paid inclusion which was big at the time they said that's evil so we'll show ads really clearly and cleanly on the side and if users want to click on an ad they know they're clicking on an ad and otherwise they're search the internet and it just created this this this unparalleled mode and so the hardware advantage that Google built from the beginning I think was really core to to their their point of success um and and so sorry going back to your question look Larry Paige is one of the most impressive individuals you'll ever meet it's really sad he's not more public because I think Larry could offer a lot to the world in the way he thinks and the way he talks about things um he always takes a bigger point of view and a bigger picture uh perspective on things you know when when people would suggest products or ideas he wouldn't get into the technical details or the near-term road maps he would always zoom out 100x and be like why can't we do X so you know why don't we search all the world's books was one of the things they proposed doing in 2003 which was a crazy concept but they actually went and then did it right and no one would have done that if not for that suggestion that that audacity of perspective and so they always pushed and challenged every team to think bigger to think more Grand to think um more aggressively and I think that's a common trait with great leaders in technology businesses is you know um uh and and same with coaches on sports teams you know your your team is only as good as you challenge them to be and so they'll um you know if you're not challenging your team and you're asking them what do you think you can do they're they're only going to achieve a fraction of what's possible uh great coaches and great leaders need to kind of and and Technology leaders in particular have this unique ability to I think understand the technology and leap several um iterations forward to speak to the team about where we're headed and then bring the timelines in and that makes for you know an incredible sense of urgency and outcome and why do you think most people don't do that so thinking big that sounds easy enough to understand sounds fun to do um you know I can hear that advice why do you think that's harder by staff follow in practice it's a really important question um so one of our principles at TPB is dare to dream so it's all about creating that audacious perspective you know how big can this be how big should we be and um what happens when you set a big goal like let's say I have to go climb to the the top of a mountain and I can't see the path from here to the top of the mountain um there's 100 uh permutations or thousand permutations on how you might get up that mountain and you don't know which path is going to work most people um that are smart have been successful and most people that have been successful are not used to not succeeding and so the orientation at that point is that success is all about doing something and getting an action that you expect out of what you just did and so you want you are inclined naturally as a smart person as a successful person to only do things that you know what you're going to get as an outcome and guess what that does that limits Your Horizon so then you end up saying I'm not going to take the more circuitous challenging route or path that might get me to the top of the mountain but I can see that this particular path gets me you know a quarter of the way up the mountain and that may not NE and you might know however that that means you're giving up going to the top of the mountain but at least you know for sure that if you do X you're going to get Y and I see this all the time I see this all the time at businesses where the teams end up compromising on their big vision and they compromise on the moonshot because they're more likely to succeed and they feel more comfortable taking a shorter range narrower Horizon and minimizing the opportunity set significantly and saying I'm just going to go do this because I know if I do X I'm going to get Y and that feels comfortable and I know it's going to happen and so they minimize the Dare To Dream circumstance and then they always say well you know what we'll come back and dream big later but guess what happens let's say you're thinking about um I'll give you a very specific example because this relates to the business we're announcing this week cana.com which is our our molecular beverage printer but early on there was a a hard push to say look we know restaurant owners will buy this device I don't know if every consumer is going to buy this device it might be too expensive it might not taste good enough consumers are so you know fickle if we make a device for restaurants we know that there's an economic Advantage there's an Roi enterprise-based sale let's go sell in restaurants and we'll make a bigger device so it can hold more and we don't have to worry about shrinking and getting all the technology into a tiny form factor that fits on a kitchen countertop the problem is if you do that and you start selling to restaurants you've now significantly minimized the opportunity to go into the consumer Channel because you now have a customer and the customer is the restaurant and the restaurant's going to say I want this feature and I want this feature and I want this feature and I want you to do this for me and all of a sudden your whole team is going to be inundated with product and feature requests that focus on that much smaller much narrower Market you're going to end up going deeper and deeper into that market and you're going to lose out on the opportunity to go build for the big Market to go build for the 100x market that can actually change the world and improve the you know the the problems that we're trying to address with this business and so you know I've seen this at many different businesses where taking on a lot of technical risk taking on a moonshot project um is often foregone and you end up you know trading into a much smaller pie and a much smaller opportunity and then you often miss out on that bigger opportunity and so I I I think it's really important for entrepreneurs to continue to dream big and find aligned capital and align shareholders to let you drain big and shoot for those bigger higher risk opportunities cuz if they work they're 100x bigger I um couldn't agree more I can think of two examples in my own career where I'm guilty of that where we did that and I was just talking to a company I invested that they pitched me this amazing self-driving car uh you know single person single single passenger vehicles that were electric and self-driving and it was this really fantastic vision of what the future might look like and I feel like you know in many ways they've made a lot of progress but also uh it's they did the restaurant thing basically they found a customer who showed them a near path to like some validation and in doing that they sort of beat down the vision and sort of tried tried to cram the vision into it okay some of the vision doesn't fit here all right it's just going to get sort of Left Behind and we'll just do this one thing that might actually net net be a much smaller overall opportunity and smaller impact of this really hard technical thing of you're going to spend your whole life doing this well you know why not go for the one that that actually might work this also isn't limited to technical have you heard the the Airbnb uh Brian chesky's thing like the 12 star experience have you heard this no maybe yeah but doesn't you you'll like this so so basically he sat down his team and he's like okay you know we're in the hospitality business we want to give our our guess a great experience a five star experience he's like so first let's just Define it right like what's a let's you know just humor me what's a onear experience it's like ah you get to the house it's locked you know there's cockroaches outside you know you can't get in you're out in the cold blah blah blah he's like be Vivid about it so he made them sort of explain really what that onear experience would feel like then he's like all right give me a three star experience give me a five-star experience and then the team gets gets excited they say oh five star experience is you know you get there uh it's easy to get in the place is nice it looks just like the photos and um you have a great stay everything works nothing breaks and um you know on the way out you know the the host leaves you a nice little gift basket so so you enjoy yourself he's like awesome so what's a sevenstar experience and now the team sort of like you know you see everyone tighten up like they didn't expect that they already had they thought five was the max number of stars that you can have and he's like totally so give me more and they're like well I guess you could get there and there's somebody at the airport to pick you up they they got your name on of Assan he's like yes yes give me more and so they started to define a sevenstar and he kept pushing it Nine Star 10 star 12 star and they get to this ridiculous extreme of like you know you get there not only do you they have the stay they say hey you're going to be up at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow I got something special for you somebody picks you up they take you on an adventure surfing out cuz they're an expert and blah blah blah and then that type of thinking is what gets you to do Airbnb experiences which is like the local kind of like activities to go do which wouldn't have really otherwise been in a uh you know go book a place to stay a place to sleep like type of website necessarily right and so you can do that on user experience and customer experience just as much as you can do on the technical side um I think that pairs pretty well with your framework there totally um so let's talk about Kaa this is cool so uh I heard this this actually when I I think I reached out to somebody on your team I said I want to I actually didn't want you on the Pod I said I want to make a drink and so let's can I explain it in simple terms of what I think it is and then you correct me uh go for it all right so uh you basically made a printer like a home printer but instead of printing out you know sheets of paper with ink on it you could print out a drink any drink so like for example my wife is vegan she doesn't drink alcohol never has drink you know a drop in her life but she loves you know certain types of tea and coffees and things like that and so she could take her favorite tea and have it like exactly the way she wants it so you know like one of the reasons she loves Starbucks is because she can go in and say I want to light ice oat milk you know decaf with no sugar blah blah blah she can customize her whole drink so similarly we're going to have a device you know five fast forward 10 15 years I don't know you tell me the timeline but we're going to have a device in our house that we can just push a button and it'll dispense the drink we want it'll print a drink for you that is exactly the drink you want and that same machine that she's going to use for her teas I can go use for a you know lime you know Gatorade like drink that I could print out or I might even be able to print a drink that you know somebody creates somebody on the on the internet just creates a recipe and then my printer can just print that recipe out and I can try that drink at home and so instead of shipping you know cans of beverages or going to a store where there's beverages on a shelf and then I drive it home and I put it on my shelf instead of that whole process we just combine the water that we already have in our homes with a like kind of like a printer cartridge of flavors and you can print whatever drink you want so all right tell me tell me if I butchered it you did great I I love the use cases those are those are perfect and awesome so that was great and I me I think that's exactly right I mean you know the the the big Discovery the big kind of aha with this business is based on the idea that 99% of beverages are water or maybe water plus sugar maybe water plus alcohol and one only 1% of all beverages is the chemistry that makes the flavor the smell uh the color and the texture of of the beverage and that 1% is all that we really need to turn water into all these different beverages so the the chem literally water into wine water into wine with canab the way is the town in Galilee where Jesus turned water into wines uh that's the name um little known fact now now now becoming a better known fact um but uh friends that went to Sunday school by the way tend to know that um but basically uh you know the if you take a wine wine has about 500 of those flavor compounds that's all the stuff that comes from the grape and the skin and the you know the the branch and the the leaves and the Oak and all the stuff um and it turns out that of those 500 compounds chemically speaking only about 30 to 40 really matter to your sensory palette so your nose and mouth can only really pick up and and really cares about the 30 to 40 compounds the same is true in coffee in tea in Juice in soda in liquor in beer so all of these beverages are 99% water or water and sugar and alcohol and 1% are compounds where you might have hundreds of compounds in the organic State uh but you really only need a few dozen of them and when you look at the chemical um composition it turns out that that few dozen compounds can be very overlapping from one beverage to the other only a few tweaks of a few chemicals can change a white wine into a red wine or you know a chard into a soft block and so the idea is like let's get those compounds those ingredients into a cartridge just like an inkjet printer where you might have CMYK right four colors and we could have 80 compounds and we think that with 80 compounds we can recreate all the beverage flavors that make up you know everything from an OJ to a Gatorade to a beer to an IED tea to an IED coffee uh to a margarita and so that that's the idea with the business and so you know canada.com is just launched right so it's um we're going to be uh we spent about three years on this project first was all the chemical work so you know does the chemistry make sense can we actually decompose all the beverages so we've at this point used a what's called a A gcms or a gas chomatography Mass spectrometer to to analyze what are the molecular um components of literally thousands of beverages it's like a 23 andb for drinks yeah yeah and it's and like this is um this is really scanning the world's um or digitizing the world's Beverages and so we've got all the sodas all the bottles of wine all the liquor all the tequila everything you can come up with has gone through this device and then based on that chemical composition we've built software that uses heris or Master combinations to try and reduce the number of compounds down and create a common overlapping set that we can recreate all the beverages so so give me the orur so were you just sitting around one day and you're like you know what all these drinks are 99% water and then just 1% is the differentiation why don't I do like how does an idea like this even come into your brain what do you see what are you reading what what happened where did The Epiphany happen well a couple things one is I I had a good sense for that for a while um I was at dinner with a professor from UC Davis um back in late 2019 or so and um uh and so or 2018 uh 2019 and so uh he was telling me about this research paper published by the scientist in Germany at the Technical University of Munich and this the scientist runs a flavor science lab and he was he basically took a glass of wine and he reduced it from 500 compounds down to like 37 or 40 or something and gave it to a consumer sensory panel and they couldn't tell the difference between that wine and the original wine and then he did it with another wine another wine and he's kind of made these declarative statements that he thinks we could recreate all beverages with just a few dozen compounds and so that was kind of I said to the guy at dinner I'm like why don't we just make the Star Trek replicator for beverages like we could just print any beverage if we could just get those few dozen compounds to people's homes um and so there's a guy working with us as a scientist in Residence at TPB which is a Foundry we run kind of R&D programs internally and if we feel confident that the R&D yields an opportunity we'll build a business around it so in this particular case we said hey Lance why don't we read these papers try and recreate these experiments and see if we can come up with a good orientation around is it really feasible that we can create thousands of beverages using just a few dozen compounds that they make economic sense that we can put them in a flavor cartridge and turn this into a machine and so you know after about a year year and a half we actually you know convinced ourselves that this is going to work we separately ran a chemistry program analytical chemistry program as well as a um a hardware program and um you know we had spreadsheet models that showed that the math could work and that we could actually make this device and we we had a bunch of different technical challenges on how do you actually dispense right you know microl ler and submicr volumes of these flavoring compounds into the water stream you got to make sure you can do the whole thing in 15 seconds or 20 seconds because otherwise consumers are going to get annoyed it's got to taste incredible you can't you got to have high Precision it's got to be cheap you got to make it really cold I mean all the the product that you know we had all these prds we were trying to iterate on and then we yield our kind of estimated cost model and then we had to prove the tech worked so you know very iterative cycle for the last um 3 years to get to this point so we now have fully working prototypes of the uh the Gen one of the device uh we're going to production on the Gen one of the device and hope to ship early next year um and so we're starting pre-orders today um for uh for $99 you can reserve a fully refundable $99 reservation fee and the first 10,000 orders are are are $4.99 for the device and $7.99 after the first 10,000 so that's the setup so let me just I'm going to do two things I want to first ask about the kind of like what kind of drinks am I going to be able to get out of this just what what the average person wants to know and then secondly I want to talk about the impact of that cuz I my sense is that if you're making the dev if you're making what you what you eat and drink in your own home um like literally you're producing it in your own home you cut out a bunch of trucking storage packaging stuff that doesn't need to happen that might actually help the environment so I want to talk about the environment in a second um but let's first do do the fun stuff so the drinks okay so um I got water in my house and uh you can your drinks are going to be you have a way to basically cool down the water or and can you like carbonate it or what are the limitations here yep it's it's chilled and carbonated optional obviously in the device you don't need to worry about any of that or you can go hot um uh we don't do heating so we don't do hot hot beverages in gen one so just to be clear you're not going to have hot coffee or hot tea uh but there is cold brew there is Iced Teas flavored Iced Teas all that there's a whole variety of stuff there um but the idea is uh there are three cartridges so there's the master flavor cartridge you put it in it should last anywhere from 1 to 3 months um before you need to kind of replace it uh there's a sugar cartridge because a lot of beverages people want to have sugar and so there's a separate cartridge for sugar it should last about a month and a separate cartridge for alcohol should last about a month um and you don't have to buy cartridges they're free they auto ship to your home and you just put them in when they arrive this the the device senses when you're running low and we send you a new new cartridge we charge per drink so um the the the price per drink is going to be 25 to 50% on average cheaper than what you would pay in retail for that same beverage um so uh you know at the end of each month your C or your account is charged for the beverages you consume but you don't need to go to the store you don't need to buy cartridges you don't need to deal with all the nonset we we take care of all that it's really supposed to be hassle-free and then the idea is there's beverages that range from morning till night so iced coffee iced tea um sparkling you know Soda uh juice um uh uh hydration or energy drinks there's um uh uh hard selers cocktails wine um and so there's a range of kind of add-ons and and features like there's caffeination there's uh nutrient boost so you can actually vitamin boost there's electrolyte boosts and so you could have low alcohol hard Selzer you could have low sugar juice for your kids you could have um you know add caffeine have an extra boost of caffeine or low caffeine iced tea so there's there's all this VAR around what you can do ultimately from a personalization perspective and as a user what you're going to experience is literally hundreds or thousands of Brands available to you on this device and they're all going to be new brands so we're we're not yet revealing who the brands are uh I think we're a few of them will start to announce this week um but if you think about where this goes as a consumer today you really have a very limited number of choices when it comes to Brands because there's only about 150 slots in a retail store for wine beer coffee te juice soda um and so you know minute made Coca-Cola Pepsi 7 up these are nameless faceless corporate brands in the future you're going to have your own brand right so so you and your podcast can make a branded beverage put it on Cana and your followers can buy your beverage and it can be your favorite blueberry hard Seltzer or your wife's favorite tea and she's kind of you know and so you guys can build your own brands at a cost of nothing to you um and so I think that the future is a lot like what we saw in media where people are consuming Tik Tok and YouTube and Netflix and you know there there's a long tale of content there's a long tale of things that are associated with individuals now in influencers I think the same will happen in Brands yeah um so basically just to to kind of explain that again because I think it's an important point so you're saying you know the same way that if you wanted to you know watch TV or listen to the radio there was just a fixed number of slots and so they you know when there was three channels well they would show the most General thing that would appeal to like kind of the common denom Dominator type of audience and then when we got cable we got more channels so now you got a fishing channel and a Golf Channel but you know those are still pretty broad actually when you compare it to YouTube where it's like I can watch somebody who just likes to binge eat food and like that's just what I want to watch right now or I can watch a guy who you know some some CrossFit thing that may not have made it onto ESPN ESPN 2 ESPN 3 or ESPN you know like it would have never made it on those you can't you can't binge watch chess matches on ESPN but you can on YouTube right so you're now watching way more more media than you would have otherwise because you love chess matches and this podcast is a good example not only does it give the consumer more Choice it gives the Creator a way to just push a button and try their hand at it and if we're good like we okay we kind of sucked at the beginning and now we're good now we get a few million downloads a month well that's great because we it was permissionless nobody had we didn't have to go audition anywhere and um and get selected in order to be on stage so what you're saying is the same thing is going to happen in drinks so consumer is going to have this infinite selection of like flavors that fit their needs so the the low sugar orange juice you know whatever that sparkling whatever that's going to be appealing to that person they're going to be able to to print that beverage even though it may not be sold on the on the shelves CU it's not the not like kind of mass popular uh drink choice and the other thing is me and Sam have already started brainstorming Sam wants to do a root beer I'm interested in more of like a a sparkling water sort of thing a non-alcoholic refreshing thing so so we're you know let's do it you got you guys want to do it no I'm serious yeah we want to do it so come to Redwood City try the device and we'll get you guys set up and you make your own brand and that's the question right we were we were about it and people got started dming us because they were like yeah dude we were totally because we we we like to make up fake name brands on on the show we like oh Southern Sam's root beer and then you know Sean's you know whatever motivation I I like to I said this idea I said somebody should make a brand of of water that's just called lucky water and just it's just a little that you might have good luck if you drink this water lucky water right Placebo water and just say there is no this is a total Placebo but hey it never hurts and um and so you put a hint of something in there just a hint well it's gonna have some flavor but the you know the luck is why so anyways that's my drink and so but the question was is this going to taste the same right so for example I lived in China for a bunch of years and you would get these sodas and there's this phrase for xats living in China called nqr not quite right where it's like it almost tastes like KFC but like it doesn't taste like KFC that was a common problem when they tried to export these kind of flavors to another country so I know you're kind of biased but give me the you seem like a you're a pretty honest guy I don't think you're trying to sell stuff no I mean we're pretty technical about so so so here's an important point and I I made this point earlier today um so it's fresh on my mind there's a difference between taste and flavor flavor is the sensory experience that you have um you know biochemically and and biologically as you experience a uh a bunch of chemistry in your mouth um taste is how you psychologically or how your brain interprets and and and finds that appealing so we've all heard stories about taking expensive wine and cheap wine and blindfolding people and giving it to them they can't tell the the difference I can give you really cheap Two Buck Chuck in a two Michelin star restaurant you taste it and you're like oh my God this is amazing you know fantastic I can give you really expensive wine in a McDonald's and you kind of chug it down right and so um taste is a function of the overall kind of sensory experience when you have a product when you engage in a product and so um you know a big part of what we're trying to get right is that experience being more than just the flavor we have to get right right like but you have to make sure that there's something to substitute for the Affinity you have with a brand so you have an affinity with KFC or Coca-Cola and so there's some benefit of that being ingrained in your mind you taste something it's good enough you're like okay cool um and so what we do from a flavor pers so so that's number one is there's a whole digital experience on the device that we think is really important Brands no longer are static it's not just a logo brands are visual right so so there's a a video or some audio that comes through as you're exploring as you're trying stuff through the device um and then um flavor it's really straightforward our chemistry team prints beverages we take the best in the market for that category so we'll take Sprite lemon lime soda we'll print one of our lemon line sodas and we have a sensory panel where we bring in consumers they blind taste and we score stuff and then we get iterative feedback on what's working what's not and that allows us to craft formul so um you know that is a big part of our analytical chemistry process is the sensory feedback that we do blind um and so we don't graduate formula we don't say that these ingredients work until and unless we hit and exceed best-in Market comparables by the way really interesting statistic you'll see that um things like uh cold brew coffee which is a really interesting one because it's so complex and can be so different just like dark chocolate you can take like Starbucks and blue bottle and one group of people will passionately love Starbucks one group of people will passionately love blue bottle and so you know you'll see that our we we will score really well with one group with one of our formula and really well with the other group with another one of our formula and so this goes to the point earlier if you take a Coca-Cola it's got 44 grams of sugar or whatever in it that's what Coca-Cola decided was going to be the lowest common denominator that's how they get the biggest audience to buy Coca-Cola but it turns out some people would buy more Coca if it was 20 g of sugar and some people would buy more Coca-Cola if it was 60 g of sugar so if Coca-Cola had a 20 G 30 G 40 G 50 g and 60 G version of Coca-Cola they would sell a lot more in aggregate of all those versions than if they sold just the 144 G sugar and so sugar is a terrible example because it's evil and awful but we all love it um but you know like my point is has a t talk on this you've seen that one Malcolm Gladwell has his Ted talk about the the perfect Pasta sauuce it's like has millions views yeah yeah you got to listen Gladwell go and like his style he go and he this great story about this this guy that get hired by Pepsi by Coke and then gets hired by prgo I think it is he's like we want the perfect pasta sauce what is the perfect flavor for for consumers and he discovers there is no perfect pasta sauce there are only perfect pasta sauces he's like right some people want the chunky one and there is a perfect version of the chunky that will appeal to the most people there and then some people want the one that's this and and that's why you see the aisle today and there's like the the one that's super garlicky and then there's the one that's super chunky and then there's one that's not chunky because those people feel very passionately that chunky is better than non- chunky they it's not close for them and then you know another group of people will feel the exact opposite and so but they're Limited in in some ways CU they're those are still well they they're only going to bottle five of these or seven of these or 12 of these and then put them on shelves which Can Only Hold whatever seven variations whereas you're not limited by that in the same way that YouTube's not limited by the number of channels on your TV that's right exactly right and I think that's where it's not about are we better than Coca-Cola it's that can everyone find a product on Canada that they like more than Coca-Cola and you you can't use their name right so what are you gonna do are you like shokola like what how are you gonna yourand no we're not using any any of those Brands we're it's all new brands so your lucky water is going to be a brand we're going to get that done and so you'll find hundreds of new brands available on Cana that you don't find on the store shelves and um and you're going to have like your house Brands basically of the popular things yourselves to to see we may yeah I I'm not interested like I'm more interested in finding partners that are going to be passionate promoters and and want to you know be creators on this platform so I think that's where I'm most interested I think we're going to have to se a bunch of stuff ourselves but um you know I think it's it's likely going to be the case that folks that want to be creators are going to be bringing Brands to Market through the device well you know this has happened with alcohol right so like the rock I think is I think he sold I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of cases of his tequila like he's the rock is going to be a not from wrestling not from movies but from same with same with George Clooney all they all got beverage Brands and by the way they all hug you have to be huge and that's the thing so um only 3% of Beverage brands that launch um and get retail space actually make it to 10 million in sales right and so you know if you're someone with less than 100 million followers you've only got 3 million followers you're a great YouTube Creator people know you they love you they're passionate about you you're never going to go make a beverage brand it's going to cost $5 million to do that you got to go make formulate it you got to make packaging you got to make a logo you got to box it then you got to go convince retail stores to carry it I mean the whole process is like an insurmountable process generally speaking you have to be huge like the rock to get that and you know there's probably 90,000 times more people in that middle that are really influential have a lot of followers aren't as big as George cloney and the Rock and so they could make a brand that doesn't require any investment that doesn't require any Capital they don't have to take any risk um and look if it it's it's permissionless right so if it works great like they've got um a nice Revenue stream and you give a a share so let's say I don't know what what do you think the average drink is going to sell for like a dollar or less than a dollar so it ranges from you know two 29 cents for like a sparkling water like a flavored water like a lacroy competitor yeah um up to um $299 for kind of like a really nice cocktail um you know you'll find that like a Mojito or Mimosa will be like $1.99 um generally the price will be about 25 to 50% less than the store right so let's say I'm selling my my 30 Cent uh lucky water what is the is there a standard out of the box like a App Store like 30% cut type of thing or what is the what is the business model cuz because this will let more people do the rock thing this will let people like me do the rock thing where we can just formulate a drink sell it virtually digitally into everybody who has a printer it's now available and then we get a small income stream royalty stream coming through this yeah by the way the royalty stream for like someone like 50 Cent or something is going to with like 2 to 6% you know so there partic on net right and so there's a very um different kind of model there we offer a much higher share of Revenue obviously you know this is a a very difficult business to operate so we've got to get cartridges made we got to get them to people's homes we Auto renew so there's a whole Services component so you know we've got a pretty good pitch today for brand Partners um you know we haven't launched um commercially so I'm not going to kind of commit to what the number is going to be but I think it's a really really compelling opportunity um and they're all going to be you know real they're going to own their brand so if they want to take that brand and use it elsewhere it doesn't have to be exclusive we don't own the brand it's it's your brand right so you can take your brand at lucky water and if it takes off and you've got 10 million people that want to buy it in stores go launch it in stores you know it's your brand um so yeah I think it's a platform for letting people kind of create and id8 and um and you know see if they can develop value there and the thing it's almost like it's like merch right like I mean just you know monetize your yourself the the device cost you said $4.99 or it's going to cost $4.99 that's the pre-order kind of price for the first 10,000 orders so once we hit 10,000 the price is going up to $7.99 yeah and then is this the like kind of Tesla Roadster model where you think that you know where do you want to drive this down to what do you think is the thing you need where this actually is not just my you know cool thing in my house when people come over and I can do a magic trick like when does this become standard where it's not a magic trick everyone's got one so it's a it's a great question um you know there's about 35 million kuri's installed in the world there's like three and a half four and a half million soda streams um these devices have prices that range from like 70 bucks up to $299 for like a nice Nespresso and then you know so so $299 maybe gets you kind of a 10% Market you know 199 gets you 30% I I don't know the number because part of what we're doing is we're not just a single product and a single day part so an espresso CG Soda Stream one product one day part so will people pay pay more for more day Parts uh will people pay more for more variety for lower hopefully our prices are going to be lower than what you pay for for some other alternative products so the value we can provide to Consumers I think will ultimately dictate how the market expands as a function of price right um and uh and then form factor so so you know can we get it smaller and then uh heating can we add heating to it and so you know there's a bunch of features on the road map and then the tradeoffs on price uh so you know if we add Heating cost a lot more it's going to get bigger can we make a technology leap where we can actually get everything to be smaller and add heat and drop the price and you know as we go from gen one we're calling this our gen one device me one to gen 3 we really think gen 3 ends up being kind of like it's got everything for everyone and it's an accessible price point for the mass market and I don't know if you're fully out of time uh but I did want to give you a chance to do talk environment for a second if you if you have it uh I think that's probably pretty major or like at least one of the big drivers for you here pretty much all the work we do at TPB is oriented around how do we change systems of production on planet Earth so that um we can make things using less energy less land less natural resources um I I'm a big believer that sustainability in the 21st century does not arise from convincing consumers to consume less I think sustainability arises from Building Technology based solutions that let consumers consume more and dropping the price and dropping the environmental impact and that's what technology allows us to do so if you go back to the industrial revolutions you know of the 19th and 20th Century we built factories right we we put all this technology in a big machine in a big facility and we used it to make stuff over and over again and that dropped the price for consumers because we automated in a big Factory turns out that the technology of that factory as all technology does shrinks gets faster gets cheaper gets better and so theoretically technology like what exists in a factory a technology that's better than what exists in a factory to make beverages can be put in your home um and so you know the idea is how do you decentralize manufacturing because it takes about 600 L of water to make a single liter of wine it takes about 40 lers of water to make a liter of orange juice and we take all of this water and by the way orange juice is 93% water 7% sugar only 1% is the flavor compounds right wine is 88% water 11% alcohol less than 1% flavor compounds so you know how do we uh so we've taken all this water grown all these crops that basically turn into water put them into glass and plastic and cans that we use carbon dioxide to make then we put them on trucks which use carbon dioxide to go to warehouses that then go into stores that then go into your home and then you store them in your home and you're basically drinking water and every industrialized home has water it's about half a billion tons of CO2 that are put into the atmosphere every year to make bottled cans and beverages um it is about bottled bottled in canned beverages um it is about four 400 trillion lers of water that are used in the whole production cycle of bottled beverages um and consumers are spending $2.3 trillion a year on this archaic insane system of centralized manufacturing to use a ton of energy and a ton of carbon and a ton of land to just move water into your home when you already have water in your home 120 million Acres of Farmland that could be reduced and returned back to the uh natural ecosystems that we would stop using to grow all this stuff so that's our long-term incentive right the incentive is can we take that carbon out of the atmosphere can we reduce the waste on water can we return the land to Natural ecosystems and at the same time make a cheaper and better experience for consumers by decentralizing manufacturing and putting these devices in homes and giving people better options um and so that's why we're so excited about this you know I think I think we we have an opportunity to do something that has an impact but also hopefully gives consumers something that's better than what they have today yeah I don't know if you're hiring but this is one of those companies where I would look at i' say wow that would be a cool place to work if I was out there in the job market because you have hard tech problem you have a device that if it works is going to be like a household name you everybody's going to know it it's going to be like a Netflix or an iPod or something it's going to be something that everybody knows if this actually pulls it off I mean you're on some Willy Wonka you know you're basically creating this magical device that lets you create whatever you want you know your own little candy your own little beverage in your home I think that's um it's pretty inspiring and uh and you know to do that while also having a big impact on the environment right like most people would look at that environmental supply chain you talked about and say how do we make this 20% more efficient at this step how do we make the trucks emit a little less carbon dioxide right how do we how do we just reduce this by 15% and what you've done is said why are we doing this in the first place why don't we eliminate the whole chain so why are we using all this water and all this plastic and all this fuel just to move water from here to there and add a little bit of flavor to it right the water and totally even even worse when there's already water piped into people's homes so we already built the the core infrastructure the pipe into the home with water all we got to do is sort of like at the at the last Last Mile not even last mile sort of like the last two feet of counter space just converted into the product people want so I think it's pretty yeah and like all the refrigerator space and energy to run the refrigerator to store all that stuff and like the the stuff in your in your cabinets yeah so that's exactly right I mean you nailed it like that's why it's so awesome so yeah we are h and we got great offices so and people go to work in the office and so that's a perk nowadays it's a per you can see humans if you work with us yeah you know I'm going go out come and meet people IRL I think you know CL climate Corp is cool the insurance companies all it's not that cool but you know I guess you made some money this is cool this is going to be your your biggest thing I hopefully this will be the thing that you know college version of you would be like all right that was that was sweet not not underwhelmed by that one uh as long as my as long as my kids are proud down the road I I'll be happy so so that's all good all right tell people where to go to uh so canada.com go go is that where you can.com C c.com and um yeah you can check out the product specs and the the product video and and uh sign up uh for $99 pre-order reservation thanks for coming on man I really appreciate this I'm a fan of yours it's been awesome to chat yeah it's been a great chat I think you really um really nailed it and I appreciate you you listening so that's been great thank you [Music]

but my big discovery and why i really started loading up on ethereum was another chart which was a understanding that metcalfe's law was the primary driver of all crypto markets and in fact almost all of the tech stocks that we've known today and once you realize that these are basically networks and once you realize that crypto are networks where you actually own the network so facebook is a great network stock and it works perfectly on a log chart and it's an exponential does all the things as you imagine you can value it in metcalf's law terms but the fundamental difference is shareholders and network users are not aligned the shareholders make the money the network users get the utility along comes crypto you marry the the network user with the owner okay now you've got networker pet effects upon network effects this is like behavioral economics right manifest religion meets michael's law right it's like now i'm trying about the thing it's religion meets capitalism it's basically what it is right so that is incredibly powerful [Music] so for those who don't know you basically you were at goldman you started your own hedge fund and then it seemed like you you retired correct you retired pretty young you retired at 36. but i mean now you're you have a company now so you're not you know fully retired and kicked back but no i've got four jobs i'm doing right now so right but you did have a break in between correct so like i think it was 2004 when you when you sort of retired from the hedge fund and it was like 2014 or something when you launched you know real vision so what was going on in between were you doing nothing or you were doing other projects i was writing global macro investor but that is a monthly publication so i don't know why all of you guys do weekly newsletters or daily newsletters that's hard work so i yeah i wrote monthly it's big it's like well it starts off at about 35 pages a month and then due to uh inflation it gets to um about 130 pages a month now but i write it in a weekend so wow in i was living in spain wrote one weekend a month sure i need to monitor markets and talk to people but it was a part-time job um so really what i've done is kind of opted out of the rat race moved to the mediterranean coast of spain i was growing fruit and vegetables in my garden and almonds and olives and all of that stuff living the beach life in spain um in the middle of a on the side of a mountain in the middle of national park having a great life in the end you might start missing intellectual capital p the people around you because most of the people most of the year round in a beach town in spain work in a bar restaurant or they um or they're in real estate which is fine but you feel very isolated when your world is global macro totally so so describe the moment because i think a lot of people listen to this so just so i don't know how much you know about the podcast but basically the podcast is usually me and sam who he's not here because he's traveling he's actually in portugal right now um we just sort of usually spit we're both founders both recently sold our companies in the last two years we started the podcast after we sold because that's when you have a bunch of time on your hands and um and it's usually just spitballing different kind of like business opportunities market opportunities and so just stuff that we see that we think could work or is interesting but we're not gonna go do it ourselves so this became our outlet to do that and um and so you get like we have like i don't know like over a million downloads a month and those people what the people who listen what they're doing is um they typically are either like they want to start a business but they don't they have like a good paying job they're looking at making the leap or they have their own business and this is like they're doing this while they're you know doing their chores and it's like i get to hang out with my buddies who are shooting the [ __ ] about business because like you know we talk about stuff that they want to talk about they just don't maybe have the friends around them that want to talk nerd out about business all the time and so we kind of had that same uh thing where you needed that intellectual sparring to uh to feel good but the thing you mentioned which was like you know you sort of won one game you're doing well in one game but you decided to exit the rat race what was that what did you have like a kind of come to jesus moment what did you have like was that a long time coming how did that happen my meta narrative is the game is life itself the game is not money the game is quality of life and how you live it so that was always my objective so when i was on the tube in london at 5 15 in the morning to get my get to my desk at goldman before six the reason i did it is because i knew that the next thing i wanted to do was go and live in the mediterranean and wanted to have that quality of life you know for me a lot of people think of money as the primary objective i actually like houses as you can tell from the house behind me right because this is where i live this is the quality of life this is my bank this is everything um and so i like where i live and how i live that's why i live in the cayman islands that's why i lived in spain they're beautiful places and i live a quality of life so that has always been my journey but what i want to do is i always take steps towards the endgame i kind of live in the future always in everything that i do so i always have a vision of my future self or whether that's future state of financial markets where i think it's going whatever it may be i'm always well ahead and so i then can look it's much easier to live in the future and look back and say how do i get here then stand here today and go i want to go forward it's kind of weird it's a psychology thing and so i had realized that the mediterranean was this life and i was my ex-girlfriend when i was at university um her mother lived in majorca in spain and i was there in mallorca one point and we were on this small beach eating grilled sardines that was this perfect mediterranean scene right grill sardines somebody's making a big oil drum on the beach you've got a cold beer some grilled sardines and on this little mini peninsula there's a bunch of pine trees and palm trees and there's this long table of like 30 people 25 people of different age groups parents kids grandparents eating paella the spanish national dish on this sunday drinking wine laughing i'm like that is quality of life and so i kept that in my mind and so i kind of facilitated it to happen that i would move to spain right um and i did it in steps as well so i did it in the step that i was speaking to my father i was having dinner with him and he's like and i i was just chatting a few glasses of wine i was like you know i'd love to buy a house in spain at some point and he said you know i've got a friend selling a house in spain a random thing so i said sure well let me know so he sent he he this is in the day of faxes this is like 1998 or something he sends me a fax of this six-bedroom house on a hillside in spain i'm not that's great dad how the hell am i supposed to afford it he's like i was 30 years old i was working at goldman he's like well i don't know how much it is so he came back and said it was 150 000 pounds which at the time was like 250 000 us 200 000 us and i just had a bonus and i thought well i can actually buy that in cash and i did right and it was game changing i had a mortgage in london and everything else was game-changing because now i'd won the entire game i've got a six bedroom house on a hillside in spain overlooking orange groves 10 minutes to the beach and i could lose my job i could still have anything and i could work in a bar and i could live there i'm done right my gaming life was one so that that was the marker stone to allow me to take more risk to do the next thing and so that's how i've always done these things and how do you get that vision so i'm the same way but what i've noticed about myself is like every i call them like these chapters so it's like every sort of like five years is like a new chapter and what i've noticed if i go look back at the kind of last three chapters so i'm i'm 30 about to be 34 so basically you know three chapters i i've done three chapters now and each time it was sort of this like fortuitous bounce where i get in touch with somebody and they show me a glimpse into this lifestyle or this kind of like mode that they're in and then i just can't unsee it i'm like why the hell am i not doing that right it's your version of seeing people eating paella drinking wine at a 30 table just enjoying life on the by the water and you're like that's the glance that that's the glimpse i needed to do it so is that how you also got your vision for the next for the next kind of like chapter yeah so the next thing was not so i'd been in spain and i realized the thing i was missing was intellectual capital even though my clients were the world's most famous hedge fund managers you know all of these super smart guys but they weren't around me they're all around the world and it was not as easy to get in touch twitter wasn't really around you know there was less ways to be social online podcast didn't really exist right so and then i think i probably discovered tim ferriss and another friend of mine mark hart had gone down this journey of looking at silicon valley and entrepreneurship and that was the thing that i thought okay this is the next thing for me how can i how can i take the entrepreneurial journey outside of you know setting up my own research business which was a one-man band essentially i wanted to take that entrepreneur's journey and push myself i wanted to see what i was capable of um so that was the next that was the next thing and give people a sense so you're at goldman that's a good job uh what are you making back then uh you know basically like what what was your kind of like because i think for a lot of people they're like okay some people feel trapped when they're when they're making a high salary at a nice company they feel trapped they don't they don't take those leaps and other people they'll look at this and say well it's easy for you you probably are making a bunch of money at the time uh you know so yeah you could take these leaps of faith because you had kind of a safety net so but wait why in the clock back we were talking almost 20 years ago or something like that um you know how are you doing financially then versus you know at those two steps kind of research i've been really lucky you know i worked in the banking industry selling derivatives to hedge funds right so these are the mega trend of finance the mega trend of derivative and the mega trend of hedge funds so i you know i was doing pretty well you know at 30 years old i was only earning more than a million dollars a year um so but you managed to walk away from that which is pretty impressive yeah and i first went to a hedge fund don't forget so i left goldman went to hedge fund so i took a risk but i used to argue with my boss every time he used to give me share options and uh restricted stock i'm like thank you it's worthless i'd rather have cash because how dare you you should be proud to have equity in goldman and that's why we can give you so much more compensation i said it's worthless he said why do you say that because it's not money i can spend so he got really pissed off with me and then when i finally quit to go to my biggest customer and the biggest customer of goldman's equity derivative equity desk um entire equity floor in europe uh glg partners he then called me into his office and goes well you were dead right it was worthless he said so i lost all um i managed to cash in some of it but i lost millions of dollars to make that move but i wanted to make that move because i wanted to see whether i could if i could run money myself and be a macro investor because it was another chapter that i wanted to pursue for my own goals and then let's kind of fast forward till today so you came on my radar i think i had seen real vision a few times but i hadn't i'm not from the finance world from the silicon valley tech world and you know so we all kind of have our like media sources that we learn from based on whatever industry you care about right and so i had seen it but i hadn't really paid too much attention uh but i saw you start talking about crypto and this was um you i didn't realize that you had actually started talking about crypto back in i don't know 2013 2014 and i went back and i read your old kind of like memos and stuff that you know put up screenshots about so you know like you said ahead of the curve you have the receipts to prove it um but i think it was 2019 or 2020 where you started becoming very vocal and then you made the big splash where you were like i've moved some ridiculous part of your liquid net worth i think it was i think you might have said fifty percent at one point i thought you third you say ninety percent into crypto yeah 100 into crypto and um so that caught my attention and the attention of a bunch of other people and so you know i know you've talked about this before but there's a new audience so give give kind of the origin story of how the mind virus of crypto kind of like what were the steps where you went from like curious to convinced what what was that journey like for you where you put in percent or hundred percent because my job is to live in the future so i had got i had lived through the financial crisis and predicted it i had also lived through the european crisis and predicted it and had been in europe and had to buy a generator and food and get cash out of the bank and keep it at home right that's how close we were in spain to losing our entire banking system and as a macro guy i knew the issue was leverage and leverage had meant that we had a unique problem which was there's a layer of collateral and all of this debt is against the collateral and usually you've got like 30 claims on the same piece of collateral in fact the average u.s treasury has 32 claims on it or it did then may have more now so therefore who owns what in an unraveling you know who's going to get screwed and the the leverage was uh you're talking about government or corporate or where where did you see this stock pile of funds i look at total leverage financial system leverage government leverage um household leverage and private sector leverage right so we're at 480 percent of gdp now whatever the stupid number is right it's ridiculous but the problem is is that's a lot of claims on the collateral so because not everything is collateral in the system only something's used as collateral anyway so when lehman went bust right everyone's scrambling to find who owns what and you know that happens all the time so i started trying to start the world's safest bank with a bunch of family offices um i thought you know we could stay a bank that doesn't use leverage so then people can put assets there their savings there and realized they're safe because it wasn't safe people in cyprus had all of their money taken out by the government so i'm like okay i need to do something about this and i can do something about it so i started that journey and a friend of mine called emil woods who was a subscriber to global macro investor um who was running a hedge fund at the time an ex-goldman guy he said you need to look at bitcoin and i read a bit about bitcoin it's probably 2012 and i wrote the first macro piece on bitcoin which is i think the thing you referred to yeah which is 2013. it's like i saw it and thought okay so we've got two things here one is this asset bitcoin and that's a scarce asset in the digital world so that's probably interesting and secondly we've got blockchain which is a recorded ownership of everything okay well that solves the entire financial system and this could be something useful for the financial system in itself as a new version of gold so i backed out that the fair value of bitcoin with gold at 1300 using the kind of supply you know stock to flow ratio done badly you know i'm no you know statistician or econometrics expert but i kind of backed it out so it's probably worth a million bucks and then how i like to look at things is okay what's the price now 200 let's assume probably rightly that raoul is a total idiot so let's assume he's wrong by 90 so it's worth a hundred thousand dollars and it's at 200 that is the best single bet i've ever seen in my entire life so i bought it and i wrote about it and i held it all the way through till and when you say you bought it that's like a like the first time i bought bitcoin i bought like i don't know a thousand dollars a bitcoin right so i bought it means what like you bought a tiny bit you bought a medium amount or you went like you put a significant stake for yourself into it a decent a decent enough amount um and i sold it after a 10x so i'd done well from it sadly i got divorced in the process so i halved that so there was my tax that i don't pay and i came in i chose a voluntary 50 tax um so you know it wasn't a life-changing bet but it was a it was a good bet now had i held it on to 20 000 when it peaked yeah it would have been life-changing so okay so i've been in it i got out i was nervous about all of these four king wars and everything going on and i don't understand this let's wait and see and then i had talked about it a lot analyzed it been involved in it but hadn't been investing it again until 2019 started sticking my toes in again because the market had been selling off i was starting to get comfortable that yes that we got a recession coming this is going to be a useful tool and then 2020 comes along um and i was already positioned for a recession but you know this opportunity was like okay if the central banks are going to print like crazy then that's the opportunity so i bought a lot of bitcoin at that point i was long bonds gold dollars bitcoin and then over time i started charting bitcoin versus other assets and i realized its dominance in performance was so extreme that it made no sense to own other assets even with the fact that bitcoin can be very volatile and have periods like now or it's down 50 it's like it makes no sense to own anything else now i probably will take other bets here and there but i think my core strategic so i was bitcoin first then i started doing the work i was on twitter a lot um and people if i were to ask anything about ethereum people would pile on to me that makes me want to know more so i start digging in has the opposite reaction i knew what about ethereum and you know but i started properly digging in and i thought you know this is really bloody interesting the chart looks incredible the chop versus bitcoin looks incredible um this makes sense to me so um i started switching um into ethereum and when you say the chart looks incredible so tell me what that means so i've uh like i said come from the tech world we look at charts all the time but they're always like users revenue uh things that sort of like are not uh based on specular you know any kind of like uh speculation or human whims human emotion exactly um so you know charts don't lie or you know they they do if you but unless unless you know what you're looking at so when you talk about charts i've seen you know i see people like do this all the time on twitter where they're like you know it's voodoo magic they see a chart then they draw this like crazy shape oh clearly this is doing a reverse cyclone pattern and it's going to go all the way up and so are you one of those guys where you actually do the technical analysis and you say no the price chart is what i'm looking at or were you looking at other charts um both so um and i'll come on to that so price chart i think is the best guide of what the asset is doing what its trend is how it how people are perceiving it and where it is versus what you might perceive as fair value so okay you know you you notice certain characteristics like crypto tends to be exponential in price so you put on the logarithmic chart it starts to make sense you know you look at things like copper and lumber they tend to be mean reverting assets because you they get met by excess supply with high prices lead to excess supply so right now with oil at 100 bucks everybody wants to make as much oil as possible so the price comes down over time it doesn't happen with crypto because you can't right so you need to understand the structure of markets where the sentiment is is it overly bearish like a day like today it got overly bearish and so suddenly you start to see a reversal so these kind of things are interesting but my big discovery and why i really started loading up on ethereum was another chart which was a understanding that metcalfe's law was the primary driver of all crypto markets and in fact almost all of the tech stocks that we've known today and once you realize that these are basically networks and once you realize that crypto are networks where you actually own the network so facebook is a great network stock and it works perfectly on a log chart and it's an exponential does all the things as you imagine you can value it in metcalf's law terms but the fundamental difference is shareholders and network users are not aligned the shareholders make the money the network users get the utility along comes crypto you marry the the network user with the owner okay now you've got network of effects upon network effects this is like behavioral economics right manufacturing religion meets matt mccaff's law right it's like it's religion meets capitalism it's basically what it is right so that is incredibly powerful so i start looking at the fact that bitcoin and ethereum charts just at different points when they at the same point in adoptions like were remarkably similar and then it dawned on me as they're all the bloody same thing they're all about adoption so then so so if you look at it and if you're honest with yourself ethereum if you think about metcalfe's law it's about the number of users and then the kind of connections between the users and the applications built to create those connections well bitcoin's kind of a one-sided one which is a bunch of people own it as a store of value like gold nothing wrong with that but there's not many applications built in when you look at ethereum it's like holy [ __ ] i mean this is like the internet right that moment is like okay this is far superior a bet um and so that's why i took that bet and then i eventually shifted majority into ethereum and then took other bets in the space to express macro views yeah uh it's funny i i have uh one tenth of the intelligence of you but i did the exact same pattern so you know i heard about it in 2013 bought a little bit dabbled sold during when you know i when i went to a wedding and my aunt was telling me about how great bitcoin ethereum was i was like oh it's probably a bubble 2017 2018. sold for a nice profit was patting myself on the back uh you know in retrospect worst trade i ever made should have just held everything um you know bought started buying back in uh in 20 20 uh 2019 or 2020 i kind of announced that i've uh i had moved 25 of all my liquid net worth into the thing but that was right before you know another another run-up and so that became quickly 50-60 and um and you know piers and some people are telling you you're crazy i'm sure you had the same and same thing you know why are you betting on this are you just kind of speculating and i said no like basically i spent my whole career studying the power of network effects right i'm trying to build marketplaces and social networks in silicon valley because i know that a network effect is the most powerful force imaginable and uh and then i see this chart this adoption chart of this new money network it's like well if this if the if the social network was worth x and the information network was worthwhile and then the you know the merchant network which is like you know basically amazon um it was worth you know z then then this thing is going to be the money network's going to be worth a lot i can tell you that and so i was i didn't know much more than that but i just knew if you can bet early in a network effect that's still going through it's kind of like you know adoption curve um you know you'll do pretty well and so that was kind of my my my bet um coming from a comp you know sort of a different different take but ended up at sort of the same conclusion and i remember being impressed that you were talking about network effects because i didn't really see a lot of people in kind of traditional finance talking about that at all and i was like they're missing the point you know really one of the first people to really start saying unless you understand network effects you understand what this is at all because everyone's not defined on weird things because people people listening maybe don't know network connect so so to define it network effects just describes this phenomenon where uh let's just take you know a language if i'm the only person who speaks english english is not very useful same thing with a telephone system if i'm the only person with a telephone it's not that useful but now another person gets a telephone or learns english well english just got more valuable and then the more people that learn english the more valuable english is as a language and so it's describes a phenomenon that every participant that joins the network makes the whole network more valuable so it's like the opposite of like a popular nightclub where everybody who joins makes the thing sort of you know diminishes the popularity over time network effects typically describe that and they it gets more valuable at it square basically as an exponential not linear and then if you think about it in other terms is let's say let's say let's look at web 3 as a network and a network of engineers engineering talent right this is where it gets really interesting why is it exponential it's because there are parts when everybody's trying to hire web 3 talent right we are every single person i know is right and the actual pool of people who are capable of doing it is probably like a thousand right and there are so multi-millionaires who don't want jobs that's the point is their salaries and the demand for them is exponential the demand for the network of those guys becomes exponential over time there'll be millions of trained people and it becomes the network effects the overall space is very valuable but the opportunity that ramp that's the single most important interesting part of network effects right and the fact that you can own a share of the network so even when the network flattens out and is now worth i think 200 trillion dollars for the digital asset space it's currently 2 trillion that's 100x in market cap that's huge we've never had anything like this before right like when the when the first when the information network was getting built out which is just the internet and it was pretty clear like slowly but surely people were adopting they were getting online and then stuff was getting built stuff to do and then everybody who was online made made being online better because you could communicate with them or they might write a blog or whatever the whole internet was getting better the more people that joined right that was a network effect but you couldn't invest in the internet like you couldn't just invest in generically the internet and so you had to pick you know certain platforms and even then how how do you become an let's say you believed in amazon or ebay or whatever you're only getting a slice of the total internet and even then they don't want you know the average person could not invest and that to me it feels like nfts right now we want to all get involved in nfts you have no idea what's going to win i mean i mean you don't have the ability to go on every discord so it's bandwidth constrained we all are in this space we know it's huge we all know it's huge we also know it's a bubble we also know tons of this is going to zero um that's fit what's interesting about you only gives you that gives you the uh action of nft the kind of you know that that kind of makes sense like owning oracle did a pretty good job of capturing the internet right and so you've been now kind of following this and so what what what is the viewpoint you had about crypto that you've changed your mind on or you've what you believe before now you realize it's sort of wrong and you think about it a different way is there any has it been anything is this kind of you know it's kind of like this rapidly evolving thing you're sort of like defogging this like brand new world you know so you know maybe some mental picture some mental framework you had before hasn't really held up and maybe something different has happened can you think of an example of that well my views on bitcoin changed um significantly i don't think no less of it as an asset but i thought about it in network terms and the community and i thought the community is not attracting new people and the job of a network is to attract new participants and if the network was actively rejecting people i thought it's going to underperform um which was surprising to me because i was very bullish on bitcoin first because i thought look it's going to have a larger place and what's happened is almost immediately and it made me change my mind is the institution started going well i actually don't like this space and they started buying eth and that was so that's that's new i haven't really heard that so tell me about because you're connected to all these folks right like you know hedge fund guys cios whatever you know a bunch of different people in that world they don't want to own an asset where everyone's shouting have fun stay poor at each other and putting laser eyes right makes them look [ __ ] stupid and irresponsible with their money well eth feels like it's a technology play yes it's amusing because everyone's saying gm to each other and all of this stuff but it's not at war while bitcoin was at war with every other network because you know that's what networks do you know religions go to war with each other for the same reason right they're exactly the same principles um so you know it's the same reason russia and nato it's they're all the same they're all networks fighting each other for the robustness of their own network i get it so that that that whole process of seeing institutions getting turned off by it was a was a big deal to me i just thought yeah i don't like this either so that was one thing um i'm trying to think well you've seen a lot of news about institutions buying bitcoin whether it's tesla or microstrategy or square or you know some like you know a random insurance company buys 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin so we've kind of heard those we hear less of that with eth is it just going on under the radar is it coming what's your sense of that because i haven't i'm in this space i haven't heard a ton it's happening um below the radar because people keep coming to me saying when's this wall of money i'm like it doesn't come as a tidal wave it comes as a flow right you don't see it until you look back and go wow so i mean i literally every other day i'm speaking to the world's largest financial institutions who put me in front of their investment committees and taught them through crypto and how to invest and the narrative change really surprised me it was always bitcoin you know can we put bitcoin on our balance sheet how should we invest in bitcoin what's the diversification move very quick to look ethereum feels like it's a technology play that makes sense with the applications we can't we're interested in d5 etcetera then it very quickly became oh [ __ ] how do we get involved in web3 um so it moved very fast which is why in the end vc got most of the money um because they saw the broader opportunity they all came through the the 2020 lens of bitcoin is the asset and you know the michael saylor route and even me you know in the earlier part of 2020 a lot of people came in that and then like all of us they kind of go oh wow okay this is much bigger so you know i've started a fund of hedge funds um which is investing in crypto hedge funds to allow institutions another way into the market because they don't really want to buy just eth or bitcoin they want exposure to this two trillion dollar asset class is going to go to 200 trillion over the next 10 12 15 years whatever the number is so hedge funds are pretty good for that because their job is to manage the exposure and and to capture the to capture this big move so you know that's another way that it's coming in that people don't see um you know people it's not all about the bitcoin etf i don't think that's going to move the needle as much it'll be positive only in a positive market yeah yeah the the way you describe it's like it's not one giant wall of money and like most things it's not you know a single moment in time or it just goes from from not here to here it's like a it's more like a cascade of dominoes and every day you hear something it's a that's another domino that's tipping the next domino each one influences the next one and then you sort of once you tip it off it which has already happened it just takes a matter of time until the whole domino set runs through and it's all it's all yeah and i i'm seeing institutions using this weakness and not being frightened by it so that look this is fantastic opportunity i need to use this i get it the volatile space they they understand the people who are trying to put capital work understand but once the price starts going up again then you'll see the stampede um right you know you know if bitcoins at sixty five thousand or seventy thousand um then people say okay we've had a year-long correction it's now going up next phase is going to go to 106 right and they'll be in and they'll be in and they'll be a mad panic because they've all been doing the work over the last year and a half so they'll be like we've got to get in now got to get in there because if they don't they miss the out performance of their peers who've got it and what do you do with your east do you uh like let put it into defy or you're earning interest or your yields for you you put it in a you block it away you don't touch it do you remember that story of the house in spain once you win something you don't let somebody else take it away from you it's as simple as that because if i was staking i get what five percent yield or if i'm really clever and i mess around in deep defy i'm getting like a 15 yield and then i get rugged or something goes wrong or it's on an exchange gets hacked i just that's not the risk i want to take it's not worth it if my expected future return is you know 10x why take why get a 5 percent yield it's nonsensical so i just don't do it why yeah exactly basically why take a even if it's a small chance of multiplying the whole thing by zero uh you know that's that's not really the bet to make what i do is i take a very small percentage and i say this is my learning budget like because i you know basically if i had done that with bitcoin i would have just sort of sat on my bitcoin never touched anything else and i said well no actually it was quite useful to start playing in ethereum fairly early on and similarly now playing in d5 or nfts you take a learning budget and you say look this isn't the principle this isn't the one that's going to make all the money um but this is also where i get to you know continue to play the game and understand how this whole thing unfolds yeah and i've i've never been interested in yield even in financial markets all the old stuff is boring to me i'm i'm a i'm a guy who likes the capital game room yeah um and different people right there's a whole bunch of people who love yield it's called carry in financial markets they want to get carrie and others want to go for performance and they're two different equations and the carry guys do really really well until they blow up and the the guys like me tend to do mediocre mediocre and then make huge things they're just different ways of skinning the cat right so i spent my time because we don't have enough mental ability to focus on all the things in the space so i started going down a different rabbit hole i saw nfts i understood it mainly not all of it i understood that you know that the the macro view of what these things are and how big this is i wasn't really that interested in these communities give the uh here's my understanding of nfts because i think like you know the third most googled question is like what is an nft so so you know even people who like hear about it maybe even own a couple but they don't have a great frame um and i think you're very good at framing things and so give us your current frame of nfts so ethereum introduced a piece of magic in a smart contract a smart contract attached to a blockchain means that any contract in existence can now be attached to a blockchain and smart contracts allowed an algorithm or a calculation to be made automatically and verified on the chain so that could be your insurance contract for your house it could be any of the contracts i mean if you look around you almost everything that we have in life is a contract whether it's a spoken contract written me appearing on this together with you is a form of contract right so all of these things are contractual relationships that are everywhere what this was saying is we can record all of them and verify all of them okay so that's a really big concept beyond which most people understand and you can understand that okay if that's the case then a house can go on a blockchain yes because the deeds and then you don't need a notary and then you don't need lawyers there's all of this stuff most legal stuff can actually go on this and then the breakthrough is that okay we've got another thing that's going on in digital world which needs solving so this contract thing is a big deal we don't even know what this means yet right when we talk in 10 years time we'll go oh my god we didn't see that coming right so that's all happening and defy is that there's contractual obligations between borrowers and lenders it's all happening on chain but what the the average person is seeing is a different breakthrough that came out of this whole concept is in digital world everything that gets digitized goes to zero in value or cost everything right the price of data the price of everything is zero over time so that's a big problem if you're living in an increasingly digital world so how do you cement digital value is you have to introduce a system of scarcity and an nft allows a digital asset to have scarcity okay breakthrough now it could have come from the music industry it could have come from a number of different places it ended up being the art market okay and where you can say this stuff that was now was basically worthless online i mean getty had bought a bunch of image rights but to police it is really bloody hard as well so okay now we can create a one of one of value or a number and do that so that becomes the value of an nft the next part of an nft that you say okay well if we give a bunch of people these we can now identify a community and then these people can be like-minded communities because they coalesce around an idea which is this piece of art and this community which is bulldape yacht club or crypto punks so that becomes an incredibly value it's a membership to a club and it's your identification it's showing your rolex and you know it's all of that stupid identifying tribal stuff that humans do endlessly and always have and always will so that's going on and it allows us don't forget the internet had taken us from our towns villages families which is our social structure and thrown us into a big shouting room from people all around the world with different views right it's quite exhausting and we all wanted a place and what this is giving us is these little digital communities sovereign states villages towns cities where we can now operate with civically minded people within that and these tokens are the identifiers social tokens are the big thing they're they're not com they've only just started that's much bigger i think than even nfts are but let's start with this because this is a way of coalescing humans because humans like these kind of identification system of shared values that kind of stuff so nfts are a lot of things that's why they're so big and again that's just scratching the surface of what this is it it can also and will also be your digital identity online right you said something about music and i saw you tweeting about music and kind of the future of music royalties or like how anybody can become an a r you know uh person now describe what you kind of what you're thinking there because i think that'll be fascinating to a lot of people because music is one of the music like art is a great entry point for a lot of people whereas you know macro investing is deeper in correct so what is the world's most vibrant communities it's sports and it's culture that's fashion brands fashion brands more than any others it's music it's art it's these things right culture the big unlock here is if you can tokenize communities which is now the network owner is the same as the network user remember that facebook example right so now we've got pop star and token holder they're all now joined in the same network so now every incentivized to grow the value of that network you've now made culture and investment this was not possible you could take a cultural marker like an adidas sneaker but you weren't making money from adolescents you had to buy the shares and there was no connection between the consumers there was no network of adidas users now you're about to create networks amongst these people so what is the value of lvmh the fashion company right with all of its kind of mega brands that people are passionate about that are status symbols that humans like we've just talked about love these things so the same with music right we're all tribal in music we love different music we like different bands so to be part of that network i could now be a 16 year old kid and never have to have a job because i happen to get involved in the right i'm good at finding the next pop star well if i buy their social tokens or i invest in their song ip on nfts right i'm in business so what this is creating is a system i think is universal basic equity where culture is the investment they're not living in your world where they're building businesses and having to sell them and go through the entrepreneurs miserable journey um they don't have to do that they do a different way which is by using their human instincts about the communities they want to be part of and which networks are going to thrive and music is so powerful because it's human emotion um and people and it's it's a place in time i remember i'm a huge music fan and you know i identify music by its year what i was doing what it smelled like what i heard who i was hanging out with i mean everything right music is is one of those anchoring things so just the ability for musicians to now sell directly and have a direct relationship with their fans via social tokens and nfts is literally a game changer i mean there is no way on earth snoop dogg would have been able to sell something in small numbers and make 50 million dollars it's just not that big a star because record labels um because 80 of all the economics of selling music gets taken by middlemen so he'd have to sell a huge sum to do that or he'd have to go on tour and to make 50 million dollars that's a big exhausting tour you know he's no spring chicken anymore these things are you know it the music industry economics got destroyed by middlemen and it made the artist have to work harder take more risk with capital which is like have to go to massive tour i have to rent arenas and take these trucks this changes all of that dynamic and the metaverse changed it one stage further yeah like the artist had to create uh scarcity uh which was basically come to my concert there's only x tickets and that's how you can see me and then they also created status which was take photos of yourself at this concert post that online and that's a big part of the value that you're gonna get out of uh out of coming to this thing and then now we have a digital version of that which is and and so when all these people spoke to each other the fans they'd have to go on a facebook group and facebook monetizes them right right and if they want to go on tour they need to go on facebook and google and pay everybody but when you've got millions of token holders you've sold out 50 of your tour you've de-risked everything in minutes it's just it it stops you having to use middlemen all the time and uh you talked about two different things there's like the sort of like almost like the thousand true fans uh you know concept where basically an artist can drop something that's rare and exclusive or access to them or their commit their fan club and the it gives the whales you know something to go by that they would you know that they're they're actually willing to buy more than just a t-shirt uh now you give them something worth buying and so that's that's one thing that you could do with it but the other one is what's talking about buying a stream a part of the royalty right the part of the royalty stream and so that's where you know i remember i don't know i i remember finding macklemore the the artist when he had like you know whatever 2000 fans and i was like this guy's great and like if i had actually been able to bet that this guy's great and therefore be a part of his community he views me as a backer and true believer and i did i remember i kind of did a kickstarter with him or whatever he he pre-sold his album and i just gave him you know 30 bucks because yeah go use this to help make your album pay for some studio time but he didn't know me i didn't have a relationship but i had nothing to show for being right and and so now in this in a world like this where the 16 year old kid can say i think these guys are going to be great their price is cheap right now and i could buy you know some of their future um there's even more magic because that 16 year old kid because he's now financially incentivized to grow the network and make that song a success it doesn't make sense like 100 tick tock videos yeah exactly right and if you multiply that by all of the token holders of those ip rights they're all marketing free for you because they get paid in the upside it's genius i mean think about it like uh you know if you doubt what you just said just think about who's bitcoin's cmo who's who's the chief marketing officer there what's their ad budget and then how much publicity do they get who's their pr person how much publicity do they get how much chatter how much you know the ticker that's sitting on cnbc all day showing the bitcoin price right like all of this happened because you had a network of people incentivized to go shout to the world how great this thing is um you know and and people hate that about crypto oh there's just people shilling their thing yes and that does get annoying and you know you have to filter you know signal from noise but at the same time you have to appreciate what that does it turns everything every believer into uh every society is the same so if we think of everything is the same so let's assume bitcoin is a social token ethereum's a social token let's assume the us dollar's a social token and let's assume that religion is a social status token essentially so everybody goes the same way to increase the value of that thing so the us is like we've got military might and we're the greatest nation this is the free place and everybody can become a president right that's their narrative right every country has a different narrative to drive its value system for its network because they all require incoming capital to support the network including the church which couldn't have survived without incoming capital so they get all these people out to go and tell the word of god they then spread the dish around take money in it builds the church it grows the network they're all the same that's humorous the book sapiens kind of goes through this a lot about how humans need to self-organize yes well said i think that's that's a perfect zoom out uh we can kind of even even pause or stop there so uh where should people so follow you on twitter your role gmi uh you also have real vision and people should go sign up for that i mean look if people are interested in crypto really easy i've set up an entire free crypto um channel which is realvisioncrypto.com it's all the great and the good of the entire industry everybody every week i interview like who i think are the people i really want to pick the brains of and i go down all these journeys of social tokens and music and macro and all of this stuff so there's so much there and it's free real visioncrypto.com awesome all right thank you for coming on i appreciate it i really enjoyed it thank you [Music] you

they sold it for 900 million dollars in cash they don't really mention much about the company other than it was doing over 100 million in revenue but they what they don't mention is the guy who started it he bootstrapped it raised no outside money and owned 100 of it all the way through the sale all the way through the sale owned 100 of it a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars [Music] so let me tell you this quick story this was not a big headline i bet you didn't even see it so my friend uh i was in college at the time he's a little bit he's older than me so he was not in college he was probably in his 30s when i was 21. he started this company called linode did you see yesterday a company called linode was acquired for 900 million dollars in cash yeah who bought it it was um um is it called akamai oh come on yeah akkamai and so they bought it for not the art everything i'm going to say is is relatively public or it's you could piece it together in a bunch of different articles but basically they sold it for 900 million dollars in cash they don't really mention much about the company other than it was doing over 100 million in revenue but they what they don't mention is the guy who started it he bootstrapped it raised no outside money and owned 100 of it so his name was chris he uh i knew him when i was in college but not bad all the way through the sale all the way through the sale owned 100 of it um the company all right let me give you a little bit background i think when they sold they had like 300 ish employees but throughout their existence they had a relatively small staff like like they were doing like multiple millions of dollars in revenue per employee and it was it wasn't run like a family business but almost kind of like a family business based out of new jersey so basically this guy what does it do what is linode so i'm not in this space so excuse me but basically it's cl it's basically like the generic term is it's cloud computing so basically before amazon web services was around lynnode was there and i think some of their customers are like walmart so they host they help host you know applications and websites is the is the non-techie version uh that i'm that that i would say but what are you looking at the website what's it say i'm looking at the website basically says you know clutch your cloud bill and your cloud bill in half um it's basically like deploy linux servers in the cloud is the idea i think we used this by the way at my previous startup i remember seeing a bill for linode probably they're they're pretty popular but they because they were bootstrapped they couldn't quite keep up with like uh what's with the other competitor i think digitalocean which is like publicly traded now for multi-billions but basically in the early 2000s like 2005 or 2006 chris worked at this company called uh health stream which was uh it's not important it was a boring company and they he worked in like with computers with tech and he he grew up with an apple and loved tinkering with computers but what he noticed was that hosting was really expensive so he basically locked himself in his apartment uh from like 2002 to 2003 and like had a year's worth of savings and like locked himself in this apartment to code and build this website and he's like if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't so he launches it and right away it does good enough to pay his salary like single digit hundreds of thousands of dollars by year two because this was in early 2000's i don't even think amazon web services was around at this point and if it was it was like brand new and in fact this whole idea of cloud computing was brand new at healthstream chris was like look we've got to like spend all this money to buy servers what if we just like bought a bunch of servers and rented it out to people and that was like the idea because it's really hard for a small business who doesn't want to create a bunch of servers in their office to like actually host a website host applications things like that so that's where the idea came from and so it grew like a little bit year over year it wasn't growing like crazy for a long time um but it was doing okay chris kind of was always obsessed with automation so we did a really good job of automating a lot of the parts of the company and so they could hire relatively small staff you know like only like 10 or 15 people for the first handful of years even when it was getting close to making um over 10 million dollars a year still really small and basically the way it worked was i don't think he ever took out a loan i don't it was 100 self financing and so it would make a lot of money like these businesses can make uh on 10 million dollars in revenue can make 4 million in profit but in order to get to like 30 million in revenue you've got to go open up a warehouse or rent a warehouse and buy a bunch of servers and there was times where like my friends who worked there along with chris were literally like tinkering and assembling the servers and they did this for years and years and years and it and it grow it grew nicely and they did a really good job of like automating their customer service even for a long time chris was answering the customer service it grew really quietly he's not on twitter i don't if you google him you might find two pictures there's basically nothing out there about him um he's based out of philly and he bought a bank like uh like a physically a bank that was the home it was a bank turned house it was the house from the real world philly he bought it and they did an article about him how he was restoring this bank and leno it was leno's new office but he was taking a little bit of money off the table enough to buy a 10 million dollar bank um but owned the whole thing and just yesterday it was announced that it was sold for 900 million dollars in cash [Music] all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are how do you know this guy you said you knew him in college he was at your college or you just know while you were in college so when i was in college um i used to work for that show i told you american pickers and a guy came in and he was like i start internet companies and i was like oh really i like entrepreneurship that's cool will you like just let me hang out with you and he let me hang out with him and this guy his name was casey he became the he was in my wedding i became friends with him for years and years he was probably 35 when i was 21 or probably 10 years older than me and casey helped chris get linode off the ground and was the ceo for a decade or so gotcha uh wow and chris now at this point he's got this like huge collection of b w motorcycles so for motorcycle fans there's like motorcycle fans is like a sub category of like car enthusiasts and bmw vintage motorcycle fans is a sub category of that and chris owns i think one vintage bmw motorcycle from every single year ever produced and so we are all motorcycle nerds and we would geek out over that stuff and we would ride motorcycles together dude i need a white guy rich guy hobby this is what's holding me back i realize i need to start [ __ ] buying motorcycles from you know the 19 anything like 30 years ago and then i need to care about it and i need to learn how to restore it and like polish it or whatever i need to become tim allen from home improvement and have this like thing in my garage i'm always working on so i can just when i meet these guys i gotta have something to say you got that you have that something to say i'm like what am i gonna say like you know hey what's up bro you like the nba and it's like yeah me and 100 million other people there's nothing to get what about so rolex's or rare watches is one of those if you you had to spend thirty thousand dollars so hard to care about these things dude why do i i can't care about it i see it i just feel nothing i'm dead inside yeah it sucks man you got to get passionate about something outside of your house like you [ __ ] dork like i literally don't leave a house dude by the chef was like hey um we need more gas for the grill and i was like oh i was like oh grills need gas and i was like never grilled it i was like okay where do i get that and she's like you know just like next time i got a gas station i was like i don't really go to run errands she's like next time you got running errands just grab one i gotta really go run errands so like she's like been asking for two months just i finally got it and i was like so proud of myself and she's like so did you forget every time i was like no no i just don't really go out of my house unless it's like for very specific things like i'm taking my daughter to the playground i'm going you know to a restaurant and back home you need a little notice last night i went to home depot just to walk around and look like like in the evening i was like i've been at home all day i'm gonna go walk around home depot and see if like let's like let's check out like how many home depot workers do you know by first name number three what you could do if you go to home depot if you see a guy wearing carhartt and paint on their pants you don't even have to ask a worker you could just ask that guy who's there shopping that's why he'll take an hour to help you yeah like hey do you know where the wood screws are yeah i got you bro like i wouldn't even know what to ask i would just be like hey do you know what home and where home improvement goods are yeah man you need to get a hobby like i bet ben has one ben do you have ben has one because he's like a history buff another white which rich white guy hobby to have is like you know studying you know great men through history ben do you have any other you know very uh rapport building um rapport building things i don't know that i do but i don't know if you guys have seen this but mark andreessen has been going nuts of like reading history books and then tweeting about history so like i i feel like that's your hand yeah yeah like if i was with mark andreessen and i could not talk about tech we would be on a silent retreat it would be a silence by the way you got to keep your camera on because when i see you laugh i know we're onto something um anyway yeah you need to get a hobby rolex is a good one a lot of people like that if i see someone with a certain rolex i talk to them about it um cars is good but i have a feeling you don't even know how to drive so i would stay away from that i learned how to drive at age 19. so because i just wasn't interested yeah how your wife ever shocks me don't listen to music i only listen to sports radio my whole life so if somebody's like what songs do you like i'm just like oh you know i'm cool with whatever and they're like oh you're a [ __ ] weirdo huh oh my god that's great uh yeah you need to get a hobby dude but uh this is the story of lenode kind of a cool story right you never really talked about it no that's that's awesome [Music]

have you ever heard of ripple yeah but they they're shady right okay so ripple was this thing kind of like started pretty early on um and they had this like you know honestly not a bad idea they were like look uh you know the way the international banking system works today is off this thing called the swift standard ripple was like we're gonna be a bank to bank communication layer that uses blockchain right so they're like we're gonna use blockchain technology with a real use case which is banks sending money back forward to each other so that was their idea they got a bunch of funding from founders fund and others and they released this thing called xrp that's the name of their token all right so whatever nobody cares about that how it works nobody cares but the interesting part is xrp has like was worth a lot the founders of ripple became billionaires overnight before like that's the thing with crypto you can get rich before like this open down has 130 million before they have a product in ripple those guys became billionaires before banks ever used their product which is like a really [ __ ] up incentive and which is why sometimes [ __ ] doesn't actually get built in crypto because hey i already got the millions i could just run away i could just do a half-assed job it doesn't really matter at this point i went public on day one so ripple has a market cap right now of 94 is this right 94 billion dollars i think i'm reading this right 94 billion dollars something like that no no sorry 44 billion dollars 44 billion dollars right that's like that's like the market cap of like you know bank of america or some [ __ ] like that so obviously ripple's not actually valued at that but ripple had believers and they had early momentum they were very early in the crypto games they had a lot of pr and the ceo would go on cnbc and talk about how this is going to change the game so what happened in the crypto community people were kind of like poo pooing riptile they're like this is like centralized they they took way too much share for themselves they didn't give enough to users that's why these guys are billionaires their product kind of sucks and they're kind of shady whatever whatever that's the reputation was ripple anybody who was in the know encrypted crypto pretty much the general consensus was ripples full of [ __ ] and uh so my buddy had this idea he was like he was like i'm gonna do the first hostile takeover of a crypto network i was like what do you mean he goes look i can see every single person's wallet who owns ripple i was like okay that's kind of interesting there you go i go but you don't know their name and all that because i don't need their name i was like you don't have their email address he goes i don't need their email address i could just put something in their wallet and they'll wake up and they'll open their wallet and they'll see that they have something in it i was like okay he goes so i'm going to go out there i'm going to say xrp is stupid for these five reasons number one the founders took when you wait people anything you can include include a message in the transaction of the thing but like the way you do it is you first drop the token you tell people hey if you held ripple you got this token today and then you write your manifesto on your twitter or your website about what this is all about so you it's kind of like somebody put a 50 check in your wallet you're like what's this all about says go to this website to explain why you just got this 50 so that's how this that's how this marketing mechanism works so he was like i'm gonna put some money in there i'm gonna put my currency in all the ripple holders wallet and then i'm to tell them ripple is stupid for these five reasons the founders took too much this other problem this other prop the you know their the right the token is inflationary blah blah blah so i'm going to change all that we only take 10 we are not inflationary we do not do this sketchy [ __ ] blah blah blah my five-point plan of how to make ripple better um and we're we're calling it our own thing and here's the deal if you own ripple if you send your ripple to my wallet i will send you back five times your value of this if you're in the first for the first thousand people to do this then for the next ten thousand people that do this you're going to get four times your your ripple back and for the next ten thousand people you're going to get three times the ripple back so basically there's this urgency of like okay if these if this is gonna become the next ripple if i send my money in now i'm gonna get five i'm gonna get a 5x multiplier of my money and what he was gonna do was just he goes when you send it to this wallet we're gonna just dump it we're just gonna sell it and we're gonna put so much cell pressure we're going to crash the price of ripple so if you do it and then do they do this or so let me finish the story so he goes if you do this early you're going to get five times your amount and you're not gonna sit there holding the bag while we dump this thing it's like a prisoner dilemma game through it was so genius he's like he's like here's the math if you're if you're holding this thing you have to assess are other people going to take them up on this offer if they do then the ripple i'm holding is going to go down like crazy i'm going to go down like 5 to 10x if i jump if i jump ship i get a 5x multiplier on my money and i don't sit there holding the sinking ship and the game theory of this i think was gonna work so he has his plan and he starts and he starts uh and so he's like okay well he needs to be credible so he went to some very very wealthy people and he got about 50 million dollars lined up to do this hostile takeover and he was like he needed it to be like 200 million and so he's like i need to create this huge war chest so i can tell people look we have this much money so you this it's backed by something come on board and he's like dude he's like basically i'm going to this investor i'm saying if you give me 200 million dollars i'm going to take down this project i'm going to absorb all the value of this project that's currently worth 40 billion right so he's like it's a huge return for those investors and they and they also don't even believe in ripple so what was this high stakes [ __ ] james bond [ __ ] what the problem was one of the investors that he had went to for this leaked the plan to a journalist this guy uh dan primack or whatever he's like pretty famous journalist yeah from axios axios axios writes the story ahead of time he says hey there's somebody planning a hostile takeover xrp and here's how it's gonna work and xrp obviously the ripple team obviously sees this and they're like okay just in case they so they sold some amount of their ripple um to create a like few hundred million dollar buffer so that if somebody tried to do this and tried to tank the price they had enough liquidity to buy back the buy back the tokens and keep the price high so it kind of foiled his plan where the the only the only way it would have worked is if he had caught them by surprise and he could have done it in like a two-day period he could have tanked the price of ripple and created this competitor and had all the momentum on his side but because they had heads up they they could create enough liquidity and they could be able to like support their price before somebody could do this to them but how crazy is that dude this is like some barbarians at the gate [ __ ] like this is like 1980s like drexel um like hostile takeover where they like were like what's it called the green mailing have you ever read like these like 1980s finance i have i have the book barbarian i haven't read it yet uh yeah that's basically what they did like it was like it was like warfare and i was like this is some george soros [ __ ] you know the george soros broke the bank of england that's actually what he was telling me he goes this is some george soros [ __ ] i was like what do you mean he goes george soros broke the bank of england by doing something very similar to this and as he was explaining i was like there's no way this works he's like well you know it's risky but like if it works who who did it and so he didn't he didn't end up doing it um but i mean who who's an artist is it public uh i don't know if it's public but i'll tell you it's our friend who remember we went to dinner after our live show in miami it's our friend yeah okay okay yeah um that's crazy i thought uh if if dan would have wrote about it he would have named him yeah i think he didn't know the name or he i don't think he included the name of the thing but how [ __ ] nuts is that that's crazy if you get if that person could have pulled it off that's wild this is bavarians at the gate [ __ ] hostile takeover stuff yeah i love it [Music] you

you're successful in terms of career and traditional sense of successful you're a good friend you normally come on a lot but you just tweeted how you kind of like took off for all of August and you kind of bailed because you're kind of having a meltdown in which we all have had before like a digital overload meltdown uh and you just bailed right totally it was it was really uh it was bad I mean it's interesting to think about like I think this happened to everyone over covid like their life just shifted in a weird way um and my life just became crappy over covid which is weird because I had this amazing year like we took a business public we raised a big fund we got to work with all these interesting people we bought some great businesses I didn't die of covid like all these great things happened and yet I was totally miserable um and when I look at it when I kind of zoom out my old day I don't know if you guys you guys know but I live in Victoria Canada and I didn't even have an office so I actually like just working out of cafes I would just go to the same Cafe every day uh and I'd sit there with headphones on three or four of my friends would always work there so it's kind of like cheers there's always like interesting people to talk to and my day was just broken up into a bunch of chunks so any given day I wouldn't really be on the computer or in one place for more than an hour or two and my day went from that to sitting in a house on my computer all day on zoom and doing email and it just kind of made me miserable and so I I am you know when I look at like what I love about business I don't actually love you know doing business is great doing strategy coming up with ideas all that kind of stuff but the cool thing about business is you get to meet interesting people like business is just a hack right so like if you're interested in health you figure out like a health business you suddenly can meet all the most interesting people in that World um and I'm an extrovert so so anyway it just I was totally bummed and I started um you know going on Twitter a lot because I was craving socializing um I and I I went from like 20 000 followers to 170 000 followers so I got totally hooked into that and like a good day would be like I have a viral tweet or I go on your podcast or something something exciting happens a bad day would be I say something on Twitter I get dunked on I got misunderstood or it doesn't do well like what a ridiculous thing like I'd tweet and it would only get like 50 likes instead of 5 000 likes that would like throw my day off so I got to a point where I was just like Jesus Christ like this is totally ridiculous I'm thinking about Twitter constantly I'm checking Twitter constantly and on top of that I'm you know email uh you know checking stats stocks uh if I went to the bathroom without my phone I feel like I feel I feel like I was gonna freak out constantly listening to audiobooks constantly listening to podcasts no silence so I just like hit this weird Breaking Point August 1st where I woke up and I was like I'm not stoked to get her to bed I'm not depressed objectively everything is fine I'm like I'm just like I have like anhedania like I'm just not excited about anything so I just said [ __ ] it I'm just gonna what what what's that word you just said that was a good one yeah it means like an inability to feel pleasure right like nothing nothing would get me pumped nothing would give me a hit like you know you know when you like you're always you go on Netflix you're like scrolling endlessly for the perfect thing you just can't find it that's how my life felt and so I basically you know it's the middle August I live in British Columbia it's super beautiful and so I just said to my wife you know what I'm out for the next month let's just go off to our cabin we'll you know we'll go on some trips and I'm just gonna totally check out and I said a couple rules for myself I was like no phone no email no computer no podcasts uh no phone calls no social media no news I couldn't even read non-fiction business books right so it's pretty extreme and I put on my Apple watch which has you know cellular so I was like okay if there's an emergency I can get a phone call and I put my phone in a drawer and I just disappeared I went up to my cabin and hung out with my kids and honestly for the first like three or four days it felt like there was like a bug in my brain like I was just like so like like something I I itch I couldn't scratch like just so irritable as being a huge [ __ ] uh I was like slapping my pocket every five seconds to check stuff I'd be sitting on the beach with my kids and I'd constantly be like oh I need to text this to a friend I gotta I gotta take a photo of this right so it's really weird horrible withdrawal but then after like three or four days I was like holy crap like this is really interesting I started reading fiction books and just sitting for hours uh you know enjoying a sunset taking a silent Drive doing all this stuff and I think it's kind of like if you eat junk food all the time like you're drinking Coke and having burgers and stuff all the time and then you eat broccoli it doesn't taste that good your brain is primed for like these extreme flavors and then if you switch to broccoli you know you don't eat those things for a month then you eat broccoli broccoli is like orgasmic it's amazing and so anyway I did this for four weeks and I was feeling really good and I came back to life like I kind of reintroduced myself into society and started going out and working and stuff and it was really bizarre like I you know would listen to a song that was playing in a cafe and it'd be like the greatest song I've ever heard I'd read some random article and it would be like fascinating and I'd just be completely uh like just you know engage with it um and then problems I had to solve that would have pissed me off like seemed like no problem when I was excited to solve them and I was kind of going like man why why did that work like what was it about that and at the same time like around then I started listening to podcasts again and I listened to this podcast by Andrew huberman huberman lab which I'm sure you guys have listened to he's amazing yeah he's uh he's coming on the podcast oh amazing that's that's awesome so he did this deep dive on addiction and he did it with this woman Anna Lemke who's a Stanford addiction doctor and I was like oh this will be interesting it'll be about like heroin addiction or something and how they treat alcoholism so I'll start listening to it those other people who have those other bad problems it's fun it's fun to read about them totally I was like I was like oh this will be you know maybe philanthropic you know I can help fund the heroin Addiction Center in Victoria or something so anyway and as I listen I just go like oh my God like you know this is not this is universal like basically the chemical of dopamine the neurotransmitter is the thing that makes you feel craving and pleasure when you do things and it motivates you to do things and I realized you know basically like she said you know something along the lines of if you eat chocolate cake once a month it tastes amazing and you don't really crave it that much you don't really think about it that much it's very pleasurable if you eat it once a week you know it's still enjoyable but it sounds good and you start having cravings you start wanting chocolate cake if you eat it every day your brain literally craves it and you're in pain until you eat it and when you eat it it's not even that enjoyable it just makes the pain go away for a little bit and she Compares that to like heroin addiction or anything and so you know here we all are we're stimulating ourselves with social media 24 7. we're constantly taking these hits and the hits become less and less enjoyable and she talked about you know she's at Stanford so she's treating students and she talks about these kids that would come in and they're addicted to social media and video games and they have no motivation and so she said look I basically recommend a dopamine fast for four weeks they can't do any of that stuff they gotta go walk in silence Drive in silence have Quiet Moments not avoid those things and I realized that you know I'd basically done that uh for myself and that's why I felt better and I you know I was an addict it's crazy [Music] laughs [Music]

A podcast where we brainstorm new business ideas based on trends & opportunities we see in the market. Sometimes we have famous guests, and they do it with us.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
we talked about the background is we talked about chess.com last episode i tweeted about it because i was even more people loved that tweet dude that tweet had tons of engagement um it was good and the the summary of this is that i actually we underestimated it so chess.com gets around 200 million monthly uniques they have 60 million registered users they traffic has grown significantly if i had a guest they do at least 100 million in recurring revenue subscription revenue uh potentially is worth a billion dollars super fascinating company um go ahead what were you gonna say we were trying to hype it and we actually were under hyping even even though we were trying to hype it um and by the way the guy who started he's like an ex-stanford guy or the guy who owns it it has two i think stanford guys uh which is cool like you know they didn't go the same track probably as 95 of their classmates and they're gonna outperform 99 of them just by by doing something really simple that the world wanted so i started thinking about this because we talked about it you brought it up cool topic cool bit really cool business it really fits the what we call the new zealand type of business that andrew wilkinson kind of coined that that phrase which is it's this independent thing it has like a cult following it's profitable it's simple it's not nobody competes with it it's like new zealand nobody's going to war with with chess.com uh you know the biggest competitor i think it's called lie chess or something like that it's basically like an open source free you know like kind of like alternative and it's also doing extremely well and those are like the two uh but it seems like people kind of prefer chess.com so i started thinking okay what's the nextchest.com what are the others is there a whole slew of these guys because i think that's where we didn't talk about last time that we should have and so i wanted to double click in a little bit so i started and that was that's a really really hard question i've been thinking about it too i only came up with like dominoes i looked into solitaire websites they a lot of them crush uh but yeah that's a hard question to ask so i i spent 10 15 minutes on it but that was enough to tell me something very interesting so the first one that came to mind was because here's the characteristics that you need you need a game played by tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people that is not owned by a brand chess works checkers also works but the problem with checkers is it's so simple that it's not as like uh there's not as much depth to it therefore not as much of a like kind of like uh money made and passion around the sport uh sudoku was the second one that came to mind so i went to sudoku.com and sudoku.com it's just like chess.com it's like you you go to snooki.com and there's already a sudoku board waiting for you with clock going and it's like oh play here it is you don't need to download you don't need to sign up you don't need to do anything just play sudoku i love that then they you scroll down a little bit and you see like this advertisement for like a mobile app a mobile sudoku app so i clicked that i'm like i bet this app i bet this is an amazing distribution for this app app crushes so this company called easybrain behind it so the sudoku app that they have has 50 million downloads the uh on just google play forget about iphone that's just google that's just android um it's probably 100 million total lifetime downloads the website itself gets you know 10 to 20 million visitors a month uh so they're getting free tr basically free traffic to their mobile apps where they're able to monetize and easy brain basically makes they're like a mobile app developer that makes these apps they've had over 750 million downloads lifetime of these little simple number game apps starting with sudoku then like a remix of sudoku then like another number game if you like that one and they just cross promote them within each other i bet this company is crushing it they're based in europe and looks like i have information on on them i just found some interesting stuff when i googled them and went to the website there was something amazing about them that immediately stuck out and and just this quick google it i'm wrong but it is based in cyprus any time a company is based in cyprus it's like it's turns out these guys actually are uh from like the belarus they're actually from this area but they're based in cyprus so i'll i just googled it real quick so uh did you know that it was they were acquired um three months ago no i did not know this so that's okay that's the other piece i have their revenues i have their profit and i have the uh all their user numbers and i have can i guess i'm going to be totally wrong but i i like to guess by the way little tip always guess before you hear any number that's how you get good at knowing numbers because you guess and then when you're wrong your brain remembers that and you start to hone that gut instinct okay so here's here's my guess okay well uh how much were they what what's their revenue i'm gonna guess that their revenue was 400 million dollars a year okay what's their um profit 90 million dollars a year pretty good um all right how much were they required for i'm gonna guess that they're required for 852 million dollars okay and how many um how many daily active users do they have across their 15 games i'm going to say they have 25 million dau okay so you didn't do you didn't do horrible okay so easy brain was acquired uh last this most recent february uh they were uh acquired for 640 million dollars in stock and up to 120 million dollars of additional consideration if they hit it so 640 yeah what is that that isn't that exactly 850 no what's six uh what 640 plus 100 is 740 plus 25 is so great job you guessed 8.50 great job you're almost there um they their revenue is uh in 2020 revenues were 210 million dollars okay so you were off there by half you guessed 400 million but their profit was 70 million you guessed 90. right pretty good um they've had 750 installs over the course of their the lifetime of all their other things all their games they have uh 15 live games with 12 million daily active users you guessed 25 million okay not bad not bad um what a company so okay so that was the first one i thought of and by the way i think that there's other versions of that like you know i don't know go look at like you know sudokuonline.com i don't know what's that like you know all the things people are gonna google search if you can get the top level domain for those that's really interesting um so then i started looking at some others poker.com so i went to poker.com and poker.com is like kind of like this crappy like just describe what you're looking at when you go to it let me look at this but you can't this is an actual poker right you're not betting it's not even a as you can't play there it's just like reviews here's it it's like an affiliate site so it's like oh here's a place to play poker here's where you go because they get big kickbacks for basically sending a player to poker stars or wherever if they deposit and so this is horrible website um crappy kind of like affiliate reviews site dude you could do so much more with this website like if somebody was like dude i'm gonna i have a if you have a mobile poker app that's like good i would pay like ungodly amounts of money for poker.com i think that that's a and they also if you like do their traffic search see what they get it's nothing so they should be getting a lot more traffic having poker.com um okay so then there's some other ones crosswordpuzzle.com crossword.com go to this like they don't even like crossroads.com or something doesn't even like render it's like a there's like fun on the screen yeah like what's going on here because crossword is the other game that's like sudoku it's like chess that people played religiously and they love we talked about how how much the new york times makes off their mini crossword game the number was uh 90 million dollars in subscription revenue from crossword puzzles for the new york times so so i am surprised at crossword puzzle across the puzzles.com crossword.com i can't believe that these sites are not being like leveraged so i was very surprised to see this and uh yeah this follow up from this so you go to crosswoodpuzzle.com it says please email suggestions to dkw999 yahoo.com right so i i emailed the guy so so so you see this the website is basically like a white page with a bunch of text and it's basically just the very bottom things the very bottom it says this dome note this domain is not for sale please do not inquire about purchasing it all emails from anonymous are unknown companies asking me a price will be ignored sorry last updated july 2007 right so i emailed this guy i was like hey uh saw your website um [Music] like i think it's awesome that you're not trying to sell this but i'm curious like why aren't you trying to sell this and uh what's your you know what do you want this to be why do you believe like why do you believe that it should be done this way you know i'm just super curious like what's your thought problem so we'll see if he replies [Music] you

so let me explain to you guys um a little bit about how i started my events and what i would what i would do if i was starting again which is basically if i was starting again i would do mostly the same stuff but i think everyone in the next if you're listening if you're willing to spend eight weeks working 40 hours a week dedicated to this i think you could make at least 100 000 profit starting probably in september because that's when uh i think events conferences are going to be okay so anyway um the the biggest thing that you have to do here is your email list is the most important thing so the hustlecon.com i launched that website on june 6th okay and within just a few weeks we were averaging around a thousand or 2000 unique visitors a day and the email list jumped from about 200 people to about 2 500 people in seven weeks keep in mind at the time i didn't even have a twitter so there was no twitter i mean there was but i didn't use it and so what i would do is hustlecon.com was basically a landing page where it explained what the event is and then you'd enter your email and that was called the front door the side doors were all these blog posts so i would write two to three blog posts a week on each speaker i would post that on hacker news people would come to the website via the side door only five percent of them would say this is interesting what's this website and they would click the home page and i would collect their email there and then once i collected their email i would send them a variety of other blog posts that i'd written and at the end of each blog post that i sent them it would say ps this person is speaking at hustlecon on uh august 1st in september you can get a ticket right now for 10 off if you buy the next 12 hours right by the way the next 12 hours that code was working all the time it was always the next 12 hours the countdown clock there's a simple plug-in that you could buy and it just starts and shows up so sorry guys i'm sure everyone knows this now but i don't even shopify wasn't popular at that point so um not everyone had that technology but that's what we did pretty easy pretty basic and in doing that i'll give an example of the blog post because i remember like i remember vividly the one you did about i cracked um which you kind of did like as infographic i remember the one of pandora so i would do but explain what yeah explain what you did and like also these were speakers so you got speakers to agree legit speakers to agree before you even had an audience or anything yes which is the second thing i'm going to talk about is how to land a speaker but the the blog post i basically would just use forbes business insider all these places and just write a biography on the person but i would do it in an interesting way and eventually what happened is we would create infographics so um i had john who worked there and i would say um john um here's the here's the bulleted points of their life turn it into an infographic please and that's what we did we had infographics it could have been a blog post which is what i used to do we this time we made infographics and it worked quite well and it was basically i read the book made to stick and i just copied that so i took uh information about their company and i made it really easy to understand so for example pandora streams this amount of music per hour which is the equivalent of x y and z uh they the reason why they were able to do that is they were one of the first people to launch on the iphone um and then i like i just tell that story pretty simple i thought it was simple very effective now that's how we got our initial sales now the thing about sales for events it's incredibly stressful the reason it's stressful is typically 20 of your sales come in the first five to seven days and then 20 sometimes more 30 of your sales comes in the last like four or five days which means that dead time so you you won't you have to get you got to kick ass right out of the right out of the gate so your first launch series you need to kick ass your first email launch series you need to do really well then there's a fair bit of dead time and it feels we're failing we're failing we're failing and then the last 10 days or so you get a wave of sales and it all comes down to the last minute and it is incredibly nerve-wracking and anything can ruin it for example a pandemic or if there was a terrorist attack if there was um um um bad weather as simple as bad weather you're and so you've been working for seven weeks and now eventually in our case a whole year on this event and you're screwed so it's very stressful but the way that you can actually make more money and this is a something that i didn't learn until later on for the tickets you actually want to charge higher than you than you can so let's say you want to make a hundred thousand dollars and you want to get a thousand people to pay you 100 you always charge 250 and then you give more you give discounts in order to get to 100 average sale price and so you want in my opinion you want to be very generous with discounts but you want to charge a lot of money so it anchors it at a high at a high value yeah correct and one other thing that you want to do is you want to run this like an ecom site so for an ecomp site you say well i want to make 100 grand this month therefore i need to get um um you know a hundred thousand people to my uh a hundred thousand high quality people on my website of which three percent are going to convert i know three percent are going to convert because i'm constantly tinkering with my landing page the average sale value is going to be x dollars therefore this is how you do it now i just need to get people to my website that's what a lot of conference people don't do that's what you should do and it works quite well um and then finally time is one of the best ways to create sales so you have to give discounts early on and at the end and you and the goal is you want to have five three to five tiers of pricing so you want to have early early bird and then early bird and then middle bird and then you're late okay seriously this is the last reminder late like you because if you actually look so can you actually see um if you log into that doc i actually put a chart of my very first event uh from july of 24. you're gonna see big spikes every single one of those big spikes was a new ticket tier ending and there's a direct correlation between the amount of revenue that i made that day and the amount of like the tier ending and um me sending an email blast reminding people and i would email some two or three times a day in order to remind them wow [Music] you

yeah we have the big spectacle we have the screens we have the thing when we hit our donation goal there's going to be the big like fireworks or whatever for doing the mo that's the moment so the difference between us and everybody else is that we also care about the moments between the moments [Music] all right sean do me a favor go to our document and look at the video that i posted to the instagram to the instagram link so i found this this weekend i was sitting in the bath just watch this right before the pond i watch this yeah does that okay so i was sitting in the bath just chilling watching instagram you ever sit in the bath you're like bad sundays you just kind of sit for a few minutes i have kids dude my bath is very different than yours now well that's true so i just it was sunday bath just chilling going through instagram and i got this video of this lady uh it's a woman from germany i think she's german and uh a guy and they're running together on a 200-meter race at the paralympics she's blind and he's the guide runner and they win the race and they start hugging and she's all crying is that the coolest video you've seen today or what this i didn't actually understand what was happening it just looks like they're racing against each other uh i wouldn't have even known what this was if you hadn't said anything so she's blind and she's must not be fully blind and what they do in the paralympics is she's like if you're if you're not yeah they put a blindfold on everyone because some people might be legally blind and they could still kinda see a little bit and so what they do is they put this blindfold on everyone and then these women are are like really fast women so like another woman can't be their guide because they're just you know faster men who could keep up and so it's they're all teamed up with a guy who helps their foot into the blocks and puts their hand in the right place and then has to run alongside them stride for stride and they'll say like all right you're in second now or like you're in first like all right we're on the straightaway like pretty cool stuff and it seems really rewarding i'm gonna do this so i've contacted um a track coach you saw this video you got emotional you know the bath bomb started hitting and uh i started getting misty and you just decided this is what i'm born to do i'm gonna be a guide runner or you want somebody to guide you which one are you trying to do so uh so here's the deal i am now i'm still fast enough that i am as fast as some of these blind women i'm not as fast as the blind men but i can keep up with the women a little bit and i probably have five more years where i can keep up with them and so i can't i'm not good enough to go to the olympics i never was and particularly now as i get older i'm not good enough this is my shot this is my way to get into the olympics is to be a guide runner for the for a blind lady this somebody called you out on twitter for this they go he did it the perfect sam backhanded compliment because you were like backhand comfortable like myself yeah you kind of yourself i don't know the whole sport because you were like i'm not as fast as i used to be and i'm still fast enough with this to keep up with an elite blind woman that wasn't my point i'm just saying like it's just a fact they're like this lady she read 23 seconds i can run 23 right now i'm not there's no this is like awesome i think it's awesome i think it'd be way more fun i'm not like making fun of these people you have to be a good person to do this at the paralympics you're not a good enough person dude we were too rough around the edges yeah you're going to get canceled before the race you're going to say i tip like 50 when i go out to eat i'm a great guy yeah that's what you got to ask yourself where's that coming from what what are you trying to cover up with these 50 tips i'm a good dude man i'm glad you could do this i'm glad you brought up the olympics so um probably don't even know this the winter olympics are going on right now half the people learned that like yesterday they're going on right now the ratings are like the lowest it's ever been all right and then i forgot to tell you this but this is the most important thing uh i can't believe we didn't talk about this earlier to be honest with you because if you're listening to this and you like what you're hearing right now and you haven't gone and subscribed to the my first million podcast wherever you get your podcast then that's the thing you've got to do there's nothing more important than doing that right now and don't do it because i said to do it do it because you want to do it do it because that's who you are [Music] uh winter olympics in general are like you know less popular than the normal olympics um some people are super into it my buddy trevor uh he's my roommate he loves the olympics like the olympics would come around he's like clear the schedule 24 7. i'm just watching whatever's on and like i kind of got into it with him i do that too by the way before the summer no no no no summer winters are real exactly exactly so um you should say that when you're in the winter olympics uh guide bobsled team just be like i can't wait to do this for a real sport um so so i was so i i was watching the super bowl then like after the super bowl just like immediately auto cut to the winter olympics and um and i was watching somebody do like the toboggan and i just thought of a very controversial take this take was too spicy for twitter i didn't even dare put it on twitter because i was like i'm gonna get so much heat for this the toboggan is the person who lays on the sled i thought that was the luge okay maybe i maybe it was a bobsled maybe it was a luge maybe it's a different way was it like one person it was one person they were running different pushing that yeah the difference is is that one they go face first and one they go like on their bet on their back on their butt legs first so completely irrelevant to what i'm saying the yes one of those was happening and then i thought so our buddy nick tweeted this out during the super bowl because nick likes to just like stare the pot on twitter that's like his character on twitter and he was like watching sports are a complete waste of time you know what i'm doing right now i'm working on my business that's how you get ahead when everybody's zigging you zag he's doing something earlier that day he was texting us photos of him partying so yeah dude he's parties all the time like this guy's not like nick lim's like the most charmed life he's like oh you know i'm tired of playing golf so i'm going to now relax right like guy's got like i guess self storage is a pretty hands-off business so you know he's got a lot of time on his hands but he likes to tweet stuff that's pop and uh so people started you know fighting about it here's my take that's kind of like that that i just didn't want to get into it on twitter the olympics are an example of how to waste your life so here's here's the spicy take so i i'll explain i i understand that's harsh but uh but here's here's the take i once was uh listening to an interview with this guy max levchin max leviton created paypal which is a pretty important like internet invention ability to send money to each other on the internet so he creates paypal paypal becomes a huge success and for his next act do you remember the company that he started next it was called slide i think slide and uh describe what slide did for the people it was advertising technology or games i forget but it didn't know it was like well many many little mini apps on top of myspace and facebook so it'd be like that's right yeah like you want to put up a slideshow of like photos with some music on it you slide you want to throw sheep at your friend you slide slide makes all these apps that are like you know poke your friend oh we created an app called double poke it's better than that they made money through ads i think it was so it was ultimately almost like it was just like a way to get lots of impressions and then ultimately the whole thing lost money didn't make any money they ended up selling to google mostly because of max i think i think it was google that bought them um so they whatever it didn't it ended up working but the point was they go max you did paypal then you had slide which which had like explosive growth on top of these really fast growing social networks but ultimately kind of fills it out you know like what have you learned he said one thing that like has stuck with me it stuck with me which means i must have been guilty of it many times for this to stick with me this this hard he goes well here's what i learned with slide you can spend be careful because you could spend your whole life optimizing for nothing and um and he's like you could optimize anything to the to the infinity degree he's like so we come out with super poke or whatever their apps were at the time like you know super poke it's like better than a poke and then all of a sudden i have these brilliant engineers from stanford and whoever else and their job every day was to increase the poke per user ratio by this much to get clicks up to get you know to earn an extra three cents per click and ultimately we spent years just optimizing the viral coefficient of how i can get super potential right across my space it's like and his message was be careful because it doesn't matter how smart you are anything can be optimized to like infinity so pick wisely like you know the the same brain power and energy went into building paypal that went into building these silly apps on slide and i've been like you know that's been my thing my my sort of mountain to die on which is like project your question is everything but you are so wrong but this is the olympics this is the olympics this person who's who's running and then diving into this toboggan they basically to me they got tricked by society society basically told them hey you know what devote your whole life give up everything basically to train every day to become the best in the world at this arbitrary thing that we've made fun of you're not are you gonna make a lot of money from it no are you going to uh you know develop these like you know amazing other aspects of your personality in your life no you're gonna go super single-minded to turn yourself into a human weapon of doing this one random thing sliding your body in a tube down this chute for 40 seconds and your job is to get it from 40 seconds to you know to 39.98 seconds that is your life and then hey when it's over uh good luck just go figure out the rest of life now that you're you've peaked at age 26 and then you know go go ahead and figure the rest of life out so i think the olympics are an example of optimizing your life on the dumbest [ __ ] okay go all right i'm going to make an argument to say why you are entirely incorrect and i've got wonderful examples these correct oh i thought you were going to tell me yeah here's why sports represents so much more there's only basically two things that transcend language religion and culture it's basically art and sports i think those are the only two things maybe family but that's about it and so what sports represents is so much more than just optimizing the the seconds not only is it about like the um being disciplined and all that and how those are good qualities but it's it's about culture so think about this in the 19th uh i think it was 33 olympics or 32 olympics in berlin it was in it was in uh berlin and and hitler was in the stands doing a zeke hell and they were still getting there at that point they just started like you know messing around with the jews and getting rid of them jesse owens wins the long jump in 100 meter dash when hitler's saying like well the aryan race is the best race and anything you know outside of that is inferior and jesse owens sticks it to him another example is this woman named kathryn switzer you probably don't know who she is but have you ever seen this famous picture of this woman running a marathon and there's a priest pushing her out of the road so okay so her name is catherine switzer look it up so look up uh marathon woman push and you'll see this famous picture so for a long time women were not allowed to run marathons so there was no such thing as first of all women weren't even in uh the olympics and they thought that like oh women are just too weak to run and this woman came along and uh i don't remember what year it was i think it was the 70s and she starts running this marathon and there's this famous picture of this guy pushing around the street and that like signals to all women like no f this you could do it all right you got this and then you got guys like this guy who you can't see all the way his name's steve prefontaine steve prefontaine he ran in the 1980s uh 1972 olympics i believe in munich uh munich and what happened at that olympics was basically a bunch of terrorists took over and they killed a bunch of israeli athletes have you heard about this they took over this helicopter they kidnapped these israeli athletes these wrestlers they threw them in the helicopter the israeli army tried to like capture them and it blew up in it and it ruined the whole olympics and you know what they said the next day they go f this we gotta go compete we this is what we have to do we gotta compete we gotta bring this together and see pre-fontaine this guy who's on my wall he was at the olympics and he said these amazing quotes like to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift he eventually inspired this guy phil knight and bill bowerman to go start a company that they called nike and steve prefontaine was their first athlete and this is all because of the olympics and this is all because of sport and the olympics happens just every four years that is one way to like bring a beginning and an end to the last trailing four years of training and preparing a discipline and it accumulates in this thing this is incredibly essential it represents race relations women's rights [ __ ] go look at the um every year at the olympics they do the the procession where your country comes in they've got this thing called um i forget what they call it but it's for people who are going through war and who don't have a country so for example i believe in london i think it was like sudan or or the congo republic i forget one of those countries was not considered a country by like they're going through civil war and so they just said hey we're just going to create a refugee country you now have your own country or when taiwan and hong kong are going through their issues it's a huge deal that for the olympics that they announced well are they going to have their own country or are they not or uh recently a kenyan swimmer was in the first ever summer olympic swimming this is beyond sports this is a really big deal that's my plea that's why i think this is actually awesome tell me how you really feel that was good right that was good um just tell me one thing who's the who's the who's the greatest um luge uh competitor of all time you just name them um everything that i just said was only for these summer olympics the winter olympics are fake if you need a judge on your sport it's probably not that real of a sport that's why track and field swimming and all those like races that's why they're like real sports yeah so everything i said no no that it's only every four years i'm mostly just messing around also i like i like watching the olympics in general i think it's cool obviously i think it's cool if people like excel and things that's awesome my point is i think that there's like uh you know like for example if my kid was like had the potential if you told me right now hey your kid has the potential to be the greatest you know like at uh whatever um the greatest third person in the bobsled in uh in the country but here's what you have to do every day every weekend for the you know the the next 20 years of their life is going to go into optimizing their body and mind to be able to do this which essentially is what goes into like becoming an olympian right you're trying to become the best in the world at an arbitrary game that was made up and you have to sacrifice a huge amount of your life and focus and attention and energy and talents you decide to invest into this and the thing you get out is character building life lessons um and the other thing you get from the boy scouts you know potentially a moment of fame when if you want if you actually did achieve the thing and you have the you know sort of the the the knowing inside your heart that that this was this was good so like you know would i rather be sp you know steve prefontaine this you know this good looking mustache runner guy or would i rather have been phil knight i'd rather be phil knight i think actually he's the perfect example what did preventane get out of you know nike nothing and so he actually uh where's he now right he died three years into finding the company from a drinking driving accident so yeah you're right okay joke's not so funny now it didn't work out wait so he was actually a co-founder of nike or he just inspired them um he he he was he was in their crew and he was their first sponsored athlete and like their fifth or tenth employee or something like that and um if you ask phil knight who you know what who's nike's mentor or sorry who's nike's mascot they'll say it's prefontaine yeah so anyways my point is i think that there's a lot of things that are fun and they're best done as hobbies versus trying to become the best in the world at it right uh i could play you know call of duty and have a bunch of fun with my friends um i can even play you know the competitive side of things just because i like to scratch that itch and i play a couple hours a week but once i try to become the best in the world at it the level of sort of sacrifice and over indexing on that thing and hey you could do it you could over index on anything you could try to become the fastest typer in the world you could try to become the best photographer of brown leafs in the world and you know like you could do all those things so choose carefully choose which one you want what you really want to go into it's like people who dedicate their lives to be an average d3 basketball player it's like it could work you could you could you could go to the nba but like odds are the papers or the writings on the on the wall like it's probably not going to happen so maybe you should actually like study a real major instead of basket weaving or communications right and if you enjoy it fantastic if you're enjoying every step of the way fantastic but a lot of things in my experience are most enjoyable when done as hobbies versus when done with the competitive pursuit of becoming the absolute best in the world at it uh are the guy used to work out of his his dojo he used to tell me that i was like oh yeah i really like this so i might start a business around it he goes oh yeah dave grossbot he goes easiest way to [ __ ] up a hobby is turn it into a job and i remember just hearing that being like that's interesting i actually never really thought about that yeah actually there are some things that are really fun as hobbies that become really unfun as jobs right it's like working at a cinnabon right it's like oh yeah i love eating cinnabon working at a cinnabon smelling cinnabon eating free cinnabon anytime you want now it's not so funny that's how i feel about business sometimes like whenever i i go to my friend nick ray always hosts these meet up these meetups and i'm miss frowned so i go and he's like say your name and what you do for work and i'm like i don't want to say what i do i'm sick of talking about work that's all i ever talk about is business like i don't want to talk about that [ __ ] ever again right so i i feel ya all right let's do some other stuff um [Music] okay i don't know where we want to go we can go ideas or we can just shoot shots that's all we have i think well i have a couple things i didn't actually put them on this list yet but uh okay so i'll give you a quick idea um i was in a pitch meeting so this founder was pitching me his company and uh he was just like screen sharing so he's showing me a product demo and it was like a it's like a data analytics uh tool and he was like yeah so like check this out if i go to excel and then he like he just opens up the browser i've never seen this before he goes he just opened up the browser he goes sheets dot new hi enter and then it opened up a google sheet like a blank spreadsheet and i go i go whoa what's just what was that and he goes oh yeah he goes i'll show you later because he was because i was he was so annoyed with me just going on tangents about every random thing he was doing like he wanted to show me his product not the fact that you could type sheets.new and save myself like i [ __ ] google i google google drive then i get to drive then i click new then i go down the menu then i find spreadsheet then i click new spreadsheet then i get to a sheet it's like this like annoying thing i do six times a day and um and so just seeing this was like well that's awesome and it reminded me that there's a whole company out there called go links have you ever heard of go links no what is that so so i saw this in a um or when i was working at twitch the kind of like whoever the i don't even know it was job title like vp of everything that kind of that number two guy at twitch um my boss this guy dan he was like he's like god we have so many documents in this company and now i just have bookmarks and tabs just with like all these docs open at all times in this company he's like and if i ever want to look up like oh the annual plan it takes me like five minutes every time i want to find it because i don't know why we don't just use go links and what go links does is it lets you set up a thing that's like go dot annual plan or like you know you could just basically type in like a human readable link and you could anchor it to any doc and so let's say you know you that's anchored to the 2021 doc oh now it's 2022. cool we just swapped the link out we just already said we like we can still always type go slash you know uh annual plan or go slash plan and go slash pan will now take us to the 2022 doc and i saw this i was like wow this is actually so useful to just be able to quickly find and like revoke access properly to to different documents and so um so i really like this most people haven't heard of this and i think it's a very expensive tool i think it's like a pretty like enterprising tool i see at the top here they raised a 27 million 27 million series a okay so doing pretty well obviously so i think somebody could build this is like a very simple product i think somebody could build a go links for like the startup level world more i got you bro indie hackers i just invested in one oh really what is it yes so i told you about it too i swear i i told you about it uh it's called nera and i'm in this too i mean this too oh i i so that's the same thing right so this is this is slightly different i don't think they do the the shortcuts to the links maybe this is a feature they should add what they are doing what mira is doing is we all companies have all these docs and then people get fired or they move teams or whatever but people still have access it's like oh yeah i still got this link it just opens up the like the numbers for the for the company or like yeah this contractor we hired still has access to all of our files but like who the heck can go audit and keep up and scrub the access for this thing that's like it's like a very big problem like your company's most sensitive data is all in the cloud and then the cloud like access is shared amongst like so many people and there's no central place to see who sees what and so nira's building that they're building the who has access to what yeah but i think the link thing is a feature maybe yeah maybe it is a feature i'm saying i think it's a feature that can be standalone because adopting something like nero is like something that's going to go through my like you know chief security officer type of thing like this is going to go through our cio or cso whereas this go links thing is something that like you know me and my one person who i work with like we're both just irritated with these super long ugly google docs links that like um you know like we can't find anything it takes forever to find stuff they they they have a free plan near it does no go links oh go leagues does yeah yes i think yeah i don't know at one point they they do this but i don't know why this is not more popular this is like like a real problem and then this also just got me thinking like what else is like this what are the other problems that are like these like i call them paper cut companies so um you know death by a thousand paper cuts so like what's a thing that's irritating but you do it so often that it's just a constant paper cut that just annoys you screenshots is another one that like sharing screenshots was one that was a big paper cut uh i invested in this company called bubbles that tries to make that better loom makes it work better i remember bubbles is it working uh i don't know i've caught up with them in a little while i know it was working initially they raised much money uh from that but i feel like it hasn't taken over like you know the loom market yet but maybe it's going into a different market i'm not dude the screen the screenshot one's a good idea also the copy and paste the copy and paste i've been thinking for years how can i optimize a copy better clipboard yes a better clipboard i've been thinking about that for a long time um it's been that's always an interesting thing to me is is is the clipboard that's really interesting but the the problem with these types of products is you have to truly be inventive i don't particularly have that muscle to like be that creative so people who invent things like this or like even like um what's that guy named howie who's got the huge company uh air table air table uh creating something like air table which is basically kind of like excel but different and better or even creating like a notion i don't like these people kind of are geniuses who can like come up with like these weird product features and like they just know that like if you hover your mouse over this it needs like that they're so complicated they're so complicated it's pretty amazing yeah they um they're big on details and i'll tell you the the best thing i heard about details like this i'm i'm not detail-oriented like if if this camera showed my desk you would see like yeah i'm obviously not organized or detail-oriented like everything is sloppy even my camera right now is actually slightly crooked but i just don't care i just don't care about details and pretty much anything i do so that's why you're talking like your neck a little bit yeah that's why i often do this i end every podcast with a crick um but you know like i'm not a sweat the details person but i remember the first time i used slack i used slack really early on it was like in beta i should have invested in it i just wasn't an investor back then i didn't think about it that way but i used it and i remember the first thing one thing i did was i was telling our designer hey uh yeah here's the color for like our logo or whatever uh or they sent it to me and they just sent the hex code so like you know heck you know like pound cff or you know 373 and it just create it turned it into a small tiny color swatch and i remember thinking why the [ __ ] did they do that like what level of care went into caring that the hex code would just auto format with a little swatch next to it that's what i mean nobody would do that unless you were like a real product designer who sweat the details who used this product all the time and just dedicated yourself to like any time you could just scratch your own itch and irritate you know like remove one paper cut from your own user experience you're going to do it and so this is why also working on your own products working on products that you want to be the user of helps because you'll get so annoyed at the paper cuts you'll just get rid of them yourself all right let me give you an example of another one so i'm only bringing this up because of colors so i've told you about this company called wgsn they make 90 million dollars a year and they tell it's a it's like an info product all about colors i don't want to talk about that but so ben go to so it's called coolers dot co c o o l like cool o r s dot co coolers dot co so basically whenever i'm creating a new product or a new website you have to pick like a good color scheme and like separate this is badass dude it's so good so basically let's say that like for me mostly i'm just like a black and white guy i want the text to be black i want the background to be white but then you still need like some radiant of gray and then you want the links to be some like gradient of red what goes good with that what goes good with this color of blue and so what you could do is look at the very bottom where it says um when you see the lock button when you see so basically it shows you five colors you can randomly select one or you can tell it which one you want and let's say you like the blue you click lock on that and then it shows you four more that fit that then you click lock on the next one and it shows you three more that fit that is this golden is this website amazing or what that's amazing that is so good and i love it when i i've been going this for years and years and years at first it started out just like this tiny little project now it gets like five million monthly uniques according to similar web and it's got a pro version it's got all these amazing versions so look yeah it gets five million monthly uh monthly uniques it's got a figma plugin a chrome extension it's got all this amazing stuff and they have a pro version that i actually don't know what you get with the pro version but how neat is this this is a paper cut problem that actually i bet has turned into a business that makes many many many millions of dollars a year and this is the type of company that you could own for like 30 years and it probably would make pretty consistent seven figure profit every single year yeah how does this one make money does it uh charge renee so they do a couple things if you look on the top you'll notice that they have a squarespace ad so they have it has ads and then they they have a pro version so it's only it's built 36 a year which is stupid and you get uh lots of different um features um but i would charge like way more because you already know this company has like a basically what you would do is if i own this i log on i look at all the email addresses i've ever collect i do like a control find uber adobe whatever like companies that have bought it and i go and upsell them on some like crazy high thing right can i tell you um the philosophy again i'm not detail-oriented but here's a philosophy i heard that i was like oh this explains why some things when i was on some products some experiences some hotels when i go into them i'm like this just feels good what's going on here i can't even put my finger on what feels good about it i was talking to scott harrison he's the founder of charity water and charity water puts on dope events everything they do is dope so like i think when he was starting it he heard some quote that was like um isn't it sad that charity is marketed with less um less like um less design and style than um you know the the 73rd brand of toothpaste it's like yeah it's like true it's like you know like a crest or like you know whatever right aqua whatever it's called aquafresh you know like the they put more design and marketing and energy into like how that looks and feels and the colors and the the typeface and all that than a charity that's saving children would put into their brand so he decided early on all right i'm going to build an epic charity brand because i think it's going to matter i think people are going to donate more if we come across if we do better marketing like we can't just like say that that's only for rich companies and we're this poor nonprofit that always has to look crappy and so he does he he's a photographer he takes photos they put on epic events so at their events if you ever go to one of their events it just flows it's just nice like every everything's just club promoter right he was a former club promoter so he gets it and he goes my he i go i go dude what what is it about your events i was like because you have the big spectacle like at any event like every time he doesn't mma trust up it from the year before so there's always like this like spectacle where it's like there's 10 000 screens and on every screen there's one person from one village that we are gonna fund tonight it's like okay that's the spectacle and that's always cool but i was like dude it's the other stuff that like i don't know why it just feels different what is it he goes my wife victoria she's the brains behind this she has a phrase for this she goes um all the magic is in the moments between the moments i know what she goes it's the moments between the moments and i was like what's that mean he goes yeah we have the big spectacle we have the screens we have the thing when we hit our donation goal there's going to be the big like fireworks or whatever for doing the mo that's the moment so the difference between us and everybody else is that we also care about the moments between the moments what's it gonna be like in between those moments everybody else only puts their energy to those we focus on the moments between the moments and i just started i was like i still don't really understand how to use this but it became this like kind of mantra so anytime i really want to pull something off like today's valentine's day i'm trying to pull something off it's like uh what are the moments between the moments that i could just level up here because that's where to the other person they're like oh you didn't have to do that like this took extra care to like to think about you know the walkway between the two rooms and not just what's in the two rooms now that i'm a hotelier i'm reading the biography of the guy who started the four seasons and he talks about he started in the 60s and he was like before then like people didn't necessarily have like the fanciest mattresses so we went and just got the best mattresses that money could buy or like you couldn't get your um shoes cleaned at a hotel and so we just hired a guy to clean shoes or the showers weren't necessarily good so our showers were just almost as good as every other shower but we just got the best shower heads and he was like oh we just focused on all these really tiny things and it added up and made it amazing right do you uh have you read this the main guy for hospitality there's like the shake shack guy i think he's written one danny meyer his book's called setting the table yeah i read it it's awesome and then there's uh that guy chip you know this guy chip have you heard of this guy chip uh conley yeah he had a hotel business is it called hotel zephyr i think no so it's a boutique i think that's one of his hotel that's like the specific hotel his group is called something else uh he has a couple like a bunch of boutique hotels that i guess chip conley yeah yeah he worked at airbnb for a long time right that's right i think he was like the advisor key advisor special advisor to like the founders of airbnb so in um in masters of scale did you ever listen to the master skill episode about airbnb about the five-star experience thing oh yeah go ahead tell it so so you should do this for your airbnb so i i do this for i use for all my startups i'll do this at one point in time for everybody it's an amazing framework so founder of airbnb brian chesky goes on and they were talking about like okay what makes air what made airbnb special he goes okay we do this exercise i think he calls it the 12 star experience so he goes all right um he sat down with the team he goes okay uh a guest is going to stay at an airbnb right that's our product our product is actually not the website where you book the thing it's the experience you have when you go to the place we all agree on that everyone's like yeah we all agree on that okay cool so uh what's a one star experience with airbnb it's like oh i i booked the place and my card gets charged twice for no reason now i gotta go contact support and then i never get a message from the guy so i'm uncertain when i get there about how i'm gonna get in um and then i get there and it looks nothing like the photos and there's cockroaches everywhere and the bed is you know the sheets are dirty whatever that's a one star experience okay cool what's a three star experience so they they define a three-star experience it's like all those little moments but they're a little bit better and he's like all right what's a five-star experience and this is where the team the first time they do this exercise seems like all right five star experience is like you know super easy to book on the website um you get there and the keys are in the lock box and just opens up and uh you know it looks just like the photos and you're feeling good and the the host leaves you kind of like a bottle of wine on the table or like you know some some mint chocolate on your pillow let's put it that way he's like okay great that's a five-star experience everyone's like yeah that's five stars they're ready to like leave the meeting great we need to find it here goes cool what's a six star experience and they're like oh [ __ ] foreign what do you want us to say they're like okay instead of a mint you know chocolate on your pillow there's a bottle of wine they say all right what's a seven star experience and they're like all right seven star experience you know they pick me up from the airport there's they're standing there with a name on my name on the sign and they i don't have to go figure out the uber in the city they drive me home and then they you know on the way out they hand me you know a little cheat sheet of cool stuff in the neighborhood that i can go check out he like keeps pushing the envelope he's like what's a 12 star experience and he forces them to think through what the most magical experience could be using their product and he's like okay cool now we know what's possible now we know in the extreme scenario like we took the ceiling from here we blew the roof off and now we can go here right we took the knob we turned it to 10 and then we said no we want the volume to go higher and now we can take the volume up to 15. and sure we're not going to be able to deliver that every time but if we hadn't even thought about it like we couldn't ever dream of translating any element of that into our into our experience and at the company there was a time pre-covered when when they didn't have you know what the when covet happened like things change and like we got to survive just like most businesses but prior to that for a long time brian had been tinkering with building an airline and the reason being is the 12 star experience is basically well like what if we flew you there and you know the moment you booked we picked you up and you were on our flight and you know a perfect 12 star would be like it's your own plane this and that yeah and they were even tinkering with either opening an airline or offering flights right and that and that's an example that that that example didn't come to fruition because a bunch of stuff but that's an example of like man that actually could have been reality from that exercise but other things did so for example the airbnb uh what was called experiences or whatever where okay you get to the city now what well my stay is not just the house i'm in it's what i do outside of the house well cool wouldn't it be awesome if we could take you on a wine tasting thing that could just be part of what was already booked for you it just turned out to be amazing it's like a local person guiding you through this thing not just this uh corporate you know um you know tour bus but like somebody who really actually like works at the winery who just does this in their spare time wouldn't that be an amazing experience and that actually became a part of the product and uh you know what if the photos weren't so crummy right so like all these things they they they like put effort into doing them to me that's how you translate the moments between the moments thing into real life so whenever i do this with our companies it's like cool so what would be a great experience oh you get the product and it works okay what's a what's a six star experience well the packaging actually are practically kind of weird it's like hard to open it'd be awesome if this just was easy to open i didn't have to go get the scissors and fumble with this oh yeah okay what else would be cool if it inside every package they also was this other little thing that would be awesome right and then like what if the founder followed up with like you know like hey how was it two days later and they you know they actually cared what i thought okay what what else and so this like this exercise of take your team through one star three star five star seven star our nice 12 star experience is like it works in any business not just hospitality to him yeah i i remember hearing this story years ago i think this he did this in like 2014 or 15 and it's always stuck with me yeah um okay let me tell you about a company that i think i think i could i could start one of these and i think i could i could knock it out the park so there's this company that i've always talked about well actually no i'm gonna tell you about that in a second i want to tell you about one other thing there's this guy named sam evans do you know sam evans sam evans uh is that the uh very like slick-backed hair guy yeah what's his thing consulting.com so he talks all right so this guy named sam evans he rubbed me the wrong way for a long time and looking back i think i was actually wrong and he seemed like an art guy so he had this website called consulting.com which if i had to put it at its worst it was basically a course that was like two thousand to ten thousand dollars that taught you how to start a business at best it's like it like it's an accelerator and the reality is it just like is a way to like it's like a community and a course on starting a company and he scaled it to like 30 million in revenue and it was just him and he hired all these people and built this office in new york and he was posted on social that they're doing 50 or 60 million in revenue and then he vanished and he had a youtube video come out today that says and he and he just says i'm back he's like for the past two years i hated life we scaled too quickly and so we were spending like 50k a day on facebook ads and we weren't even making that much profit so i decided to change everything and over the last two years we've crushed it he goes for example in january uh this course he goes we got rid of like there was three courses now we only sell two or one and last month in january we made eight hundred thousand dollars in revenue and our expenses which includes payroll buy and paid ads was sixty thousand dollars and so basically this guy and and then he launched this new company called school which is basically like a facebook groups alternative because when he was launching courses he was like you stink so that is a different story that's actually cool but this course business this guy has now basically let's just times it by 10 so 8 million in revenue with 600 000 in expenses is that nutty or what is that crazy yeah but it depends is that sustainable and also is that going to grow so for example i know i don't think it's going to grow but i think it's going to be sustainable when i did the like all access passives like i was making whatever 50k a month off of the newsletter i paid newsletter making 50k a month what were my expenses it was like you know 300 a month for convertkit uh you know like a va for 500 a month whatever so it looked nutty but like that's because i had an audience so i could just sell into that if i wanted to grow it i would have had to like you know my expenses would have had to gone way up right you know like so it depends where yeah maybe his ad spend is really low now is that because his ads are ultra efficient or is because he had a lot a big list no they said that they don't they don't spend ads anymore but previously they had spent millions and tens of millions of dollars of ads so the website definitely already has yeah uh traffic traffic yeah so yes it's not like i talked to somebody who worked there um pretty early on so they i was like is this guy legit he's legit he's good um they're like he he lived in new zealand or something like that he's a digital marketer uh then he has consulting.com which is basically like they had a course they had a consulting accelerator and they're basically teaching people how to start their own business their own consulting business and uh they said they told me at the time that there was like 10 million dollars of free cash flow a year and they said that um they it was about 30 million or something in revenue they said like half of that so like 15 16 million was coming from one product which was a two or three thousand dollar course about how to start your own consulting business and then from there they upsell you into the five thousand dollar course about how to create a course and then uh once you get to five hundred thousand dollars in consulting revenue then you get to join a mastermind that will help you get to a million dollars plus and that'll cost you 25 or 50 grand or something like that and so that was their you know that was their model but you know half of it was coming from that kind of like entry level two to three thousand dollar course um where they like kind of sell you close you on the phone to like get you to buy the course which is yeah i went through the funnel to like so i got him to sell me online or to do the phone call and i was like i want to figure this out it's pretty good man and i gave the guy a hard time because he's just kind of weird he just comes off serial kill kind of patrick bateman he's kind of like the patrick bateman of our of our friend jack smith like the american psycho version of our friend jack smith and so he's like just like a little off but that's actually really incorrect of me to say because i don't i think he's just an oddball which is totally because i don't know the guy well yeah and i don't know him and i think that my judgment is just totally wrong i think he's an all right guy yeah i think it's wrong because it's all based on his haircut no i watched a lot of this guy's videos and i was like something is off here and i he was he was aggressively selling it was the type of guy where you're selling like a private jet uh like a video on a private jet right so that's not wrong but it's it's it's you know your cousins with wrong um and so i think that that it was just kind of odd but i thought that was interesting i thought you get a kick out of that all right but the second thing so go to board google boardroom insiders okay so this company was just bought the other day for 25 million dollars and it was bought by this company called euro money and so basically what it does is boardroom insiders provides executives with help on uh it helps them with their sales marketing and recruiting teams uh if your audience is a c-suite executive basically it's just a database that lists all the executives you can think of and for a bunch of big powerful ones it has in-depth profiles on them and it helps you map out who they know and um uh you can like follow an executive and it could like tell you like oh this person recently changed jobs and they claim that none of their information comes from scraping i don't buy that but it could be true and they also they say that baseball so let's just assume that's not true and then we'll assume it is true in a second but assuming that's not true that means they get all of their data from basically these editors who are just scraping the web not scraping but like monitoring the web and manually creating this database of tens of thousands of executives and then selling it for tens of thousands of dollars and i think that's pretty amazing and i think that's interesting because there's this company called pitchbook that did something similar to this and what pitch book did they pitch book is owned by a publicly traded company they do like 200 million in revenue which means they're probably worth well over a billion at this point and what they did was they hired these huge teams of people in the philippines and it would basically call vcs and ask them if they invested in this particular company and then they would create a list of like all right here's we we triangulated this to this company raised this much money at this valuation from these five people these five people also invested in these things these things these things these 18 companies are growing at this rate based off their head count growth on linkedin these fascinating databases is this is this interesting yeah i always like kind of i kind of admire a product like this i put this into beautiful businesses category why because um what's the product the product is data uh you sell it digitally you collect it through either automated scraping or outsourced you know kind of phones phone sales scripts you get every every bit of data you add in makes your whole data set more valuable and and you could sell this thing for a very high price because the people who need it right like boardroom insiders for example who needs it it's who needs access to the profiles of executives at companies it's like you know executive recruiters um they are willing to pay because they make a ton of money when they place a cmo at a company it's executive sales or executive marketing and so it's like people who are who have big budgets who spend a lot of money and they don't have the time to like go figure this out themselves they'd rather click a button and get the get the list and so um so yeah while i don't think these are the most fun and exciting businesses to build or like not like that good for the world you know uh i don't like admire them for that reasons can be if you if you cared about it i think if i think there's a and there's not like i am fairly passionate about the pitch book version crunch bass is also a cool version that i'm like oh that's actually pretty sick i think there's a world where it could be cooler yeah yeah maybe it doesn't look like they have kind of like a lot of stuff on the person so it's like you know i'm i'm on one so this is doug um he's the head of retail business they have like sample profiles on their site he's the head of retail business at amazon okay personal interest or golf and greek letter organizations frats i don't know i don't know what that's about and then it's like here's the summary he did this before that he was working on this before that he was working on this it's like a resume like golf and boofing let's go hire him and then it was like hey he was born in south korea grew up in kentucky it's like yeah you want if you want to build rapport real quick it's like here's his wife's name you know hey how's the wife how's that young how's uh you know what here's what he's focused on or he he's bullish on retail business because on the q3 earnings call they said we're bullish on retail business it's like okay some of this is kind of like you know who's typing this in here uh but some of this could be useful i i could see why this have you seen uh on the office michael takes notes on all of his clients and he's trying to get trying to teach how to do it yeah he goes and dwight gets to know he goes hello mr smith how is um greg 14 year old homosexual son how was your gay son yeah he's like it was written in he's like it was on green he's like and michael he called somebody's like green means go i said do not go there that's what this reminds me of oh my god that's great um yeah so all right so this is a cool little website well that's it can i tell you something uh interesting i saw so um the one the 0.01 rule so nathan barry came on the pod and he was cool so he's the the founder of convertkit he came on he was telling us about some blog posts that either he's written or that others have written that he liked so i went back and i read one of them and i saw this thing called the 0.01 percent rule have you seen this no okay so it's pretty amazing i'm gonna pull up this uh where's the blog 0.01 rule wealth let me see if i can pull it up here um okay i'm not gonna be able to find it real quick here but i'll put the link in ben if you could find it or search nathan barry wealth ladder 0.01 so basically the way the guys think he's like he's like you know um he's like he talks about price sensitivity he's sort of like you know as you get more rich you um you know the way you think about money should change right this is like when i came to your house and you had like cvs receipts in the glove compartment because you're like saving them for like the three dollar thing you're like hell yeah and i was like dude you just sold your company for like many many millions of dollars uh what are you doing with these cvs receipts you're like ah i just like to do it it's a habit and so this guy talks about like the richer you get um you should sort of he's like he's like this works for when you sell something to somebody or yourself as you get to that level basically below 0.01 of your net worth so that's you take your net worth you multiply by 0.000 whatever you know one so it's like uh 0.01 of your net worth so let's say you're worth um let's do 100 million so 100 million what is it times what use 5 million right they'll use a little bit more of a approachable number here so um so that would be five hundred dollars for if you have five million dollars in net worth five hundred dollars is the threshold below which you don't really feel it you don't really care or feel it you become a little bit price insensitive below that point so that might be like you know opting for the night you know the nicer hotel or like you just really don't give a [ __ ] you can just ball out at a restaurant you really don't care uh and so he draws this little curve and he's like at um at the first level of wealth it's like he calls it like level zero level one of wealth where it's like you know your 0.01 is like a hundred dollars or less than a hundred dollars at that point a million dollars yeah a million dollars would be a hundred bucks yeah so he's like you know at that point like you know if you're at the grocery store and something costs an extra dollar like you care you don't want to buy the eggs that cost 1.99 more you care he's like then the next level the next jump up is you're like well i don't care at like you know it's the way he draws the chart it's like what are restaurant prices then the next one's like what are vacation prices like you don't even really care about how much your vacations cost the next one is like you you know you could fly first class and then the final one is like you know or the next one's like you can buy a crazy house and you know you don't really get you're not really feeling uh house prices as much and then the final one is like you know what are prices anyways like you know this is when you're worth over 100 million dollars like at that point most things don't cost anything to you and um you're pretty insensitive to the cost of it so i'm sort of summarizing the idea the the exact you know you can quibble about what you should or shouldn't care about but i thought it was kind of an interesting number and the reason i bring it up is very few people that i know are like properly price sensitive so there's a lot of people i know like my dad who no matter how wealthy they've got like the sort of like the trauma of not having money is so deeply ingrained in his body that like you know starbucks he's just like he's like pissed off when they charge even if he buys the coffee it like he's angry at the price and he's like oh my god 4.99 like i could make this for so much less and they're like sir you're welcome to do that and he's like oh like what's going on and you know he's anchored to prices from like the 80s when like you know that's where like he thought movie tickets should cost x and also you know it just like hurts him to spend more than some amount regardless of what's in his bank account and so he's kind of on one side of the spectrum too cheap and then there's another side spectrum which is where more where i am where it's like dude you should really kind of like pay attention to this you're kind of spending like pretty crazy and uh you know completely price insensitive is on the other side and then there's like whatever the sweet spot is and then school they don't really teach you how to how to like gauge that or what what those kind of like what even should be a good number for this what should i spend on things so you you don't get nervous like i i freak out a little because as an entrepreneur like some years i just like knock out the park and make so much money other years i make nothing i mean hopefully i don't think nothing will ever happen again but like there's times you don't get nervous about running out no actually like two months ago i was like oh my god i have like no cash left no cash on hand left i was i was investing in everything i saw i was putting money into startups and to crypto into stuff i was then i was spending a bunch like my payroll expanded and i was like oh my god i have like so little cash in my cap i felt i had 60 grand in cash and i was like i feel low yeah i think it was like 38 000 was in my like whatever wells fargo checking account i was like where'd all the money go this was like and i was like oh yeah i guess and i looked at the like out outgoing thing and it was like it's not that my spending had gone up i was really just investing a lot of money but i was like wow i should uh i need to manage cash for most the time for me it's like i need to send my invoices for like things you know like i was like all right i'm gonna teach a course and i'm going to invoice you know for the podcast and i'm going to like do the things that bring in like cash today versus most of the things i invest my money into are like long-term illiquid things or my own businesses right like uh maybe i should take a withdrawal out of my business and like put money in my bank account and so so you know it was just like a reminder of that but no i don't really get too worried about that um and maybe you know again i think i'm too far on the dial of like willing to spend on whatever ramit sethi this is pretty much what his entire uh not course but his entire image and content is about which is like he's got this podcast where two people couples argue like we have we're worth three million dollars and he got into a fight with me because i spent 80 on this silly thing and ramit's all about that it's i have i'm more like your father than i am like you like and i think it's just rooted it's it's rooted in like trauma like just fear uh i've got the same thing we're just like it's like it bothers me so much like for example um commenteer coffee um i they sent me some for free it's so good but it's a dollar fifty per cup and compare that to like you being coffee i'm like a dollar fifty sometimes i don't even drink the whole thing and so like i've been really struggling with like is that worth it is this worth it or the backsplash on my sink in my kitchen we need to replace it and it's 800 and i've been fretting over it for over a year now i'm like ugh 800 to replace that i can't so even though it will add value to the home and also make me happier i understand why your dad thinks that way it's really it's real i think it's challenging when you're it's like it's like you know it's proper trauma i think of like you felt one way for years and now you suddenly like things are different yeah maybe we actually need money therapy uh money therapy specifically i think that's actually a good idea here so therapy is this broad thing that has like a bunch of associations with it and mostly it's like stigmas and blah blah i think somebody needs to spin off and remember sounds like he's kind of doing this which is therapy's a great idea financial therapy um and it's like yeah have a money coach er you know you probably need a switching therapy to coach is the hack to like oh i'm i'm focusing on performance and not like uh you know fixing a pr broken part of me but in reality it's that i tried finding people like this and when i met them i was like look we're just getting to know each other i'm not a financial advisor different thing no i know when i i would go to therapy for a lot and i would and i would go when i whenever i was trying out a new therapist i'd be like so i'm not gonna like i'm not trying to sound like a douche or big headed but like i'm a high achiever like i want to like conquer the world and like do cool [ __ ] and so i don't want to talk like this is this is the the place that i'm coming from like i'm high octane baby can we can we make this happen do you have the tools necessary or no or do you like specialized just in like you know like traditional way what were you really trying to tell her you were trying to tell her that my problems are not like i'm not broken i'm trying to like just achieve a higher level of success or were you trying to tell what i'm going to do therapist is that what you were trying to ask her what were you trying to ask him no the blunt way to explain it is i've got rich i'm i'm complaining about some rich people problems okay and like i'm just like mostly just insecure about certain things and i want to like use that to like conquer the world i'm not very good on twitter yeah and like i'm gonna complain about stuff that sounds super weak because like on outside like everything's going great but i need you to like empathize that like i'm trying to like go places and i don't need you to tell me that like well you made a million dollars that last year isn't that good enough like no dog that's not like i need you to understand like what like what's at stake here you know what i mean i said what is at stake here that's like you're better i'm gonna be i'm gonna be i'm gonna be your money therapist but you know what i mean like it's so like i would be people and i'm like oh you've only worked with like a certain type of person you have like i don't think you unders i don't think you'll be able to help me yeah yeah exactly i know what you mean it's the reason tony robbins gets paid a million dollars plus per client because it's like his clients are serena williams and ray dalio and you know or whoever he's crazy yeah and he himself is successful and his other clients are you know objectively very successful but everybody everybody um you know can improve the you know the little voice in their head dude while we're on the random random random topics did you watch the tinder swindler no but i saw your picture with it so what's the what's the like the the okay so you guys don't okay so here's here's what happened it's kind of an amazing thing um there's a guy so the document it's a documentary about this guy who goes on tinder and his tinder profile looks like uh you know he's kind of like a normal-ish looking guy but he's like clearly living a cool lifestyle like lots of travel in different climates kind of wearing very nice clothes that's his profile all right so girls swipe right on him and they start chatting with him and he he basically what he ended up doing was he ended up conning women out of money and it was like a ponzi scheme so what he would do is he would meet a woman on tinder take her out on a date kind of wine in diner make it look like he's this baller of a guy and he you know was just like like a prince out of a fairy tale he just loves her the average looking girl who's average job just for my average city and then all of a sudden i come on my private jet and come do this with me and they go together and there she's like oh my god it's all happening i am that princess that he picked and he cares for and so he he starts talking to him and his back story is that he um his dad owns a diamond company and he's the son of a billionaire and if you google you see that this guy's a son of a billionaire so he kind of like had created this profile around that and um and then you know sure enough a month in he's like um hey you know like he's he's like oh you know he sends a picture of his body he's always with the bodyguard he's like my bodyguard got attacked oh my god she's like oh my god is he okay he's like yeah but you know they're telling me i can't use my credit cards anymore because they're tracking my location you know like these are our enemies for our company the diamond business is a ruthless business and he's like uh can i borrow your credit card for the time being while i uh you know because i can't use mine yet and she's like uh okay and he's like cool just make sure you get your limits raised because like i have business meetings and all this stuff so these women end up going like 150 200 000 in debt as he racks up credit card debt then he's like hey go get a quick loan and send me the money i need it because you know my enemies are after me and he's like my enemies are after me and so you the documentaries the first half of the documentaries women talk about how they fell in love and the second half is like how they got conned basically and he's like a ponzi scheme so he's well he'd fall in love with one woman or he'd get them to fall in love with him get them to start giving him money and credit cards he'd be using that to wine and dine the next woman and then he would be doing this with multiple women at once telling them all the same things and then he was living this like extravagant lifestyle on all these women's dime and uh and then you know so that's that okay that's the score of the movie quick reaction to that and i'm gonna tell you some other stuff well what happened to him so how does this end it ends with he gets exposed so the women are like oh my god you know they they go to the credit card company they're like look i have to be honest like my kind of boyfriend you know or i don't know what's going on this is the guy he's tricking me and like he's there can we see a picture of the guy and he she shows a picture on her phone and then the two like agents from like amex or whatever just look at each other like it's him and then she's like what it's like we've been after this guy for years uh he does this with tons of women they're like there's other women he's doing this too and so it's like they feel cheated on plus conned and um and so he but technically what happens is is he breaking the law he's not breaking the law they are giving him money they're sending him money willingly and they are um you know they're giving him their credit card and they're calling the credit card company and saying no no it's me can you please raise my limits yes i'm traveling i'm in i'm i'm in ibiza right now and so they're like uh you know you're in a kind of a sticky spot you can't really say he stole it you clearly gave it to him uh in fact you kind of committed fraud but like well whatever we'll leave that aside but like yeah you do owe this money like this is not um this is not you know a stolen credit card and so anyways how much do you get he ends up getting a 15-month sentence for not even for this it's for like something else that he did like associated with this um he serves five months he gets off free he's out there living he's got a new model girlfriend he lives somewhere else um the girls kind of like exposed him in the press because they were like okay look law enforcement's not doing anything or it's going to take too long he's going to keep doing this in the meantime they go to the norwegian press where they're from and they they they kind of like expose it the netflix turns it into a documentary and uh and so the guy's still out there and one of the things in the movie is he goes to a plastic surgeon and he's like i want my eyes cheekbones chin mouth all restructured and this guy's like i'm not gonna do this only a criminal would want this surgery and so he's like trying to change his face so he could keep it going but he can't change his face and now he's like you know kind of like public enemy number one but a lot of people who watch this are like dude these girls are stupid you yeah you were just with him for the money and then he can't do for the money you got what you deserve so the girls are getting a ton of flack for it which is really crazy that's that's that's dumb but i was just thinking what a waste of talent by this guy yeah like that's pretty amazing it's like a you know what's funny is like leonardo dicaprio played the same character and catch me if you can and it was awesome yeah he became like when i see this guy i want to punch him in the face yeah exactly that was the problem it was a documentary instead of a movie about the con man itself where you sort of fall in love with this smooth guy uh yeah if a different if if like a lovable if like if like matt damon played him i would be all about it but you got to watch the thing super punchable face this guy yeah um and the memes are just amazing uh around well i saw the meme with you with your face on it yeah yeah yes i had somebody i was like hey photoshop my head onto onto this photo where it looks like i'm with the guy and i just tweeted out like i'm with my sister's new boyfriend like is he american no this guy's there's israeli um dude screw this guy man i i i'm happy they made a documentary about him how did he get all the uh so he's in a private jet a bunch of these pictures how did he get that because he's using the previous woman's money to fund his his lifestyle so he would fly private yeah yeah so he's actually flying private i don't know if all the time but at least some of the time and uh it was just really wild in fact a lot of the numbers don't make sense like he must have been running this on like tons of women at once to fund this lifestyle because he's like the jets and the stuff that he's doing like okay he called this woman out of 80 grand but 80 grand funds like one month of this lifestyle you know like that's not very long so he must have had a lot of people at the same time or the documentary is a little inaccurate i don't know but how much money did he get they said that he had conned women out of millions of dollars over over time um they didn't say exactly how much they don't know you know how much of it what was there but but i i just feel like he did this all wrong like if you're gonna do all this effort you gotta be more intelligent right like okay what could he have done um could have just married rich could have just seemed rich married rich divorced took half right like that that would have worked uh wait wait you know put more wood behind fewer arrows here and he could have just caught one very wealthy person if he really wanted to do this that's my first critique of him uh my second critique of him is bro all this money to just party partying's exhausting like why he just wanted to fly private and go to these clubs and do table service like you know you couldn't pay me to do that i don't know you gotta diversify your assets dog yeah you should uh you should own some crypto like buy something buy buy a home do do something with this money you just blew all the money on overpriced you know like bottle service at the club like wow all right that's critique number two um number three go b to b bro corporate swindling would have worked way better so you know he could have been like you heard about the guy who just started sending invoices to microsoft and apple and stuff just got paid like millions of dollars just he was just sending an invoice to accounts payable or whatever and uh and then they would just pay some of the invoices like like ap at microsoft.com yeah he was like he's like hey you know this is for the blah blah blah and like and then they went back and they were like what the hell is this who is this vendor that we paid 1.1 million dollars to this year like nobody knows who this is i don't think that's illegal either uh i think it is because he was like you know uh well whatever they were going back after them you know these companies a lot of money so that's the downside of going b2b i feel like there could have been a b2b way of doing this should have actually just started a diamond company could have made a lot more money if you're this good at getting women's emotions tied up in your your lifestyle just actually sell the diamonds it would have worked use their money to fund a diamond company that actually could have worked this guy needs to be needs to be on the facebook ad manager instead of tinder that's my best maker i'm looking at him now the all those these women who he's scammed like a lot of them look like models like he was killing it also like you forgot the other option which is like just marry one of these ladies if they're rich enough to like if they're these beautiful women who could wire them 200k like i don't know man bro maybe you got to keep her well in this case he's like he was telling him like go take like a kind of like a collateralized loan or a payday loan and like super high just don't worry he's like i'm going to wire your money back in four days and then he would like not wire them back and then they'd be like hey did you wear the money he's like oh sorry they are like the bank was closed okay then he would like show them a statement he'd be like i sent it should arrive in a couple days she's like hey it hasn't arrived yet what's going on like the interest is building up on this like flash loan you had me take he's like oh my god let me call the bank another two days go by he's like called the bank they said this thing got frozen i gotta i gotta deal with this i'm so sorry here uh you know i'm gonna send you one of my watches in the meantime you could just sell it this watch is worth a hundred thousand dollars sends them a fake watch and you just buy time doing that it's like these women didn't have the money but like i think he could he could have totally gone for a richer woman and then been like you know what baby like i love you i'm not gonna make you sign a prenup you know me i'm a billionaire uh i come from this lineage but i'm not my dad says sign up prenup i'm not gonna do it and then she would feel a little bit of pressure and be like okay i guess i can't really ask him for a penalty anyways this guy's richer than me all right i guess i also won't that would have been a more effective con if this guy were in jail do you think he'd be popular or hated i think popular sadly you think popular i think i think popular i could see this going either way man i could see this i could see this going either way i think like dude in prison would he like all right so bernie madoff i heard in prison was like a god which i get i get that you know like he could teach people how to like corner like the chocolate chip or the chocolate hot chocolate market like in prison like he could like you know or he could like you know dominate the commissary and like teach you about markets i get that and also there it wasn't a violent crime so no children or women would hurt like this guy is he i would see this guy being unpopular uh i don't know that's a good question he's got kind of like a douchebag aura to him so that's the problem that's that's where he's going to get in trouble but uh bro the swindler this window would do well in prison i guess i'll watch it how many episodes he's not in prison he's out and about he's he's living a nice life right now i'll screw this guy man and he sold a couple million dollars yeah i think i think about i think this documentary is good punishment though that's fair i'm okay with you not serving time and you have this documentary our buddy jack butcher pointed something out that i was like oh wait a minute that's true he's like yo netflix is gonna make a lot of money off this documentary pay off these women's debts they have like a gofundme going it's like yo netflix you need to pay off this woman's 200 000 debt that's true you did well on this documentary so that's the uh that's the real call out here netflix cancel netflix if they don't pay off these women's debts that's a no-brainer you don't think they're going to well nobody said anything these women are doing interviews everywhere there's a gofundme out there i feel like i feel like they could have said or they're just you know swindling people one good thing you know we didn't make a lot of money off this but netflix actually generously did agree to pay off the debt you know uh blah blah blah that i feel like that story should have come out if they did it if they didn't then fire your either fire your pr person netflix or pay off this pay these debts you have two choices that's actually a great point how many likes did that tweet get that jax had probably not that many because now everyone's just looking at jack for like nft oh my god all right that's a good episode

[Music] so basically i i'm we were facebook friends now so we talk a little bit there but i first met you at hustle con i think this event that i hosted in 2019 and you're one of the best people we've ever had we've had hundreds of people and i'll i'll tell you why two things the first i think you spoke right when so this is max he started grammarly we'll do an intro in a second but i think you spoke when you guys had just raised maybe a hundred million dollars at a billion dollar valuation or something like that is that right yeah that was uh yeah that was uh 120 uh and i we didn't disclose validation at the time yeah but if i had to get yeah you didn't uh but i think i heard rumors and like i just i'm guessing it was like in that range and it didn't matter but yeah but basically um i made a comment to you i'm like that's pretty cool right and you you kind of replied back you weren't cocky but you were very confident and still humble but you kind of had a grin and i forget exactly what you said but it was something like yeah it's gonna get much bigger too and i i loved that like subtle confidence and then at the event what you talked about i don't even remember the title but the idea was basically like you're an engineer but you've done a really good job of like evolving past just engineering and you like said this is how like i engineer like good products and this is like everything you looked at was from an engineer like uh about reverse engineering different stuff and i thought that was incredibly fascinating do you remember what i'm talking about oh yeah i do i remember that i actually use it mantra a lot in inside the company as well when we look at different markets and where to go next and it's just a universally good framework that uh uh works for many things yeah just kind of looking at things narrowly identifying the sweet spot and then just going broader from there this is max litvin lit vin he started this company called grammarly before grammarly you had another company called like blackboard i think right that was not my company that was a company that bought my company so my company was my dropbox not to be confused with dropbox it was a plagiarism detection company and it was bought by blackboard in 2007 um and then they spent two years with blackboard uh kind of a part burnout part just being been there and that was like a a a compared to grammarly a mild success right like it was it was financially good but it wasn't like this huge huge multi-billion dollar company oh yeah that was uh that was uh just a start it could have grown big but education is was at the point a relatively difficult market to to be in and wasn't as big of a market uh plus our product was fairly narrow it was just doing one thing for one group of people so we kind of saw that it can grow to this point but further it's going to be very slow and very difficult so that's why we decided to sell plus we had bigger ideas and you started grammarly and at this point can you reveal can you reveal how big it is because i i like it's shockingly large yeah so we raised that 13 billion valuation and we disclose that valuation i still think it's a conservative it's conservative one why because grammarly is a very non-standard company and very non-standard product it's easy to see it for less when it is um and and that that's kind of reflected often in in in perceptions of of everyone if investors of uh sometimes even potential team members we have to explain why it's big and you know but uh that also helps with the last competition well and like and by the way you guys bootstrapped it for a long time so like you and your co-founder like it's not like you own like four percent of this company you guys probably you own like a very substantial amount so like actually so you're on paper you're you're probably a multi-billionaire at this point uh it depends on whom you believe uh there is some information that's not fully accurate uh but yeah we we managed to keep significant portion of the company with the founders and employees uh employees only actually quite a lot did um when i heard about grammarly the reason why i wanted you to come on to the podcast and at hustlecon is because i think my reaction is the same reaction most people in business had which is like a this is just a chrome plug-in b this is just spell check like there's no way that either of those things are interesting and then i learned about it and i was like oh this is like way bigger than it just looks like that it's way more than that did most people or like there's most people dismissive of like it just being a chrome plug-in some people are dismissive uh quite a lot and uh i wouldn't say dismissive it's not like completely oh there's nothing uh but uh underestimate the impact and the importance of it and that's that's an interesting uh conversation always always very similar because um they kind of think oh this is a good product this is a cool product but not for me because well i know what i'm doing and then they try it and it helps it helps the material ways and especially when you measure results because you know when you don't measure things and then just you know typing away uh it saves you from an embarrassment or helps you phrase something more clearly kind of yeah that's cool but what's the impact of that show me the money but when it's done on the business scale uh and it's measured and it's uh kind of assessed uh you can see like percentages improvements in in different metrics productivity satisfaction and so on and that ends up is updated we bought it at the hustle so i i had it for uh the whole company um i don't remember what it what it cost but i remember seeing the bill every month hundreds of dollars a month and everyone loved it and i loved it i i still use it so like i totally i totally buy i i totally once i started using it i was like oh my god i get it but one thing that i've always been fascinated with is is just plugins as a business um particularly two types of plugins wordpress plugins um there's a bunch of guys that have like some substantially sized substantial size businesses selling wordpress plugins you know like 25 50 million dollars a year and then chrome plugins which do you i don't know if you like describe yourself as a chrome plug-in as a business i i don't think you are but like it's definitely like the one of the main ways in which most people interact with you right uh for now yes uh we just recently switched over to our flagship product being uh operating system level integration so it works similarly to chrome plug-in except it integrates with all the apps not just web apps uh so that's uh that was a big switchover that happened uh in december so just a lot of months ago so that's uh that expands the surface area for grammarly now it's in microsoft powerpoint and uh you know oracle applications and wherever wherever you want um did you uh why did you hire a ceo when did you do that that's kind of jumping topics but uh yeah we um we brought in a ceo i think in 2011 uh and um one reason one big reason for that was that um both uh alex michael founder and i we have a philosophy that everybody should be doing should be in their zone or genius doing what they like and what what they're good at and nobody no one of us was really experienced or or even that passionate about scaling organizations uh and that's what we're kind of the biggest thing we were looking for from as uh from uh ceo uh teaching us and and doing that basically scaling the company because we realize that to do what we need to do we need a lot of people we need a big company it's a kind of a number of people and size is not a kind of a desired outcome in itself it is a necessity because the goals are so big that you can't do it with uh 20 people or 30. how many employees did you have when you hired brad uh i think 20 something oh wow nothing i mean small small yeah we were fairly small uh we were we were uh making good revenue and being profitable at the time already uh but the company was still very small um and that's that's kind of a that that realization we need to their opportunities big and we need to scale uh that pushed us to look for kind of external expertise how did you because at that point you i guess you didn't raise money so you and your partner like oh it was like your business it was your company and like your money how did you how did you not micromanage brad um because i did the same thing and not micromanaging is tough because you're like oh my god if you make a mistake you're gonna lose money and that's like my money and so it's like really stressful to like let someone fail sometimes and learn were you micromanaging or were you pretty emotionally healthy about it i'd like to think we were emotionally healthy maybe brad would disagree i don't know i wish he i actually will ask him but um i think part of it was out of necessity there was just so much to do that if you're micromanaged you get stuck you don't not make progress so there was just no time or resources or energy to micromanage anybody we had to divide and conquer to to actually keep making progress because so that's a lot of work so just just from the volume of things to do everybody had to do their own thing so that that happened naturally and part of it is a philosophy that again alex and i share that basically if you bring in smart people on board like not listening to them or not letting them think independently is a waste basically there is no point in bringing smart people on board uh so that's uh that's that made it easy to kind of uh give freedom and give space to to brad and other um leadership team members what were your goals early on like when you started the business we're like man i think this can make 10 million dollars a year and provide a good lifestyle or like i think this could or was it like i think this could be like a multi-billion dollar thing like what were your goals early on um i think we decided that it could be a multi-billion dollar business during our conversations with brad partially uh so kind of alex and i we we hoped it could be but then once we started talking with brad about valuation plans and all that um when he was thinking about joining then it become pretty clear that yes there is a multi-billion dollar market out there uh are we gonna capture it or not to be just to be determined but um at that point but uh there is definitely an opportunity so the size of the opportunity became clear fairly early um but past there that that took years what was the vision that made or what what did you see that made you feel that it could be a multi-billion dollar opportunity and what was the vision and were there any was there any numbers that you saw early on that which said like oh my gosh there's something here yeah so i think the breakthrough moment was when we saw that it is possible to help not just professional writers people who write for living every day but also help casual writers or people who write as part of their job but or part of their life but not like a key part so writing is not their like main product they're no you know like novelists or or researchers who are published and so on so when we saw that it's possible to make a product that's useful for everybody else uh then it clicked uh a very simple formula if you look at amount of time we spent communicating and creating knowledge uh as a humanity as all people in the world that is a huge percentage of our time and it's increasing because we spend less time doing things with our hands manufacturing is being automated it's not like we're doing it manually anymore as much so if you take this time that we spend communicating and creating knowledge and make it even one percent more effective the impact is in trillions not not even billions uh so can we do something that makes communication one percent more effective on average for everybody that doesn't sound impossible that sounds like something is doable uh that's doable so so we decided i had that aim same insight except i did it in such a horrible worst way so basically um i learned how to be a copywriter so like i read books on copywriting and like on persuasive writing and my theory was like oh my gosh like with texting or like online dating i i was single at the time in 21 so it was all about like dating i'm like oh man if i were to learn how to write better in my messages to girls who i match with like my life is going to be better and then i was like wait a minute if i learn how to write better i could sell more stuff if i learn how to write better i can make people feel emotions about like this cause that i want them i'm like just writing better like it changes it makes it life more practical but also it it uh makes you think better so like if you can if you have an idea for something and you're forced to write it out you'll see all the holes in idea and you'll and you'll force yourself to like lay it out and so i was like oh i'll teach people how to write better and so i created a course on how to write better of course like obviously creating a software product it was out of my league but like that was clearly the better move to do but the same insight was like everything that we do is via a text whether it's a text message or an email or a website and even if it's via like the spoken word i have to write that anyway so like writing is like the most important thing that you can master i just wish i would have approached it in a software way as opposed to just selling a 300 course yeah software is more scalable that's that's true and uh and actually what you said about writing uh it also applies to speech we when we do user research we notice that um people who use grammarly repeatedly adopt patterns of communication more effective patterns of communication translated to uh non-written communication as well so for example if grammarly keeps suggesting that you don't use kind of a wordy or wig or weak sentence structures you stop or reduce use of them in speech as well so i so kind of good habits rub off and and translate to other modes of communication so here's my opinion so have you ever heard of copywork all right so in like the um 1700s 1800s and up until like 1910 one of the ways in america that we would teach children how to write well it's the same way that we would teach them how to play an instrument so if i wanted to teach you how to play the piano i'm not gonna say like go ahead like write go write a piano song i would say well let's play jingle bells let's learn how to play happy birthday then after that we can move to like some more pop songs that you really like and then you do that for like two years and you like see patterns and you like understand you just copy other people's music and in doing that you see patterns and then eventually you're like oh i know the rules to the game now now i can decide to follow them to break them but i can make my own and it's the same thing with writing but we don't do that and so what that means is i think one of the easiest ways to learn is you find great writing that you really like and you just literally copy it by hand and in doing that you like see the patterns and that's called copy work it's not a very popular way to learn how to write now but in my opinion it's one of the most powerful i would say grammarly in a sense it's doing that because in real time you're learning but it's far better than just saying like go and write like just like spend a lot of time writing your own stuff i think copying other people is far better um anyway it's something i've been playing with i'm i'm not a lot of people have heard of copywork i thought maybe you would have but uh it's like not very well known no i haven't heard of it but i've seen it done in many many fields like uh at one point i i was passionate about photography and same there you just basically try different uh try to basically copy different photographs and recreate them and then this way you learn the language of that art uh so so yeah that applies to many many areas how technical were you and your co-founder were you technical enough to build the first handful of iterations um so i was very technical um so for example the previous plagiarism detection company i wrote the core uh the core algorithm and and uh most of the code originally most of the kind of back end code not the front end um but when we were working on grammarly i don't think i did any production code i coded some of the like experiments landing pages payment checkout process like some stuff something you don't even need to code anymore today if you didn't want to yeah yeah yeah yeah so i coded some of that but i didn't code the like uh like a real production grade stuff mostly because i'm i'm not a formerly a software engineer i'm a kind of a self-trained coder but kind of building a real complex software is not my thing plus i had to i had to manage the business full time so when we started out i was responsible for finance marketing like pretty much like lots lots of things like basically everybody has to wear a lot of hats in a small company so the running of the business occupied pretty much my whole time so it was no time for so you just hired you did you guys just self-fund it and hire a couple people to help build the first version uh we hired quite a num quite a significant number of people uh we also had a technical co-founder on board um a demo leader who helped build out the technical team uh so he was responsible for um for the technical side initially uh but yeah because of our previous exit we had some savings that we could put into grammarly and some substantial savings we could put into grammarly so basically we were both founders and the first investors how much did you spend to get the to make it work until like it was a sellable product uh i don't remember but it was quite like a million or 10 million 500 000 do you remember uh i think it was close to a million um but it was a product that worked only for very small audience very very small use case and it was not real time so basically what happened was you write a book a chapter of a book because it couldn't check the whole book at once or you write a research paper you submit it to [Music] the initial like the old grammarly and then you go make a cup of coffee and then you drink the cup of coffee and then you wait a little bit more and then it spits out the result and the result was probably half of it was real issues and half of it was false positives but at the time the audience the the target market was fine with that because if you spend like two months writing a book like what's extra half an hour to review all the potential issues right even if they're not real but that wouldn't fly with uh with business writers for example if you're writing a business email that you need to send in 20 seconds you're not going to deal with false positives and did that version get you to profitability yeah oh [ __ ] what'd you charge for 100 a year uh we charged i think 90 dollars a year something like that uh yeah um yeah or hundreds so yeah i think 995 dollars a year how did the people hear about it the first users uh so that was interesting because we launched two parallel streams one to consumers and one to uh businesses educational institutions publishers basic companies consulting companies and um the consumer channel took off like it grew exponentially from basically week one uh in enterprise or b2b um it took a longer to build so once we kind of pushed both of them in parallel for about half a year uh we saw that well kind of makes sense to focus on consumer for now because it's just growing like wildfire uh but uh b2b requires much more pushing much more hiring more people intensive because you need sales team and all that so we kind of decided to slow roll it a little bit um and focus on consumer for first few years and deal with it through paid marketing or organic uh we did everything um we we tried uh all the channels available to us and uh obviously different channels have different benefits um at the time social was also easier to to get free promotion from uh right now obviously kind of facebook and others just want to capture all the value they create but back then uh it was easy to it gets easier to get stuff viral on social and just get like free promotion from that um seo was easier as well uh so many things were just like many channels were uh quite easier to do uh but we relied on paid uh early on quite a bit uh because it's uh it's a very quick feedback uh you design an ad you send it uh or kind of put it in the system and then you get back results like within hours and it tells you if the message resonates if there is a market for that if you're finding that market correctly you know that within like hours uh it's in in more traditional world it's a weeks of hundreds of thousands of dollars yeah so that's uh that was uh that was kind of why we were so uh bullish on paid from early on even though it costs a lot of money what companies are you guys trying to buy companies um not specifically i mean we're open to that uh but we're not like hunting to buy companies is there a problem that you need to be solved and you saw that this other company was solving that problem that you'd buy it so like let me give you an example the uh the founder of jet you know jet.com they sold the walmart for some billions of dollars and he's like man if walmart if we could figure out a way how to reduce returns by helping people pick the right sizes we would buy that company for a lot of money is there anything inside of grammarly we're like man we haven't figured out blank yet but if someone did figure out blank that's a cool company we would buy that's a cool problem solved that we would buy uh yeah there are many things um like things around um doing more on device uh like doing more and more processing on device i think that that would be very interesting to us because um it didn't it enables uh better user experience lower lag potentially higher performance um it also helps alleviate some potential privacy concerns so kind of a uh a no-brainer to do more stuff on device and it's cheaper for for for us to sorry what does that mean you mean like instead of you paying for all this cloud space for everything for the the for yeah yeah calculating the suggestions on device so basically whenever uh we say oh this needs to be shorter or we rephrase it like that making that determination on your phone or on your laptop rather than sending it to cloud and and having our servers crunch numbers so that's uh that's kind of a that that that has number of benefits for uh for both us actually i i don't know what those costs are so how much does it cost to ho like what percentage of your revenue do you spend on or maybe like how does the payroll compare the payroll cost compared to like your hosting costs i i would say it's comparable uh hosting costs are like even though we don't host much of the data like we're not like dropbox where we store files uh but the processing the processing is quite expensive especially if you consider that we have uh tens of millions of free users who are not paying us anything uh and we're not we don't monetize them in any way at all um because we don't we don't sell user data we don't show ads we don't do any of that uh so basically all the free users are not monetized until they subscribe so that that makes it uh that makes us be conscious of trusting costs especially for regions where not many people can upgrade to premium like developing countries how many employees do you have um i don't recall exactly but i i would say somewhere around damn so then you're paying a [ __ ] ton for those ho that hosting uh yeah i i would say it could be less than period i don't remember exactly uh but uh yeah it is significant amount i mean that then you supporting that many users uh and providing a reliable service it does what do you pay uh it's mostly amazon crazy man like it just runs the internet it's crazy well yeah we evaluate from time to time bringing some things in-house um and actually some things we do have in-house not uh not necessarily like the the hosting infrastructure but uh like some trade model training and all that stuff we do in-house um but uh uh so we look into that uh so it's not like we're just amazon and forget it uh but it is an effective way to scale business it doesn't affect your weight right yeah it's just like crazy that it's crazy it always freaks me out a little bit that like uh we used cloudflare and i remember one time cloudflare went out and like our website was dead and so was like a quarter of the internet yeah yeah it's uh it is um this concentration it is kind of scary um yeah it freaks me out a little bit yeah it has its benefits but it is uh yeah a lot of places have a single point of failure for significant portions of our uh infrastructure are you uh and we'll wrap up here in a second but um i uh i asked you about hemingway earlier do you do you view them as competitors at all not really no they they do something that's similar and something that's basically part of what we do and a number of people use both products simultaneously so we don't view them as a competitor because they don't take business from us uh so yeah so it's not like who do you view as a competitor uh who do you use a competitor well the biggest one is complacency just people not realizing that they can benefit from this i think that that's the biggest thing that by far bigger than any any other competitor but other than that once you get a certain size everybody becomes a potential competitor because you know when you look at big tech companies they all compete in some ways and all do some things that are similar or the same so that's that's kind of the mindset that basically at any point anybody can become a company yeah but are there any i've never seen any like upstarts or any small companies try to compete with you guys is there a map is there many uh there are some uh but most are uh focusing on either a niche like a grammarly for a specific market um and uh i think that's that's a good way to start and obviously we're watching them and seeing what they're doing right what they're doing wrong and so on um they're there they're similar products microsoft i think has a similar product but again it only does part of what we do uh so it doesn't take away much business from us if any um so so yes and i wouldn't i wouldn't say that there are any kind of direct competitors at this point um and i'm not too worried about competition frankly because it's just such a new field uh that most of the market is just untouched by anybody cool well thanks for coming on i'm gonna uh we're gonna wrap up now and uh i'm gonna let you know when this is live it should be live in like a week i think but i appreciate you coming on it means a lot ah great thank you thank you so much for having [Music] you

they they find um a bunch of burner cell phones they find like a bag of like 50 000 of cash they find a bunch of like the hardware wallets that had the bitcoins in them and then they found like folders on their computer that were like fake passport ideas and like like places to go places to run away like they found like folders that said that [ __ ] on their computers [Music] i don't even entirely understand what happened but i have a backstory about three people today's edition of the milk road you will get the full backstory and 10 bullet points yeah you need to go earlier so but but we did bullet point and what so here's what happened 2016 this crypto exchange called bitfinex got hacked and at the time i think like 120 000 bitcoin got stolen that was like 70 million dollars got stolen and it was like it was bad uh that was like a big hack the price of bitcoin that week dropped by 40 so it was like it caused like this huge uh you know like uh a fear shock in the market but the thing about bitcoin is bitcoin is on a public ledger right like it's a it's a public blockchain so everybody could see the coins everybody saw oh the coins are in this wallet and like and so all the other exchanges were like look this is bad for the industry we will try to prevent like if that wallet tries to cash this out we won't let them cash out uh the money so for many years that money kind of just sat in those wallets or was moving in like really small small transactions back and forth between like a web of wallets clearly somebody was trying to like launder the money essentially they were trying but but how how did he how did they even get out of the first place so i don't know i don't know what the exploit was that let them hack the accounts and they didn't hack all the accounts on bitfinex they actually just hacked like some of the whale accounts so they were able to take 120 000 bitcoin from not all the accounts and the funny thing is that biffinx didn't have the money to like make those users whole so what they did was they they reduced everybody on bit fedex's balance by 33 or something to like balance it out so i'm like hor like imagine if your bank did that that would be like insane i'd be like oh they robbed that guy's vault and you're taking my money away to like even it out for everybody like no thank you um so anyways it was bad and there's a reason why biff next is not like you know the biggest exchange now um so anyways that the money kind of sat there now fast forward five and a half years go by last week people start to notice bigger transactions coming from the uh the bitfinex hack wallets um and so they're like there's these alerts on twitter like whale alert well it's like the coins are moving the coins are moving hundred thousand dollars a million dollars the coins are moving 10 million whatever and so um and so the fed go are not the fed sorry department of justice goes kicks down a door in new york into this this this husband and wife couple's house and they look like you know your complete like average joe clean cut like you would this is not like you know doesn't look like a grimy criminal mastermind operation uh and i'll explain a little bit more about that in a second the funny bit about that uh but basically they seize uh like their computers they they find um a bunch of burner cell phones they find like a bag of like fifty thousand dollars of cash they find a bunch of like the hardware wallets that had the bitcoins in them and then they found like folders on their computer that were like fake passport ideas and like like places to go places to run away like they found like folders that said that [ __ ] on their computers and um and they seized three and a half billion dollars worth of bitcoin because the price of bitcoin's gone up so much so that 70 million has become three and a half billion dollars worth and so these guys were trying to launch they don't think these are the hackers but they were trying to launder that money they may have been the hackers they don't know that's not proven but they were trying to launder the money and the the doj had been like if you've seen that meme of charlie from it's always anywhere they have like the cork board and he's like trying to like find that find the the crime or solve the crime that's what they had been doing because they had this web of all these wallets and finally they found that oh it's trying to cash out in this wallet owned by this guy ilya dutch liechtenstein or whatever but how how did what what type of idiot would use this well eventually you need to get the money so the problem is like they were trying to get the money out through like walmart gift cards they were buying like 500 walmart gift cards with bitcoin they were doing like playstation games they were like they were trying all these small things but they could never move the bulk of the money so if you want to move like in mass you got to do something that had that lets you move size and usually those could you buy an nft and then sell it no well eventually you need to get the money out of the wallet that's the problem so so so the problem so in order to do that there's like an off-ramp right how do you get it into you know us dollars for example if that's what you wanted to do um you know he left it there for five and a half years and they were probably living off and spending in some ways but like you wanted to actually like get a lot of it out and get get it uh remove the paper trail of the blockchain you need to get it as an off-ramp but to get as an off-ramp you have like a you know your id like these exchanges they require you to upload your license and like they have laws they have to comply with called kyc know your customer and so eventually they found that somehow the doj they didn't explain exactly but they they identified that the money was moving towards a wallet that was owned by a known person that's how they ended up finding these guys now the funny part is that's awesome so that well so the i when i read about this i was like wait that name sounds so familiar both their names sound familiar so the guy his name is ilya i-l-y-a i think it was like a very like weird name his last name was lichtenstein so he spoke at the first hustle con i never talked to him but um he had a company called mix rank which was just a normal startup went through yc and he spoke at hustlecon and then his girlfriend or wife she was a copywriter and i remember talking a little bit with her because she her name's heather morgan i think and she had a um a website all about writing sales emails totally is that right remember before the hack did it like a red dress she had like a linkedin post on like five hacks for your your cover letter for your job interview like you know like that sort of thing and so yeah she was doing that she and so they and the funny thing is like the reason the internet kind of went crazy with it was because here you had two very unlikely characters so um we had a bunch of friends text us or text me because i was writing this this edition of the milk road and i was like um anybody know this guy and you you knew him but some other people knew him they're like dude you would never get vibes of like this guy might just go launder billions of dollars like smart like kind of like like his engineer type uh he like showed very little emotion no i did not think that this guy like yeah and and in her she's like this like super strange kanye west level weird uh you know like person she basically she had like an alter ego that was called razzle and razzlecon was her rap name and then she has like these super [ __ ] cringy rap songs on youtube like dude okay i have you know i have you know i think it'd be cool to be a rapper but if i hear myself there's no way i'm publishing that because it sounds so bad you better win come real far but don't know where i'm heading [ __ ] crocodile of wall street silver on my fingers and boots on my feet and so uh it's horrible it's so bad that the top comment was paris hilton i'm gonna prove to everyone that you could have uh that having money means you can rap good and then it said heather morgan hold my beer i don't even know pearson has like a rap song so yeah yeah there's just like she's like one of the strangest characters like i watched i went deep dude for this i was writing this thing and i was like oh let me get some examples and then i couldn't look away because like the the train wreck dude it's like there's videos so uncomfortable and like she she like forced everybody to like they built like this golden mini taj mahal that she sat in and then her bridesmaids lifted it up on her shoulder and brought her in but even though the audience at her wedding is like uncomfortably clapping like off-beat because they're like uh this is this normal there's like there's like clearly only 14 people in the room and then she does a rap performance at the wedding that was like equally cringey and she's just like humping the air oh my god to the guy iliad when he goes dude this freaking guy uh i'm looking at these pictures that's hilarious this woman's really hard to look at she's just friends she's that should have been her wrapping cringe city that would have been like okay i get it you're gonna be the cringiest cool uh that's like henry cejudo the king of cringe uh yeah that's what she should have done like it is super strange but um but yeah basically they recovered it and so now what's gonna happen anyways there's a bunch of interesting little bits to it so the doj is gonna give the money back to bitfinex it looks like bitfinex had when they they launched their own token at one point time called the leo token that's like used in their if you trade in their exchange it'll give you a discount using the leo token so they had to put it a thing when they launched a leo token was like hey if we ever recover anything from that hack um we'll use 80 up to 80 of it to buy back and burn our leo token which will cause like the price you know leo holders to benefit from if we ever recover from this and so now they're gonna get like three and a half billion dollars to buy back so the price of leo token like shot up like whatever sixty percent in 24 hours because people are like oh wow that's gonna be a lot but they said we're not gonna just cause a bunch of cell pressure in the market we're gonna do a controlled sale over like a multi-year period um so that it's like scheduled and doesn't like affect the bitcoin market or whatever um god this is such a good story this would make this is exactly that's what everyone was saying is like here comes you know incoming incoming netflix doc have you seen this i saw i just watched this clip like every day for the past three days and it just absolutely cracks me up i was hoping ben can uh play it in the thing but i don't think it'll work i don't think the sound will come through so have you seen this clip of this interview of bill gates back in the day jumping over a chair yeah have you seen this yeah wait like just the normal one of him jumping just so he's doing some interview with some woman about microsoft and she goes she goes is it true that you can leap over a chair is that that impressive he goes well first of all it is impressive for bill gates to be able to do that second of all just i don't know why this is being talked about and then he goes so she goes is it true that you could jump over a chair and he goes it depends on the size of the chair so you know just like then the cuts it's like a hard cut to a chair and the milk it's clearing it is it true that you can leap over a chair from a standing position it depends on the size of the chair i'll cheat a little bit yeah that's an old clip you've just now seen that i no i came back into my life because i was thinking uh somebody said something like oh yeah you know back in the day or you know in the good old days somebody said some phrase like that and in my head i go what are they even thinking about when they when they say that and i go i'm gonna have i was like what's the funniest back of the day thing and i that clip came to mind and so i decided anytime somebody says back in the day or or you know in the good old days i'm gonna think only of that moment where bill gates says depends on the depends on how i had the chair i always just think of uncle rico the uncle rico clipping napoleon dynamite where he goes i used to be able to throw a pig skin over them mountains all right so listen i did something that i did not think i was ever going to do um so last year in 2021 or no uh 2020 whenever covet happened i launched this course that i i don't even know if i ever talked about it called the ideation boot camp i did it with gagan i invested in this company just like you did in maven you have already done two of them i think and you have a third coming up i decided to launch one i launched one the other day i only talked about it on twitter i've not talked about it on here yet but so if people want to do it it's called the ideation bootcamp and it's basically my research um my research framework and how i research stuff it's but it's uh you go to maven.com so maven how do you say how do you like you say maven it rhymes with like raven uh yeah there you go with an m but with the m at the end no no that's right that's right yeah and you could see my name is on the front page but what they don't have yet and this is what i told gagan they so me and sean both invested in this company and as part of investing in it he made us promise to do courses yeah um which was actually a good kick in the ass because now i actually had to do it and it has been fun but um he needs like custom urls he doesn't have that yet oh yeah yeah it's like maven.com blank slash whatever in order to get to your thing but i just have they made it for me they made a powerwriting powerwritingcourse.com they're but they have to make it for you but i'm doing this thing it i think it's gonna be pretty badass i think i'll continue doing it maybe once a year but maybe i won't ever do it i don't know give an example so give a teaser of like okay so so this is about coming up with a great idea figuring out so coming up with ideas and then picking the ones that seem like better ideas and worst ideas in a short amount of time is that the hook yeah i'll give one old example so basically when trends launched i wrote this article about plants and i'm like man i think someone could build like an online nursery or an online plant business and the reason why i came up with that idea is i read the annual report for 1-800 flowers and they said the of and 100 flowers the big company does a billion or something in revenue so they've got a large perspective and they said that our fastest growing segment is millennials buying succulents online this is growing like crazy and then i looked on at their financials and it looked like the majority of the profit came from people buying accessories so chocolate or fancy pots and i'm like well there's a [ __ ] idea you make succulents and you make it like really cool pots that are artists and you like figure out what the contribution margin is and then what alex said about what did alex say yesterday in the podcast like opportunity of value or value of opportunity like he like phrased it actually better than i phrased it historically but basically you could do a bunch of math it's really like simple arithmetic and you're like in order to get your repeat purchase rate uh the total adjustable market times your contribution margin and like that's how you can come up with a good idea in that space just off that one insight and so that's an example so i just list out all like my frameworks and how i research and it started with reading the reading the annual report for 100 flowers which uh that sounds like the most you know kind of unique starting point for finding not even just finding specific opportunities but just like training your brain to think about the world wider than the way you currently think about it that's that's how i would phrase it because like i don't think you'd necessarily find the best ideas by being like okay i'm gonna go read you know the heart the hbs business school in the harvard business schools annual report and in there i'm gonna find a business idea i think that's a little too hardcore no the way it works is you have this general thing so this general thing is basically what's this combination of things that i'm interested in things that i'm good at and things that can make money all right i know what that general i think is i'm going to go to very particular places to find information that's going to help guide this and what it's going to do is going to help me find a handful of problems that i'm interested in solving and these problems for sure have demand for them i'll give you an example of this how this played out in my life so i invest in this company the guy actually came to our podcast our live podcast show in san francisco which was live in your office very so you know it was a very small crew maybe 50 people 75 people something like that i don't know what it was but it was the very first live thing we ever did and um this guy comes up afterwards and he's like uh hey that was great um and i'm like what are you cool what's your story what do you do and he's like oh i'm i currently run the perception team on the self-driving cars division of uber um he was very charming very good looking i was sold too handsome guy uh ver very confident so he wasn't like hey sean can i just pitch you my idea i'd really just want to tell you like that that's always like uh sure man uh you talk while i think of a way to escape is usually how that conversation goes and so this was different this guy was you know he i was genuinely interested then he started saying things and then i was like oh so he's like yeah but i'm leaving to work on my own startup okay what is it uh what is it uber artificial intelligence guy you know like a guy who works on the ai team at uber and so he was starting his own self-driving car company and he's like you know here's what we're gonna do we're focusing on he's like you know it's funny i i was you know i was looking at what we were doing at uber and he was like what stood out what jumped out to me this is kind of like one of your ideation things it's like sometimes some a stat will come out and um at twitch the ceo emmett he used to call the he used to say sometimes you look at data not for a specific answer but just to find something that makes you go huh or like that's weird it can't be right can it and um and so he used to the ceo and he used to mention like you don't always go looking do it write a sequel query just to get a specific answer sometimes you just browse until something jumps out at you as being like not what you not on trend and so anyways this guy had said 75 of all um uber rides are like you know one passenger going less than it was like 60 60 something percent go or one passenger and 60 were going less than three miles so it's like short trips of just one person inside of a dense city and he's like you know so it's kind of crazy right we have this like four person maybe six percent six-seater car that weighs thousands of tons with a with one driver driving one person one mile like that seems inefficient and so he was trying to create a new vehicle that was like a one-person vehicle one or two-person vehicle that was electric and self-driving and optimized for very short trips and i was like oh that's really cool anyways i invest 50 000 bucks you fast forward like a year and uh you know he's like grinding away in this garage in san mateo uh trying to get a car to drive itself and i would go down to he was working literally out of a storage unit so i would go to a storage container like kind of a what's it called like uh like public storage public storage yeah literally and then he'd roll up the garage on like unit 333 or whatever and then he'd put me in it he'd be like all right let's see if it works and then we drive in a circle around the storage facility a storage like a parking lot and it was like whoa that was bizarre to sit there and just like it was thing driving me yeah so it was working but it was very you know like that's a closed environment it's pretty easy to get that to work but he was working on okay now let's take it out a mile okay now let's go get a sandwich from the shop and like that's what he was doing for like a year so anyways um you at the time the idea the initial idea was like to be kind of like an uber competitor right like somebody will just push a button this ride will show up roll up to them with no driver inside they hop in they actually drive themselves to the location then they leave they just walk out and the thing will drive to the next passenger by itself i was like that's really cool idea we were trying to figure it out and i felt like we were hitting a wall and this is where something like your course will help because if you're oh if you're if all your ideas are boxed into your own life experiences and you're like a you know 27 year old engineer who's worked at you know tech companies like your life experiences are pretty narrow and only once we got out of that and started like figuring out these little like you know like these these these unique spots like when you when you read an annual report you go huh so i was reading an annual report uh we talked to we just took a random meeting we took a random meeting with some transportation lawyer and he mentioned that he does work for this company and i looked up that company and it's basically like this i don't know like 30 billion dollar company that i've never heard of and what did it do they partner with like 15 cities and they go to the city and they say hey um you need buses and scooters and ferries and trains and all that stuff yeah you just commission us we'll bid for your for the right to run transportation in your city and they would get and so this the whole 30 billion dollar company or whatever was like off of like 15 city contracts and then i thought about i was like oh of course like san francisco doesn't run their own buses like you know or whatever not every city is going to want to be in the transportation business they just contracted out to some vendor and i was like man that's an amazing business because that vendor now has lock-in like the city's not going to change so they're just going to like they just get to eat up they have a monopoly on city transport and then that got me thinking about those city bike share programs if you've seen those city bikes awesome and then their annual reports were online and i went and i read about it and city bike did the same model they went to new york and they built like 100 million dollar revenue business doing city bikes in new york and they were the only ones who had the license to do it and they did it in san francisco and then they sold to lyft for i don't know some hundreds of millions of dollars and i thought that's a really cool model and so then we started brainstorming dude could you go to a city that needs this type of transport like a different type of transport than what they already have with their buses and whatever and just say we'll be the vendor for you that's exactly what they did they went to las vegas did it work uh yeah well i haven't talked to him recently but yeah they got a contract basically with las vegas where the city was like yeah we have this thing called a transportation desert it's like a place where our routes don't really go but a lot of people need to go in this area and they're complaining to us about it so you know yeah we'll pay you guys we'll we'll pre-buy you know like quarter million dollars of rides from you um and so it's like instead of trying to get half a quarter million people to download your app like uber yeah whatever you've got one city official to say i'll buy 250 000 worth of rides and that'll last us a few months and we'll see how that goes and that's what you and i do to people so because we just study and break down stuff i think you you and i go through the same discovery and aha moment i hope that our audience does which is basically you see it once you know what's possible or once you know like what other people is possible your standard of what's possible kind of changes and you're like well of course i could do that they did that and they did by doing this this and this i already know exactly how they did it it's like um it would kind of be like me telling you well just go get big muscles it's like i don't i can't get big muscles like i don't know what that means versus like well just lift this weight do it four times a week and and here i'll remind you every single time and you can do it it's like when you know like a specific routine or you know what's possible it definitely changes your perspective on what you should be doing and uh hopefully that's what the podcast does but that's what the course will be doing but uh i don't know i wanted to go sign up maven.com maven.com they'll see your face they'll see my face and it's called the it's cool and then you have one too on the i it's called the ideation boot camp you have one too the the power writing course this is your third time doing it my third time doing it yeah and you did it because you're like uh people liked it i think god said that you have the second highest rated course yeah yeah i forget who had number one and uh you know uh second place is the best place uh would they still have somewhere to reach is it but i'm still at the top i don't remember which one he said it was like either one or two i think we don't uh i don't really care about highest rated because i was like you know honestly people's rating will be more based on themselves like it's just like actually to use your gym example um most people aren't like if you're out of shape it's not because you have the wrong workout program and trainer it's because you know most likely you're not even going to the gym then if you are going to the gym you're not working going consistently if you're not going consistently if you're even if you are going constantly you're not working out with intensity and then comes the program for back buys and shoulders that's going to help you get the most gains and so similarly like i had um it's like yeah we had a high rated course but then i looked at i was like man 15 or 20 percent of people just never showed up to singapore they paid and never showed up like damn that's that's on them like i don't think you could solve that yeah well you know and i and i luckily i was wise enough to not have heartache over that because i was like that's actually just like a completely common pattern with all online education is people don't finish or they don't start for something that they'll even pay a bunch of money for which is really wild so it's like of the people that come what kind of experience do they have and then you know six months nine months later are you still getting emails being like yo i used your thing it was you know i got this outcome out of it that's like that's the only real true measure of success and i don't think if 100 people go into the course it's not going to be 100 people who have that 20 people aren't even going to show up you know 60 60 of them are gonna forget everything within a year or never never implement it and really it's like the 15 to 20 out of 100 that go like use the thing and better they're better themselves yeah it sucks um do you want to talk about this bitcoin bitcoin couple what do you want to talk about uh i have okay so i have a couple ideas and then i have a couple random topics but let's do ideas first um so i want to i want to shout out a couple ideas i saw other people saying that i thought were kind of interesting so uh here's the first one so you invested in this thing stonks.com right i did and uh explain for people who don't know what stonks is explain what it is because it's actually kind of like pretty dope i had the opportunity to invest i know the guy super well who started it uh he was our biggest competitor when we were doing my startup so i was like watching them i kind of saw how they operate so i knew these these guys are really good but i didn't get the idea fully right away and the valuation was really high because they have a good track record so i was like ah okay i'll just pass i'll be a user not an investor you invested so explain what it is yeah so it's like shark tank meets angel list and so angel is a platform where you can if anyone starts a company they can go on and they can get investors and they make it easy so anyone could invest like a thousand dollars into your company and you know what shark tank is and so basically stocks you could spell the like the reason i was like is this gonna work because it's spelled like a joke yeah yeah it looks like it's like smells like a meme and like their logo is like a silly it's like the wall street bets guy but it's uh so once a how often what's the cadence now is it every day or once a week no i don't think it's every day i think it's once a week or so so once a week but then they have like big ones that are once a month and they do some pre-vetting and they find interesting startups and all types of entrepreneur investors are on the phone or on the call listening and they could ping in with a question and the whole audience can watch in real time and so i've been a guest i've been an investor or they call it investors where you're like you're able to ask questions and i've seen people write checks for fifty and a hundred thousand dollars live so the experience is like a live like a twitch channel basically like an auction so a startup goes up they pitch their thing the investor some investors can ask questions in the chat some are asking questions live and then you just see in the chat it's like so and so is investing ten thousand dollars so and so is putting in forty thousand dollars so as i was putting two thousand dollars in have you seen one where people they'll raise like i think somebody raised over 10 million dollars in 10 minutes is that right i think well the company raised 10 million stocks right raised money from guys like me but and then andreessen horowitz just like angel investors and then they let their users invest and they raised like 10 or 15 million dollars in a few hours and so so what is what's cool is you're a founder normally your fundraising is like this multi-month process that you're almost dreading getting started with you're like okay i gotta first get all my ducks in a row and then i gotta start reaching out and figure making a list a pipeline to reach out to then asking people to go out to coffees or asking for intros and following up and then pitching and then follow-up meetings this shrinks that three-month process into like seven minutes on stage that's what's dope about this for the for the founder for the investor it's also a time saver right because and my job is to look at interesting companies so these guys if they're doing the hard work of curating them and putting them on stage and letting me make a snap decision they're creating a demo day basically where they they pack in a bunch of good startups and in theory right and the whole it's either going to work because they curate great startups or it's going to not work because the great startups don't want to do this well how did that's the best when i talked to him i was like oh this is a no-brainer i only invested ten thousand dollars but it was it because i would i would have done more but uh this was early on he was like you know it's twitch for um twitch for angel investing and i've just seen every other live streaming pro with too much battle scars like i've seen so many live stream products fail and i was like bro why are you going into this you know that as well as i do you know like that's so hard to do i didn't really understand what he was saying as the idea and then he i was like so i asked him a couple questions he sent me the memo and i saw the evaluation i was like uh so i think it's a dope idea okay so now here's the the riff on it right so that's cool in and of itself so uh elaine zelby who's been on the pod a couple times before and she has she's uh she's an idea person just like us so she had this idea that i thought was pretty cool she goes stonks.com for other things it's i agree can i tell you what one of our friends uh moyes ali tweeted something and it needs to be for homes stocks for homes like it's because what the the cool thing about stonks is you could see what other what questions other smart people are asking and with cars so bring a bring a bring a trailer my favorite car website it has a comment section and i could see what smart people are asking like is this a 67 or a a 1967 or a 1968 because the 1967's offered this thing and the real collector's items at 68. you know what i'm just picking that up but with and with houses it's the same thing like i i remember our home like our realtor was saying like is this made out of stucco or this other thing and i'm like i don't know what any of that is and then they're like did you guys like spray the installation or is it like i'm like i i don't know what that means i i i wish i could see like what questions i knew smart people were asking and i wish you could do that live okay i wish i could i wish and then you could have an up vote and up vote and i think i would like it to be for houses so i think uh okay that's interesting the one that she had said that i thought was pretty cool was hiring so stonks.com for people okay so how does that work so okay there's general hiring which is like you know our hiring is like this like large spectrum from like temp staffing where i just need like a hourly employee to show up today and then like tomorrow they may not come back to like craigslist to uh then you get to like linkedin and indeed which is kind of like mass market if i'm a if i'm a you know junior you know or i'm a mid-level marketing manager i might get job opportunities on linkedin or indeed that might be where i go look then you have like angel list like vertical places where it's like if i want a job in startups i won't go to indeed i'll go to angel list because that's where the startups hire or the that's a job board for startups and so then you have this one like really interesting thing and then you have like headhunters which do executive placements and kind of like uh you know how do you find a cmo you hire a head hunter you pay a ton of money and then they get like a huge cut so somewhere in there i think there's an opportunity to let people hire like top talent live like this so if you were able to essentially it's like a reverse job interview so instead of me going and interviewing you know what this kind of reminds me of it's kind of i'll say it though this kind of sounds like a like a like a slave yeah i think you're gonna say you're gonna go there and actually it makes me it makes me a little this makes me very uncomfortable actually like that i mean like a talent auction is that what we're going to call it now dude it's yes at will bro it's like you get paid or not like that's like saying employment to slavery right it's not um so so but there was a website i don't know if you saw it coming out that co it was called developer auction it was controversial for this exact reason so this came out maybe six years ago or so it ended up um it got really hot so what they were doing was they're saying look how developers are talking it was like part of yc or they were they piggybacked on yc in some way i don't remember if they were a yc company or what they did was they were like we're only going to take developers or we're only going to let yc companies hire from this place so it's like if you're a dev who wants to work for a yc company come on to developer auction you get the highest dollar bid because these guys have money and they want great devs which which was just a little bit of icing on the douche cake like you're doing you're doing it yeah you're doing an auction now you're doing it only for yc yeah that's the late that's the cherry on top of the douchebag cake the douche de leche cake yeah so so basically they they kind of did that and so what was happening was developers were getting way more money on this and they also didn't have to do like a multi-week job interviewing process it was like they say hey yeah i was at reddit earlyish first 40 employees i worked on the fraud fraud system and this and this i'm interested in you know companies doing machine learning and then boom job offer and job offer at a 20 premium and developer auction all they had to do was just say they just had to be like harvard they just had to be selective it's like no not any company can just apply here we're gonna pick and then no not any developer can apply here we're going to pick now ultimately i don't think the model worked because they're not like the biggest thing ever now i think they ended up like kind of pivoting or softening it well all talent marketplaces are really hard businesses i think to scale yeah yeah to scale i think that you could have a lot of you can have like you can be a just a recruiter and make millions of dollars a year you could be just a job board to make millions of dollars a year but if you want to be hired.com then it i don't know if it can it's really hard to work so i think the trick here is to do it with something that's visual so okay stonks is cool because it's a live video stream so one question is what in what what category does having a visual screen that's showing you something work way better than a resume that was attached to an email or a job board and so i think like potentially designers or even something like more niche than that like 3d designers video editors graphics something like that like this could be maybe how like the video game industry hires or something like that i don't know there's there's something there to doing this oh that's what she said elaine she said i don't know i didn't i didn't see which exact example she had the example of hiring and i didn't even read on i was like yeah great idea let me just like riff off that that's pretty interesting so i thought that was cool and then i think there's probably some other areas where you could do that and i think the trick is normally the reason live streaming products fail is because the viewers your computer like you don't want to compete for viewers with people who are just doing this for leisure um because they have a ton of options they can just open tick tock they can you know go for a walk they can do anything you need people you need the viewers of the buy side for this to be their job so that's why actually real estate or real estate investors instead of maybe even maybe it's not just for buying my home that i'm going to live in but maybe it's like multi-family properties get auctioned off in this way and it's multi-family investors that are showing up to to buy pieces of that action or something like that i think i think that would be cool i i think i told you this a hypothesis i had in 2012 or i remember when i was in the apartment business we had like a an apartment finder thing and uh i was like i'm pretty sure that people it's not that far away that people are gonna start renting homes and buying homes without ever seeing them in person like like like uh this was before matterport was around and i think we're there like i i would buy a house would you buy a house without seeing it no i would maybe not mind rent i for sure would rent a place without seeing it yeah uh i maybe would buy but i think i i there's a world i think where we're gonna buy them soon without ever seeing a house right the other one that's kind of all out of left field here is did you ever watch the zoom bachelor that some of our friends did sheila was the zoom bachelor did you ever watch it uh no i don't watch that [ __ ] though was it awesome in real sports well i just don't watch reality tv you know i watch good stuff it was like it was like just people it wasn't real tv even but it was basically like an object you're shield he's a he's an investor he's single he's a good guy we think he's great and so as a as a joke as a kind of a lark they created a a live stream and they curated a bunch of single women and they were like all right uh and they basically in the course of an hour it was like here's six women they introduce themselves he cuts two it's like all right of the four women now he's gonna ask you a question like all right what's your ideal friday night date what would we do and then one girl's like oh i think we would whatever like just how many times movie whatever there was like i don't know like 500 people live watching it which is a pretty big like live stream channel pretty good um and this was like again it was all kind of done as a joke it was just friends i don't think that any of them really wanted to date each other but it was just like to do the show but maybe there's something like that right the bachelor is one of the highest rated shows ever and then you see stuff like uh there's like a matchmaker show on netflix that's like indian matchmaker or something like that as people pay thousands of dollars to like uh to matchmakers to find like kind of like eligible candidates like that's a that's a that is a niche thing that exists in every city you and i have a friend you have and i you and i have a single friend and i for a gift i nearly bought him a four thousand dollar matchmaker and i didn't end up going through with it because like i don't know if they're gonna like follow through with this and that's too much money to spend if they don't do it and i don't know if they're gonna find it insulting but i was like i interviewed this lady three different times i'm like trying to figure out this would be the right fit for our friend um i think that i think they're interesting i think more people should use that so i think that if there was a private version of this that was you know it was more expensive um well so now we're talking about auctioning off sex yes we're talking about auction off the things people want right so yeah it just happens to be talent sex things like that williams has said this quote ev williams started uh twitter and blogger before that and medium now he uh he goes here's the recipe for a billion dollar internet company have you heard this quote before he goes here's here's the recipe for a billion dollar internet company take a human desire preferably one that's been around for hundreds of years use technology to remove steps and that was his whole thing he's like you know and so he's like that's how i built blogger twitter everything else like twitter took out a bunch of steps for a human desire that people had and um and i think that's just like you know sounds stupidly simple but is actually true let me tell you about something that i saw i did not research this at all for this talk but i wanted to just bring it up because we were talking something about something similar um i'm trying to find i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to manage so i bought this farm i need to like get a manager to help run it and there's these property management companies but they don't really have like the touch it's a little sterile and like to make this work the way i want it to work i want someone that's a little bit more close to it um so in your brain in your head when i think of an outsourced person like what's like the image that you're that i that you get can you just trying to give you can't explain that to me no no just just tell me like outsource vr uh a virtual assistant yeah like i don't know somebody in the philippines or india who's you know sitting at a desk uh you know stepping away for for like in a call center or style style exactly okay now when i'd say um military spouse military spouse what comes to your mind um patriot a woman in america uh white blonde hair uh speaks great english sitting you know in the comfort of her you know her home office uh talking to you know customers what attributes are there uh any loyal organized um trustworthy things like that exactly so there's this company called squared away so google squared away we've talked about the one here before by the way yes we have uh but i didn't get it we talked about one episode we did one we did one episode where we talked about um like a cool way to come up with a type of company that you want is uh who would you want to hire like what demographic you want to hire so who do you want to show right that's another one right yeah you're ultimately gonna be serving a customer and so it helps a lot if you care about them and and understand them and want want more of them to be around you every day so go uh what's it called go squared away i don't know why it's called go squared away or maybe it's just called the business squared away the domain they just couldn't get squared.com probably and it's the most expensive the cheapest tier is two hundred dollars for five hours great copy on this website look at this so what okay great it's great so what's another what's another outsourcing company can we just find like up work like uh go to um let me just google like outsourcing or let's say virtual assistant for uh virtual assistant if they show up on the top of google they might have good copywriting but while you're looking for that so the copywriting on this page so you go to uh squared away it says the best company perk is personal assistance for your entire team our our team of military spouses gives you your time back and it's a picture of a lady holding up her sign waiting for her husband to get off the plane from like coming home this screen so ben open up flexjobs.com this is this is just a perfect example flex job is not terrible right like it's it showed up at the top of google it's not i don't never use the service i'm not saying that i'm saying just the website it's not horrible um but it's not special and it doesn't make you feel anything right so i can't so just compare the feelings okay so and if you're on you should be watching on youtube to be able to see this so if i go to flex jobs i see this kind of like blue and orange tacky site with stock photos of literally men and women in corporate running away running away like we're doing a ballet leap away from you and then it says the number one job site to find vetted remote work from home and flexible job opportunities since 2007. that's that okay great and then it and then it's like good morning america cnn wall street journal whatever okay so this is it's okay and the headline is find a better way to work generic vague doesn't make me feel anything um and you know just the this is this doesn't do it now go back to go straight away go squared away what do they say the best company perk personal assistance for your entire team so already they're selling the benefit right you who's coming here is probably looking to hire a personal assistant um and they um and they focus on they frame it as this is the best perk you can offer your employees instead of just find a personal assistant which assumes you already know you want a personal assistant they sell you the benefit of having a personal assistant that you're providing the best perk for your team then they have this like black and white photo of like a military mom holding a child's hand with a sign you know uh you know like i'm thinking of thinking of you daddy as you know the as he leaves for the plane she's like at an airport hangar right like an emotional scene and she seems like somebody who you would want to support you would love to like help this woman out and that she seems like somebody who you would want not like you know this stock photo of a corporate person running away from you how crazy is that this is beautiful branding because i don't know how many people are in the military but like a military spouse is not like i mean uh that's a it's not that ex uh uh it's not that rare so like i may hire these people for doing all types of jobs and they are a military spouse but as soon as they brand it as i i'm like oh well you definitely are a good person exactly like even though i've i they it doesn't necessarily mean they're a great person but for some reason i think that even though you're a good person you're bringing this company up yeah right bonus points yeah you're you're uh you know you get free free virtue for for having brought this company up as something cool is this beautiful branding or what like why did we even why did we talk about this before we talked about before same thing we were talking about the stay-at-home mom workforce and like how do you tap into that like labor markets that are under underutilized so excess talent that doesn't that's that's looking for a job and we talked about you know what could you do with stay-at-home moms and then we brought this up and they actually shared the clip because they were like hey this was cool we got like featured on this thing and so that's how i remember that we've talked about it before but uh how did we get here what were you talking about so you were talking about that oh well i don't i don't remember we were i think you're talking about like talent right like talent marketplaces and i was and i just i i didn't even research i'm i signed up for uh what's it called get square squared away i entered i'm waiting for them to call me back but i signed up because i but when i went to it i was like oh my god i'm in love i want i want to hire this woman in the picture i need her i hire if i use the service it like washes away the fact that i like don't do compost that i forgot to recycle that bottle and i feel like the woman's just gonna have my back so hard like she's just gonna like just so much loyalty she's not your spouse dude [Laughter] no but she's my partner that's like how i feel and i just thought they don't they this website i've never seen i've never felt this way about a woman oh jonathan brought my wife you were talking about managing your ranch so you were saying you might use this instead or just kind of it reminded you that nobody's doing that in the past space of making you feel the way that this makes you feel about assistance is that right i don't even remember the angle that i had but yes i think i'm going to use this to manage my ranch but i thought i thought that and good example of a landing page so uh all right so let's let's go to another one so can i tell you uh all right i'll do a quick one i just want to get your take on this so i followed this guy uh and i don't know if this is his name because it sounds like a fake name i've been talking to him i just sort of realized i don't know if this is his real name uh but his his twitter handle is pure rich and um and i don't know if he's if his name is pure rich his name is al okay his name is his name is peter richardson uh peter richardson so that's his name uh so anyways he he's uh he's another guy who tried to talent marketplace and now he's pivoted to something sweet so uh he had initially he had a yc company and it like didn't work out and then he like as a like they just needed money and they were like yo we just shut down our company um you can you can hire us we're a yc duo you can just hire us we'll do a project for you for like as a contractor for like two weeks cost money but like you're getting a yc founder duo where can you hire that oh my god and i was like dude this is [ __ ] amazing i was like i would love to hire yc founder duos and i was like if you think about it like some number maybe 20 30 40 of yc companies are gonna shut down and like you know those people might just go get jobs but actually it might be cool for them to like continue to brand themselves as a yc company as a yc founders and be able to be higher be able for hire so they did that for a little bit and i thought that was cool that's how i got in touch with him now he's doing something called cal.com have you seen this it's a competitor to calendly cal dot com great number domain just email all right all right so scheduling infrastructure for absolutely everyone so basically what they are is we've talked about calendly calendly before calendly basically gives you a little a link that's a calendar where somebody can book you and so that's great for like a salesperson who's like uh hey i would love to chat about you know how we might be able to help you out here's a link to my calendar grab a time that works for you and it like lets you go pick a time it emails both of you a calendar invited like takes care of the whole like booking process so calendly had become like a i think a billion dollar plus company uh uh recently two billion dollar company and they're aren't they like weren't they bootstrapped for like a really long time or something crazy they had like yeah the guy was an african immigrant who uh bootstrapped it for like 20 million in revenue raised around at like a billion and then recently raised another round at like two or three or four so that business is working so cal.com i think is a great competitor so i'm gonna invest in this because i believe in this model that they're doing which is commercial open source software so cal calendly is not open source cal.com is is open source what does that mean that means you can hey you can read the source code b you can basically like self-host it so a lot of companies don't want their kind of like data and for information in the hands of another company they like to be able to self-host the software that they're using and also be able to fork it or remix it in some way that like is customizable to them and so these guys are growing fast i switched over from calmly now i use cal is it awesome yeah it's a sick product and you could you embed these on your website so it's like if you have a website you're like i don't know uh you give people you're you're a lawyer you need people like instead of saying here's a contact us form and then one of our humans will reach out to you and then we'll try to schedule a time and by that time you already forgot how interested you were so what this does is do just embed your your booking calendar right here and it reads your existing calendar so it won't let anybody book a time that's already taken and you can set up rules like don't do meeting like i need a minimum 10 minute gap in between meetings or whatever right you set some rules you just embed that right here so in the heat of the moment when somebody's interested you can grab that lead right away to get them booked for a meeting and so do but how do you use it because you're not a company you're so i'll use it either for if i'm going to invest in if i'm if i'm doing talking to founder and it's like hey yeah i would love to chat sometime next week all right you know here's my calendar feel free to grab any time that works for you um and some people find that like offensive whatever i don't know people are too sensitive about [ __ ] like you know just trying to be it's we're trying to try to make it flexible for the other person to pick whatever time works for them without requiring for email back and forth or pawning you off to my assistant who's gonna like take it from here um and you'll have to email them four times to find a time that works and so uh so i use it for that i'll also use it for like random meetings so i'll have a calendly that's just you know like i'll have like you know just backslash sean and i'll put like a one hour of random meetings once per month that anybody on the internet can go book and so those are ways that that i just add a little like randomness and serendipity into my life that's like in a controlled fashion of when when it can happen dude this is cool you they did a really funny flex so if you go to the website you see a thing that says claim your username and when you refresh consistently you see different names in the autofilled example and it's all people who are well known and i bet are investors of the company and you see that and you're like oh well james beshear said neval this person yeah those guys are they are investors yeah isn't that funny how they did that yeah that's cool and i think if you look by the way this is a common model there's a closed source winner and there's an open source winner for a bunch of different categories and software so this is just like a very simple way to find good deals is if you if you missed out or you see a great company that's like completely closed source just google for the commercial open source company and then if they have a great team behind them there's usually like a separate segment of the market that's quite large that they can attack just by going from this like open source self-hosted model these guys have exploded they went from like nothing to a lot of traffic they're growing fast yeah you should invest too i can introduce you yeah do it i would love i love this stuff can we talk about the bitcoin thing please yeah let's do it by the way i didn't even say his idea all right that whole thing wasn't even the thing oh what's the idea what he tweeted out he goes um i wish somebody built this called the anywhere school i think this is just kind of interesting so he goes the anywhere school is for people who want to travel the world but they don't want their kids to education to suffer so here's how it goes and he put out just like a one-page pdf memo of just like here's what it would be if anyone's building this like you know take this and run with it and let me know and so what it was is like you join a classroom but it's a traveling classroom around the world so the classroom's gonna be like we're gonna spend three months this year in paris you know three months in bali and three months in wherever you know like thailand and three months in in south africa and the family and the kids go with it so the kids get a consistent structure the teacher stays the same their friends stay the same but they get to experience a year of world travel and um and so it's like for prep for people who want to have travel but don't want to wait or don't want to trade off their kids stability and education i actually think that's a kind of a cool idea i don't think this is like a huge huge business maybe it's bigger than i think but i just think that's awesome and that should be pretty neat so the anywhere i'm on board and that and and i also think that's a while i was googling anywhere school and uh there's nothing interesting it's a great great name right i think it's a great name it's great okay let's let's do the bitcoin wait really quick before we get to that what were you gonna say about strauss zelnick dude you're gonna love this so you know i i i know so explain who he is yeah so there's this guy named so there's this guy named strauss how do you pronounce this i think it's right zelnick uh i'm i'm just doing this off memory so correct me i think he's the ceo of uh uh take two interactive which is basically the owner or creator of uh grand theft auto and like in like eight other games that are of that caliber so like uh maybe like a five or ten billion dollar a year company that owns like the biggest video games in the world and he's probably in his mid to late 50s and he looks like a gi joe so he's this like jacked dude who gets up at like 5 a.m in new york and works out really hard and a lot of people are invited to go work out with them um but it's all like high caliber get average that's exactly right so he created a kind of like i call it the breakfast club but it's basically like a morning a morning workout club and ben you can google this so there's a a youtube video that's called strauss zellnex invitation only fitness club it's a two minute video so it's just like really easy to watch and you can see basically um when you go to it it's like he goes he goes i made a decision that i was going to treat fitness as a like important part of my schedule so like okay i'm a ceo if i had a board meeting i'm not going to skip it or move it because i'm feeling tired right so he's like i'm gonna treat fitness the same way that i would treat uh like like a like a meeting or family time or whatever like i'm gonna put it like first order importance and then he's like but you know how do i like juice this up and i'm a big fan of this this is a big life hack which is multiply activities so you know like i've done this before too which is you want to hang out with cool people or have friends but you you don't you know you only have maybe like one hour of recreation a day so are you gonna choose fitness or friends well even better let me just find friends who like fitness and let's work out together right you do this all the time i do this too and so what he did was he was like all right we're gonna wake up at five or six in the morning um in new york and they go somewhere and do a different fitness related activity it doesn't matter how fit you are although the pictures that they share like everybody's got like a six-pack everyone's jacked and then it's called like the program and it's basically like kind of networking kind of friends hanging out and kind of fitness all at once uh but instead of being kind of each of them actually that's the wrong way to say it it's it's like the 100 of each of those because when you work out with somebody it's like the new york banker exactly and so they get up they do something different every day and um and he like would pay for it so he's like all right if we're doing this activity like money is not going to be the object that stops somebody from doing this so i'll just cover it for our whole group and we'll just go do whatever the heck activity we want to do and so the guy's in great shape he's like oh i love it because i get to hang out with like a bunch of like really interesting motivated like kind of 20 or 30 year olds that are like pushing me to a be more fit and like don't be the old man but also like these are really talented ambitious people who are who see the world differently than me right and so i thought this is just a fantastic idea and um bev tell me a friend of a friend of a friend of his was was doing it and uh i was invited when i was in new york but for some reason the scheduling didn't work out i couldn't go yeah they get up early that's the beauty of everything right so how do you prevent this from being just the moochers show up who just want you know just the networking and all that you make it at 6am uh and you make the fitness thing kind of hard that's the filter that will self-select for the type of person you want to be around for this kind of thing i just hate working out at 6 00 a.m i hate working out i thought you'd be all about it because you know the harder the better for you i yeah like i would go but like the problem with my my issue with working out at 6 a.m means i've got to wake up at like 5 20 which means i've gotta go go to bed at like nine and if i have to go to bed at nine i'm in bed at nine and i'm so anxious saying to myself if i don't go to sleep now like i'm not gonna be able to wake up and i get so anxious about waking up early that it makes it not funny totally tell you you know what i mean i i i don't work out early i work out as a midday break every day so i i work out like that two p.m every day and uh and actually i pretty much stop working at that point then i come back and i start working again at like 11 p.m or midnight and so i don't have to wake up early and i have a bunch of energy when i do that but the the the takeaway for this for me um the voice in my head when i heard this i go oh yeah i forgot sean build your cult and um i think that's just like the take away i think you gotta build your cult it's like do the things you want to do uh open them up so that others can do them with you do them in a way that's like slightly hard and everybody's making a bit of a everyone's stretching themselves in some way because that's the sacrifice and the buy-in the blood oath that you want in your cult and like just [ __ ] build your cult be around the type person you want to be around dude this is this is why you're building your cult that's a great example i was doing it like general assembly guy what did he do uh daybreaker yeah daybreaker it was like a 5 a.m party with no alcohol you're cold right like what do i want i want to start my day yeah a bunch of energy dance blah blah blah but i don't want alcohol and music i don't like nightclubs so i'm gonna bring i'm gonna build my own cult that's awesome uh all right did you have anything else you wanted to do or should we wrap it sounds good [Music]

i have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote do like this is my life and this is what i like doing [Music] because i never heard of you before and i was like hey this guy is popping up all over my youtube all of a sudden what the hell is going on and b he's saying that this gym i don't know i call that a course which actually is incorrect if there's like one thing that i could make just for the almost for the audience's sake because like we were we were much closer to what a franchise would be um and overall in the very beginning that was what the big decision was like am i going to go the franchise route because i had six working locations i was 26 years old and they you know they worked and that's when a mentor was like you should stop owning all these gyms you need to license the model out and so that was when i kind of transitioned from b to c to b to b um what you might not know is that for two years i actually because i wasn't confident i was like i know it works in my six markets i was like but does it work in all of these markets so my wife and i actually did 32 gym turnarounds in the next two years so we'd fly out in person fix their pricing change how they did their layout change their sales just like a consultant like like a management consultant for a job it's exactly that and then um from there we you know we figured out we cleaned it up to just like completely dial it in um and then it i would love to say with some stroke of brilliance of like and then in my master plan i decided to start licensing um that was not what happened uh we ended up doing these launches and the flaw of the business model was that i didn't control the fulfillment so we would go in we would charge nothing it was pure performance we'd fly in and i would charge 100 of the upfront cash collected uh that we would do while we were there so we averaged about 100 000 in cash collected in 21 days and that's what we would average per gym that would come into so that means each gym is making an incremental 100 grand a month from your so if i were launching eight gyms in one month we would make eight hundred thousand dollars got it right oh that and this was when the model before you were like exactly doing gym live and so what ended up happening though was like and it started scaling really quick i was like [ __ ] this is this is the game like this is what i need to be doing this is awesome and they didn't have to spend money on ads they like they did literally nothing they gave me a place to go market and sell is basically what happened and so what happens we would dip out and then all these customers that we sold would then be fulfilled by a facility that was struggling because that's why they called us so they typically had pretty poor product and i didn't have the bandwidth to stay there for six weeks on top of that and retrain trainers and show them how to set up like i didn't have the time to do because we were marketing some of those times were there and so anyways we would fly out and then what happened in an unfortunate percentage they basically were like hey you signed up and paid this guy 500 i would give you the same thing for 200 refund with him and just sign up and i'll do everything through me and so within a matter of months i had uh like 150 000 in refunds between like three facilities because they talked to each other and then i was like [ __ ] yeah and i already incurred the cost of the marketing the flight the sales guy the hotel rental car everything what was the name of this gym franchise this this gym okay but i'll tell you this the original concept was gym rescue um it's like bar rescue that was kind of the idea um but you said jim motors didn't want to be rescued bingo so who doesn't want to get launched though right so it's gym launch even though you're already open um it's a nice branding switch uh and so anyways we were like okay this is not the model something's wrong here so i had to you basically keep selling more every month to cover the refunds from the month before it was horrible very stressful um and so my wife had a little side training business that she had kept she was doing like three or four thousand dollars a month um and i was like you know what screw the gym thing we know how to sell weight loss uh you know direct consumer that's what we're good at i was like why don't you become the face i'll go in the back and i'll just run the you know i'll run the acquisition side and it will sell like 16 week transformations just over the phone and so we started doing that that's it that that doesn't seem like a good idea does it right i mean it it started working 14 days we're doing a thousand bucks a day uh switching it and um well i just thought it was so crowded we're yeah i mean we're good like we're good at that you know like we that space we understand very well um and so we were able to do that and i was like all right the eight sales guys can come in we could do 8 000 a day selling these like the the the transformation programs great and so i had eight gyms i was supposed to launch the next month um and so i called him up and i was like hey we're not doing the thing we were doing before you know you didn't pay anything so best of luck you know i mean basically it was kind of what it is and then um the first guy was like dude i just refinanced my house i just maxed out my credit cards like i need this my buddy like filled his gym up with you like i know your thing works like i just need i please like help me and so um we heat and hog and finally i was like all right man listen i'll show you what to do i was like but i'm not flying out there to save your ass if you can't close and he was like no no that's fine that's fine and he was like well how much and this that was like the magic moment where i was like uh and so just to show you where i was at the time i picked the highest number i could think of with the intention of getting him to say no because i didn't want to do it and so i said six thousand dollars and he was like done and i was like i just remember looking at the phone and be like holy [ __ ] six thousand dog and so i hung up the phone and then i called the next guy who i was supposed to cancel on same spiel he was like how much i was like eight thousand dollars and he was like what are you giving these guys so that you're giving them a playbook to sell in their market which included what what did they do but you probably actually didn't even know what you were going to give them well so we had already had the entire the entire front end process was super super uh lubricated so like these are the ads these are the pages here's how you place them here's the targeting once they come in these are the five texts that you send here's how the reminder sequence works once they walk in the door here's how you set up your lobby here's where you need to sit this is that's the stuff that a gym owner would send to a client who wants to get trained so it's not a course it's also not like eos it's not like a back-end operations thing it's it's like a marketing machine you would you'd basically like i licensed the acquisition so we were the ads so it was ads that i was in because i was like these ones work so i would run these ads that i had written to pages that i had built and i would and so what i was doing but on on their url you basically were you were a services business 100 were a services business and the training component was like okay well how do you sell so instead of getting one on one i was like one and so what i did was i actually gave them my internal sales training so it was this thing that i put my guys through and like a lot it's kind of interesting because i fell into this where i think a lot of the the e-learning space try and create stuff to have stuff rather than creating uh as as short of a time commitment to get someone from point a to point b which is i needed to get a guy in who used to be selling shape mix from mlm and get him to close 500 deals day one with two hours of training and so that training is what i gave to them so i already had everything i just didn't have the marketing part so all i did was i built the marketing part over the weekend because i already had the ads i didn't make a training for it but the training for like how do you weigh them in how do you do the food stuff how do like all that stuff already made because i had to do that during the gym rescue side so i literally just added in how to run the ads and then the whole product was there and um we helped them implement it implement the acquisition system within the business and the average gym collected thirty thousand dollars in additional cash in the first 30 days so we would do a hundred but them not being as good as us still did thirty thousand dollars additional cash in the first 30 days and so the price point for the for the system was was 16 grand so they were stoked and then at that point we signed three-year licensing agreements for 42 000 a year um so they were like what else do you have and what would happen and what didn't bring their gym because all of a sudden they go from 100 members to 250 in two months and be like how do i hire trainers how do i scale a sales team how do i it'll be like and then all of the other problems emerged and we already had done this because i had six gyms so i was like here's my ads for trainers here's how i train them here's how we set up the classes to maximize square footage here's how we do the ascensions into semi-privates here's and so we just we just did the whole thing what could i google to see one of these gyms i i want to see like like did you do that i know you use click funnels i think i could tell by the favicon because i like click funnels too but you what like can i google something to see one of your uh clients one of your students i don't know what you call them yeah one of their channels look different because they're all they don't they don't take my brand so franchise is system fee name right so we were just system and fit otherwise i'd be operating as an illegal franchise and so let's zoom out for a second so you basically go from for those who don't know the story and i i only barely know the story but the story is you open up a couple gyms yourself so you open up a gym and you get to six locations you're sleeping on the gym floor which is always you know any business i do i'm just to sleep in a garage at least one night so i could say that but uh but you know you know maybe you did the real deal where you actually had to sleep throughout i don't know nine months all right so you're sleeping on the gym for nine months uh you end up getting six locations off of cash flow so you know you're not like you know getting a bunch of investors to come in or whatever and somehow someway you stumble into this like i don't know like a mastermind or a retreat by russell brunson the or i don't know if he hosted or he was just there um who's the clickfunnels guy how did you even get to that event and then i want to ask you a couple questions about it yeah so for for avoidance of doubt i had two partners that after i had my successful gym uh one was the ex-ceo of broadcom number two at broadcom 10 billion dollar company and the other guy had 22 tanning salons and so the broadcom guy brought in the tannic salon guy and was like hey let's scale this thing and i was like awesome long story short the partnership didn't work out um and so i ended up opening the next full three on my own um and i opened up two more with them and then i ended up buying out uh both of them over time so just did you have a job before this because you're only 29 32 i was a management consultant uh before that so i quit my major and then and then started this um the question that you asked though originally was so how did you end up at this thing where it's at this hangout or this mastermind or this meeting where you you realize i'm in the wrong business i shouldn't be running gyms i should be teaching other people how to run run their gyms right uh how did you even end up at that thing it was it was and it was like russell's idea right at least i saw the video it was wonderful i um so the the long story compressed was two years before i went to that mastermind i went to traffic and conversion summit because i knew i needed to like learn more about marketing and like i'm a gym over like i'm not internet marketer i was like not this is not my world you know i mean i was like i got to learn more about marketing so i'm gonna go to this marketing event so i go there and one of the side rooms is russell and he goes and pitches click funnels but he couldn't actually do the stack because they weren't allowed to sell so he did his entire sales presentation and then literally just stopped before the buy button and i was like i want whatever i was like screw the gyms i want to learn how to do this stuff and then like most things because i couldn't buy there was nothing that i did and i went back to my life for two years and that was it and then when i was having some sort of existential crisis because i was now 26 or 27 at the time um you know all the gyms were you know they were making money and i remember like texting one of my managers and i was like hey do you need anything he was like uh i think we're good i need some ink you know and i like ordered my amazon cinnamon ink and then i was done for the day and i was like trying to be useful but i needed to be useful so i googled i was like you know what that russell thing was really cool so out of the blue i google his name and the first link that comes up is are you one of my dream clients or something which was directly to his mastermind so i applied to the mastermind i got sold to the mastermind and transparently i should never have been sold into this mastermind it's for internet marketers and i was the only one and it's like 30 grand right and i was the only brick and mortar business owner there they're like oh yeah tons of motors and i've already told him we laugh about it now but like anyways i show up and i'm like all right all the guys show their funnels and all stuff and i was like yeah i own a bunch of gyms i'm trying to get to ten i've got six so that's kind of i'm just here to learn you know yeah that's where i'm at yeah yeah and so i walked through my acquisition process because we were we were getting 30 to one on the front end so 31 ltv to calculation in the first 30 days right not including my my recurring on the back end and i walked through everything which basically means which means you're making 30 30 x what you were spending on average you get thirty dollars out on cash in the first month yeah so the university launches which is which is like absolutely a good for a lot of brands like one to three over a year would be all right it was insane i mean so it would cost us three dollars to get a lead and one out of five leads would give us five hundred dollars and the reason that it wasn't more than 31 is that that's me giving the average with the sales guys but like when we ran it and i was selling and we were working leads like we'd get 100 it was insane so anyways he saw these numbers and was like what is going on um and so anyways i walked through it and he said the sentence that changed my life which was alex um you shouldn't be running gyms you should be showing gym owners exactly what you showed me and right now you're in a level two opportunity with a level 10 skill set and that would those were the exact words that he said to me and it honestly hit me like a ton of bricks is i was like this is my vision united fitness we're going to be america's next gym we're going to make more healthy like we've got this and um but you know i he he made more money than me at the time and so i was like if i don't listen to someone's advice then why am i paying for it um and i saw an interview with you you said something that i've had this exact moment before which is you meet people who are doing you know on whatever the scoreboard is they're they're they're richer their business is bigger their valuation's higher they're younger whatever so they're more successful quote unquote and uh you meet them and you're like all right there's nothing more special about them than me okay so that's the first realization i want what they have and they're not they don't have something i don't all right so then you know how do i do this and it seems to me like that's what kind of shattered the glass of that whole like business plan that you had was that realization is that right yeah 100 i mean i didn't even know what an opportunity vehicle was i was like what do you mean he was like you should like and i didn't same was that same yeah let me know what that means either yeah i remember i remember when i didn't know what that meant either yeah well i mean i i define that now as uh the number of potential units to be sold and the gross margin per unit possible so it's just one times the other and then the third multiplier would be supply and demand dynamics within the space so like if i were to try to get into telecom amazing tam amazing potential gross profit per unit sold terrible supply demand ratio for me to enter right so it's like how do i measure the opportunity vehicle so those are the three that i used to measure that vehicle and so in this instance uh he was like okay you have all these gems that you can sell you have a huge and the big one that he saw was like the amount of potential gross margin per unit sold was enormous right and so for context our second year of business was in the licensing business we did 26 million top lines 17 million in ebitda amazing wait say those numbers again it was 25.9 million in top line and 17 million in ebitda for the life first i've got a bunch of questions about that that was in year one okay first of all what made you you said that you were getting this thirty to one um uh ltv the cac what what were you doing that was so good just good copywriting are you just a good salesperson on the phone what was so good about you well first off facebook was way cheaper in 2013. you know i mean when this whole thing started right so i mean like just the cost per lead was insane the percentage of people would convert on landing pages was higher everything was more responsive et cetera but from uh from from like what we were doing is we were offering an irresistible offer so we had a free six-week challenge is what we'd offer people when they would come in uh we'd walk them through you know what the program was etc and then the shtick and the reason it was so cool and compelling was that if they lost 20 pounds uh in six weeks we'd give them the entire amount of money back and that's what made it so cool and that's why we got crazy results we had like 70 80 success rates which for a weight loss program is insane and it's because people were basically wagering money um and that was because i didn't know that like wagers are managed by lotteries and like i did like i just it was like you put 500 bucks down you lose the weight you get it back but the reason it works so well is that someone come in so i'd pay i'll walk you through the math so let's say at this point i'm probably paying 10 bucks you know cpm so like and you know so i'm getting and probably like four percent five percent ctrs because it was like back then so i'm getting 50 clicks for 10 bucks right i'm like okay and now my landing page is converting half okay so like it was it was just you know like bonkers like and that's why some of these in some markets we're getting 25 cent leads you know what i mean in some markets like the highest markets back then were like five bucks right and so you've got an average cost per lead of like two dollars which was no you're getting what their phone number was that yeah name phone number email um and so from there we'd schedule usually like 50 to 70 of those people half of them would show and then we'd close um and depend on you know the skill of the sales guy the average gym closes 35 our team averaged about 50 when layla and i sold we averaged 80. um and so there's a big range there but we'd collect the cash up front for 500 bucks and then 24 hours later they'd come in for a nutrition consultation which was complimentary we'd average 200 a ticket in supplements you know creatine pre-workout etc that we'd sell them right after that so we get another 200 pop three weeks later what we do is say hey listen you lost 12 pounds sandy um is that your ultimate goal and then she'd be like well no i want to like get an amazing shape and blah blah blah we're like all right so you understand that it's not about the six weeks it's about six years from now right and she would say yes then i'd be like congratulations you won the challenge you got the point of this and so what i want to do is i'm aligned with your long-term goal too so i want to do is because you won the challenge don't take that 500 i want to spread it over the next year so you get a discount for doing it so we can align with you all fair enough she said sure three weeks after that she gets billed for her first billing so if you follow the money 500 200 and then she gets billed right for the eft even though she won the challenge right right yeah and then six weeks after that we'd say hey wouldn't you like to like have a little bit more attention instead of being in this large group we can put you into a one-on-four scenario we can give you even more stuff we can show you cooler more advanced exercises blah blah and so that was that was how we did it and were you just um but but then this parlayed into the actual product that you really crushed it on right so which was when you were doing 27 million in year two or whatever 20 something million with like 17 million in ebitda on year two that product was the was gym launch right yeah and what was that what did that look like was it what software were you using and how did you package this like that's because i want to get really nerdy on this stuff because i think about that i'm like that's a great idea but packaging a service is that's a challenge that's interesting and i want to so i want to ask you what you did and then i'm going to ask you um what other industries would you do it for so i mean that's what acquisition.com is so it's like it's exactly that like i know how to do this within a within a niche so like b2b services if someone's like i know how to help a lawyer make more money with their law firm i know how to help a bookkeeper make more money with their bookkeeping business i know how to help hair salon you know people make more money with their salons like that's what i'm looking for is niche e-learning service companies um that we can invest in our our good friend jack butcher has a phrase called um build once sell twice and that's basically what you were doing um you were like people who were selling one to one they had to sell then do sell and do you were like no f that we're gonna build one cell a bunch of times and and that like process is what i'm asking about that's interesting yeah i mean that was when i'm sure you're familiar with naval because i know you're on twitter um like i i kind of fell into like it's like you realize why you start making money like i'd love to say it was a master plan like you realize later why something worked so well it's like i had zero incremental cost i was selling cars over the phone and i had no cost of goods like it was insane um and so we basically would onboard people you know we had a concierge service back then this is i mean it's five years ago you know it's been it's been a while um but we do an onboarding process we kick their ads off we basically check in with them we had calls every single day so i would hop on a call with every new customer every day um i did it as a group call but i was always available and then we had a 35 person tech support team that would help them with like the pixels and setting the landing pages up and all that kind of stuff and so because that was that was the issue they would get stuck with was the tech so they could understand the sales they could understand the nutrition stuff they got both of those things for the most part the tech is where they struggled so we really ramped up like our implementation hump um and then on the strategy side i would be there every day to take calls and i took 400 calls over the first year um and so like that was kind of how we did the fulfillment and then but it was like a set of videos yeah there's a set of videos you watch along with like a file a folder a file yeah it'd be like here's how you set up that you know i'd be like here's why you set up the lobby this way this is what they need to see when they walk in you have them sit down here give them this ipad here's the download for the the swipe file of the presentation that they should be leafing through before they come to the office when you come like when you're ready say these things make this joke do this thing when you come inside like sit on the corner don't sit across from them because it seems confrontational uh have them step on the scale make sure they step on it make sure they look at the weight then she cries and you're like okay sit down now listen we're here to help you let's figure this out what have you done so you know i mean like it was very scripted so it's like here's the video explaining it here's the script that does it and then here's six examples of guys in different gyms with different styles of selling because that's one of the things that like we started to learn early on is that i was attracting guys originally like in my team i just had everybody selling my way more or less right and then i realized that a lot of people over time as i learned more about sales like people have different styles of selling and they're just as effective some people are more you know very analytical in terms of like their approach like basically make a logical argument some people just very emotion driven some people just do it off the poor like and so i showed different styles of selling but still following the same framework and so we went away from scripted process to more of a question-based framework which is what we've pretty much stuck with since then and if somebody wants to get good at selling what uh like you know there's a go out there and you know try to sell a thousand times it's one way to get get better but if you wanted to improve your rate of learning what books courses whatever what what youtube videos uh like do you remember that like that really clicked for me and that was like kind of like a game changing uh thing for me and getting better at selling i have relatively stronger beliefs about the topic um so i think first off a lot of people read books before they start selling and i've thought a lot about it and i don't think that's the right path because you don't know what they're talking about yeah like you only know like what the concept of building rapport is until you've not had rapport and like oh okay now i understand how this works but like until you like until you confront the reality like you can't you can't bucket the knowledge into something that's actionable so i'm a proponent of doing first realizing the deficiencies and then going to find the information now to match the the real life scenarios that you have encountered the second part of the question is like which books or things like made things click so um there's one moment that made things click which was i said this in the book sam which is like make people offer so good they'd feel stupid saying no which was the secret of selling right it's like if you just make it so good that they won't say no then it makes your job a hundred times easier and so i did work really hard on that side to make my job easier yeah and i agree with that my problem when i i'm a copywriter a former self-talk copywriter and i knew i know all about that but i'm like uh if people want to refund this is going to be a pain in the butt like if like in order to make this like in order to make an offer irresistible you could you could go a couple different routes but one of them is you just do lots of stuff and when i think about that route i'm like oh my god that's going to be a lot of work i don't know if i can actually execute on that what's an example of that so uh give an example of where you see uh people with a kind of substandard offer and how you would give me and how you would switch it to be a more irresistible offer i mean a simple one we did within the agency space and the software company that we started um was we helped them transition from a retainer model to a pay performance model so that was an implied guarantee and we just said listen pay us one time up front which by the way for most of them was what their ltv was because most of them sucked so it's like if you're charging 1500 a month which would be probably the standard small business b2b you know i would say commoditized price point for a generic lead gen um they're charging 1500 bucks a month we said hey charge a person 5 000 up front day one and say you'll never charge them again unless someone walks in the door and so they'll cover the ad spend after that and you don't get any percentage of it unless someone walks in the door so you generate the leads and work the leads and when the person shows up you charge x and that was based on a pricing survey that we ran internally to our customers where i said if we worked your leads for you what would you be willing to pay as a flat rate and so there was a big pricing curve and the the concentration of like 75 were willing to pay between 300 and 400 a month for that just as a flat service and i was like okay now i asked the exact same scenario same result same everything later on in the survey and i said if we just said hey uh pay per show what would you be willing to pay for somebody who walks in the door for the same exact performance they're willing to pay four times as much and so i said well i'll be why don't we price it that way and so we did it on a paper show model and so that's what we transitioned and it also makes it way easier to sell we could cash flow the acquisition because we were making the ltv that we're not we but like the agencies could make normally upfront day one in cash and what's cooler is that the first 30 days they had people show up so they get cash up front and then in the first 30 days they're still getting cash that they can use to finance the acquisition of the customer right and so that's a much more irresistible offer from a chiropractor it's like well how do i know it's going to work it's like you pay us one time just get all the [ __ ] set up and then from this point going forward only when someone shows up you have to pay and so people understand this you said software company and so i look i mean i watch a lot of your videos so i know this but you basically had like three or four or five businesses the first one was this main one which was gym launch and that was doing like 30 40 50 million seconds down to 26 uh you're so we did 6.8 million year one that was the hybrid between me doing gym rescue and transitioning the licensing model so about halfway through your one i was like this model is not working and so we flipped it and then that's when we shot out like a gun like the first month we did 120 the next month i think we did like two something then it was 360 then 480 then 780 then a million then million two million five like that was literally the next like six months and so that crossed us into the second year of business and then that year we did uh 26 million um so we did six point eight with three million e but a year year one uh the second year we did uh 20 25.9 with 17 million and then year three and this is why i'm a big advocate and this is maybe just my own deficiency but um we did 37 million top line 13.4 million in ebitda so alex made a big [ __ ] up um and was like hey because at this point even though it may sound like there's a short period of time i was like i had heard that i could sell this for like a hundred million dollars so i was like [ __ ] yeah let's do that um three year [ __ ] journey but um anyways and there's this flu that went around people lost their minds it didn't affect the gym space at all that was good um i'm joking uh so anyways uh we started the supplement company prestige labs in december of in december of 18. and you're basically selling supplements to your clients well it's through the clients so they never actually purchased from us directly what we did was we created a drop shipping model because one issue that small business owners have is cash flow so i said what we did was we sent out retail kits that had 130 bottles on them or empty so the result was like 100 bucks and they could stock their whole wall because all consumer research shows that like the more stock the wall is the more likely they are to purchase and they would only have one sampler of all of them out and then we sent them a kiosk with a with an amazon fire on it right that was pre-loaded with their affiliate link so someone would oh my god and they would make the purchase right there and say hey this is so much better because now to go straight to your doorstep you don't need to take it home with you and better yet you won't miss a month because it'll automatically ship to you so we gave the gyms a second recurring revenue stream through the supplement so when someone walks in when i was telling you earlier like some service and we sell them product we'd sell two eft so that's the gym word for electronic fund transfers or recurring revenue so we'd sell them a service recurring and then we'd sell them a product recurring so that we'd have two different streams that would come in the nice thing with the product recurring is there was no there's no operational drag for the gym they don't have to do anything they just have to make the one sale one time and they're gonna make 80 bucks a month from that point going forward pure profit for them like just straight to the bottom line and so what you know interestingly uh a lot of gyms made more money selling the supplements they did on their service because service is low margin but the the product was like almost all marching for them and we paid really aggressively so we paid 40 um commissions to them because they were paying for the cost of acquisition and doing the sale so i said you know you guys should get disproportionately rewarded in the first month we launched that uh so we beta launched in december and then january of 2019 is when it kind of officially launched in the first month we did 1.7 million and so um because i figured i was like okay if we've got you know 800 active gyms if each of those guys sells and who's actually under my projections because i was like we're gonna be you know so wealthy i was like if all of these guys just sell five thousand dollars a month i was like we'll do a million a week um it didn't work out that way but uh we ended up doing that year 37 but my licensing business came down and i think it went to like 20 ish and then the supplement company was like 17. and part of the reason the oopsie that i did was two big oopsies number one was i started a second active company when i already had one which to me i think was a mistake uh given the skill set i had at the time and then the second uh oopsie was that because i thought potential acquirer would want lower churn which is true um i lowered the price and so i thought that if i lowered the price that would get more people stick and so i cut my top line price by 25 and saw absolutely no change and just lost what what was it and what did you reduce it to it went from uh the it went from 800 a week which is the licensing uh on the back end to 600 a week what's 800 a week times 52 i don't even know like what's the annual cost 42. what is it so it costs 42 grand to be a part of your election what do you call it part of your not court yeah but what do you what's like the noun that you use to describe this uh like your the program was called legacy the people were called gym lords and so we would sell launch as a front-end program and then they would go into the continuity which was legacy so if you're if you're if you're following on from home for anyone in the podcast i've copied the exact same model so i sold a six week defined in program for a lot of money and then i down sold the continuity because 16 000 for 16 weeks is a thousand a week and so i said now you're gonna get more for less for eight hundred dollars a week you're gonna get what you have before plus all this other stuff for less money than were currently paying and they're like what a deal at the gym i'd say hey it's 100 a week 600 and if you stay we're going to drop you from 250 a month to 200 a month because we'll take your 600 and we'll spread it over 12 months we'll go 50 a month in credit and so then you get to 199 a month and so it was front end to liquidate the cost of acquisition so they wouldn't need outside capital to acquire customers and then the back end i would down sell the upsell so that we could keep the continuity and make it which is all like the most classic internet marketing [ __ ] which like a lot of like tech startup stuff they don't do this in their fools for not doing it in tech startups we do the opposite typically so we say hey we want to get you in we want to make you don't know us we don't know you let's make the cost of trying so low so free free trial don't even put a credit card on file and then try to put the bar as low as possible you did the exact opposite you said okay i'm gonna put actually more friction up front i'm gonna ask for five hundred dollars or sixteen thousand dollars a huge number up front and then over time i'm going to actually be selling you on more value for less cost why do you think that works or why do you think that worked for you to charge have such a big kind of commit up front when you know that's usually when people are you know hesitant i think there's a couple pieces um one is most software companies have funding not all but a lot of them have funding i did not have that and so i could not afford to be in the negative and incur caught i did i couldn't have a burn rate burn it was alex's bank account so that wasn't going to work for me from a psychological and behavioral standpoint it always made sense to me to sell someone when they're the most excited so you're the most excited day one before you've gone to your first workout because once you get your first workout you're like [ __ ] this is gonna be work so and i'm gonna have to start dieting and not eating the stuff i want sell them when they're excited about the bikini and not about the tsa and the airplane they have to go through to get to maui right and so i followed that and then the reason that we decrease cost over time is because it's my belief that information decreases in value over time and so the longer someone has it and exposure to it the less valuable it is you know marginally and so we tried to accommodate that with the pricing and since our our gross margins were still basically 100 it still made sense for us so let me try something this might be a bust we can go back to the gym stuff this is a bus but let me try something you've said a couple things that i thought were really interesting nuggets i want to kind of rapid fire just say i'm going to just quote you and i want you to riff on it for as long as you feel like doing and then we can switch to the next one all right so i'm going to take one of yours let's let's start with this one passive income is overrated we seek freedom but what we really want is options for engaging activities what does that mean and how did you come to that realization so 2021 uh we sold three companies so we were like i didn't it was interestingly my cfo was someone who's really engaged in those activities and like i was not so i pretty much like took a really passive seat in 2021 because i didn't want to really go start hardcore on on scalingacquisition.com until that was done and so i was born out of which which three companies so allen prestige labs and gym watch so those are my three majority holdings right now i have all minority holdings so between 20 and 33 are the holdings that we target for acquisition um and so i had this i don't want to say existential crisis but more like i'm bored out of my mind i thought this is what i was always optimizing towards which was you know quote freedom which is like you're always you're always outsourcing all of your activities and buying your time back and then you have all your time back and you have nothing to do and i was like this sucks and i look back on the times when i was building into those companies with lots of nostalgia and i was like man that was like some of the happiest times of my life and so that i'm in this position i'm getting back into the game and like right now we're heavily recruiting like we're two days a week we're just doing interviews uh to build the core team out and um i honestly i'm happy as [ __ ] doing this uh and so it's like but the difference between this time and last time is that i have the option to do it that i'm choosing rather than uh because if i didn't have this business i wouldn't have the option to work so i have to create the option for myself and so it's like for me the shift was going from freedom to optionality at least for as i had to understand the word right first you start you do what you have to do to pay for life then you take that money you buy back your time but then you need to spend your time on the thing you want that's the thing and acquisition.com is basically you're buying other you're going to buy businesses and deploy your model what are you what are you doing 100 yeah so we buy an interest and we buy a majority interest in the business um and we deploy the model i mean that's sorry the business is somebody who's doing like what you did for gyms they're doing it for legal or hair salons or something else or photographers that's your latest right yeah that was the that was the fourth company that one we still yeah we have a 20 interest in that company and you say hey i just had a business just like this and i scaled it up i know what it's going to take for you to go national with your kind of like with your business let me take a minority seat and uh let me like help you grow this thing yep that's a great what's a great model what niches interest you i mean really it's just services like i and it's silly because like everybody's like really hot on software and there's all the valuations and stuff but like i may just be a simpleton which is very possible um i just like high cash flow businesses so i just really like service businesses are super malleable i can chase price points i can change a product i can change client experience without a ton of devwork or engineer or ux and and i just like that i feel like they're simple businesses it's very easy to get tons of margin in them if you know how to you know deliver value and so uh right now the the four kind of they're all related but the four targets are e-learning businesses that are in a niche uh brick-and-mortar chains that already have multiple successful locations so they're probably looking at do i do i go national and own them all which is what we we did with the photography business so ironically we actually own we own all of them um which is different with that one uh which we have i think 13 locations and when we started we had one and that was like a year ago so like we're just it's an awesome business that one i think is gonna be worth more than all the businesses that i put together um uh software as a service or tech enabled services uh more tech enabled services that could potentially have some mini you know software component but not as the the main thing necessarily um and then uh and there's a fourth one that i'm just forgetting because i'm on a podcast so you you said that might be the best business what what people are like photography what what is it so what does that do and why is it going to be such a good business so it's a great business um the it's children's photography first off um it has an awesome mission we donated a million dollars last year to kids stuff and so the founders are super mission driven the the short story is their daughter got told at school to shut up um because she was stupid or something and she didn't talk for like nine months and so they couldn't figure out how to get her to talk again and so they did was they started their photographers so they started taking pictures um and put it into like a story experience and read her a story where she was her own hero and so in the story that they put together for her she like gets her voice back and like whatever and so that actually like their daughter started to talk again and so that's why they're like super mission driven around like the donation stuff that they do but the actual business model itself is really really good um i mean people come in and we take you know take pictures and it's really about the it's called magic you know chain of fairies but it's a magical storybook experience um and so it's kind of like the idea of like taking disney um and putting it you know in some in other areas you can walk out with a book but then what's with you in it there's another one of the products we sell there's and you're going to now like teach photographers how to do we don't teach photographers oh i got it so that so this business was interesting so he at the time when he came to me he had one location and he had i think about 100 customers who were b2b who were doing like some sort of like hybrid agency business coaching thing and i really hated the model um and i was like well how much extra does like a photography studio make i'm not going to share the numbers i'll just say it was a lot um uh and i was like how much you charging he was like five grand and i was like all right we're never doing that again so how much does it cost to open a photographer studio and he was like a lot less than it makes and i was like okay well why don't we just front all that and build them all and so that's what we learned sean he uh alex maybe i don't remember how long ago i think recent had a call the headline was like grant cardone just made me a billionaire or something like that it was like a funny headline and he did this he paid grant cardone 30 grand for an hour of time oh yeah pretty crazy and basically on it he record he youtubed the call and on the call he basically you know how like you and i will talk to each other or our friends and you're like hey i'm in the middle of selling this company what do i do and then you also be like by the way like here's my net worth portfolio like is that enough like you just asked all these questions like you know like what do i do now like once i have this like how much should i expect you know like all these like the things that you ask like your rich uncle like as you're growing he asked all these questions and he was so transparent it was uncomfortable almost he said um he goes well look like right now i've got 21 million dollars in the bank after this i should have like 54 after taxes um and he like this is all on youtube it's it's wild why why are you so open about that i think that's that's um cool but uh uncomfortable for you yeah um i it feels like the right thing to do um i think like what are what are the things i'm most afraid of and but usually they're the things that i should do and so it's like i'm afraid of saying this because i it because i know that when i say those numbers people can immediately judge me in one direction or the other but in my mind all the people that i want to talk to think that's a really small number and so i feel insecure saying those numbers but i want to like i'm a big believer that like shame only exists in the darkness and so like if i can shed light on it then i can hopefully quell some level of the insecurities that i have right so yeah but the panda express guy wasn't doing that when he was 32. what are the numbers yeah no like he he didn't like you're saying you think it's small or they they think it's small um age is a fact age and liquidity are huge multiples to net worth so like the fact that you had that at age 30. and cash is way different than owning 10 restaurants it also seems like you know for your model with acquisition the more you go out there as the entrepreneur's friend and entrepreneur's helper and you provide a bunch of value by giving out free content and stuff like that then you're basically creating your own deal flow because of that right like people when they think god what do i do with this business i've learned so much from this guy maybe i could reach out to him maybe maybe acquisitions would be a good partner for me like as the next phase like to me that's the model right that's the why to me aside from like you know like okay this podcast is similar in that sense right we go on here every week we risk getting canceled we risk getting judged as idiots for saying stupid things off the cuff about stuff we barely know about you know we risk all kinds of stuff but the gain is a it's kind of fun to do it and b um you get either people thanking you or opportunities coming your way and you're like all right net net i think that the combination of the the good feels and the good deals uh you know makes it worth it i would i would have to quote that the the big thing with like fields and deals the mission and like this is might be like my personal mission and i don't really understand the value of it because people do like mission statements and stuff but like i think people just put generic ones and they don't like resonate um like my mission through acquisition.com and really my life is like i want to document and share the best practices building built of building wonderful businesses like that is what i want to do and i'm like i will die and the [ __ ] that i accumulate is irrelevant and so like it's a travesty to me that like elon and bezos and warren like they they don't they didn't write any books like like that's i mean that's the point you don't even like it's just as for me for me you know that's real for me uh is like sharing that um and so the businesses are just there to lend credence to what to to the books and the topics and the lessons and give me real stories to drive real fundamental truths from um and candidly to discover them as i go because like i mean i'm horrified at the things that i you know said five years ago that i thought were true but you know the only thing short of that is not saying anything which is is something that i consider every day of like is this this is this is as strong as i can think of it currently you know and maybe i will think of it less wrong in the future were you um you seem like a grinder when you were building these businesses were you just like uh doing 80-hour 100 work weeks and what about now because you're like yolked you're huge you're like a bodybuilder so so like how did you balance like uh being fit and getting married and you but i don't know you well but you seem like you'd be grinding hard so my wife works in the business with me so we are true 50 50 partners like it's very rare i like i recognize how rare it is she actually is 100 matched with me and like should just as much be on this call because she runs the other half like she from a work standpoint she has more output than i did um she is the operator so she builds the infrastructure she does the recruiting she sets the they are the hr stuff she does the culture she like she does i mean she runs everything um i just you know occasionally come up with a good idea and try and stick with it long enough to see it come true but in terms of grinding we this is what we like i love business like i love this and there's nothing that really stimulates me like this and so i do as much of it as i can and if we want to go into dinner we'll go out to dinner you know but like we're we're i was just saying we're single so we don't have kids and so we work from like five-ish to four ish you know um and then you know usually in the middle of the day we'll probably go to the gym for an hour or two and then come back and keep working and go out to dinner at night and that's that's kind of our lives you seem pretty um this isn't i would say i'm a little bit i'm definitely this sean has a little bit of it too like manic's not the right word but like neurotic maybe is a better word um where it's like uh you you're there's something that's deep rooted inside of you that's kind of it's not like you want to do something necessarily it feels like you're it's more compulsive um or obsessed you're obsessed about stuff which i am as well um where if that's true what's that rooted in what are you trying to get done so i think originally the drive was from just crippling insecurity and needing approval right um and then i think from like a behavioral conditioning standpoint i got a media feedback that was positive and then i was conditioned to continue those actions now uh i continue to do them without the original catalyst that got them going to begin with so i don't i don't think i suffer you know from the insecurities as much as i used to i'd say i'm probably 30 better than i was at the beginning and it might just be because i have this massive big pile of money that i can use as an emotional crutch to why i'm not a piece of [ __ ] um that would help i'm just being like i mean if it were all disappeared i'd find out how much actual growth i had or if i just compensated by circumstance and you know compensate for the divisions yeah i don't know you can send it to me and we'll we'll find out we'll see let's run the experiment i like so there's the compulsion and like this last year i pretty much took off like i did not work that much um and so i saw the difference and like i have i have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote do like this is my life and this is what i like doing and their ideals that they've arbitrarily made up as what they define as balance are irrelevant to me you said you took last year off what'd you do what'd you get up to we went out to dinner every single night to a five-star restaurant for seven straight months we went to i mean we we moved to vegas temporarily um we traveled a lot uh went to cabo went to scottsdale went to sedona went to flagstaff um traveled all over um went out did did stuff um felt felt honestly pretty empty like you can only eat so many times like there's just not a lot to do um it feels good having that rest though i mean when i sold my company which was a year ago last week the first six six months i was like i need to decompress it felt good to have it and then and then i was like and i'm in that phase now where i'm like all right now i'm ready for war again you you can't like i i like you can't be in the trenches i think like or rather you need breaks from from being in the from being at war i think and maybe even phrasing it i'm just throwing this out there like phrasing it is instead of like a break is a shift in how you're thinking because like it's really like it's going from dirt to clouds but i still think it's high leverage activity you know what i mean or like output it's just a different type of output you said something on one of your videos that um you're one of the only other people that i have heard say this phrase i use it a lot which is yeah i had a season like or this season i'm doing this or i had a season where i was really just focusing on x and that's been like a game changer for me my personal trainer and kind of coach he's like my mindset coach plus trainer he does this all the time but he's like he's like i'm in a season right now where i'm i'm just uh he'll be like you know i'm practicing not waiting and he's like he comes up with these little themes or he'll be like right now i'm in a season where i'm going to eat whatever i want and it's kind of like in the entrepreneurial world it's like time boxing it's like all right i'm going to give myself two hours to get this [ __ ] [ __ ] done or i'm going to launch in the next two weeks no matter what right like we i've used time boxing for productivity and now this seasons thing it makes every like decision you're making less heavy of a commit because you're like it's okay yeah because there's yeah there's beginnings and ends and this season is gonna feel a little different just like winter feels different than summer that's how i use it do you do you use it like that i just noticed you said that phrase 100 yeah and maybe it's a fitness thing i have no idea um i i've yeah i i have no ownership over here yeah i mean i i think about in terms of entrepreneurial seasons um and i at least for me might have been like five year chunks and so this is gonna be my fourth season um and they've roughly been about the same length so i think that it probably takes me like three ish years to like really see something through and then two years to figure out how i'm going to transition from that thing or realize or monitor you know whatever that's right it's kind of like a pe cycle almost how much of your look do you think is a lot for your success accounts for your success because your face are on a lot of ads and on your youtube videos it's like you looking jacked you've got this in a lot of videos you've got this badass handlebar mustache for the people listening not watching you look i don't know what your what your heritage is but you've got like cool jet black hair you look like uh i don't know you look like a like a like a like an italian lumberjack like i don't know what it is persian all right there it is yeah like you drive a you drive a g wagon but there's an axe in the back so i read a book by dan kennedy five years ago that said that people who have noticeable facial features are more easily recognized and remembered and so i read that and then i grew a handlebar mustache and that actually actually i sold the likeness of the mustache with the company um because it was still a core part of the branding like you know at the events everyone would have stashes it was like money you know stat you know stat cash money stash or whatever you know there's a bunch of different hashtags you had to stop having your mustache after that was you had to stop having just the handlebar mustache because you stole it no but but they were allowed to use it yeah i got tired of having the mustache after five years but but what about like just be cause all right again what do you weigh what do you how tall are you you're huge i'm 5 11 220 okay so uh just when you're getting getting big is it like do you think this is going to look awesome [Laughter] before he started internet marketing right you were built when you started the gym business i saw a video or a photo of you like starting your first gym and you're already jacked so it's not like well i i watched i was i've been working on my squat and i was trying to figure out how what i can make how what the gains i can get in three months and i came across an article that you had when you were in your early 20s i bet and this article the gates that you had in like nine weeks that was the craziest [ __ ] i've ever seen what was that sean you got to like look at this that was natural i like i'll tell you because i'm on trt now um me too yeah so i was i was that was 100 natty um and no in the comments they do not think that that is yeah it's like trend much you know whatever you know i mean um but the that training methodology is pretty much what i've done since then so i had a i had a roommate whose name was greg knuckles he's really big in the strength space [ __ ] amazing name he has his real name greg knuckles yeah and he's he's one of the two smartest people that i've ever met from a pure processing power standpoint like sounds like a mafia guy i mean you know he's you know got a perfect sats when he was 14 like very very bright but also stupid strong like when i met him we were in our 20s and he was pulling 800 like stupid strong and natural and so anyways he was like i read this research paper what if we had you lyft six times a day but for like 10 minutes each time and i was like cool and i lived at the gym so i was like sure whatever so i set a timer and every 45 minutes i would go and do one set on three exercises then i'd go back to work which side note is actually an amazing productivity hack because like i had this nice uh timing i like cadence and i got this nice like boost from my nervous system every 45 minutes to like wake back up and so i did that and that's when i gained just a tremendous amount of weight um but coupled that with another thing that he had done research on which was like a pure carbohydrate diet with no fat and so basically the efficiency of fat conversion to fat that's stored is almost 100 the efficiency of carbohydrate storage into fat is lower and so if you don't have because you're gonna have a calorie surplus and so to give yourself a smaller percentage of that surplus that gets stored as fat you would want a hundred percent of the surplus to be carbohydrate carbohydrates and so the idea was like i had you know 200 grams of protein and like 800 grams of carbs and basically zero fat besides yeah i saw what you were eating it looked like it would be awesome for a day and then horrible after that horrible anybody was like it didn't work i'm like just try eating that now the big caveat to this is like i have what i you know i think i have elite genetics i think like dr cashy who's my closest friend he's a biochemist he's a national strong man he's like you have potato chip genetics he's like you shouldn't give advice to people he's like you can just like drink coca-cola and work out like you'll have a six-pack so like i had that plus i was doing everything maxed out like as i possibly could and like it was not sustainable like my knees were shot my elbows felt like [ __ ] like by the end i was sleeping terribly because i was i was bordering on over training um but i put a ton of weight on and i put a ton of strength to all my main lifts and uh from there what i did was i dialed back the total volume but i kept the split not to get into two fitness stuff but instead of doing uh seven sets of every exercise every day um i just dialed it down to like five and then well i was reading that article while i was listening to your videos and i was like oh man this guy carries this [ __ ] over to everything i understand like it was super precise very like well obviously i think what's interesting about you is you don't have a or maybe you do but you've overcome it a self-limiting belief that a lot of people have and you're like well of course this is going to work you're going to do this you're going to do this you're going to do this you're going to do this and it's going to be hard but that's the outcome is going to be blank and and you here's the plan attack and you took that same process to business yeah i could i could hear it in your voice when you talk about business and fitness and that's why i thought it was cool thanks let's do like uh one thing you one of my favorite things from you is uh these little tick tocks or shorts i see where you're giving like a sales tip or a little sales trick or whatever and um i would love for you i think most people probably you know most people who are listening to this just you know the bell curve of people listening to this probably have spent you know zero time trying to improve their sales and have not seen some of these things so i want to give them the opportunity where they don't got to go click and find this random tick tock that i'm talking about in the ocean of tick tock i want to uh role play a little bit um give us kind of like um give us an example of normal like here's the default way people are doing something and then here's the rephrase of the reframe that has better results i would love to to give get two minutes of learning sales from alex sure and just as a quick caveat to complete the loop from like 40 minutes ago you said like what was the book or training or whatever that so it's my belief if you look at belford you look at bradley you look at grant cardone some of the big sales trainers that are out there almost all of them invariably have the same story which is i started selling and was the best guy on the team by a [ __ ] mile and then i tried to figure out what i was doing and so i do think that some people naturally based on their childhood their upbringings their whatever are just have a higher proclivity for selling which yeah just a gift of gab and and empathy yeah and i think it carries over into how you recruit for selling too because we've built a lot of sales teams and i actually have a very short allowing for people to fail at sales cycle probably much shorter than most people and it's just because i've never had a killer sales person who didn't do pretty well the first week and so for me we you know we turn through this quickly but as a result of that the team is just killers and they know that so i like this quote from from grant cardone he says you know my sales team is a dangerous place to work and i i love that so in terms of uh sale stuff i think that i think people don't know how people are really freaked out about the idea of selling right and so i think the first reframe is like you're not selling you're helping someone make a decision that's going to help themselves and the the the front part of that is that i do think that the number one predictor of good sales is conviction and so fundamentally you have one person who should believe in something another person who does not believe it yet and trust is the thing that transfers that conviction so if fundamentally there's the two things you need you need trust and need conviction most times sales people don't have 100 trust i'm sorry 100 conviction and so the also the idea of conviction as a binary is false so it's not like i believe it or i don't believe it is to what extent do i believe it right and so that's why like in terms of if i want to improve a sales team i can do the drills which we do and that's like blocking tackling but the thing that really juices the sales team is hearing the testimonials of the people that they sold last week and what they're doing today and how their lives have changed and so i noticed this because on my sales teams when we were in person whenever i did weigh out day which is when everyone finished their challenges and everybody was crying and so excited i tried to stack as many sales appointments as i could while people were weighing out and during those days we closed like 100 because people were like dude how can you not think this works it's right there and so the thing is is like you can either trick yourself into having the right tone or you can train yourself and i think that it's much easier to trick yourself into it by just simply believing because if you talk if you truly believe in the product you will talk about it differently and so in terms of an understanding of selling if you need to have conviction you need to have trust trust is going to come from expertise and some level of rapport right and so um i think that overarchingly to help someone sell we just have to ask the right questions to get someone to come to the conclusion on their own and so most sales conversations follow more or less the same framework if you know what you're doing otherwise people are just chasing their tail and trying to chase a prospect to an outcome that the prospect doesn't know how like we've had this conversation a hundred times they have only had it once we should be the one knowing how this conversation's supposed to go right we should also come in with a massive advantage to how to have this conversation go the way we wanted to because we do it on [ __ ] day right and so you know big big front end pieces is like why are they there what's the problem what have they done so far understanding where they failed seeing why our product is different from the things that they failed asking for permission to explain about the product explaining the product not in any way based on features but only based on the experiences that they will have as a result of it and using analogies to explain those experiences right um and then and then having a close at the end which the the tic toc i think that you he references like a no base close and i think a lot of natural sales people do this anyways like if i want something i might be like hey can you do this for me i'm like hey would you mind and they say no they don't i don't mind right like it's natural communication dynamics that most people who naturally know how to persuade people or at least influence do that on their own this is just retroactively looking at it and saying what did i do different like why is this different and um in terms of like overcoming because people are afraid of confrontation right that's what they're afraid of and so i believe that you can sell without ever having confrontation and you can do that with what i like to call childlike curiosity and so if someone says um well my husband's not going to approve that i'm like why wouldn't he like huh that's so interesting tell me more about that rather than like all right let's like your husband's an [ __ ] like that's not gonna work because in arguments no one wins right and so like why why would he think that because because i would think that he wants what's best for you right yeah he wants what's best does he know you're struggling with this right now well i mean yeah he knows i'm struggling with it okay so he wants a special he knows you're struggling with it so why do you think he would be opposed to solving something that that you're currently struggling with so just so i understand would he be happier if you continue to struggle well no it's like well great then would you be opposed to moving forward today and that way and hey if you go home to your husband and you make a joke and the lightning scenario then you close it right and so it's i think child like curiosity is the immediate that you have to train because people get defensive so that is one thing that like fighters talk about when they're in the ring like in the beginning you breathe in too much right i don't know if like if you've been like sparring and stuff like you breathe in you breathe too much you hyperventilate and so the guys who've done it enough they slow down their breathing because when they get things get intense they can slow it down and so i think sales is a lot the same way where you're like your adrenaline kicks in start breathing faster it's fight or flight so you got to be able to slow it down and be like huh that's crazy i wouldn't have thought that okay tell me more about that and like now you're interested and then they don't feel like you're combating them they feel like you genuinely are interested and want to help them which is what you should be doing because you should be them dude only if it makes sense you're exhausted you are full of like interesting insights and like it's like you're you just you you just have you have a you know a lot of [ __ ] and like you've clearly packaged this in really easy to understand ways it's almost exhausting listening because it's like every it's like when you read a really good historical book or something it's like every sentence is packed with a fact yeah and it's like oh my gosh like i cuz i got it i want to pay attention i was like exhausting this is awesome uh but then now i know there's a picture right now that's like like one of the best books i've ever read literally the first 10 pages have more insight than any book i've ever read and i'm only on page 30 because i'm like i'm like rationing this not to like not because i don't i think i'm gonna run out it's like i can only it's like i can only have my mind blown so many times per minute and so i gotta like chill out with this book right now and i'm reading 10 pages at a time then i hand it to my trainer and he reads 10 pages just so i have a two-day break and then we bring it back that's our book club right now and i think it's more like that like what you what you just said which is how many lessons are there to learn right so there's like there's the lesson of like you know guy goes from sleeping on the gym floor to you know like hustling but then realizing i'm hustling a hundred percent or i'm hustling level 10 at a level two opportunity okay how did he recognize that wait what and then people got to ask themselves what level is my opportunity that i'm at right now and you had that formula of like number of units old times gross profit per unit times like you know supply demand dynamics of the market that's like that one nugget alone isn't all these things put down the podcast and go [ __ ] reassess your life all right then we go to the next next space so it's like the part where you're like yeah we charged 500 up front and then we had this continuity thing where we would actually say hey great congrats you've made awesome progress we're actually going to offer you more for less because we want our ltv to go longer and uh we know that that reduces churn blah blah blah and i'm going to do that because the best time to sell somebody is when they're most excited boom nugget two go rethink your sales and pricing strategy you're probably doing it backwards or you know you're not maximizing the opportunity because you just sold to them once you never figured out how to sell the back end then three is you know like you've had five in this session and that that's my explanation of sam sam's weird compliment sam is the king of backhanded compliments he'll be like you're like uh you're like the weirdest looking handsome dude i've ever seen and you're like the guy you know the guest doesn't know what to do they get frozen by the uh the backhanded compliment it's so good well i bet i bet your dear friends when you're with your your non-work buddies buds are they just like dude alex chill i don't care let's just like make a fart joke i don't have many non-uh entrepreneurial friends honestly so you're always able to kind of shoot the [ __ ] with them i guess a little bit and that's how i am mostly with my friends but every once in a while i'm like i'm like i i got i can't talk money related stuff today like i i do i i purposely have to take breaks sometimes one of the things i want to mention that you had said that resonated with me um uh conor mcgregor has this quote where he goes some people will look at my success and get bitter most will get bitter and a few will get inspired and he's like you know that says more about you than it does me and um and similarly you had something in one of your talks where you're like you know if i share you know how much money we make or you know how we did it whatever it's like some people get envious some people get angry some people are skeptical and want to say is this guy a scammer some people get confused like i don't know what the hell this guy's talking about and some people get inspired and i'm here to talk to that group at the end like that last bit whoever you are in this room of a hundred people like the four people who are here to get inspired that's why i'm doing what i'm doing and uh i think that's just a great like question to ask yourself if because we all get stories all day about elon musk and about whatever's going on and you're gonna have some kind of reaction i have it myself sometimes i get envious why should i get envious uh you know like i gave this example i went to i went to vegas and i visited somebody's house who has a eerily similar sim story to you they're in the gym business uh 60 gyms that were super successful then transition their bigger opportunity was real estate they owned the real estate around the gyms and have since made a ton of money and i felt envious because their house was the most baller house i think they lived near the panda guy by the way uh he has a house in the neighborhood that's that's big as well um and you know unbelievable houses like you know you gotta [ __ ] swim in a river to get to the door type of thing uh and you're and i was like and then my trainer helped reframe it he goes he goes oh man he heard me saying i was like yeah i'm feeling you know a little bit envious he goes he just kind of ignored what i said he goes man that's so cool you get to sample you know what you like and dislike so when you make your money you're going to know what you want to spend it on is it their cars or is it the pool or is it that he's like that's so cool you're getting to sample it and just switching switching the reaction to you know instead of envy that i don't have excitement that oh i'm getting to play with all these toys to figure out what i want what i really like what you know i could think about it or look at images on google but like this is way better i get to drive the car instead um and so you know i just think that's a good thing for people i want to leave people with that is like study your reactions and then also if you are sharing information just speak to those who are going to take the positive and don't get so caught up in all the people who are having the other types of reactions to it that's good um even without the hair i still got the guru shawn no that was good i i i'm learning you cut the hair but you can't cut it away i gotta ask you one last question for being a you i don't know you're a business guy who's having a great time on youtube and you're succeeding a lot why is your setup so bad like how do you you are in a room right now that like doesn't have a carpet i think so it's like i could hear the echo you um don't have a microphone you're on your oh my god nice quads uh you're sitting on a on a laptop i think that was sky's out thighs out baby that was a lot of thigh um but you're set up you're set up thank you your setup is horrible for such a uh uh someone who does this for a living what the hell i think i don't do it for a living um you know what i mean the first answer um honestly all the technical i i spent like 80 grand on a studio on in my house in vegas i started in austin and i couldn't get the damn thing to work half the time so i was just like and then i ended up like getting just like immediate annoyance around the idea of having to [ __ ] with it again and so then i realized that i stopped making stuff because i was just annoyed by the idea of having to fix it and so then i was like is it better that i just make the stuff and that'll just be it is what it is and hey if i can dancers yes if i can figure out a way to not have it be a pain in the ass then i will do it but up to this point like i'm literally my video guy got on today he's like dude your video is stopping and freezing for half seconds like 13 times during this video and i was like i don't know and he was like can you just do the laptop when you do the laptop it doesn't freeze and i was like sure whatever you know what i mean and so like it at the end of the day i think it's like the in gym launch when we started uh it's probably maybe a good wrap-up point but like we didn't have a website until we did 20 until after our second year we'd already done 40 million in sales before we even had a website and then we didn't i didn't send my first email until we crossed like 70 or 80 million collected you know what i mean and so like we've i don't know we kind of just do things our own way and if people are down with it they're down with it and if they're like you know what i'd rather have a really polished guy who says less in more time then like go you know i mean that's it's all good it's badass thanks thanks for coming i i've learned a lot sean what do you think this was fun thanks for coming on dude i uh i think people are gonna really like this i'm honored you guys decided to have me on the platform i know that you guys don't take the time of your attention of your audience attention lightly so i want to say thank you for for thinking that whatever i had was worthy of their ears [Music] you

[Music] yeah so got a crazy story for you guys so you might have seen the app wordle recently have you guys seen it yeah your time just bought it you play yeah so new york times just bought it but about two weeks ago one of my friends he's a great mobile app developer bootstrapper he basically was like oh wordle is going viral and there's no mobile app that everyone's using so like the wordle guy had put out this crazy story he put out this story about how he was pure he didn't want to monetize it it was just a toy for his girlfriend it went viral out of nowhere which i don't know if i believe because he works at mischief and like i'm not sure i totally buy that story uh but that was a story to the media so my friend was like holy [ __ ] there's a huge opportunity for someone to build the mobile app uh this guy doesn't own the trademark of the name uh it's kind of like ripped off an old game show so my friend built an app over the weekend called it wordle the app uh went viral so basically like over the weekend got like 30 000 organic downloads was top of the app store and my friend's one of these guys who likes to build in public so he tweets everything he always has he used to like put his portfolio up so you could see everything he's doing and sam by the way this is this is gonna support your build and public thesis uh by the way this is like the perfect case study of why of how you feel about building public which is i like it in theory it's like the face tattoo thing right i like that other people do it i don't want to do it and here's why here's the cautionary tale like when you know when the dare officer brings like you know someone who's like been in jail for drugs to the class before and after of meth like it's like sean explain what wordle is because all i know i don't play word games i play real sports and so uh i'm not i'm not trying i don't waste my time with that so when when people are what is this game it's a game okay so this it's a simple game you you literally if you just the way i get to it you just google wordle first link you click it and it's just five um empty like letters like five squares where you gotta guess guess a word there's no clues it's not like a crossword it's literally just like guess guess a word so you type in a word you might type in like i always start with irate because darmesh from hubspot said the word irate has three vowels plus the letter t plus the letter r so you're getting a lot of common letters there so it's a great start word so you type that that word in and then it'll tell you either it'll either show up gray which means the letter's not in the word yellow which means it's in the word but you got it in the wrong spot or green which is this is the right letter in the right spot and then you have i think five or six guesses to be able to um to get the word in the end and then the beauty of it is at the end it's like you got it you feel the sense of accomplishment the whole thing takes you like two minutes to play the game so it's like really easy to play in that sense and then if you get it right it lets you share that you got it right but it doesn't share what the word was it shares like the like imagine what you're looking at now which is like the word and all these colors but take the letters off it just shows the colors so it'll show somebody else oh man i started off not having any of the letters then i got the t at the end then i got one letter at the end so that's what that's like fourth one i got it right so that's why you see that grid of green uh squares posted on twitter and it started going viral on twitter and again and what what's like the score okay so i'm sorry i just got it moist and did you really just play that are you watching a video i think i heard you this morning i was trying to just do like an illustration you know just trying to get some accurate b-roll all right so i understand so people have been sharing this like crazy and darmesh the founder of hubspot he plays a daily and he even built a competitor to it as well and so your buddy ben levy what's what's this guy's name his name's zach shakheed and what's the name of the app it was called wordle the app so part of the story basically so he goes and builds its app uh he tweets like holy [ __ ] this is the fastest growing app i've ever built you know i've built 10 other businesses they've all done really well but this is the only one that's like growing organically like crazy uh and he basically the wordle creator sees it and he's like yo uh he gets on the phone with them he calls him and he's like hey this just doesn't feel the way by the way this whole thing's just happening in a twitter thread ben sends me the first tweet he's like yo zack's uh because i've met zach through ben he's like yo zach actually cloned wordle next tweet look at this [ __ ] he's tweeted out a graph it's going crazy third tweet um someone someone says dude you just ripped off wordle like you're gonna get whatever suit or something and you know you don't know the trademark for this he goes what trademark and so i'm seeing the tweets in real time and he's bragging he's bragging about how good it's doing and he's like ha like there was no app now i'm dominating this i'm getting all these free free downloads this is amazing he's just tweeting update after update okay so ben pick it back up so then somehow the world guy gets in touch with it so the wordle guy dm's him and he's like yo let's get on the phone and my friend zach is like hey like you don't own the trademark i know nobody owns it there's a bunch of other apps called wordle before this uh but like let's partner or something and the guy's like uh i don't like you know he basically said some version of like i don't do this for money this is just fun uh you know ironically he sells the new york times like a week later but that's separate so my friend gets off the phone with him uh and he's like all right i'm going to talk to a lawyer i'm going to figure out what i should do like clearly there's no ability for us to work together here uh and then like 20 minutes later some big tech reporter dunks on him pretty aggressively and he's like dunks on who your buddy or the original creature jumps on zach my friend and he's like uh he basically says something like wow like app developer has no ethics clones wordle bragging about how he's at the top of the app store uh and then you know when that happens everyone goes and looks at zach's past tweets and he ironically had two tweets so like six months ago he tweeted i hate app clones like someone's cloning my app and i'm gonna like come you know he basically like disputed every app that was cloning his old app and put posted a big threat about how app clones are the shittiest people didn't he call them like scumbags or something yeah he was like there's the scums of the earth that you're copying my app uh and then wait you said you said the word ironic so was he being serious no he was being serious it was ironic that he tweeted that and then he was doing you know and then he was being opportunistic uh and then he also tweeted like at the beginning of the year i have two goals for j for 2022. it's like be more vulgar and make 10 million dollars this year uh so he just gets like proceeded to get dunked on really aggressively and people start buying his domain and or like you know i'm gonna start like i'm gonna dispute every app you've ever made i'm like gonna make sure that everyone knows you're the worst of the worst uh and like so basically that's what happens apple ends up pulling down every single word he calls you right somewhere in the middle here he calls you for some advice right yeah so he calls me in the middle of this and he goes hey this is crazy like app is doing really well i think this is a big business like you know i know bait i know how much these apps convert like free to paid this is just growing organically this is a 10 to 100 million dollar mobile app here what would you do and i was like well i think you know ethically i'm not sure i think you did kind of copy him but i get that like this is version one and you're gonna make it better uh like i could buy that uh but right now you're probably stuck like the mob has you uh but he's like well maybe there's a trumpian version to this where like you know i kind of own that like this is my approach and like i'm doing it there's no change apologize apologize uh put up the white flag take it away right these are options on the table right i can just say sorry i did wrong i could say you know sorry i said what i said and i'm gonna make these i'm gonna change the name i'm gonna make some concessions and then there was go full trump and full trump was like just lean into it and yeah but you could do that and then back down in a non like douche way what you could say is um yeah like look we're not claiming to be innovators here but we are we're executors and so we find things that are great and we make them available for the masses sue me like you know that's like the way that you could take this that's what that's what racket internet says they go we're not innovators we're executors we're operators so how did the conversation go ben when you guys talked about these options yeah so basically i was like you know i think those three options are on the table and he was like yeah but i don't think you know i don't think we're really doing anything wrong like you know yeah there is no mobile app uh so like while people can think that i think it's fine so he basically was like i'm going to double down you know i'm by the way this other guy didn't create wordle there was like you're saying there was a game show back in the day that was the same game he created a web version of it is that right because i think that changes it too which is yeah this guy also copied this show right like and it looks like this guy zach did he re do the app but call it word love well that that's later in the story that's like after wordle got shut down in the app store he recreated a new you know another word game uh let's literally just shut down all the clones yeah they shut down everyone that was using the name wordle after that uh and to clarify yeah there was there was a game show that wordle was based on and i think the guy's story was like i did this for my girlfriend it wasn't for profit so he didn't get crucified for it so and what did apple say why did they say they could just take down all these things or you don't know you don't know why they just there was no statement they just took down every word a lap and said you know you don't own this trademark like you're being taken down because we do decide what we do with you yeah so i'm i'm not a lawyer here obviously but i've done some trademarky stuff and i'm almost positive that someone's going to correct me but i'm almost positive that even if you don't own the trademark if you're like and you can make the argument if you're like the first or the most popular and if there's like a general consensus that like yes when people think of this name they think of you and these other clones or these other people are trying to like steal you know like uh act like they're you the courts tend to favor your side even if you don't own the trademark yeah like yeah just because they don't literally have that trademark there is probably some like you know you would probably win yeah i think i think that's probably true and like he he knew that uh like there was some argument that there's been other apps called wordle but it was pretty clear that like they would have a good case uh so he proceeds to kind of double down on it gets dunked on aggressively like basically you know he doubles down a little bit like says like no like this is based on the game show you don't own a trademark i'm looking at it now uh versions of that and then it goes completely viral like 10th out you know it gets like 10 000 people in the tech twitter circle are dunking on him there's an article why why was his goal be more vulgar for 2020. why was that a goal that's such a random you said that and my mind is still wondering why was that his name does that mean like be more aggressive i think he meant like be more aggressive like when he sees opportunities be more assertive and like you know be as aggressive as possible when opportunities present themselves uh okay which clearly was what this was uh so he went he went hard he got dunked on and basically what happened was uh people bought his dome people squatted on his names zachsterked.com they were like we're going to go vote down every single app you own we're just basically going to attack you oh and so how's this how's this end so i mean basically it ended with him shutting the app down as you'd expect and now he's like making a new word game uh because he likes the word game space but i think his like when i was talking to him about it earlier he was like you know the biggest thing for me is building in public is not always good you know like the fact you know by building in public like i just assumed i you know this was great for me and this is the really dark side of me building in public well dude let's be more specific he had 10 million dollars in his hands and decided that the tweet love for talking about what he was doing was was worth that because if he just stayed as an anonymous developer he just put it under some shell company developer name left it in the store didn't brag about it it wouldn't have got picked up by journalists as like the story isn't that other people there are apps in the store called wordle that are owned by different people that's not the story the story is look at this guy cloning this thing ripping it off bragging about it and then getting [ __ ] on on twitter that's the story so if he just didn't do that then that doesn't get to apple like i think there's a pretty good chance he gets away with it because i know there's a the app store is full of clones like flappy bird had tons of clones every slot machine game there's people don't know this like random apps like slot machine apps are what like produces the most revenue in the in the app store and um and you know nobody really cares about it they're under these like random building company names because you don't talk about it you're just crushing it you shut up yeah it's when you're not crushing it that you want to talk about it as soon as you start crushing it yes when you're doing well you only talk about it when you're not doing that well or when you are doing so well that you think that like you know you can't catch up that's why people are always like why don't you talk about your e-commerce thing like why it's working what do i need what do i need to tell you guys about it for yeah and i also think but transparency like yeah cool i favor transparency uh with people i trust not strangers on the internet like i don't value transparency well it's like if it's my wife or my family or my co-workers all right i'll give you transparency i don't owe you my twitter follower or even my podcast listener to tell you about every detail i'll be very honest with you i tell people things when it's beneficial to me and i don't when i don't and i actually recommend that strategy to anybody there is no like a force that is there's nobody forcing you to tell everybody everything uh when there's no gain to be had for you yeah and there's actually clear downsides and this guy just totally screwed it up if you should have shut up you just got to shut up sometimes and that's really hard this it's the building and public thing man and also it impacted the wordle guy now he got all this competition and he had a lot of stress i think that like when you're doing well you just shut up you don't talk about it you know i think you know part of it becomes your identity like i'm the building public guy so like i do everything in public uh and i think he was just like you know type of guy that's like i'm a really good at growth and i'm really good at building apps and wanted some love for it you know and by the way i recommend this guy's blog or sub stack because he actually uh he does a good job of building in public like he uh ben what was the one that we were we were reading and i remember telling you i was like dude this guy's stuff is actually really good he had like no followers but like uh or like you know not no followers but he had a very small following but i thought his content was actually really interesting he would talk about like all right i'm gonna build this product because of this reason so first thing i'm gonna do i'm gonna go to you know lean domain search i'm gonna get a name generator for this okay i got the name boom now i'm gonna go do this boom here's how i do this boom all right i'm gonna fire up some paid ads look here's the dashboard and like he was actually making progress so he wasn't just like you know stuck in he wasn't just talking theory like he was actually getting users getting revenue and he was very um again he was giving out a ton of value and so i was like oh cool i like to learn all this stuff great thank you very much and uh in those projects the trade probably worked right he got interest and respect and attention and he gave up you know just a little bit of knowledge uh but in this case it did not pay off yeah and he like openly shares all of his app numbers like that link i just dropped zak dot so slash dashboard you can see all of his app numbers all the churn uh so it's a big part of his identity and he's really good at it but you know sometimes it doesn't always pay to be pop to build in public dude cornrows and face tattoos it's cool that other people do it but not for me yeah the other thing is like identity be real careful what your identity is because your identity comes with like you know some serious trade-offs people have an identity and then they'll like uh you know they use it to build a little prison for themselves here's here's my walls and chains that i put on myself by like labeling myself in this way i like to i like people be like oh i thought you said this the other day i'm like yeah change my mind speaking listen you know done speaking of prisoners and building an identity i saw that um someone did a survey like a like a reputable source but i forget who did a survey and they asked they did a survey and they asked young folks gen z who they follow for crypto and nft advice and it was like i think they surveyed hundreds of thousands of people pomp was number one for the most trusted person pomp is like our friend and started out like just a guy on twitter now he's like pretty official how on earth does this guy do so much so he's got a 200 000 person email list who he talks to i think every day every day he's got a daily business show and i think he has like multiple hours of three hours it's a professionally produced morning show meaning like he's there on camera with his brothers they had an agenda a rundown of stories they're gonna cover it's like a news show business news show i think it's called the business news show or some [ __ ] like the best business best business show um and he does it for multiple hours in the morning every morning and i think i was with him and his wife a while ago and she was joking she's like man he writes all of it i don't know how he does it but he writes really fast how on earth does this guy have this much output i uh i have a tremendous amount of respect for that because i know how hard that is and i know there's there's not usually people i look at and i say i can't i couldn't do that and i know when i look at that i couldn't do that um there's no way i could maintain that level of output um at the same time i would not want to do that that is not a problem i want to build for myself i don't think he's going to be able to keep doing it he won't be able to sustain that for more than two or three years yeah that's crazy his he's got like an empire what do you what do you how big is his empire you think you think he's making more money from selling stuff as opposed to actual bitcoin we've speculated on this before so let's i don't know if we we've kind of done this before you want to do it again yeah okay okay fair enough so he's got a couple components right he's got the paid sub stack so he's got the free there's like a free version of it but the daily one i think goes to a paid group ben do you know roughly what the paid size is i think it's like i think it's something like 70 000 people paying like 10 a month or something like that i want to say it's like 70k uh ish so that would be what 700 000 um by the way the the i don't do public math that was stolen from pom pom said that i thought it was [ __ ] hilarious and stole it because i think it's amazing it's amazing rule to live by so he's got about 200 000 people total on his list and he's got i think 70 that are in the paid group so let's just call it that then he's got a job board i think the job board we had heard either heard or we had kind of investigated looked like he was doing about a million dollars a year that's cryptojobs.com or something so then he said all right you learn about crypto for me you want to work in crypto boom uh he also has sponsors on all the new on all the newsletters so at the end of every newsletter it's like thanks to these 10 companies he like rolls the credits and if i had to guess that would be if he has 200 000 free subscribers that would be around between a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars a month in sponsor revenue so we're at um that i think i think what we've just added up to is about two to two and a half million dollars a year and then that stuff the his videos he does about a million dollars a year on his bitcoin course um which i don't think he even shows up for or maybe he does but like i think i think he's got teachers it's like pretty automated um so let's add another million there that's let's say three three and a half million on the course then there's uh investing so investing is probably where the real money's to be made very hard to say kind of what both crypto investing so like buying bitcoin and other tokens as well as investing in companies that serve the crypto economy that's kind of like and he had a fund the fund was pretty big ben how big was the fund uh but he closed he returned hundreds of millions of dollars 100 no that that was the fund he was at before though i think sorry his personal fund which is like the pomp rolling fund or whatever oh yeah i think was like 25 million a year or something like that which is the equivalent of a 100 million dollar fund um so i think he was doing 20 to 25 million a year again these are all plus or minus 50 percent and then youtube got 4 million views in the last 30 days and then his podcast i bet is around where we are but dude youtube at four million views is uh that's like four thousand dollars or something youtube pays like nothing on just the views but maybe his sponsors he's probably because i think his best business show has a main sponsor that's like uh yeah it's so fine because one time i got in trouble because i i disrespected them when they were they well they're not a sponsor anymore right so can you tell the story yeah so basically one time um the the hustle wrote an article about sofi's ceo getting in trouble for i don't remember what it was sexual hurt was it a sexual thing or was it fraud something like that and he in the headline we wrote so fine more like so [ __ ] and they bailed as a sponsor and i told that story on his podcast and he got really uh he wasn't mad but uncomfortable yeah i was like well you just tell him i said it you know you didn't say it i said it so so if i can't you're like a menace yeah the sofa like marketing team so like god everywhere we go this guy comes in so at this point i would say he's in the huge range of five and seven million a year just off like pomp that's income right they're not even counting the sort of equity value that's because there's also bitcoin pizza which was his like uh ghost kitchen he launched what else has there been he's got merch is he a merch i think he's got merch yeah he's got marge what are the other part of his empire of his uh his pomp empire he's got his brother so he's that i really respect that anybody who takes you know anybody who's got the uh when i eat we all eat mentality i respect that and he brought his brothers along so one brother joe he does awesome content about the business of sports his other brothers are his co-hosts for the best business show because when i asked him i was like dude why are you signing up to do this morning show like there's so much work to do youtube show every day for multiple hours he's like yeah but i'm just like it's me hanging out with my brothers shooting [ __ ] busting each other's balls and talking business like that's kind of what i would if i just said what's my ideal life it's like i'll just hang out with my brothers and like you know like i mean i get it i can do that the problem is like let's say you want to take like a three week vacation you know yeah there's a difference between uh i like to do it and i have to do it right and he's he's gonna have to do it it seems like right now with where uh you know you're committed to a schedule um all right you want me to tell you about an interesting company yeah actually one plug there so while ben's here so we uh i don't know when we're gonna talk about the milk road i want to talk about my new new new project that me and ben have launched a new company uh but there is a version of this which is the the one we were like all right this is a great idea but there's one drawback which is you have to write this email every day and it's the same thing it's a prison it's like and we were very conscious about it it's like ben you want to sign up for this this is the prison we're going to choose uh to be in like if this is if this is what we choose fine but let's not get here and be surprised because uh because that's the commitment we gotta make we are every night and so ben at you know midnight after the babies are asleep or whatever it's like you know he's like hey here's the draft for tomorrow morning's email and then i i was up until 2 a.m last night editing the thing and so there's definitely a pain in the ass component to it that's uh you know that i'm experiencing which is one-tenth of what pomp does but it's more than enough for me and you did the same thing man it's hard i like i loved it i mean it to me it it's like i think i told you it's almost like running a marathon or like being in a fight or something it's like you're scared to do it you do it and you get in the thick of it and you like kind of enjoy it and then you get you get to a point where you can take a break and you're like this is horrible i never want to do this again which is how i felt like last year and then you get like six months out and you're like [ __ ] i miss the i miss the action i need to get i need to get into it and so it's really hard to to write a newsletter every single day to do any type of content creation every single day for more than a year is very very very hard really tough uh and we're only what less than a month into it ben what's the uh where are you at in the grind like i think we're giving it a year for like how long you you could tolerate this and and sustain this pace where are you at right now you're only in month one i'm at the still exciting still fun to research and write but i am at the holy [ __ ] shawn's a way better writer than i am point uh but i'm still it's still fun yeah sometimes i i i go into edit i'm like let me just touch up this little wordsmith and then like i overhauled the whole thing because i'm like oh no i think this could be better and i'm like actually it was fine before but like i just can't help myself like last night actually this is an interesting point to talk about at sam actually so so we should say two things one we'll talk about what this company is and why we started it basically every year me and ben have started one company um last year's company was the e-commerce company and we grew that from zero to about 10 million in revenue profitably uh and we and to do that like never had done a physical product before never like never knew how to get things manufactured and all that never had been spending like you know 200 000 a month on facebook ads and being responsible for that return and making sure you don't grow broke so so that was the adventure last year this year we were like what do we want to do and we basically were like whatever it is it's got to be in either crypto or like kind of like teaching slash audience building that's the stuff i like to do crypto's like the topic me and ben are obsessed with and that's why we came up with this thing called the milk road which is basically it's an email you get every day and we just say it's kind of like um it's the way i got it's the way i got good at crypto which was my buddy fer khan who's way smarter than me um he was like he you know he bought ethereum and the crowd sale he bought he was mining bitcoin back in the day like this guy's just been ahead of the curve on stuff he's an engineer and every day he basically just sends me like three links he's like yo check this out you seen this i'm always like no i haven't seen it and then i'm always like wait what is this why is this interesting and he's like oh so the reason this is cool is because abc and he just breaks it down super simple for like a dumb ass like me and i was like dude if i could just take that idea and provide that like as a newsletter like furcon doesn't care he's never going to create a sub stack or a newsletter he's like too smart and too cool for all that [ __ ] but i was like if i could take that idea of like a smart friend just showing you one or two cool things a day that's going on in crypto and explaining it in simple plain jane english i think that that would actually be useful how many subscribers do you guys have so we've been doing it for i think three weeks now and we're at 16 and a half thousand as of today so it's grown like last week we're at 10 000 so this week alone we've grown about fifty percent what was the cause two things we turned on uh paid ads and so you referred or you have you know a guy who uh is good with this stuff he's been helping us out he's really good actually like wait i've tried like five agencies for facebook as this guy's like better than all of them how much are you spending to acquire an email um right i don't want to say that right now but it's in the good range remember when you were like dude back in the day it used to be x now it's y we're getting it for x still but we also aren't spending a ton so maybe as we spend more that's going to go down um but honestly there's such a big appetite for learning crypto because people know people kind of know all right this seems like the next big wave like you know there was the internet there was mobile phones there's iphone and now like crypto seems to be the big wave super hard to keep up with and i know there's money to be made so i think the appetite is there where i think we're going to keep getting subscribers for pretty cheap because the appetite i've never seen an appetite for content like this in my in my life because i've been trying to make content that people want and i'm always talking about [ __ ] i'm into and like you know it's often like the name is good i think the name's pretty good and you're using that platform beehive is that any good beehive's pretty good it's pretty new so like there's a lot of features we need where we're like yo we need to be able to for example if i um do a partnership with somebody or what or somebody plugs us in their newsletter or let's say facebook ads we pay for facebook ads i need to know is that subscriber like worth the same as an organics like are they still opening it 20 days later you know i need to know like based on where they came from are they still opening it to know where i should put my energy spreading the word and so they don't have features like that yet but we're kind of working with them to be like yo help us like good we need x can you build it we'll be your best customer if you can kind of like help us uh get what we need sick i think is i i think it's going to work it just um i think that you'll start seeing well you've already seen progress after one year you're gonna see a lot of progress and then if you continue to do it for three years then [ __ ] really starts to accumulate the media really does compound i didn't believe that it did compound because i'm like well it's not like subscription revenue necessarily but then i realized like yeah but if i like just continue doing this and i get known you like it becomes it compounds in terms of cultural relevance and that usually translates to revenue that's a good point and i've always said this and i've always [ __ ] this up that's the reason i keep saying it as a mostly as a reminder myself like the best advice i get the advice i give the most to others is the advice that i've had this the lesson i've had to relearn five times because i just can't like get it through my thick head and that's that what you work on and who you work with matters way more than how hard you work and put that another way is the most important decision you make is what project to work on and so like i'll tell you like i've worked on some really shitty projects like uh we did a hackathon and we built this app called beer hunt and it was like every time you drink a beer you like take a picture of it you check it in yeah but you don't give a [ __ ] about that and it's like and people got excited why because oh beer everybody loves to like it would get a big reaction any time we told somebody about it they'd laugh and they'd they'd be like oh that's cool i'll send it to my buddy or whatever and so p people liked it who were especially craft beer types but i wasn't a craft beer type and also like i didn't have the filter of like dude if i'm gonna do anything it's gonna basically take up all my time for like three years minimum is this the one right and um and i was treating it like a you know like a hookup and i should have been treating it like marriage because projects are more like marriage really when they like once you decide to do them you're going to do them for multiple years right like and so so i've chosen a bunch i did a sushi restaurant horrible project beer app horrible project tried to build the next big social network and messaging app worked so hard built cool [ __ ] but like the [ __ ] hardest industry to like you know you're just running around with a bottle trying to catch lightning so my project selection has been horrible to date the best project i ever selected was this podcast and then you know the e-commerce one was okay not not great like it's successful but it's more successful just because i got better at business it's still a really hard business to be in and kind of a roll up your sleeves type of business to do i think this is probably the next best like i think i finally did project selection right and the reason why is i think that crypto is as important as like you know mobile apps and iphone was in kind of like 2009 2008 um 2010 maybe and as important as like the internet was back in like 1999 i think that's true and when there's a huge wave happening it kind of doesn't matter exactly what you do you just need to make sure you're out in the water paddling with your board and i had been kind of like i'd been investing and thinking about it but like it wasn't my job it wasn't my job to think about it every single day what this newsletter does like i don't know if the news i don't know if the media business is going to be amazing i think it could be but even if it's not the fact that my job is that every day i have to learn two amazing things like two interesting things about crypto and be able to explain it to tens of thousands of people um that is like that is a job that i think is going to pay off in weird ways i could think i think we're going to get into good investments because people are going to be like oh cool yeah you guys got that big distribution yeah we want you in this project yeah i mean i'm going to find that's what happened with the hustle right and it's like i'm going to find cool projects because i'm literally i have to say something interesting tomorrow morning at 7 am when this email goes out uh i'm not going to say something boring so that means i got to learn something every day so that means i'm turning myself into kind of like a learning machine so that is why i think this is the right project and the reason i share this is because i think it's the most important decision you make in any project you do in any endeavor you do is just at the beginning what project you decided to go go for dude i i i that's wonderful i'm reading three two two books on this topic the first is called wanting um which is uh andrew suggested it that's why i bought it he suggested it on this pod it's called wanting and it's about mesmic desire um genetic sorry memetic desire um and the second one is the daily laws and this it's this daily it's about uh the 48 laws of power and mastery and all these great books by this guy named robert greene but you read just one page a day and the whole first section that i'm continuing reading is like how do you find what you care about and it's really great because the the the thing is is you want to find you want to find stuff where you are able to when you get into it you actually get more energized and i've done a lot of stuff like uh copywriting stuff which i think is fun sometimes but when i do it i'm like ugh i gotta like i'll be like fine i'm gonna get this done by one o'clock on monday i gotta get this done and then i realized one time a couple years ago i moved apartments and i remember the mover coming and i planned for a week so i was like all right we're gonna get all these box we're gonna stack these box here this is how we're gonna move it the move is gonna come at eight o'clock i'm gonna be there i'm gonna lift this up and then i was i i got up at 5 00 a.m because i couldn't go to i couldn't sleep i was like i'm so excited to move and to like physically move these things and set up the new place and i was thinking about that when i was figuring out what i'm going to do next and that's one of the reasons why i'm getting into short-term rentals right now is because i just got it and i think that the the point i'm trying to make is when you're thinking about what gives you energy it doesn't have to be you said it but i don't actually think you meant this this way you said i think this is a big deal and i don't think that's why it excites you it excites you just because the the i don't know why it excites you but like the um literally just like it's a new money that's kind of interesting i don't think it would matter if like everyone's talking about it or not like i i don't know if you if that's what excites you what excites you is like literally the tiny minute details for some reason it's it's just if maybe the math maybe like you're over overthrowing the system something about that is really interesting to you right and so for me i was like i just love moving these [ __ ] boxes and moving into a new apartment i don't know why i love doing that but like i love going out on the street and hunting for places and talking to the guy at the bar like what do you think about this neighborhood are all the hipsters moving here like i love it i get obsessed with it and like i what i was trying to do what i should do next is i was thinking about what do i just get so much energy of and i remember i cannot sleep the day before i've got to move because i'm so excited that's so funny but i think most people hate that but you love it which is why it's even more valuable uh when the thing you get energy from is things that drain other people's energy like bingo you're going to out-compete everybody because for them it's going to be working for you it's going to be play like my co-worker this guy paul gemheim told me this month he goes he was like um i hadn't really thought about this i was really young at the time maybe 24 24 25. and he goes he goes yeah so you should um you should go talk at this event and i was like why is it gonna like give growth to the to our app or like are we gonna recruit people he's like no you should go talk because you love talking right like he's like talking gives you energy so you're gonna love it and i go what he goes he goes yeah it's like um you know for most people if they had to go give a talk in front of a bunch of people they would like they'd be drained by the time they even get up on the stage and then afterwards there'd just be like finally some relief from the anxiety i've been feeling he's like you're the opposite he's like i noticed that he goes he goes yeah he goes he goes it's like going to the gym you know you go to the gym and like if you just look at the math it's like well there's a lot of energy expended working out but how do you feel after you work out you feel yeah you feel physically a bit tired but you feel like your actual spirit feels energized uh like you go give energy and somehow you get energy in that moment and he's like so you know there's some stuff that's energy drains and even though it's not that taxing it's like just thinking about your good think about filing your taxes for like the next 20 minutes watch you'll feel [ __ ] awful by the end of it you're going to need a nap or a drink and it's like on the other hand if you do stuff that gives you energy you know blah blah blah and so you know you can audit your calendar and say i'm a highlight in green the things that i do that give me energy and put in red the things that that suck my soul and um and you know if i want to have a better life i should probably just do more of the green [ __ ] i think that's that's great i think that my i i've talked to a ton of people right now who are messing they're like you know i've made a little bit of a name for myself should i do it in my career but like i don't even like it what the [ __ ] do i do and i'm like ah yeah it's tough but you gotta find where where you have to find what gives you energy that doesn't necessarily mean what makes you happy by the way but what gives you energy totally because it can be really challenging and frustrating at times and you know uh it'll have highs and lows in fact i i i add this channel to every slack that i do so like i just put it in our e-commerce one because we just had like a big low where we got effed over by this like crazy unforeseen circumstances like oh well here's another one and so you know my team they get so bogged down by these highs and lows and i was like guys remember like we we stood in line to get on a roller coaster why are we surprised when there's highs and lows that's what a roller coaster does like if you didn't want the thrill like you know we can go sit in the grass over there we don't have to be on a roller coaster line i'm stealing that and it's like you know so i create a slide channel called highs and lows and i say well now we have a place to put it which is in itself like therapy it's like ah dude this is gonna be an epic low that i put in there and we went we wrote the low and then we started riding some highs that we've had and like it just it's what you should expect don't be surprised when the roller coaster goes up and down when you you stood in line to get on the roller coaster you were excited about going on this roller coaster um you know that's that's what you wanted you wanted the adventure and so um and so you know that's how i think that's like a good tip for really any business that's a great line with the milk road which milk roads the name of the the crypto email that me and ben sent out every day um and like you you go to milkroad.com i bought the domain by the way for 2000 i think it's pretty good pretty good buy right it's a good buy two grand for milk that's a great buy we had milkroad.xyz and it was like such [ __ ] like people couldn't even like the thing wouldn't even load i don't know why but like milkgrove.com so when we started writing this i was like all right i found my thing now i found my thing when i was probably like 32 or something like that right so it took me 12 years maybe to figure out what's the thing that gives me energy and mine was i just want to get paid to be curious and it's like what does that mean it's like i don't know like ever like every day i hear about different stuff or reading about things i'm talking to people wouldn't it be great if just like going and learning that thing was somehow how i got rich and fam richard famous like wouldn't that be dope and like the podcast does that it lets me just be curious i can be like oh someone's making a bunch of money selling turnkey tailgates to universities how does the economics of that work right like that shouldn't be something i'm i get to i get the license to go spend three hours figuring out but the podcast gives me that license and cool it gives me money and fame for for doing it i get power and influence great uh as a byproduct then the second thing the ecommerce one for example does not give me this and that's why i don't think long long term it's for me because it's not me being professionally curious it's like more of an opportunistic thing milk road is that because every day i'm like i like for example yesterday this guy came out with this thing i think you'll find interesting so most of the time people talk about the prices people tell us about a lot of time talk about price of crypto which is kind of annoying once you stay in it for a while but like let's say the price of ethereum right now is about twenty six hundred dollars per per each and um it should be five thousand yeah people people come out and they should be they're like oh like ethan's going to five thousand is going to ten thousand eath to the moon and like nine times out of ten this is you know either hopes and dreams or it's like just click bait like if i say i think bitcoin's going to five million a coin guess what that's going to get covered by a bunch of people and like a bunch of people are going to share it because it's outlandish and hey you know please don't hold me to it what are you going to do i'm just making some far-fetched prediction about the future and the last one is they are like using some weak ass logic like like people do this with bitcoin all the time they're like there are 55 million millionaires in the world and there's only 21 million bitcoin there's not enough bitcoin for the millionaires to all have one so price is gonna go way way up and it's like okay like i understand the general idea of what you're saying but like that's so unsophisticated compared to and this is why like warren buffett comes out and says bitcoin is rat poison or it's pure speculation there's no fundamentals that was like the that's the common narrative so what i thought was kind of cool was um was that um ben just linked an article in the chat where i did the clickbait thing where i said i'm putting 25 of my net worth into bitcoin this is like you know a year and a half ago or something like that and i was like because there's a there's a wave of institutional capital coming in i'm going to front run the wave and it just sounds great and guess what like you know these these news websites you know look at this like cringing with my face with a big one what was the thing that happened all right so this guy came out he's a cr he's like a kind of like a crypto quant uh investor he's got like his own fund or whatever and he said you know i actually think that there's a way to value ethereum like you would value any stock any stock of a company he goes so how do you value a company you value a company based on its cash flows well guess what ethereum has revenue so what's the revenue of ethereum ethereum has revenue because there's transaction fees and um you know peop this is not new but there's something new of like ethereum changed what it does with the transaction fees so now you can value it so for example bitcoin has transaction fees but the transaction fees get paid to miners so as a bitcoin holder you don't get that revenue and the miners all have different expenses one guy's in greenland his expenses are low because the electricity is cheap there whatever so you could never really get the profits the net profits of bitcoin transactions or the bitcoin network because it really wasn't that's not enough it wasn't it was apples to oranges but ethereum has changed what it does with the fees which now lets you create a valuation model so what happens all right ethereum transaction happens let's say it's a hundred dollars for the transaction fee um 70 of that it's called the base fee and do you know what they do with the base fee you know where that goes no i don't know anything what you're talking about to be honest okay so you okay well i'll explain in the most simple terms when there's an ethereum trait when there's a transaction ethereum there's a fee right that's cool visa mastercard everybody has a fee when you do a transaction the ethereum fee gets broken into two parts there's the base fee which is just burned so they take 70 percent of the transaction fee and they just get rid of it why would you do that well this is like when a when a company buys back stock it's a share buyback they basically buy stock on the open market and just get rid of it what does that do it makes le it shrinks the supply of the stock which makes the price go up right there's less supply but there's the same demand so price goes up so so ethereum started doing this thing last year where it takes the fee and it just buys back ethereum and gets rid of it which drives the price of drives the supply down price up okay cool that's the first bit the second bit is there's like a tip that's 30 of the fee uh today that goes to miners but there's a like the way ethereum there's like ethereum 2.0 coming out when it does that that's going to go to the holders of ethereum to the long-term holders of ethereum so that's like a dividend being issued out so now you have now ethereum has revenue which last month that was 1.3 billion in fees so real significant revenue and we know that that go that accrues the value accrues to the two holders of ethereum so what price target did did he put on it so he does a model he does a discounted cash flow model and he basically says based on this revenue based on this multiple and based on the this discount rate the price target for ethereum right now right now the present value of ethereum according according to this model is ten thousand dollars per each ether is trading at two point six thousand two point six k if you believe this guy's model he's under value currently by about four x and he put the model out there so anybody can go change it you can say name uh his name is google to read it what was his name ryan alice and um and so you could say okay maybe he's got really like aggressive assumptions in his model um well actually he just used the average price to earnings multiple of the s p 500 um and he assumed 25 annual growth uh for the ethereum message over the next 20 years which is not like super aggressive right it grew like a thousand percent last year 400 this year like you know it's growing much faster than that right now so you've used pretty conservative estimates now there's always risks right any i i have this phrase i put in my i put in the newsletter this morning which is that you know more fiction gets written in excel than in books um you know because uh you can you can make a excel model dance and make it look great just by tweaking two little variables so you always have to be careful with the stuff you got to do your own homework but i found this to be really interesting because the common narrative is oh it's all speculation it's got no intrinsic value there's no fundamentals there's no analysis you can do on it uh you're just guessing what the next guy is going to buy and that actually is true for most coins and it was true for ethereum until now and one of the best things you can do as an investor is spot when something a common narrative is now no longer true uh those are usually pretty big opportunities so anyways that was i'm up till 3 a.m last night because i'm learning what this guy's model looked like i'm kind of checking it for myself does this make sense to me and i'm putting that in the newsletter it's like hey let me make this simple for you to understand like this is kind of cool um and so even though that's a lot of work that's a prison of my own making that i'm happy to do because i i would rather you're going to be into this though for years i think you will be um that's the big tbd but that's the that's the i think you will for now i'm into it i'm providing a [ __ ] out of value nine months from now 28 months from now am i gonna feel the same i don't know but hopefully we can hire a writer who doesn't feel the same i think with most people even the [ __ ] they love it does get boring sometimes and then what you do is you walk away or you chill and then you you fall in love again i mean i have to imagine that even steven spielberg is like i don't want to make a movie this year right you know what i mean uh i i think is that how they feel i wonder what like nadal or what's what's the tennis player or the uh um rafael nadal yeah i wonder like what he thinks about like tennis or something like that i mean i like usain bolt was like i don't even like training man i'm just doing this because i'm good at it and it like i i like winning but i don't really love i'm not in love with this right now um and like that's normal i think that's natural and you see even like fighters like dustin poirier when he beat conor mcgregor he was like man i'm over this i don't even like doing this anymore i don't even like this anymore tom brady just retired yesterday right and he's like basically he's one he's 44 now so he's been doing this for like you know 20 plus years um professionally and he was like football is he's like i still love the games but football is a 365 days a year commitment for me i don't know if you know about tom brady but he like sleeps every day at like eight p.m i mean he started like the t12 or whatever his thing is called the tea body or whatever his thing is called wanting to come on the path oh really his trainer yeah the guy alex i don't know if his trainer or business partner but like he branded himself as the guy who started it the tv12 method um so uh yeah i think people do get burnt out tony robbins has this thing he says which he goes people's number one need in life is certainty so like you need to know where your next meal is coming if you've got a roof over your head where you're gonna sleep that's why we love relationships because we love the certainty and comfort of knowing who's gonna be there who you talk to what you do every day we love routines he goes but you know god in her infinite wisdom made it so that uh the second biggest need we have is uncertainty which is variety which is it's like a see-saw what do you do as soon as the thing is balanced you start jumping around to mess it up right and like you got to know that about your nature and um and there's like you know it's it's completely normal to enjoy a structured routine and then at the same time crave variation doesn't mean you don't like the thing or it's not cool anymore it's just that that's how humans are wired all right sick let's wrap up here because i've got i've got some stuff that i wanted to cover but we didn't get through today and so we'll save that for monday right okay cool producer ben what did you think of the app good episode uh uh good episode ben levy good edition good story uh yeah solid episode ben your your meme was amazing he did this meme which is like walks into shaun's office for interview is your name ben yes you're hired we're putting together a team if your name is ben and you're talented get it get at us how's your uh what was your what was your numbers in january ben oh i need to look it up it was uh it didn't beat my best month which was um like just below 100. my best month was 97 or something like that and this was just below that what's the latest uh who are you profiling right now what story are you telling uh well i'm still in the middle of walt disney i haven't put out part two yet um so i'm in the middle of that also i'm i'm a bigamist i'm a cheater when it comes to research so i'm also doing a little research on other stuff too yeah so i know a fair bit about walt disney what's like give me one tidbit that's like bet you didn't know this or this is super what i found super fast give me one i haven't listened to that he's optimistic and he went broke and bankrupt a few times right yeah i mean that was the most amazing thing to me um actually the tidbit that like has blown my mind the most um is there's a story where basically they're inventing cartoons with sound and like they're showing it to this audience the audience is going crazy right so they keep showing it to him again and again and again and finally a couple of his animators are like we can't do this it's six hours they've been showing it to him it's two in the morning so they just like go outside of the theater a little bit and they're like smoking and talking and he comes out and he goes yeah what are you guys gonna do you stand out here talking about babies or you're gonna come inside and change the world and it blew my mind because i was like if you just told me that that quote out of context i would have told you it was steve jobs like it was it's so similar and then i just like started putting it i would have thought of sampar when he said uh do you want your kids to have braces [Laughter] so those those are just like two stories that i'm breaking this down now in the second episode the similarities between their stories are actually like kind of uncanny they have a lot of weird similarities yeah isn't it i've always thought that like you could with all types of people that you could basically there's like i i was always trying to think how many categories are there of people because i remember meeting some people i'm like oh you are this you are exactly this human being and after listening to your podcast i remember listening to edison and i'm like oh elon is exactly like that and if i study edison i bet you i can like make sense of a lot of what elon's doing and help predict what he might do and i wonder if you could do the same for like a jobs and a uh a walt disney where you just put them in the same category like i can understand a lot of stuff because of ben this is perfect for your your uh consulting business that you've created off the pod you know those disc personality surveys where it's like you're a dominant you know indifferent or whatever you know like some [ __ ] like that you're a red blue and you can get along with greens uh you just need to do that with like great great people in history it's like you're 42 jobs and actually like you know you're 42 jobs and you're 60 um you know like whatever uh you know walt disney and it's like what does that mean it's like well you're like jobs in this way and everybody just gets a compliment it's like oh yeah i'm 82 percent edison actually and i don't work well with disney's i'm 32 percent wozniak i need to find my job yeah yeah do some like myers-briggs over the top of it i like that um i'm all about making up fake personality uh quizzes i think that's great i gotta run i gotta go get my workout in it's about to snow and get freezing in austin like the first time in a long time so i gotta go doesn't austin like shut down when it snows yeah it's stupid like last year we were shut down for like a week but i didn't have power in water for six days and it was like 20 degrees so it was kind of warranted by the way speaking of one-liners you said an amazing one after we recorded last week uh like like he was just saying that walt disney quote what was the one that you said that our our buddy said he goes remember the lime he goes and this guy's like worth a hundred plus million dollars he said um people hate on get rich quick schemes are they crazy getting rich quick is the best way to get rich why would anyone hate on that i love getting rich i only want to get rich quick yeah he goes you got a good get rich quick scheme for me i love that and this guy like sold his company in like two years so like it was a get-rich-quick scheme it worked that's so funny all right see you guys [Music] you

know if you know the founding story of ethereum the guy who made it this guy vitalik hardcore world of warcraft player he was grinding like crazy he got to level 60 which is the max at the time leveled up his character and earned all this stuff and then the game maker changed the rules of the game they like changed the way the items worked for three weeks he was like inconsolable he was like just so upset he couldn't believe it and he found it so unjust that the game maker owned the items it could just change the rules on her and rug pull them at the last second and ethereum is basically this global computer where you own your own tokens you own your own items you have your own private keys and there's no company the whole platform is designed so that the app makers could never do that to you and he credits that as like a pretty major influence in his thinking and like sent him down a rabbit hole of like why is the world the way it is and how can i change it

what uh what do you do with your money yeah yeah i know you got a ranch uh i think you live here he's had that forever that i mean that was like my house that so it's it's not like it wasn't like a hot uh like a luxury property or whatever like kanye having a ranch in wyoming you actually live there because you wanted to live there sam sam i think has some some similar aspirations um but what do you do are you like i'm an investor you just do something boring with your money what do you do yeah uh well i spent a lot of it on this bookstore uh i i bought two buildings in this in this small town of bastrop uh originally there's gonna be a bookstore in a coffee shop now it's a bookstore and i rent out half of it to a a record store but i wanted i needed like a space to do all my stuff so up top is like my office my wife also wanted me to take all my books out of our house uh so uh that was part of it it was like getting all the [ __ ] out um but no i don't really do anything i don't really do anything with it i invest it [Music] i like investing in things that are very different than internet things so most of it's like in income producing real estate [Music] how do you describe yourself you know i don't do it very well uh you you nailed i i would sort of if i had to say what do i identify as i would say i identify as a writer and then i i sort of have these other things that i do in that are somewhat related and somewhat unrelated but like if i had to sort of only pick one thing or like what what do i feel like i was like meant to do it's it's writing so i identify first as that sean do you remember this did i ever show you this coin i used to carry around i would have it with me a lot particularly in the old san francisco office i had a coin remember no i've never never seen your coin what do you do there's two face of me um no it was it said um what did it say momentous mentor yeah which means like you're gonna die you only live once right by the way don't you love that sam carried it around for years doesn't know what it says on it momentous i knew that it meant like you have to live today like you're gonna die yes right and uh i was thinking about it i bought one for 26 and i was thinking about i was like this is the greatest business of all time i just bought a like a fake coin from ryan for 26 it cost him it was just probably a post like a stamp just to mail it to me so only 50 cents there's not gonna be any returns there's no it's one size fits all and it made me happy and i carried it around and i was like this is the is that the greatest business of all time selling coins it's uh it's been it's been a nice business better than the publishing business right like what's interesting about books is like like the the new book so you spend two years of your life writing something it's like 60 000 words uh you have to you know the publisher is taking managing all of it so you know they're they're the middleman in all of it but like that book is 26 and people if if that book was 32 people would be upset because there's like a a sense of what a book should be right like this is what people are willing to pay and regardless of how good the book is or not it's exactly something of this shape i pay either nine dollars 13 or 2016. yeah right and so one of the things uh as as daley stoic which i started as this email list became sort of uh big if the idea was like okay are we gonna advertise uh are we gonna monetize this via advertising uh or are we gonna like is there stuff we can sell that you know makes it a business to pay for itself and uh as we were thinking about stuff you could do as because i came from the apparel business before i was a writer um i was like we are not doing t-shirts under no circumstances are we doing t-shirts first off because t-shirts uh uh are like are you know it's kind of cheap you know but t-shirts are the worst business you can do so like bands become popular people build a brand the first thing they always think is t-shirts but what i remember is just how [ __ ] complicated t-shirts are first off because you have to get someone to make them but if you sell one t-shirt that's already at a minimum three skus right small medium large if you want to do extra large and and uh extra small okay now five skews and then you're like okay we're gonna do white then we're gonna do black so now you have ten skews right and it's in and then then they don't fit there's quality control issues all so i was like we're not doing shirts and also like shirts even though all of that people will only pay a certain amount for sure because we don't value it as a thing so um i would think i was like i want to make something that's better margins that's less work all of that so i was just really thinking about and then one day i was at the airport i was at the austin airport and i was thinking about this idea of memento mori which is um like if you look at a lot of old like renaissance paintings the philosopher always has a skull on its on his desk um and so there was a philosophical genre of like reminders of mortality and i was like it would be really cool to have a reminder of that what would that be i was like oh i could get a tattoo and then i was like i don't really want to get a tattoo and uh so i was like what could i have and the idea of the coin popped into my head and it turned out to be really cool we actually used this mint in um minnesota that invented the the alcoholics anonymous chip like that you get it like 10 years or 20 years so um they've been in business since 1888. wow that's i think i think we're their biggest customer now um uh and uh that also is a really cool business that i've been fascinated with but yeah that was that was close i'm going to i'm going to ask you about the minutes in a second because i have another mint that i think you're going to get a kick out of but do uh can you reveal how many of those coins you sell a year or do you're not talking i don't want to say exactly how many but like ten tens of thousands uh it's uh a lot of them and and people like i'm giving a talk in marble falls uh next week and like they bought one for each of the attendees so it also became it's a really cool way to like what i'm interested in is not like tchotchkes or like just random ass merchandise but like what are phyllis what are physical manifestations of the ideas that i talk about that could actually provide value in some way so like i have i have this this one on my desk but then the other one uh that i have this for my others this is this one says tempest fugit which means time flies this is like a parenting one it's just a reminder that like to be present as a parent so i kind of start with stuff that would be helpful to me and then if if it works for other people it's good i do think entrepreneurs tend to think about digital products first and not physical products that have good margins and this so that's been really cool well how much does a coin cost you a dollar uh more than that uh because more than that and then there's also packaging and all that all that kind of stuff but um but yeah it's i'll just say it's a good it's a good margin uh but um but uh yeah it's a good mark not as good as a digital product but good enough that business i feel like um you know i have this phrase you you know you you are what you admire which is like if you admire things enough you you end up moving in that direction and that's a type of business that i've really like the thing the the little thing you just said gets like the highest amount of respect for me like okay elon can send a rocket to mars you know steve jobs can [ __ ] you know where's turtleneck and do his thing but an entrepreneur who says well i wanted to create i really was interested in stoicism so i created this free thing to give it away and i didn't know what the business would be the traditional model doesn't really work ads um it would like you know how kind of shitty would a stoicism newsletter be if it was just plastered with ads uh but i did it anyways betting on myself that i'll figure it out and then i figured it out first by having my little framework of like what's a thing that represents this belief that has high margins that has low headache like i have a ddc business with over like 3 000 skews so when you're saying that my body's just like you know inside just shriveling up and dying um and i'm like oh wow how amazing would it be if i had one skew that was just high margin and like i could just make that skew amazing um so hearing you pull that off and uh you know the way kind of like sam has it and people at the conference buy it to me that's like you know top level respect because uh the creativity that that requires and the thoughtfulness that that requires is um is kind of amazing i think most people would just kind of declare creative bankruptcy and say i don't know i don't know how to figure it out and just never never that's why i think shopify is going to be like the biggest company in the world because they like let people do that do you know what i mean like you just come up with an idea and then you know it plugs into a third-party warehouse although i have a fulfillment center here in austin where i do some of the stuff out of the bookstore but just like that you can just come up with stuff and make it and sell it to people is is to me is going to unlock like so much potential um and part of the reason i'm able to have the books to like a physical space is that because most of what i sell online can subsidize like uh in person retail also right sean have you heard of th this story is going to come full circle but not till the end have you heard of stuart resnick stuart resnick no all right i bet you've heard oh i think i know this guy they own the pistachio company right yes so when you go to the store juice or whatever yeah so they own this it's a privately owned company it's probably one of the large linda and stuart resnick it's probably one of the largest uh privately owned companies in america they do multi-billions in revenue his he started like a security business that he sold and he got some money and then now he owns palm wonder like the drink palm drink he owns um pistachios and a bunch of stuff anyway he one of his first businesses after he sold his security company made a little bit of money he bought this thing called the franklin and the franklin mint i knew i knew ryan i knew you're gonna know what this was and the franklin mint basically started out by selling coins eventually they expanded to a bunch of other collectibles but they started selling coins and up until somewhat recently they are one of the largest i think advertisers of digital and uh not digital um print media and so like if you would open up a magazine like a usa like a tv and news guide like the things they were always selling coins and it was franklin mint and he uh sold it for like two or three hundred million dollars when he was done with it and you know who bought it recently was tai lopez oh wow didn't he buy radio shack also and a bunch of [ __ ] he's bought so much stuff hold on i'm kind of stupid what these mint okay is the mint literally a coin factory so they take metal that shape it into a coin of your choosing and then they they sell it uh or they they you know they provide it to you who sells it is that the idea is a coin factory is that what a mint is yeah although the franklin mint is like commemorative quarters and dollars and stuff right but they don't but they do like they do that no but yes they do but they got actually sued because they use like a princess diana coin or they've done like a like a i don't know like some like famous person that like middle american moms like care about you can buy like a coin with their face oh interesting i met this guy who has a very interesting path that like intertwines with the silk road and other things and uh he had said something like he's like yeah what i'm doing now is i'm buying these email lists of like hundreds of millions of people like the you know like the leaked madison read or whatever what it was not massive what's that ashley madison yeah yeah email list for like uh linkedin got hacked cool i'll take all those emails and like you can't you can't really even send to that big of a list it's like too dirty and you'll get like banned or whatever but he like had some like expertise and how to send mass emails and i was like what are you gonna do with this like you start a new thing and he's like oh no i'm just gonna find people who like trump and i'm gonna sell them coins i'm gonna sell coins and hats to trump fans and i was like i was like wow and he's like yeah like if point two percent of my list 0.02 of my list of whatever ever converts uh like you know i'll just make millions of dollars passively sending these emails and i was like wow this is the one of the craziest business plans i've ever heard there's an argument that fox news basically exists for the sake of like reverse mortgages gold coins and other forms of grift like you if you watch fox news just the commercials you get a sense of like just how dumb the audience is to be perfectly honest and then you realize why the content it's almost as if like i heard this great thing about spam they were saying like like you know you get an email from like a nigerian scammer and you're like oh this is obviously spam that's because it's not for you right it's for someone who's dumb enough to to not be bothered by how all the red flags that are there and so well even further it's uh they want people who after they get scammed won't really know how to like have any recourse yes so they won't be able to get back at you and so they filter out all the people who have like lawyers yeah and so when you watch fox news and you get the sense oh this exists to create the kind of customer that would fall for these like obscenely high margin almost criminal enterprises i know this is an exaggeration but but like right on this side of what's legal or not businesses that tend to exploit not very smart or savvy people that's why the content is what it is is to set up the commercial break where people won't buy real things when you turn on pretty much any other form of entertainment you're not seeing those advertisers because you're that's not who it's appealing well this it reminds me of an india uh and i want to do a deep dive on this at some point but there's like india has this culture of gurus right so like in first in terms of gods we have like whatever 50 gods so the then the gods all have like their gurus and the kind of like the saints type of people who give you know genuinely good advice but then they also kind of like do magic tricks and you're like to show that they're like you know you know the the man of god it's like he can produce something in his hand but it's like literally an illusion uh like a magic trick um but the way they work is they have this like virtue virtuous brand of being this person who only wears their white robe and they like don't have any material possessions whatever but when you go to visit them and people i mean there's like miles long lines like going wait like crawling up mountains literally they crawl to show their devotion to get to this person's like thing and then you donate your gold chains you donate like gold and so these guys inevitably get raided by the government because they pay no taxes and they like you know are involved in crimes and they go they find like tons of gold literally like the physical the measurement tons of gold in their house and they have like then they'll like license these like chip brands and like popcorn brands and stuff like that and it's like the face of this guru but he's selling like you know potato chips dude vikram yoga vikram yoga had ketchup i think yeah it's crazy yeah no it's uh it's it's uh it's very strange uh once you get into sort of the back end of how some of this stuff works do you know anyone ryan who's out selling you in terms of coins if it's selling more coins no i mean i do sometimes wonder like when when um when we order like we'll order like you know a bunch of the coins from the from the mint uh which is in minneapolis they'll be like oh no we're really backed up like sorry your order will be like in a couple weeks or whatever and i'm always like who is it who is ahead of me um but but there there is i mean so so i was thinking about it like i was thinking like okay i wanted a reminder of memento mori and then i thought coin um and and it didn't occur to me because i had a bunch of them already so i was probably but there is a genre of there's a thing called the challenge coin that like the military gives out or police officers give out or firefighters give out sometimes it's like a commemoration like you visited this place but like if you did like you know this tour of duty and operation enduring freedom or whatever like they'll they'll often give you challenge points so i think a lot of them are like government clients or um uh like you know non-profits or organizations like that but like i could get them done like we're talking about margins they would be much cheaper for me to make them in in large bulks like from china um but but we haven't done that we've always used this this original place um i wanted to do made in usa but then and then as it happened during the pandemic it was great because it was like we never ran out of stock of any of our products because everything we sell is made in the u.s that's awesome now brian i wanted to ask you because you've done a bunch of different things okay so you're uh you're a college dropout correct you um you worked for tucker max you consulted with tucker max uh robert greene who's the kind of 48 laws of power or whatever um you've written a bunch of books you've you own a independent book shop you got your coin business you sell courses all that you've done a bunch of different things okay so i wanted to play a little game just to get to know you game and um and it's called first worst best best last week okay and basically it's um okay so what was the first job and it doesn't have to be like a job it could be like a side hustle you had so what's the first kind of dollar you earned i worked at it i worked at a deli at a grocery store called obexers in uh in homewood california right on lake tahoe and what were you doing at the day like making sandwiches and i worked in the stock like just like a like a just a kid i was 15 15 15 16 yeah 15 you know just like six dollars an hour whatever minimum wage was uh in california then just a you know kid who worked at a little little small town grocery and what was it like because you make six dollars an hour i don't know how many hours you're working but you end up with like you know a couple hundred bucks after you know a couple weeks that's a lot of money to a kid do you remember like what you did with the money or how you felt about that that amount of money at that time you know what i don't remember what i i was super into snowboarding so i probably bought a snowboard or something um but uh yeah it occurred to me the i was just thinking about this that i've basically worked non-stop since i was 15 years old like uh then i worked at i worked at wendy's after that if i remember correctly that was a lifeguard so i've had like a bazillion jobs but that was that was the first one and then like i feel like at age like 18 or 19 or something stupid you're like the boss of american apparel or something like just like something ridiculous or like at 18 you like worked for robert green writing 48 laws of power well 48 laws of power came out when i was uh like 11 years old but um so not not exactly but uh i did i started working for robert when i was 20 and then i was uh the director of marketing and american apparel like in my in my early 20s so so you when you dropped out you dropped out because what you just hated school or you had something you wanted no i liked school but i wanted to be a writer and so i i had this i was going to uc riverside so uh i was i was working for tucker who was at that point one of the first bloggers to to have a book deal um so i was like i was working for him doing like marketing and online stuff and then he got me a job at a talent agency um where i did like yeesh i could not see you fitting in yeah i was like answering phones and stuff but i worked on like new media uh like so this is right like youtube had just sold um so everyone's sort of interested in internet talent so that's what i was working on and then um this summer i was at the end of that summer that i was working there i was supposed to go back into college and within one week uh i got an offer to to stay on at the talent agency to i was working for this movie producer there to be his assistant uh and then uh i'd met robert greene and robert green needed a research assistant on a book he was writing called the 50th law and so uh why did all these people like you why did tucker hire you when you're 18 what did you what did you do to get hired by him because at that time he's writing basically like funny dating stories and sex stories right like that was like his blog at the time if i remember correctly i think i was very young very ambitious very hard working and i was just obsessed with the internet like what what this sort of internet culture would become um and i loved books like i just i've always loved books and so i i think they sensed that i wanted to be a writer and they sort of went under their wing as like an apprentice in uh you know how to do how to do what they did did you just cold email them so when i met tucker because i was writing for the college newspaper and i wrote an article about him which is what i was doing i would write articles about people in the way that now you'd be like oh i want to meet this person uh will you come on my podcast right um yeah but but this is before pocket so i would just interview people and write articles about them so that's how i met tucker i was a huge robert green fan so i met robert through uh through tucker and then the talent agency uh the guy who i worked for was producing a movie about tucker's book first book so they're all sort of connected and then it was through robert greene that i met dov charney who was the director or who was the founder of american apparel so it all kind of was all swirling about each other and what was the first kind of like personal hustle you did right you're helping tucker achieve his goals you're helping robert green achieve his goals you're helping the talent agency find talent when did ryan go into business for ryan that's a good question um i don't know what like the first thing i would have i mean i started my marketing company in 2011 when i was writing my first book but i think the first big bet i made on myself was um i mean i'd done other like little stuff uh before but the first bit i in 2011 i basically quit at american apparel to go write what was uh my first book trust me i'm lying so that was like the first big bet on myself and that was a hit i mean that was that was pretty it seemed like it took off it got a ton i sold it for a good chunk of money for for at least to me then um it got a ton of attention it ironically it will it sold well but it will earn it will probably earn out its advance uh by this summer which will be the 10th anniversary of it like by the the i'm it's looking like the the royalty statement i will get in july of 2022 which would be the 10-year anniversary of the book it will finally go from pi from negative to positive on the advanced statement what was your advantage i was two 250 uh it was i think it was 200 with some incentives um although when i announced it um i announced that it had been sold for 500 000 because i know i knew people nobody actually fact checks press releases so uh trust me yeah so so the whole point of the book was to prove that like uh the problems i was talking about in the in the media system in the book were real so i i promptly uh doubled the advance when i announced it and and uh nobody nobody checked that's funny did you um so you got a big advance you didn't have that big of a following at that time how did you finagle any advance let alone like a quarter million dollars so it's your first time so the bet on myself was that i i left and i wrote the book first almost all nonfiction is sold uh with a proposal and then you go write the book but i didn't i didn't necessarily need to do that so i wrote the book so i had what was like i had a it's like i had a good piece of property like i i wrote something that was like unlike all the other books at that time that i don't think really there's been that many books like it or that i would maybe um chaos monkeys would be another like similar book that i i'd sort of which i thought was good um but but so i sold it that way um so i wrote it so that i had it um but it was mostly just all the authors that i knew i sort of got in because i i'd worked for tucker i'd worked for robert i'd worked for tim ferriss at that point so i had a pretty good sort of rolodex of people who got me in the door when i when i sold that book are you still doing the deals now those type of deals now with all your latest books or are you self-published i'm still at the same publisher actually i've done all my books with the same publisher um uh i've self-published uh a children's book and then i've self-published two high-end editions of traditionally published books that i have like i have a leather edition of uh the daily stoic and the obstacle is the way um but other than that everything's been traditionally published i guess i own the audio right so why is that because like from the outside you know i think a lot of entrepreneurs feel this way it's like oh publishing you know record labels and book publishers it's all just middlemen and they're they take advantage and the authors see so little you know blah blah and someone like you you have a a lot of business sense b yeah now have a track record c you have an independent audience you can sell to um so there must be some reason that you say no actually people don't get it that you do want to publish it for these reasons i look at it on a case-by-case basis you're just you're really doing the math um will uh will the what they're paying for it plus the royalty um what what are you thinking you will earn you know in a short amount of time or you know in a certain amount of time so i just do the math on each project so every time i think about a book just because i have a publisher if obviously if no one was interested in publishing it it would be a different story um but i i you know i conceive of what the book is and then i take it out my publisher has a first look deal at my books um i and i see what you know what they what they think what they're willing to pay and then you know i have an agent and so we obviously try to get that number up as high as possible um and then once i have that number then i think okay what would this look like if i did it myself so what would it cost me to do it myself what am i likely to sell myself um how much work is that going to be how much of a distraction is that going to be um and 90 of the time you know the math the math tends to go towards traditional publishing in my experience um the the kids book that i did the publisher just wasn't uh wasn't it like wasn't in their wheelhouse they didn't totally get the project um but uh so i did it myself it's been great and really fun and artistically fulfilling but also just an incredible amount of work i mean like the coins i sell directly from my store right the manufacturer makes them they drop it off at the warehouse they get shipped um fulfilling books through amazon is like in like and then also the thousand independent retailers in the united states plus every international edition you know um is extraordinarily uh logistically difficult um and i remember you you gave this talk one time that was awesome where you showed a chart of the sales of your book versus the normal book so a normal book you get a peak and then it pretty much just kind of goes away but then for some of the classics you get a peak and then it goes down a little bit but then it kind of quickly comes up to the point the word even like it's pretty steady throughout like a catcher in the rye or something like that or even sometimes it'll it'll it'll suck early on and just slowly get better your books if i remember correctly they they popped just like everyone else they went down a little bit just like everyone else but then they like raised and were pretty steady with daily sales and you're like that's because i make [ __ ] that can last a long time and this was actually for when you're writing perennial seller i think you're like proving this point is is is that still the case and considering all of your other businesses is booked is making books still where you make the majority of your income or are you just using that because you love it and it happens to make money and you all but you make the bulk of your money from other students yeah it's it's uh most non-fiction authors make more money from speaking than from books um that's because speaking can be more lucrative but it's also because most authors don't sell very many books right um so i'm in an unusual space where um my books do sell consistently and i have a lot of them uh so i make a good living from that but probably make more money from stuff other than books than books uh all in dude that's crazy um that that you're like the man and yet still it's like the other well that that's like that's another reason to traditionally publish right so so like uh you you're a publisher does not take any percentage of speaking does not take any film or tv adaptations uh does not take any ancillary products any merchandising anything like that so really this the book is um it's not a loss leader because uh people pay for books and and books have value to people but like the the the ideas in the book everything else is downstream from whether that that takes hold or not does that make sense um so if the book doesn't land all the other stuff you know doesn't really matter but if the book works all the other stuff happens and then the success of the book is slightly less uh less significant i think um what my so so in publishing there's the front list and the backlist front list is anything uh within one year uh that like the year of release that's considered a frontlist title and then it becomes uh a backlist title after a year um so most titles stop selling when they leave the backlist when they leave the front list and become on the backlist but almost all of the income in publishing is from the backlist so so for me it's about like i've tried to create that in my own my own catalog of like titles that sell every year um as opposed to like a big book that comes out gets a lot of attention then then three four years later i have to write another new book because the other one is like not relevant anymore it's like it's like michael buble or mariah carey writing a christmas song you know you you want that christmas hit you want that a nude yeah yeah i mean so so like uh my book the daily stoic when when my agent was like we should do a page you should do a page a day about stoicism and i was like i don't know and he was like it will be your best-selling book and i was like there's no way that doesn't make any sense he's like yes it will every new year's like it will and he's right the book sold uh more copies this already this january than last january amazing what uh what do you do with your money yeah yeah i know you got a ranch uh i think you live he's had that forever that i mean that was like my house that that so it's it's not like it wasn't like a hot uh like a luxury property or whatever like kanye having a ranch in wyoming you actually live there because you wanted to live there sam sam i think has some some similar aspirations um but what do you do are you like i'm an investor you just do something boring with your money what do you do yeah uh well i spent a lot of it on this bookstore uh i i bought two buildings in this in this small town of bastrop uh originally was gonna be a bookstore and a coffee shop now it's a bookstore and i rent out half of it to a a record store but i wanted i needed like a space to do all my stuff so up top is like my office my wife also wanted me to take all my books out of our house uh so uh that was part of it was like getting all the [ __ ] out um but no i don't really do anything i don't really do anything with it i invest it um i'm i like investing in things that are very different than internet things so most of it's like in income producing real estate in which state uh texas and florida and you're just buying like what like multi-family i have some multi-family i have some mostly single uh single-family uh and then some like vacation rentals and you have a manager who do you are you hands-on with that is it a headache for you yeah i try i mean i try to have it be as little a headache as possible most of them are managed by yeah property managers um but uh but i like it's not that i think that the stuff that i do will go away but i like the idea of like like my decision to write trust me i'm lying and not having to think about needing to sell it up front um there was a similar one when after i wrote trust me i'm lying i was like hey for you know for my next book i want to do this book about uh ancient philosophy and they were like um are you are you sure you know so they gave me less than half i got 75 000 for the obstacle is the way um which has sold you know many many times more copies than trust me i'm lying um and you know obviously set up all these other things um but when they came back with that offer i was like okay sure whatever you know it wasn't i didn't have to think about whether i could live on 75 000 for however long it took me to write the book because my life wasn't set up around needing that's that's really like when people hear a book advance it can sound like a lot of money um like even you know two hundred thousand dollars right trust me i'm lying so but it's just like a salary right for two years but even worse than that right so i had to i let's say i left my job and then 18 months later the book came out um from from like when i left so 200 000 over 18 months that's that's pretty good but like i said it hasn't earned another dollar for 10 years so so over 11 and a half years uh 200 000 is not is not great um but i really i wanted that's the book i wanted to write and obviously it opened up other business opportunities but i like to be able to do my creative work um and not have to think about uh does it make sense in the dollar instead and this is this is how the entertainment business works as well like um almost all the money is in the catalog in owning the intellectual property uh over the long term but you can't do that if you are dependent like you get paid as an author every six months uh so and you're getting paid for the previous six months of earnings not like okay it ended yesterday here's your thing you're you're getting essentially a paid from a year ago um and so that's like you know that's a you can be living hand to mouth that way even if you're a very well-known person who's in you know the media all the time and so i i want to be in a position where that's not the case sean do you remember like uh seven maybe 2014 i think basically when when you and i were just getting to know each other uh there was this article that went viral and it said you can buy a ghost town in california for like 1.2 million do you remember that it was like you could buy like an old mining ghost town yeah and people did a group did it right and i think yeah i saw your notifications that ryan was involved in that i think ryan and his brian so ryan correct me if i'm wrong i've never met bro my best buddy oh really okay so listen to this shot okay so neville is good friends with brent so i've heard all about him so if you go on youtube sean and you type in like ghost town brent you'll see this channel where this guy named brent he's this really cool dude who's got like 1.5 million subscribers on youtube uh he started living in this ghost town that he bought a while ago but just when the cove when pandemic hit he just moved there and it it went to the moon and it's the best youtube channel i've watched well anyway ryan weren't you like the you and brent were like the mind the brains behind it you were just kind of the quiet i was one i was one of the investors there's a there's a bunch of investors i think we know uh you probably know like half of them at this point uh or more more than half uh but i to be perfectly honest i thought it was a terrible idea i was like you're you're gonna lose all your money uh this is not gonna work uh but i mean i've known brent for so long i i just sort of was like one of the small token investors but i and i didn't see it becoming what it was becoming i should have like i was thinking about it in terms of real estate because brett and i have invested in in real estate in austin before and so i was thinking about it in real estate and you know being from california i was like that area is like like a pit you know uh anyways uh i didn't think about it as a content play and that's obviously what what it ultimately probably will become i mean you could make more money off the youtube channel than the actual any money you could make off just turning it into a hotel that's one of the things i found with the bookstore and that's kind of where where the it clicked for me was realizing that so opening the bookstore that like that making money from selling books might be the third or fourth like least important revenue stream or or use of the property like the office being number one uh the space to film and make stuff like content being number two and then like real estate being number three and then uh you know like the actual uh brick and mortar retail business being like four or five that's amazing so you basically are like you bought a set the set actually just kind of functions it's like what do you mean it's like dude it's like coffee it's like 300 acres in the middle of the mountains yeah have you seen it shawn no no no no i'm talking about the bookshelf but it's the same thing i mean the the ghost town is an enormous set uh it's a set piece to film and create content and have a a life and a brand that people care about you know and uh so so hold on so it's been many years now so what's actually what is that today is there i don't watch the youtube channel is there like a functioning town do people come visit what the pandemic obviously made a hospitality business you know not very viable so right now it's it's mostly just in the sort of rebuilding phase they're like rehabbing all these different cabins and then he films you know if some videos there and they do like merchandise and stuff like that it's really but like my son like my son is five he watches one of those videos every night before bed he's like obsessed with it it's beautiful it's like a beautiful youtube channel it's and brent is very endearing he's awesome and it's crazy i mean it's crazy that the quality of stuff you can make of one person can make with like a drone a gopro and like you know one decent like sony camera like you can i mean he it was at one point putting out like a 45 minute video a week like he was putting like a television quality show out uh for millions of people you know for like a couple thousand dollars a month it's crazy what you can do anyway it went from like zero to like 1.5 or one point i forget exactly over a million subscribers in like 18 months yeah i mean he got tons of media attention it's done like hundreds of millions of views um i'm very bullish on youtube as a social network i'm like late to youtube ironically considering that's like what i left school to focus on like i i saw at this talent agency i signed their first youtube client and i remember this agent coming up to me and he's like what are you gonna do you're gonna commission their advertising revenue and i was like i guess yeah and like that's like of course that that's way better than commissioning checks from you know a television series um because you just what you actually own own the stuff but um i've seen it even with it with daily stoic like like as an author you get recognized like every once in a while it's actually been weird for me in the pandemic because like i haven't done that much stuff and so every time i if i go out or i do something like i was i saw someone in austin a couple weeks ago and then i was i was just in new orleans and like because of youtube uh and and like instagram reels like the amount of like fans i see in person it's like exponentially different than what i was getting from like who i was i see you on tick tock like every day you're in my tic toc feed every day uh oh well i'm sorry to hear that telling me to like you know uh thanks marcus aurelius said yeah yeah tell me something some ancient dude you know said about you know remembering i'm gonna die or like you know not not being anxious about the future and i'm like yeah actually this guy's talking some sense uh i like it and this and the the video quality's actually really good um like i don't know if you're i don't know what you're doing for that but like it's like a gopro that's a gopro 9 hero it costs 600 and you can shoot in 4k video with a it doesn't even have an external mic it's like it's crazy what you can do but you could do a 4k video on your iphone but when i upload on 4k my [ __ ] never looks good i think the gopro corrects but i don't know the gopro does incredible the the lighting in the building i have to say not something i control is quite good um well it looks like you're on like a farm and you're leaning on i mean the gopros are better for outside stuff but yeah you just i mean just put it there and it shoots like you know super high quality stuff and then somebody cuts it up do you edit or you just hand that off to somebody you see i like and then i i try to shoot i try to think about what i want them to make when i'm shooting it and sometimes i'll give notes i'll be like okay you know cut this here or whatever but i'm mostly yeah i mostly just shoot in like small blocks um and then the idea is like okay so if i'm shooting in a in you know between 30 and one minute 30 second and one minute chunks uh okay so that goes uh a content of that size can go on twitter uh instagram as a reel it can be a facebook video and it can be a tick tock so you've got like four shot four bytes at the apple there then that content can be packaged together to make uh videos on on youtube so i'll take like eight of those and that can become an eight minute youtube video um and so so by shooting like these little things i get like lots of different like platforms that they can go out on so basically um well so ryan i i had i made a living with a daily email sean sean just released this new business that he's working on which is amazing sean i gotta reply your email it's called the milk road it's pretty hilarious and it's like a bit uh a crypto daily email that he's working on with his partner ben but uh you have the daily stoic which is awesome but you have this new ish thing that seems to be like working out really well and honestly i think could be like one of your bigger businesses i also think it could be bigger because you could sell it because it's not exactly like the ryan show but it's called the daily dad yeah so i do two daily emails slash podcasts daily dad and daily stoke who's who's writing all the daily dabs i write them all i write daily dad and daley stoke what how big is that business or how big is the email uh daily dad is like 60 000 people i think um it's weirdly not as big as i want and not just want it to be but i actually thought it would grow faster than daley stoke did and it's actually been a little bit slower um but uh how big is the daily stove 400 oh my god really holy [ __ ] and do you advertise to grow these or what are you just through content then you capture you you make videos i make content uh social drives a lot of the sign ups um and then the book i mean the book sold you know well over a million copies um but uh but yeah so i write both of them and then it's it's mostly organic but i'm trying to i'm having to get more serious about sort of i think some of the low-hanging fruit's probably been picked so i'm having to start to think more seriously about it as a business not just a content that i make man you you you oh my god you're killing me why weren't you advertising like three or four years ago it was so much cheaper you could acquire email for a dollar fifty now it's like five six seven dollars uh i i should have asked you so you you're hanging out with people all the time that are you know super successful i know a bunch of people who know you and i think you're respected in the kind of like the business world entrepreneurial world but i feel like the matthew mcconaughey world i feel like you you are uh pretty grounded and you're i don't get the vibe from you that i get from a lot of people i hang out with which is just like more more not enough uh i'm not there yet i got to go bigger bigger and uh and really it's just kind of like i haven't succeeded enough yet i haven't earned enough yet i want more money more success and i don't get that vibe from you are you just hiding it or is that the case um i mean i definitely have there's definitely a part of me that's in that i mean i've written 12 books in 10 years if i was just like oh i'm good you know like clearly there's the drive there uh or even some might say a compulsion um i think uh so so there's a part of it but i i have so i've been with my wife since we since i was 20. uh so we met like right as all this stuff was happening and so and then i had kids five years ago um so i've always been a little bit more of like a normal person i don't mean that in like a [ __ ] up way but i haven't been like oh i'm a digital nomad or like uh you know i'm i'm gonna go live in puerto rico for two years like you know like i've been more of just like a regular like i don't say a nine to five person but like i've just been like more rooted in like regular people life than i think a lot of like creative entrepreneurial people i know who i tend to find are a bit more like chaotic it sounds judgmental but just it's a different lifestyle and so i think that's i think that's a part of it no i know what you mean like for example right now a whole bunch of my friends are either you know like you said they're crypto rich moving to puerto rico they don't pay taxes they're going to miami because i heard the actions there right now i'm doing this doing that and i'm just like but you know like i just got i have two little babies and i'm like what the idea of moving like i mean the idea of like getting the kids into the car to go to the park is like overwhelming let alone like uprooting my life in some way in any way taking like massive risks now just is not like appealing to me in the same way like when i was 24 i remember i moved i picked up i moved to silicon valley i didn't know what i was gonna do but i was like this is where the action is i'm just gonna move to silicon valley and then i ended up getting um this job working with this like billionaire dude in the office he had this dope office and i remember i slept in the office like 232 days out of the 365 days and i was just loving it i wasn't like i was being forced nobody's forced the the office had an apartment right don't feel bad it was like it was like it had like two million dollars with the furniture it was a lovely it was a billionaire a better imagine peter thiel's office yeah i wasn't sleeping in a garage like the bathroom floor was heated in the morning so your feet were your toesies weren't cold so you know it wasn't super rough but nonetheless i basically was choosing to obsess and like go all in in a way i was like excited about that and able to do it in a way that i couldn't as real life stuff layered on like relationship and kids and things like i remember when clubhouse blew up like a couple months ago or six i was like what like i was like i don't even want to go to a real conference let alone be in like an internet room conference like i it was just totally inconceivable to me that anyone would want to do it have the time to do it it that's so that's sort of not been i actually like writing you know what i mean so the other part of it is it's not just like the sort of uh wanting to have more of a normal sort of rooted life although i feel like i do weird unusual i take risks in other ways living on this farm and stuff but um it was also like for me like i i writing to me is a calling that's a little bit different than i don't know um making money in crypto or something like it's it's a blessing and a curse right it's a blessing in that it's fulfilling it gives you purpose it's artistic it's like a thing you master there's also i think a ceiling on it you know and like you can you can be good at it there's obviously the jk rowlings of the world but like you know um but there's not a ceiling to being famous i mean you know we're both friends with tim ferriss and like his fame allowed him i don't know what he's worth but he's probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars because of his investments yeah i mean there there's not a ceiling on being well known and getting access to no but i mean you sort of you end up in different niches right if you if you're called to be a poet you obviously would be more lucrative to write business books but like you are where you are you know there's a certain amount of uh like you don't choose what muses visit you i know that sounds a little mystical but like you i like sometimes people have been like oh he's writing about stoicism to get rich which i always laugh at because like again i if i if being rich was what was motivating to me i would do literally anything but this right like this is the worst possible of the things to affect um but i guess my thing is like i i really like the routine and the ritual of sitting down to write which is also i think inherently a bit grounding in a way that like some of these other pursuits maybe aren't what does your uh normal workday look like i mean are you are you doing like a nine to five uh not nine to five like i wake up early i i go for a run or a walk with the kids whether we're at my farm or my place in in town um i don't check my phone in the morning uh i don't eat in the morning i usually journal in the morning and then i go i write usually for two or three hours and then the rest of the day after that is business other work stuff and i'm i'm done by four almost every day so i'm probably work eight thirty to four seems like a good asset i like it i try to i but i like it's important there are also i i don't know to me being really great at what you do and somehow managing to be like a somewhat normal person um to me is actually like a rarer thing to do than to to just be great at what you'd like i think if anyone decided to be like tom brady's tom brady but there's a cost to being tom brady but like if you choose to be that singularly dedicated to what you do it's easier to be better at what you do than to say like i'm gonna work nine to five and be like great at what i do if that makes sense so you um used to work for tucker max you then became buddies with them and um you had a a business together but i've never asked either of you about this you've probably it's based off of some of the stances i know that you've seen you've written some great stuff about like a letter to your dad about voting for trump i know that you're against like some a lot of these statues and you've donated money to that and uh tucker i think has gone the other way where no i wouldn't i don't want to call it the opposite because of course he's probably against a lot of the things or for a lot of things you are but maybe different and he actually recently came out this article that uh sean and i talked about it's called doomsday optimism and it's about how barry bluntly but he's such a good writer that like everything he writes it seems like convincing but basically he talks about how he thinks like the american government is basically gonna collapse in two to four years and how he's preparing for doomsday and it was like crazy fascinating but i what is your opinion on that i've been eager to ask you what you think about that and what if you have an opinion on it uh tucker was very good to me early in my career and uh set me up for the success that i've had so i feel very grateful for that in a lot of ways um he and i live in very different realities now um i think uh i don't know exactly what caused that or or what um what the driving force of that is i mean i have some theories but um a lot of that stuff that i see and read i think it probably has nothing to do with whatever he's talking about it's it strikes me as um as driven by driven by something else um which i've seen a lot of like i think the pandemic brought it out in a lot of people they're probably so we both know but i've noticed a kind of a radicalization or uh [Music] an untethering from people that otherwise i would have assumed were in in alignment on i've just noticed uh an untethering that i don't i don't know where it's going but it certainly worries me is that a diplomatic answer yeah and i don't really like that answer because i understand what you're trying to do i i i think you could you could not agree with his opinion and still be respectful towards a but i understand that you're trying to like keep it you know be cool but like in one regards i could be like well i i i unders i actually could see ryan thinking almost something similar because he lives in the country and he likes privacy and like he you know you're like so so high iq that high iq people typically are like quirky and have like weird opinions but then on the other side i know like some of the things that you stand for and i could see you just laughing at that being like what are you ridiculous uh but it's it's it's it's weird i i've noticed this sort of trend in like sort of tech entrepreneurial people where i don't want to say fads but it's almost like these idea viruses sort of enter the community and some people end up taking them to like very strange extremes so like polyamory was one a few years ago and then crypto is one i i i have like i'm not anti-crypto i i i think there's a lot in crypto i'm invested in it too but then then it then in the pandemic there was like then there was this sort of anti-vaxx uh anti-lockdown anti like coveted denialism that was one and then i'm i'm very alarmed by some of the people that i know in that space that are now going in sort of um like a it's worse than a trumpian direction it's more of like a january sixth like uh end of the gov like a like a toxic uh like we gotta buy guns and i have guns but there's this like almost like uh like doomsday like disaster cultish direction that it's going in and i don't it strikes me as coming from somewhere other than like what they're actually say it's coming about does that make sense and by that do you mean uh the belief is coming from some other like kind of reasons or the motives meaning like trying to make money yeah like if we perpetuate this we'll get more notoriety we'll get more money we'll get more attention like you know there's some people like clickbait in general is that right like i may not believe this like if you watch a sports talk show on espn they don't necessarily think that lebron james is better than michael jordan but they know if they say it it gets clipped and it gets shared and so there's like this yeah i do i perform versus like do you think that the belief has come from somewhere or the motive might be driving them to extreme you know radicalization i think it's both those things so i think number one uh all these people are are very smart right and so if you've built your whole career being smart and being a contrarian it can put you in an uncomfortable position where you're like rejecting things that make sense because that's instinctively where you go like this is what happened with with with dove at american apparel his whole cr everything he did was [ __ ] insane i'm gonna start a usa apparel company i'm not gonna use professional models i'm gonna pay a living wage none of that makes any sense that was all those individually or very bad ideas but he somehow built a billion dollar company out of it so then when people were like you need to hire a professional operator uh inside you know you need to hire a real cfo and a real cmo and all this stuff he was like no right so he just got used to rejecting everyone's advice and it led to this downward spiral so i think that there's a little bit of that i think there's um i think there is this sort of as people uh become like i think there's you know what audience capture is where you sort of get used to telling the audience what they want to hear and so the algorithm is very seductive it tends to reward like obviously controversial things it rewards uh you know uh polarizing things and so i think what happens as certain people's relevance slips they are more prone to it's like you know you're always putting stuff out and if what you've put out and in the world hasn't been working and then suddenly you like you chance upon something as as uh compelling as like anti-vaxx or uh this or that that then if you it's like you're getting it's like a blast from the past you're like [ __ ] this is it right so i think there i think there's some of that uh that that's taking that's spiraling people i also think just the pandemic [ __ ] with people's head it's been a long life we're not meant to live like this i think it's that um the other thing like in like a joe rogan or some of the intellectual dark web people i'm also noticing i just like when you've been very mistreated by like say the media or just like elite culture um it's very hard for you to agree with those people even when they're right so you end up going back to the contrarianism you end up like going against things that ordinarily you wouldn't agree you would totally agree with but from a tribal perspective um you know you you it's imagine if trump had gotten reelected like how many liberals would have trouble with the vaccine because you would have to then agree with a trump thing um i think i think we're seeing that i think this is why in a lot of men who have been uh sort of not media darlings are going towards some of the direction of things we're talking about it's just a sort of like i'll die before i agree with those people on anything right there's a there's this chart i saw that was amazing it was in a cr it was in a crypto annual report and i said yeah what is what are some of the underlying things that drive this like crypto's like a religion it's like a cult it's like this very very strong it's not just the same as like i like this business i i'm gonna invest in this asset you know people don't feel the same way about bitcoin as they do you know a piece of property in dallas and so it was this chart and the chart basically was on the on the on the y-axis it was like do you believe it was about institutions it goes do you believe that institutions are like credible or not credible meaning like are they honest or are dishonest i think the way they put it and then on the other side was are they competent or incompetent as i rank these institutions i was like the us government it's like dishonest not not competent incompetent and then it was um the cdc and it's and it showed how they've been moving over time and basically every institution that you can think of whether it's universities whether it's health organizations the nih and who and cdc whether it's the us government they are all sort of traveling towards dishonest and incompetent as the general public viewpoint of them and this has a bunch of implications it's like well so people so the things that reject institutional beliefs so you see joe rogan just explode in popular you know he's bigger his show is bigger than quote unquote mainstream media he is more mainstream than mainstream media but his brand is not an institution and he doesn't look like them he doesn't read off a teleprompter and so he's got this like appearance of higher honesty higher competency and so the same thing is true with crypto which is non-government money and blah blah blah and so all these things are like on trend right now and that doesn't necessarily make them more honest and competent but it is the perception that's good yeah and when i was listing the different things the other one i put in there is i think like psychedelics is another one where it just becomes like this idea virus and i'm not saying that i have a disagreement about it i just it's very interesting how these things just sort of infect these different subgroups and become almost a new it's their identity is primarily in that the the it's like it's very tempting to fall into a thing where you're smarter or better than other people that sort of outsider mentality and so i think i'm just i'm very wary of how that's affected people that i know and i'm worried it's taking some of the more fragile people into a dark potentially dangerous direction where they're just they're [ __ ] with things that once you [ __ ] with they're very difficult to unfuck and speaking of psychedelics and we'll wrap up a second here um i saw i follow uh so we've talked about aubry marcus on the podcast because aubry has a crazy story because his dad liking invented like the fleshlight and then he like kind of parlayed that into building this awesome uh supplement empire but i got this instagram ad or maybe i just saw on his page so sean i don't know if you saw this aubrey marcus the guy we talked about he has this documentary where somewhat recently he spent i think seven days in complete darkness like and and i heard maybe it was in sarah gordo am i getting the details no it's definitely not at saragodo okay well for some reason i thought it was at yours okay i'm wrong then but did am i right though and that it was like five or three or seven like a multiple days in complete pitch i don't know i haven't i've not heard about that but i am uh oh man i like aubry alive i've known aubry a long time but he's he i i'm a little worried about him he he he's a wild man sean you didn't see this so basic idea why did he do okay so so basically he had a uh a night vision camera looking at him and he was in a small room with a bed and basically pitch dark and after 24 hours or something like that he kind of starts hallucinating and kind of goes crazy and he's talking to himself and the whole documentary is is basically showing the night vision camera of him talking to himself and then like a voiceover and some flashbacks of him talking like what he was experiencing to that point and he was trying to go through like almost a psychedelic experience because i guess there's something where i don't know the science behind it where you're in the dark for a long time you start going nutty and have some realizations i don't know if it's true or not but it was [ __ ] insane it was crazy i mean the way that i see it is like to me it's like i don't care if i'm an outdoorsman if i see a huge epic mountain i'm gonna be in awe and that's how i was with aubry marcus in this documentary i'm like i don't care about drugs i don't care about this guy that's not that much you just saw the ad i just saw i i watched parts of it i started watching parts of it because he released like five minutes at a time on his instagram and i started watching parts of it he is it's the [ __ ] craziest thing i've ever seen the guy's insane uh you have to watch this [ __ ] it is why did he come out okay or you haven't gotten to the end well this was filmed like a year ago and he was on instagram so so we assume it all worked out okay well the reason i didn't buy it is it i'm afraid i'm kind of afraid to watch it but like he's wild man because i watch his instagram and i see some of the [ __ ] he does and i'm like this is i'm just i'm very i'm very concerned that these people are messing with their brain chemistry in a way that it's hard to come back from and you know uh i i i am not a fan of uh this sort of like uh prescribed medicine for yourself to heal unnamed traumas like i i think it's going to end very badly maybe i'm a little conservative uh and i'm missing out on something but i i don't think you should [ __ ] with your brain the way some of these people are [ __ ] with their brains and i think it's gonna i think we're art we're starting to see some of the ramifications of it with some of the stuff we're talking about here but i i think this is hard to put back in the bottle yeah this this is wild this is are you looking it up yeah i'm reading about it right now what does it say is it seven days it was like days so like okay there's a part of this i can get behind which is like you know people whether they go try to climb mount everest or wim hof getting in a cold black cold bath every day to like you know challenge themselves to like uh like it's a you know there's a form of meditation for example so he says my thinking was this if the prospect of sitting in the dark with just your own thoughts frightens you maybe that's exactly where you need to be oh my god rattlesnakes scare me too i don't need to get bit by rattlesnake and so on for me there's a part of this that i actually like i get part of that which is like um i think the more comfortable you could be with yourself and by yourself and not need stimulation not need others not need constant entertainment i do think that that is like a direction personally that i would like to go in where i can i can be at peace and happiness without something going on now in this and this one i think is less it to me it's less scary than like being like yeah i'm gonna start micro dosing lsd or like i'm gonna go on this ayahuasca trip in the [ __ ] forest because i heard joe rogan say that it was transformational to me that's like way higher risk and um maybe not necessary compared to you know i guess this darkness thing is a little bit less permanent feeling for me but i mean that's what they do to like break them i i don't think it's something you want to be messing with but again yeah maybe it is like deeply traumatic i'm not sure hey you know what the phrase is whatever doesn't kill you makes you weaker seriously man i don't i don't know whatever doesn't kill you [ __ ] you up really bad the way i always read these is to me these are like um these are content stunts right this is no different than jackass and a bunch of other things like maybe some people come from a good place and i'm just kind of skeptical about all this stuff like for i'll give you ryan i'll make it personal for you which is like when i saw the daily stoke i was like oh that's smart stoicism is this growing trend he probably likes stoicism but like you can like it without having to do all the work of creating a daily email and content around it like that is the opportunistic side of this like kind of cool niche thing that's clearly growing and i've said i i don't know you right so i'm just thinking from a farm thinking oh that's smart um and you know he probably recognized this growth and said okay i could build a cool brand around this thing that i like and i see is growing and so when i see and you know so for example if i see you making a tick tock every day about stoicism i think to myself well you know uh i don't know how much of that is like well this content is gonna work so i'm gonna do it versus i really just needed to get this off my heart and share this with the world so similarly when i see you know these stunts i think to myself well they know this is content that's gonna hit and they can get a bunch of attention from it and like did he really need to do this and want to do this i'm not sure right those motivations get mixed i know for myself they get mixed because um you know if i i've had a bunch of tweets go viral you know i added 200 000 twitter followers last year it's very addictive and in uh i don't know if you saw his uh the the um the stand-up special that that hussain is doing but did you see him when he was in austin he has this part in it did you see when he was in austin i saw him in san francisco i live in san francisco so i saw him when he was here and he's got this whole part where he's basically like you know he's like i challenged you know this dictator who was doing this thing and then boom that clip goes viral i made fun of trump at this thing boom that clip goes viral the likes the views the followers the comments and he's just like [ __ ] inject this into my veins i need that next hit so i went after the next big dictator and then the next big fish and then all of a sudden like you know there was a price to be paid for and he talks about how he received something in the mail uh that was like you know something like anthrax looking thing and it got on his kid and it turned out to be all okay but like his wife was like dude you have to figure out how to keep maybe you shouldn't be poking it's very important and that's kind of what you're talking about right right there you got to figure out how to keep that on a leash and i think about that a lot and i think about it you know even with what i do i remember i was uh i was on some big morning show and i remember thinking like there's a i know what i could do to make this like national news like i know i could i'm i've got a you know an audience of several million people right now what what and then just going like life is too [ __ ] short and also i want to continue to live in reality and so i think what happens is certain people get desperate or maybe their judgment is not good or they don't have someone in their life that's like uh you know that could work but what about this this this and this as a consequence and uh you can you can become unhinged very quickly um especially if there is any also you know uh comorbidities with like a mental illness or you know like and so i it most of the people who want to be in the public eye you're already a little you know like that uh and so you got to be really really careful and i'm i'm worried about where some people i know are going yeah sam as a fitness influencer i've been wanting to talk to you also about your excessive exercise and what this might be leading to hey man you might spend three days in darkness only doing squats uh just to you know hit those views i'm in a good place my friend i'm i'm doing everything right at the moment we'll see how long that could last ryan this has been awesome man i appreciate you coming on this is fun um thanks for thanks for coming in the they didn't even say the name of the book courage is calling right um it's awesome i i've not read that one yet but i'm gonna buy it i've read everything else perennial seller obstacles away conspiracy i guess i've read four conspiracy and um um uh trust me i'm lying and then the middle two are just the stillness one i haven't read that one stillness this is the key and then ego is the enemy is the one i think they're missing the ego is very good and obstacles always very good those are both both great well and you're awesome i appreciate you thanks coming [Music] you

i wrote down how much money i made from the age 20 to the age 31 and it was like zero thousand dollars then negative thirty thousand dollars then i i got a job and the job paid me a hundred twenty thousand dollars i thought it was great at age 31 i made more than the previous 11 years before that combined my advice to young people always is if you're going to take a non-traditional path like entrepreneurship or betting on yourself it's going to be this slowly then suddenly path don't count your earnings at 22 or 23 or 24 check the scoreboard at age 30. or regardless of 30 or not after like eight or nine years and you give it give it a decade when success comes through the front door this is how it arrives slowly and then suddenly

like you got to choose the business model that's right for you but answer the question of like okay can this audience that i have make me a billionaire [Music] i have one house that's gonna pull off like 15 000 a month and it's just a single house so you'll beat it by quite a bit no way really what's what's the house worth uh i bought it for 900k that's right dude that's crazy 700 a night where where is it yeah uh it's in in boise uh like right next to the boise state university stadium oh so do you get like basically like football tourists or what do you who who's renting this thing for 700 a night in boise we're live by the way nathan we're live great no for real um who's renting it so you get like all graduation everyone coming in to you know tour the university or whatever else and then um uh just anyone coming to downtown it's like a five bedroom brand new construction sam it actually looks like the kitchen looks somewhat similar to uh the place you just linked me to so so why haven't you bought some more like floating shelves in the tile backsplash and all that why haven't you bought like yeah in the same area that's my question yeah it's a million dollars it's a million dollar or 900 000 or whatever you said under a million dollar house that's making 20 15 grand a month why don't you buy 50 of them well i i i just bought this one and so it's not making that yet but that's what we're like the bookings for the summer so it's at i just did 8 000 for january locked in um and then the summer bookings are coming in at like quite a bit higher um like so the january ones you know are last minute and and boise is slow there but uh yeah the summer ones are coming in at eight nine a thousand dollars a night eight hundred nine hundred or a thousand a night um which is wild and we haven't put a hot tub on it yet so i just bought a hot tub today and uh so we'll get that in there i should be able to charge a little bit more and it's gonna be good wow so we should start uh we should intro intro well yeah so you're we're live that might go live this is nathan barry nathan barry um i've known nathan since a gum road meetup shawn i went to a gumroad meetup in like for real uh i'm not joking she doesn't join that sounds maybe 2012 2013. nathan was doing gumroad he had this book called authority right authority yep and i don't even remember what the book was about just making a living online but then you also had graphic design stuff and you had a really cool blog and you uh you sold all types of stuff but i've been homies with you for a while and then you launched this thing called convertkit and i was like nathan like the other thing's working just do that and anyway now it's a business that both sean and i i think are i didn't end up i didn't end up doing it there's some mechanics problem with the way we can get into it we're an llc in it it gets complicated uh as like pass-through funds and stuff like that but yeah but sam you're okay i'm in the cool club and basically his business convertkit does like 26 i think million dollars in recurring revenue it's like a mailchimp competitor that's better and different their their revenue is all completely live so if you google convertkit revenue yeah like 20 the revenue 29. do you regret now that your business is actually kicking ass do you feel like i kind of wish this wasn't all super transparent or you know because it's good early on transparency is great early on it gets you a bunch of people interested then when you start winning you know you're giving more value than you're getting back usually by that by doing that yeah so i think it's uh a great idea if it's for a mission reason a terrible idea if it's for like a marketing reason and i actually had two friends who sat me down at one point and they're like nathan this is an intervention take down your like public metrics page and which they were right like they had talked to competitors who were like wow this is so helpful like you're scrolling through and they're like you know your competitors are doing this right i'm like i know but really it's like uh it's a mission thing of the whole mission for the company is help creators earn a living and so if we can put this public blueprint out there that's not just like the snapshot of time where you know you've done it with companies where you're going through and you're like oh they said here they're at 10 million you know you're like trying to piece together the trajectory we all have the same spreadsheets um and so like actually doing it in real time means that someone can be like okay i'm at 50k mrr churn is absolutely brutal right now oh i wonder what convertkit's churn was when they were at 50k right and you can go back and you can find the date range and be like oh in this time here's all of their metrics here's how fast they're growing and everything and so it's like this for anyone who wants it it's this master class where you have to dig in and find the data but you can find everything about our business and my hope is that it's like breadcrumbs that every future entrepreneur who wants to how much recreation how much traffic does hopefully in another industry do you know what's up how much traffic does that page get i don't know it's not actually even our page it's convertkit.baremetrics.com right and uh it's not even ours so wow presumably not that much okay so you're for real not using it for marketing if you don't even know how much traffic it gets okay now i believe you but when you said the mission thing i have a i have a system of uh tuning out whenever anybody says values mission vision things like that i'm just like yeah by default i do not believe anything you're about to say for the next 30 seconds how many um how many people work there now 69 because when you you wrote this blog post two years i forget i've been reading your blog for so long i don't remember the years but you wrote a blog post and you're like oh we are making let's say eight million dollars a year but we basically had twenty thousand dollars in the bank or that's i don't remember the exact numbers but it was almost as extreme as that right yeah so uh the company's totally self-funded there's no outside capital and so when we hit like this period of rapid growth we grew from 2000 a month to 100 000 a month in 12 months and uh you know that was just on 50 grand that i'd put in we spent all of that money and so what happened is the company was growing and profitable but we were doing like three percent profit margins and so we've gotten down to the point where we had i think like ten to twelve thousand dollars in the bank and like that was growing but we were like expenses were increasing by so much more that uh like our days worth of expenses was getting shorter and shorter and so that got uh super scary you guys want to know okay random story so uh i i think you all know andrew warner um mixer i was at a mixergy meetup in san francisco like he would do these scotch nights and uh uh after one of those like we i think we were walking out of the building and he's like dude you know it kind of pulls me aside he's like dude you seem super stressed and and i was like yeah like and i kind of told him the financial situation and we were like our bank balance was growing but you know you're like now paying all these people and you have no money and uh um so i told him about that and and he said okay here's what we're gonna do i'm gonna wire you 25 000 tomorrow you're going if you need the money spend it do whatever you eat whatever you want with it whenever you feel right like pay me back um or if you don't need it like just put it in a savings account like just let it be in you know like an insurance blanket for you and then uh wow you know why did you know him well anything if he uh we'd hung out in person i think twice before so i knew him a little bit on the podcast and we were gonna say the only thing what oh the only the thing he said is like if you do decide to raise funding like convert that into you know like i'll be the first person in for that um if not what a smart move okay but i think that's a good move the thing that he said is the only thing that will piss me off on this is if you ever try to pay me interest on it like don't try to make this a loan in any way and so i held onto the money it sat in the bank account for like eight or nine months uh we grew our bank account to the point that we had plenty of savings in the bank and all of that and i wired the money back and like uh andrew is forever one of those people where i'm like thank you just because he pulled me aside and was like dude you seem stressed and he was like here let me loan you a security blanket that's one of the coolest stories i've heard that's frankly that's amazing shout out to andrew we gotta have it we gotta have everyone now just for that story uh we've joked about it before but we should have them on for sure because if he's done it to you he's probably done like some weird stuff like that to a bunch of people so that's he's probably has some interesting stories yeah i mean he knows everyone too so he's he's i'm looking at your guys's revenue chart there's a huge spike every november what did you do is like a black friday deal or what what causes this huge yeah we can talk about whether that's a good idea or not um so early on right when you need cash uh the thing that you do in sas is you push annual plans right because you have this uh cash flow problem and so we started pushing annual plans as part of our black friday sale you know to bring forward a bunch of that cash um and so we kind of just kept doing that and then what it did is it aligned a whole bunch of uh um renewals you know annual payments right around that same time so it just keeps getting bigger and bigger right until it gets the point that you're pulling in like four and a half million dollars in a single month um you're also getting all the churn at the same time so i don't know that like like we're not gonna keep doing it by the way there's so many things like that in business that i'm like we're doing this i can't really say if it's a good idea or a bad idea i wish i could but we're just we're just gonna keep doing it for now and then like i just kind of feel like it's gonna work out but i could totally see that like we didn't need to do any of this or that this like long term is hurting us more than the short term gain what's an example um like in my d2c business as far as kind of thinking about this is uh we do this model that like drops new products all the time every single week we drop new products and it's great because it causes this sales spike but it also puts you on this treadmill of new products that you have to release every week and that means you gotta do photo shoots of those products every week and then that means that you have to have inventory whether you sold your previous inventory or not you got to buy new inventory like most brands they don't do that they only buy your inventory when they're out of the old stuff so even though inventory sucks out cash you know it's like well it's i'm buying it because i there's i'm sold out we're not even doing that but on the other hand it's creating like that when i look at his chart it's creating this spike every single week and i'm like okay so that's good but these other three things are bad and like i don't know how to weigh these against each other because they're like in different categories that speak different languages and on different time scales so it's just hard to hard to know if this is like a dumb idea or a bad idea or a good idea um i think the thing to look for in that is uh something that served you before might not serve you now so like that served us really well for a period of time because it brought in this cash you know and you could tell the team like hey like payroll is good we're set for a long time and it gives that level of comfort and also like in the early days churn is often high in a business just because you don't have very many mature accounts and so locking that in is really good but then if you get to this long you know much later in the business you're like look we're on accrual accounting it we don't really care we have plenty of cash in the bank like this spike at this time doesn't make a difference right and so just i'd watch for those things where it's like this served the business well for a while and it doesn't anymore who built the early version um so i did all the design and front-end development um and then i hired uh freelancers to um you know write the rails back end and then that went okay and then it went much better when i hired a long-time friend named david to come on and like full-time uh build it but that was two years in and you know it was making enough it was making enough money to pay him no that was where i paid him out of the 50 grand that i put in which was like our our savings and everything seems like a pretty good return i mean 50k and you're able to get that built and turns into what it is now or at least it got you to enough revenue to pay people yeah yeah and uh i mean it's wild what you can do when one you're doing a lot of the design and code yourself you know so you gotta count that in the cost but um but but yeah and then you just fund it with that makes it sound easier than it is but you know you fund it with growth simple not easy yeah simple not easy so so sean nathan he's got this blog post called like how to how to build well yeah i think it's called laughs we have another blog post ladders of wealth he's got this actually this other great blog post called um the billion dollar creator i think it's called or the billion dollar blog let's do the billion dollar let's do the billion dollar one all right i'm sorry to sam i don't know where you're going with that well well i just want to say so this whole thing about transparency so nathan i don't think you publicize this but i'm on this email list and every month or week probably month i think he sends out dude it's the craziest [ __ ] i've seen he sends out his entire net worth and you could see like how much cash he has how much uh like which stocks he owns of and of how much uh like his angel investments like you see his entire fi all of his finances i gotta get on this list that sounds amazing it's all the content that i wanted to that i wanted like other people to publish like sam you talk about fat fire and like that's it fantastic subreddit um and i just want like more of those conversations because i've written a ton about people who have or like how to get from say like zero to a hundred thousand dollars uh on the internet you know that's you mentioned my book authority that's what that was um but like once you kind of get to the point where you're making a hundred thousand two hundred thousand or more online like people don't talk about what you do with their money because you know if you do that someone's like oh you know like there's sam just bragging about how much money he has again or you know something like that and so i was like okay i'm gonna make a private newsletter and i just charge people 100 bucks like just to filter out the the uh anyone who's going to complain about it i guess or say that i'm bragging and then just say i'm going to write about all the stuff that i wish i knew when i made like my first 250 grand uh online and so the way that i i describe your blog or that email is it's kind of like face tattoos and cornrows i think it's super cool when other people have them but i don't want it like yeah you know not not for me but i i it's cool when others have them there's only 200 people on that list so it's it's a small group right now dude i don't know man but sean what was your question about well i wanted to kind of walk through the the framework here so you have this blog post that's kind of like i know you worked on that for a while uh kind of shaping your thinking here and um and then we also have sam who's somewhat bearish on the idea of the creator economy thinks he's kind of overhyped over over buzzword and you're mr creator economy in a way uh nathan so i think this would be this this might be good um but let's walk i don't think our opinions are opposites by the way i would i would say probably our opinions are not opposites yeah for the sake of argument let's just uh let's just walk through so you basically have these four rules of building a billion dollar audience so um i guess like first why did you even want to do this uh like kind of like what got you interested in this and then let's walk through the four yeah so the article asks a question like the whole premise of it and that is what is the most profitable uh place to direct attention right so everything we do right we're recording a podcast now whatever you're doing on on tick tock or if you're a movie star or everything else right you have attention and brands want it they're willing to sponsor you know all this stuff and so it's like okay you have the opportunity to point that attention somewhere what's the most profitable way to do that long term because you look at people um you know maybe who are taking sponsorships right five grand uh you know to sponsor the newsletter or you know 500 bucks for a sponsored um uh instagram post or anything like that and that's actually not that profitable and we when you dive in you learn that the most profitable thing to do is to create your own product and to drive that attention to something where you actually build equity long term so it's like a longer uh article talking about that but like the richest movie stars you know like take jessica alba for example right she has made a lot of money from movies but the bulk of her wealth is from starting a company using you know being the spokesperson for her own company um and then my other favorite example would be ryan reynolds um who you know right he's doing ads for other people and probably getting paid a million bucks here 10 million dollars there you know that kind of thing and at some point he goes like forget that i'm going to buy my own companies with mint mobile and aviation gin and i'm going to be my own spokesperson so i don't get cash i get equity and so you know you just watch this process of people doing it over and over again and that's actually my hypothesis with convertkit right of i have attention on the internet through running a blog and a newsletter and all of that how do i want to monetize it sponsorships ebooks membership a bunch of things i'm like nope i want to monetize it through convertkit building a sas company like that's my version of the billion dollar creator so that's the whole premise of the article and it's like uh so you have a couple examples so okay so rule number one is you have to build more than a personal brand so what does that mean you give the example of jessica alba of mark from primal kitchen so what what is the nuance here it's like it's not just your face your name you need to actually create a brand around uh around your lifestyle or your interest is that it by the way sean primal kitchen is the sugar-free ketchup company that i like so this guy named mark he's like kind of looks like the 65 year old version of me but like even more jacked and he like has a health and health blog and he starts selling ketchup and he sells that for like 300 million dollars yeah so i mean what mark did uh with uh amy's blog was called mark's daily apple and it was like the leading you know like paleo kind of health blog in that space and a blog like that you know when he was doing this 2006 2010 that kind of thing you can make a million bucks a year off of that blog and he was right but you play that forward um and that's it's all about him all about his name um all that write his name is in the name of the site but i mean you can build substantial wealth that way what he didn't said is he started primal kitchen you know kickstarted this whole brand by saying i have the most popular site in the space let me you know make these uh paleo-friendly uh ketchup mayonnaise that kind of thing and then he goes you know how big his audience was do you know how big how much traffic he had at the time it wasn't huge huge like it was like ours yeah thousand subscribers on the email list maybe so a hundred thousand kind of like trusted audience size to kick kick off this yeah you gotta remember audiences were a lot smaller like even just 2015 2012 like that kind of time frame but yeah then he sells it to craft for 200 million dollars you can't sell a blog to like a blog doesn't sell for 200 million you know uh like all of these things and the crazy thing is he still owns the audience right the thing that that kicks out of this whole product he still owns he can sell off the that whole brand talking to him at a conference you know he's just on to the next thing figuring out what he wants to do next he didn't have to sell his his name and whole identity with it uh and craft is so thrilled with their purchase kylie cosmetics is probably the biggest one that people know about because you have tons of attention through instagram tick tock whatever the tv show whatever and uh instead of just saying hey i'll you can pay me because people used to say wow you have to pay twenty five thousand dollars for a tweet from kim kardashian or then if that was twenty five thousand then it went up to like two hundred fifty thousand then two million dollars for an instagram post from is it two million dollars it got it got up to that range where it was like either hundreds of thousands or low millions to get like an actual like endorsement post from from one of them and um and so then you know cool you can make a lot of money doing that you're right you can you could stack up quarter million dollars at a time but kylie cosmetics was a billion dollar brand so i was like well who wants to who wants to pay me to promote their products well it's mostly like skincare products makeup products or for kim kardashian it's her shapewear like you know like uh and khloe kardashian it was like you know fashion or whatever so chloe launches true american jeans uh kim kardashian launches i think it's called what was it skims skims is it like the shapewear brand dude sean you're on top of it keep going kylie kylie cosmetics kanye yeezy shoes right layers like they all turned to say who whoever is the most willing advertiser actually you become my competitor and i'm going to launch my own brand my own equity and have my own equity in this thing and there's a guy in the nba who gets made fun of for this which is this guy lavar ball i don't know if you guys know this guy but basically he has three sons all three wanted to make it to the nba and this guy's this like loud mouth guy they got like a reality show around them because they're sort of like the like you know basketball version of the kardashians there's three brothers and like a a kind of an overbearing parent who is like architecting their business strategy and when they were gonna the guy was gonna get picked second in the draft and nike offered him a contract in adidas and instead he created big baller brand and you know triple b he created his own shoe line and like the shoes kind of sucked and like you know he didn't have the full business plan and people were making fun of him for like oh wow you turned down a guarantee 10 million dollars from nike to like launch this thing 10 million a year or whatever and it's like actually that was the right move now maybe his execution was slightly poor but that was actually the right move and and a lot of these nba players would have been better served had they done that themselves well how's it going now the shoe thing so the shoe thing's not going good basically the guy they had running it like was like kind of stealing from them so they fired him that was like a black mark on it the second brother never made it to the nba so that was like a little bit of an issue um the first brother kind of underperformed his potential at that time uh and actually now that it would have worked because the youngest brother the one who was like the the the one who's kind of like he was kind of like a a [ __ ] boy a little bit he's you know he's like had a goal you know like a diamond grill had like a lambo at 15 and was like you know he was kind of off the reservation he actually turned out to be the best one he's actually a star player and if they had kind of built it properly around him it probably would have done a lot better so i um nathan you'll get a kick out of this so like three or four weeks ago we did this thing where we said we're gonna give five g's to one or two three people who take our clips download it post it on tick tock and get views there's this kid who did it and i don't remember how many views he got but like our hashtag i think got 30 million views in like two weeks and this guy accounted for a lot of them and multiple of his videos got a thousand or sorry a million views one video got so big that we drove thirty five thousand new members to the subreddit and they complained and i was like reached out to this kid i'm like who are you and he replies back with like michael you michigan.org or something like that or dot you or whatever it is and i'm like wait dude are you in college and like he calls me and i face time with him and he's in his dorm room and he's young he's in still in college he's doing his universe i think and and he's really cocky not in a bad way but he's like he's got hutzpah he goes man i knew i was going to do this i wanted to prove to you guys that i could do it i want you to pay me money to do this now and i'm gonna do this for other people and we're gonna change the media game and i'm gonna raise money and i was like okay hold on dude hear me out and he goes i'm gonna i'm gonna go raise money for this thing uh do you wanna invest i go bro listen you do not wanna raise money for this here's what you should do you are so talented at this that don't raise money for this but get it big and start launching other stuff on top of it and if you want to raise money raise money for that stuff and own all he owns this thing called like um i forget what it's called future but he's got like eight handles now that have like a million something follow followers i'm like no no don't raise money for this thing man own that forever and that's your piggy bank and your audience raise money for like this other thing that you want to do and funnel it through there but don't sell that thing because i raised a little bit of money for my thing which was like that and i i don't regret it because i got the outcome that i wanted but i do regret it because it definitely hit you're massively handicapped because of it yeah one that's i think such a good point because you can have that platform to launch whatever you want in the same way that you know marxism can use his platform to then go launch the next thing right he probably has contracts that say he can't compete in the exact same space but he could do a fitness thing or he could do something else right you have the great point well i was gonna give an example conor mcgregor is doing this pretty brilliantly in the ufc so like uh the ufc gets knocked a lot because of they have like low fighter pay right like the the percentage of revenue that they give to their fighters is way lower than other sports nba is 50 nfl's like 50 ufc is like i don't know 15 or 20 so the fighters are you know they go out there they get their you know face beating in and they're they're they'll make twenty thousand dollars off that fight or forty thousand dollars or eighty thousand dollars and then they only get to do that two or three times a year so it's like a pretty brutal sport for low pay what conor mcgregor did was instead of selling the attention try to try to make money as his kind of like service fee he created a brand around literally every part of his lifestyle so he's like all right this thing's gonna get me famous but then okay what am i famous for people like my suits at the press conferences cool i'm launching a suit brand okay um i'm irish i'm going to launch an irish whiskey irish whiskey i think just sold for i don't know if you know samus yeah like he walked away with a hundred exactly then he's like um cool uh i'm super fit because i'm a ufc fighter my body's amazing here's my p90x program it's called mcgregor fast you can you can buy my program and subscribe to that and you can get fit with me oh you're getting fit and um guess what else do i do i recover okay here's a recovery spray that i spray on my leg that's like you know like makes my leg uh recover faster after workouts and the guy is literally just selling like every piece of his lifestyle as a independent brand like uh you know i think at one point he was thinking about launching a sports betting exchange it's like what is the best business who wants to pay me oh draftkings wants to pay me hmm maybe instead of draftkings is mcgregor kings now and i'll launch a competitor he just he just opened up a bar called the black ford exactly oh you know i had good good success with whiskey what else do we do irish stouts okay i'm gonna so he bought a bar not that the bar is that good it's like a bar in his hometown your bar's not gonna make a ton of money but then he used that bar as the like basically the backdrop to film him creating a stout and now he's going to sell a stout as a new like alcoholic beverage brand and uh it's kind of amazing the guy's going to become a billionaire and fighting is going to be the lowest part of his income stream is my guess which is insane i bet you i bet you mcconner conor mcgregor i bet you he goes well he might make a million he might lose a billion i think he could uh nathan oh you're you're worth like uh did you reveal the valuation of your company uh we we raised it 200 million okay so let's just i let's just i don't know what the facts are but let's just say you own 90 so you're worth 180 million dollars do you think that you can ever spend through that uh i would have to radically change my lifestyle but do you think is that enough yeah that's so much more than enough i think i spend like 200 grand a year so if that gives you an idea if you take a like if you set aside the things like when i'm not buying assets that's your burn that's your actual burden it's like 200 a year so yeah it would take a lot to yeah to spend through uh through that so we let's go let's go to this wealth ladder thing well i i hold on there's a point uh i'll go so what what sean was saying about um uh like the trend between all of these people is that that's what's in the rule number two of selling products not attention and that's the flip right so conor mcgregor is a perfect example of this because everyone's expecting people to sell attention right that's the the nascar logos plastered all over the car equivalent of that you're like great conor's doing that every celebrity and so you know you expect that uh um everyone like every influencer is going to do that and the wealthiest people are the ones who are like great i'm going to not do that i'm going to promote my own product conor is the extreme example of like i'm going to do 10 of these or something most people are like let me do one or two but that's where you're going to build this real wealth let's just hit the other rules real quick so rule number three drive higher customer value through recurring or repeat purchases so you'd rather have a a product that you can that has repurchase rate versus a one-off that's the big idea there yep yeah and that's the thing if you just look at the most valuable brands you see that a lot of them are selling a product that someone buys many times right yeah so you know if my first million created an idea journal it's probably not going to have super high repurchase rate because your you know one journal will last you a long time versus if we made uh you know the pure money deodorant and pure money deodorant is something that you would go through every two months then that consumable is going to be worth more than you know so product selection is important here yep and so even just going back to the ketchup example right right you know you're going through catch-up every month every couple months you know that's way better than something that uh lasts forever right billionaires catch up great okay so then last one uh choose a better business model so um what do you what are you pointing out here with choose a better business model yeah so there's a couple things in this one is uh well i'm using the example of uh vani hari who has the food babe um so she had information products business she's selling cookbooks meal plans all that and then she teamed up with a friend of mine derek halpern who was also in kind of that online business space and they went and made uh like a health supplements company and so it's completely different they've made this switch from you know that business model into uh selling this product that people are buying on a recurring basis that you know the brand can be acquired but then i think the other example that's interesting um i love listening to andrew wilkinson on the show and you know he did his whole thing his whole thing is using a very cash flow positive business right in meta lab of they're doing agency work honestly it's a very profitable business but it's not value that high in the market and so he's like okay i'm gonna take low to medium quality revenue and use it to go buy really high quality revenue you know because agencies they're not as recurring they're not a high multiple if you want to sell the business so it's like great i'm going to go buy software companies or start software companies you know and so i'm going to trade in you know one set of revenue for another and then you see this a lot in software where someone will launch two like you'll have two versions of the same tool one's like the wordpress plugin version where it gets it done and all that but none of those really turn into like substantial companies and so the ones that made it are like optinmonster where they built a wordpress plugin it was okay made millions of dollars but like it's not valued like a software company whereas when they go and rebuild uh like cya bulky rebuilt opt-in monster as a sas platform added more features you know they can charge a different pricing model um all of that and and then it's really valuable right you have to raise money at silicon valley evaluations you get to sell the company at those multiples um even though it's like fundamentally accomplishing the same uh three people who i think left money on the table you named two of them i have a third actually you might have named all three um okay so you talked about ramit sethi who you think you know maybe he's making 10 million a year in revenue selling kind of high-end courses his audience is all around personal finance and he pointed out like at the time where he had a bunch of audience and trust in personal finance and was advocating for a philosophy of like hey you know low fee index fund style investing set it and forget it um you know saving a certain portion of your revenue he could have built wealthfront which just got acquired for 1.4 billion you know yesterday or something like that uh which was like a robo advisor doing just that so instead of selling courses could have built a software product so left left some value potentially on the table um another one is tim ferriss right tim ferriss has makes a ton of money on sponsorships and ended up making a ton of money through investing in the right startups because of his brand name but you know could he have done what joe rogan did uh with like on it supplements right like i think tim ferriss has a huge trusted audience he said look i tried every supplement and here's my issues with them so i'm launching the paleo ketchup i'm launching the nootropic supplement i'm launching the the protein powder whatever whatever he could have picked you know i think is is a 500 million dollar business given the size and trust of his audience uh but it seems like he didn't go that path so what do you think of that of that oh the third was marie uh i think you had her in here uh and you i think you pointed out and yeah you pointed out two things she builds everything at her name instead of uh building like brands that can be dissociated from like her person the product is her telling you content her selling you time and consulting or whatever else her selling you a course versus her creating a product based on her belief system and you trust her so you think this product is gonna work for you so but listen to this sean you're well not exactly but you're criticizing these people you're doing the exact same thing so you've got this big audience of people who like and trust you that shockingly trust you and do what you say but you're building this other thing that people are begging to know what it is like do you think that like uh you're you should follow your own advice here oh totally um you know that's why i like this article i think it's it's an eye opener for it pieces together a bunch of like anecdotes and philosophies and by the time you read it all the way through you're like yeah of course of course i agree with this so i did it in a way with the fund so for example podcast uh podcast ad revenue i think our first year i made like 70 000 or something like that in podcast ads it wasn't much it was like a very the the value of the audience i felt was bigger than the the value of the trust in the audience was bigger than the the ad revenue and so i bet on that i was like okay well what if i raise the fund from these people who have been listening and i'm not going to take any i'm not going to do any pitch meetings i'm not going to make a presentation i'm just going to say hey if you trust me from this podcast and you want to invest alongside me in startups you can and so now that fund is like an eight million dollar a year investment vehicle so if you just take the math on that right you get two percent of that in management fee okay that's not that much but then you get 20 of carry so 20 carry means you're basically getting 1.6 million of startup equity that you're investing per year for free so 70 000 in ads versus 1.6 million in startup equity of which i get to pick the startups and i think those startups can you know what if that's 5x in the next uh you know seven to ten years so that means each year i'm getting something like five million dollars a year of value out of a product created from the podcast so that's an example of doing it example of not doing it is i do a course uh and the reality is i do the course just because i i i like teaching and b i like the instant cash flow from that because i can go buy stupid [ __ ] with it so for example uh like i wasn't i stopped teaching my course because i just got busy doing other [ __ ] and then i really wanted to go like do some random nft speculation and i was like ah i feel stupid doing this with my money what if i just like did a course for you know two weeks and then that let me go buy a board ape and a crypto punk and whatever else okay that sounds more fun um and so i'm like i'm down to you know teach successions to do that that seems like a good trade in my head mentally but i would say that's not actually a good use of time and then the new thing we're building the new product is kind of in that boat right the milk road isn't called sean's crypto newsletter it specifically has a new brand name and it has like staff around it and it's a product that if it works can be big and it'll be supercharged or kind of initially initially uh distributed by people who already follow me and like my content and then the second criticism which nathan can address which is like and maybe ramit would say this he's like well but i like blogging and i don't know anything about starting like a per uh a fintech company and what's the what's your reply to that nathan yeah i mean i think that's a great answer and like all these people who i like lightly pick on in my article they're all friends and and so that's one where like you got to choose the business model that's right for you but answer the question of like okay can this audience that i have make me a billionaire trying to have as many examples of like if that's the outcome that you want you know or maybe it's not a billionaire right because you raise money or something else but getting on that hundreds of millions of dollars on type scale then it's like okay well here's the framework that has to happen and if you're saying like look you know these we listed people who have amazing businesses right they're complete control of their time making millions of dollars a year you know like absolutely no complaints there so this is all on the case study of like how would you do it actually one of my favorite examples i used um michael hyatt as an example in this article and he replied like he sent me an email right after it and said like hey we actually discovered the exact same thing personal brand entirely we're selling digital products we're very tied to our email list we're doing like sponsors and stuff like that and we realized like oh this business is gonna you know reach some limits and so he then built out all these sub businesses they built out a journal product you know other physical products and realized okay how can we build what we take what we have now and use it to leverage um you know other independent brands and like kickstart and launch them and so it's fascinating to like use someone as an example and have them come back and be like you're spot on in describing our business but you're actually two years like you were spot on two years ago we realized the same thing we're fixing it and now like everyone will see the result a little while from now and so uh yeah if people want this path you know that's that's the way to go about it how big is this how many notebooks does this guy sell uh i don't know that i have the numbers i'm trying to think what he what he put in the article but it's uh his other products are now bigger than all the things that we know him for so in the tens of millions of dollars that's crazy um all right what were we saying sean i was gonna jump to the ladders of wealth because i think this is the other kind of nice framework that you have so um and this is kind of like i think some people have heard of kind of stuff like this but i just want to like lay out the fast version and then we can go into whatever's whatever's interesting from this so you have this image of uh of a series of ladders and it's not like one ladder that you just go up up and up it's basically like if you use if you choose this method of wealth creation your ladder can be this high but if you choose this method of wealth creation it can go one rung higher or it can go two runs higher or four rungs higher depending on which one you choose so here's here's how it works so it's basically the lowest ladder the smallest ladder is you're selling time for money so that's having a job or being uh yeah having a job basically then there's your own service business so this might be like an agency you're charging by the project you have some clients you charge some hourly rate whether you're you know it doesn't matter if you're like making logos for some company or you're a lawyer you're actually in the same boat you have a service business with clients you charge an hourly rate then there's product side productized services which is um it's giving a given example of a product of productizing yes so the example would be let's say i charge 100 an hour to redo the copywriting on your website you know and so i'm i'm doing that or i say for a thousand dollars one time you can buy it with a credit card you know i will go and rewrite your site you know or write you one whole landing page um and so there's a couple really important things there uh one the purchase is being made without me talking to you like if i'm charging a hundred bucks an hour we'll probably have a conversation you're like we're planning that um second thing is it's pre-packaged so you know exactly what you're buying and then the the third thing is that the time and money are totally disconnected so if i get better and better uh if i hire people any of that right like i'm not having to sit there for 10 hours and do it and so there's a bunch of these skills that they have to learn to do the productized service an example a simple example we i think ryan beagleman came on the pod long time ago and he talked about drop servicing which was a version of this so like the the example he was given is like there's these products that are like um you pay thirty dollars and i'll draw a picture of you you and you give me a picture of you and i'll draw you as a simpsons character or like you can send this as a gift so somebody loves the simpsons you can give me a photo of them i'll draw it as sims character you get it so it has all the elements you talked about self-serve you come in has a predefined price you just click a button and you pay um you get a defined product end product out of it so we're kind of both clear on the bargain and then third you don't know how long it takes me you don't know how much it costs me i don't have to do the work myself so with a lot of these character services it's like it just gets piped to a you know person in the philippines who's an artist they take the gig they submit it they get seven dollars the the service keeps you know whatever twenty three dollars and uh and it's all done so that's like an example of a productive service and uh by the way isn't there like a facebook group called production who runs that there's a guy running that's pretty interesting yeah we talked about him uh yeah great name um green felt maybe or something like that so so what he does is he's got this facebook group and the reason i like is so niche but it's actually pretty valuable for if you're in that niche so he has this facebook group called productized uh services or something like that productized businesses and um [Music] and what he was doing was he would just show an example so he'd say oh look this is a real estate agent and before here's how it used to work you know here's their page here's their face call them up become a client blah blah blah and he's like oh sorry that's not a good example it's i make what i design websites i can code anything you can hire me as a freelancer and then he changed it to a product i service which is you're a real estate agent you need a website for your company i make real estate agent websites come here pick one of the six templates push go i'll give you a website um and i'll charge you a fixed fee of 250 or 500 to give you that website and so it's basically a way of productizing a um a service you know what the best name that i've ever heard for that is jack butcher who's our friend and he has this course it's got it's a beautiful it's called build once sell twice it's so good it's such a good name i took the course yeah did you love it yeah i loved it just because everything jack does is done so well so you know uh he could you know write me a birthday card and i would be like wow i love birthday cards now it's like do i really love birthday cards or do i just love jack butcher i think i just love jack butcher actually yeah his ability to take something and like distill it down to the absolute essence uh and like build one cell twice is that like it's selling products you know you're saying okay i can make this thing a single time and and then sell it as many times as i want which everyone talks about the upside of that of like oh this is going to be amazing right i can build this and sell it a bunch of times no one talks about the downside that like it's so freaking hard to do the first like to make the first one you know whereas if i'm building a one-off thing like using websites for example like okay i'm supposed to build a website for sam he's paying me 2000 bucks like i build this out it's not that hard i can use my skills to do it the product version is like building a website builder you know that's incredibly hard and so you have this like trough for a long time where you're not going to make money in the short term but the like the leverage is incredible how old are you now 31. so you're 31. as long as i've known you we've known each other since we're both like 23 24 you've always pretty much been the same where you were pretty calm very patient i would say patient would probably be the best word to describe you and there's been a lot of times i remember in 2014 or something like that i didn't have much money but i hollered at my really rich friend and i was like man nathan is doing like a hundred grand a month like in revenue this thing's gonna be big you should try to invest and maybe i could broker a deal and you would and uh if i did that then i met you you probably had a ton you've also probably had a ton of people who were trying to buy the company for a life-changing amount of money and you've probably had loads of other um opportunities so my question is how have you stayed pretty calm and also incredibly patient throughout all this patience is something i struggle with sean was telling you about uh how he launches like a new does a new drop every week and like and i i think that that's rooted in like oh but we need the numbers to go up this week and like you got caught and i've done this i do the same thing where i'm like but it's not growing now and i need to so how have you done so patient and long-term focused well i think part of his personality and you're right that like uh patient and relentless are probably two things you could use to describe me back then uh and now but i think a lot of the ideas that are in some of these articles or that i try to write about is really in building this one thing so i think about uh what analogy that like is strip malls versus skyscrapers let's say we're getting into real estate development and we've got a piece of land and you're trying to decide okay what what should we build on it and so you want to make money quickly and so you build like uh you know first little office building or something you got like a radio shack there now you're making you got a little bit of cash flow coming in you know you want to expand so you build another you know add on to that now we've got a subway and we're we've built it out and we've got a little strip mall or a shopping center and that's like we're gonna use up our land uh each time we're expanding horizontally and so we're you know launching a new product the version of this is the like the blogger podcaster someone who's like i've got my ebook my membership site my whatever other thing that i'm doing you know i keep adding and each one makes a little bit of money my approach on everything is the skyscraper model of like i'm gonna do one thing and i'm gonna keep pouring everything into that and just keep going taller and taller and taller and make some and so like convertkit is my attempt at a skyscraper and like in the billion dollar creator article it's all about people i think who are building those skyscrapers you've not you've not always done that actually i think and i think that that's a good strategy but i i would actually say it's pretty cool that you've not always done that and i'll give you an example but the reason why it's cool is because like you're flawed and you do you you definitely have you're you're even though you're incredibly patient long-term thinking like maybe it's not rooted in this probably but like there are some examples for example like you've done a bunch of book launches you've launched like eight or nine things that's that have sucked uh you did this great twitter thread were you well no he did this twitter that's very sucked yeah he goes here's the nine things that i've created that were horrible no he had a threat i don't know if he used the word suck maybe he said fail yeah flopped or something like that so yeah this is something else right like we all want to jump in and build the most perfect product uh and you can't do that because there's all of these skills you have to learn like that's the point of this ladders of wealth creation article is that like business and building wealth is the combination of like a thousand little skills and if you try to do it all at once you know like you're going to fail and so that's like in these ladders the one point that i'm trying to make is that the like you know i put marketplaces and social networks you know and at the top of the hardest ladder and then just below that is sas because if you think about the number of skills that you have to know in order to do that like sam what was uh the first product you sold online um i uh well there was two it was liquor so i sold alcohol on the internet and then i also created a guide on how to how to find a roommate in san francisco okay so that guide like do you remember as you were trying to figure out how to collect payments for that or like how to put together a page that would sell it that's why he was at the gumroad meetup yeah i ended up using gumroad because it was so stressful i couldn't figure out i was like well i was like i remember going to shopify i'm like well does shopify let you sell pdfs how does that work so yeah one of those things right you're trying to figure out how to do like okay how to collect money on the internet is something you have to learn and now we're just like we could we could rattle off a whole bunch of ways right but someone's starting out saying hey i want to get into this they don't know how to collect money on the internet they don't know how to write headlines they don't know how to collect email subscribers why that even matters right all of these things and so i think the best way to do it is to learn through a bunch of these other little products right and so that was like basically what you're seeing all the way along with the ebooks and everything else is me learning all of the skills that ended up culminating and being able to build conversations yeah that's right and then the other thing is like if i say i only focus on convertkit like that's not fully true because i like to have contrast in my life i think that's something that helps and so like we we started off you know riffing on some real estate stuff and the reason that i like it is because you spend all your time sitting in front of a computer and so doing something tangible like airbnb or something in the real world like to me is the opposite because i get to actually go see a real property i get to uh you know um visit in person it's a totally different experience my friend um sean blanc says uh if you work with your mind you should rest with your hands and that's i like that idea of like just doing something that's the opposite and so i think if you give yourself these little indulgences of like uh buying a house in airbnb or starting like a one-off paid newsletter that you run on autopilot or sean what you're doing where you're like run out and make a course and then you're like okay that was fun i think that can be a creative outlet that helps you focus on the main thing rather than saying like oh i'm going to go create 10 main things when you've been creating convertkit um let's say that either you've sold the company and you still want to like do interesting things or you're 21 or 25 years old and you want to start something what interesting opportunities or problems that need to be solved have you discovered where you're like i can't do that now but it'd be pretty cool if someone like someone could totally get into the blank and do blank yeah okay this is uh honest but a terrible answer to your question because of the night because i also did it right um is as we were doing email marketing you know and running the newsletters for like james clare and tim ferriss and everyone else um the thing that i wanted to do is then get into commerce of like okay we have this whole side of it right where we're sending all the emails have the connection to the fans now i want to build um the like the credit card processing and i want to get a cut of everything that they sell um and so then i realized like oh and that was always the answer uh actually if someone's like if you weren't doing convertkit what would you do now i always said i'd go start a gun road competitor and then the nice thing is there's that synergy there so it's like okay i went and started a gun road competitor called convertkit commerce it's in the same product so it's like uh both a realistic answer and probably not very satisfying for you because it's totally different gumroad has been around for a long time now up until recently they pretty much had never done anything to change it um and no one is competing with them but there's a downside it doesn't make that much money like i actually don't know what it makes anymore but as of a couple or a few years pass like he would tweet out his revenue and like it was really hard to build a business where he was making like four percent of someone's like ten dollar pdf you know what i mean so that's why you have to build a build a better business model right and so if you look at something and say how could we improve that business model the thing that i saw in that is like okay uh what if we had another product alongside it that we sold it's right so for convertkit we make money off of uh your email subscription and so i now have these two things that go hand in hand and so uh the commerce side is really good because now like we're able to for every one of our customers right who's selling products we're able to make a little cut of that and they don't feel like they're paying us anything extra because it's just a bit of a credit card processing fee um and then it also reduces our churn because anyone who's selling through convertkit commerce um right they're now like convertkit is paying them rather than uh the other way around and so we saw a radically low return so i'd argue that like gumroad by itself or you know the gumroad competitor that i wanted to start by itself you're right it's not that good of a business model but when you pair it with convertkit and make the creator marketing platform this is turning into a sales pitch but you get the idea that i'm trying to make um it's the like the combination of those two things that then makes it a fantastic business model and so you have to look at okay this is working i want to go after this in whatever space it is and then take a step back and say okay what are the flaws in the business model what other products do i pair it with what other audience do i targeted against you know any of those things that actually makes it a compelling business instead of like an average business and do do you actually are you still hands-on with convertkit or are you i know you're the ceo but do you have someone helping you run it or are you still the guy in charge no i'm uh way too hands-on uh the thing that people don't tell you in startups is that like the growth that you see is a whole bunch of stacked s-curves you know of like you figure out things that work and it takes off and then it levels out and you got to figure out the next uh plot or like the next uh stage of growth and so i'm uh very hands-on like we've had a few executives leave over the last year uh just a lot of change and so i'm like completely into recruiting new executives uh working with the team to design the next version of the product and so yeah i'm not the the like uh case study of what you should do for the perfect execution on you're not the four-hour work week i i'm not the four-hour work week [Laughter] do you grind i mean i know you got like 18 kids uh no three yeah i know i i just because as long as i as long as i remember you i think your oldest are like you had your oldest when you were young and so i always would tease i'm like what do you have like 40 kids now um [Laughter] and uh but you you are you grinding right now or do you have is it a 40 hour work week uh it's uh it's right now it's a lot more than a 40 hour work week but it's interesting of trying to structure that around like kids you know of it's a lot of like waking up early you know or like this weekend uh we're headed out for our team retreat like meeting everyone up in person so i'm leaving saturday morning so like this morning when my kids woke up early i like we went out of the house and like spent two or three hours together you know before because i know i'm gonna work all day and and then be gone all next week so uh yeah i don't work a crazy amount but at least like 50 to 55 hours a week is probably what i aim for so i don't know if that counts as grinding but it's definitely not not relaxing it's in the middle yeah in the middle i think of grinding and neck grinding um what do you think sean uh i think it's great you know i think convert i'm a user so i uh and i i complained to nathan all the time i'm like i'm paying too much for convertkit and he's like you do complain about that and he was good and i just point out how much money you make yeah he was like um but you know email's like making you all this money and i'm like yeah but i just feel like email's free and like this should be free and i was like i was like can i just get this for free and he's like well you know like let me know what you think is you know you're very very patient with me and it was sort of like you know because i was like i was like i don't know i told ben i was like ben go find like what we should use instead of convertkit and then kind of like search for a couple products and then he was like well you know like they're all kind of worse but there are some cheaper options you want worse but cheaper and i was like oh [ __ ] i gotta choose worse but cheaper wait what's your what's your what's your bill every month i think i pay like 400 a month maybe more i don't even know uh that's what you're and how much money do you make a month well see it's not about that right like it's more those are two separate things i feel like because because the email directly doesn't make me that much money uh it's like got it through the email i build the audience and then through the audience if i launch a product or a course or whatever yeah that makes a bunch of money but that's separate work i gotta go do with a separate set of costs that go into that and so we actually did we were like oh should we switch and then i kind of respected that nathan wasn't just like uh whatever it takes to stay you know here you go free i was like i was like uh okay the fact that he didn't do that tells me like he knows the value of his thing and um as much as i hate that i'm you know not getting this like free discount or whatever i respect that and so i stuck with it nathan are you mormon no i'm not dude you got the big mormon energy man [Laughter] i mostly just hear from you sam you've never heard that from anyone else i mean you live in idaho you you you had kids at 21 like you're you work hard you're honest it seems like you don't party you got hardcore mormon energy mountain dew all the time yeah gotta avoid the caffeine uh no sean what i was gonna say is uh that what what's funny is so like tim mcgraw and arnold schwarzenegger both have convertkit newsletters and they pay full price and they don't ever give me [ __ ] about it but then it's the it's like the internet influencers where they're like i should get this for free you know and i'm like no so it's fascinating because we've had that a lot over the years right of people saying like hey what discount can you give me do you know how famous i am and kind of what's fun is getting into uh i separate them from internet famous and actual famous and the more you've gotten into the actual famous space the more it's very easy to say like no man here's the value that we provide and and i think i was giving you a hard time because you had just done a thread like two weeks earlier about your paid newsletter that was making like 50 or 100 grand a month i can't remember if i like linked you to the same thread but that's what i wanted to do in the twitter dms so how big is how big is arnold's list oh we can't say those numbers but he's uh still relatively small who's whose list is bigger his his list are my list my list is not very big but uh his experience i think it could be the same thing as arnold no way that [ __ ] you don't have a favorite little uh like business model synergy that weakly [Laughter] so he was on like it's fun like as he goes around promotes his newsletter right because he goes on like jimmy kimmel and he's talking about his email newsletter which is is always fun um yeah i go on indie hackers dude but uh when like a business model thing that's funny is when one convert a customer links to another to grow their list so like when tim ferriss links to uh arnold's list and said like hey you know go sign up for arnold's list it added you're like 40 000 subscribers and it's just like our cut just goes up you know just one customer just referred to the other but now anyway it's a fun dude you got to write a blog post like the best way to grow your list partnerships here's like a list of like interesting people to partner with so uh i have a vp of growth opening uh do you want to come come here for morning brew actually as we discussed last episode yeah last episode morning brew offered me a job too there you go it's actually like a great power move is to just offer uh staff writer jobs or staff jobs to ceos of other companies just to like flex on them okay you know i heard things are tough um just so you know we're we're always there's always a home for you here so let's just say of mailchimp like the like a month into starting the hustle um i like we wrote blog posts whatever and we were i was trying to hire writers and i saw this awesome article and i and i don't remember where it was but the author was nelly bowles i think her name is b-o-w-l-b-o-w-l-e-s and now she's like a really famous new york times person and i think like even when i found her she was actually at the new york times but like had just done a one-off piece for this small magazine and i emailed her i'm like you are so good would you love to interview for a position at my company like we're looking for bloggers and she was like that's cute but no thanks and uh i will never forget that she told me that's cute i've i have held this grudge against her for years because she said it's cute for years you could just imagine like the little pat on the head and the hair tassel that went with like you know like it kept me up at night like so many i was like i'm gonna how am i gonna get revenge and i don't have a good way but that was like eight years sam's like arya stark before bed every night he says a list of the names of the people he needs to like get revenge on is like nelly bowles i definitely have you know like what they said like i got like a bunch of champagne bottles with people's names on it and whenever i get back at them like crack that champagne bottle open and drink it like yeah i want some people's heads on my desk that's for sure we have a buddy on that list not much turns out not much yeah just don't call me cute um just be like you know comment on one of his instagram uh you know videos and just be like um it's awesome for a beginner just let me move on like you're still at it awesome [Music] we uh we have a buddy who is like the nicest guy in the world like uh you know we'll give you the shirt off his back and uh nice to everybody kind of strangers kind of animals kind of everybody and you go into his house and on his fridge he's got this like clip art picture of a of a brand name of a another company's logo with a target and like kind of like a red target like a sniper um and he's got three of them on his fridge and i remember going over like what's this about and he's like oh yeah he's kind of like you know those are my those are my competitors i just every day when i come to the kitchen i just want to think about you know just sort of killing them basically and i was like whoa there's a dark side to the uh to mr nice guy here do you have one of those nathan i would bet anything nathan does not have anything like what we're talking about he's got you are so wrong i bet you that he he will i don't know if he'll admit it i bet you he hates mailchimp oh see i have weird feelings about mailchimp because i have so much respect for them and like dude you have respected them like the guy who killed john lennon has respect for him it's called a love knife you love him so much you want to kill him that's like what it is it's like the guy who like killed the pope that's what you're gonna do so you have to separate the businesses like the business from the people so i think that's true like one time uh i was at a conference and ben chestnut was speaking and so i emailed him and was like hey man were you i don't even know why he said yes but it's just like like big fan of what you've done like all in all fairness for a competitor trying to take as much business from you as you can but would you be up for sitting down and talking and he said like yeah i have a flight at this time so i'm checking out the hotel so like meet me in the hotel lobby you know and we'll chat for 30 minutes gave you the wrong hotel love it great power move bent chestnuts set me on this wild views yeah it's like you missed your flight he never had a flight but no he like he sat down with me and told me all about how they launched their free plan and all this stuff and then the they were inc magazine's uh company of the year this is the inc magazine like in 5000 event and so the editor in chief from inc magazine comes up while we're talking he's like hey ben great talk all of that and uh um he ben goes hey do you know nathan he's trying to kill my company and like as he introduces me to the editor-in-chief of ink magazine and anyway so what would it look like if you just like assaulted him right there sam's gone now he's still thinking like like killing nelly balls with the love knife or whatever for the record nelly i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do anything is this the same person that you had the interview the famous interview with at the new york times or the new yorker or whatever it was and like the interview did not go well it did not go is this with her no that was uh aaron griffin and she like came to interview me and i don't even know why but she was fishing for stuff and she's like so like what do you do in the weekends like listen to joe rogan that's what she said to me i'm like what like no like he doesn't even like that's monday to friday he doesn't even have a podcast yeah and she was like well like because you're like a tech bro and i'm like first of all most of new york times revenue is digital you're a tech company so you tell me what your tech friends do and uh so anyway yeah that thing did you storm out or or how did that end sometimes yeah i was just like i don't know what to say i'm out of here yeah i i it didn't it didn't end well that's so good ah those interviews i've only ever had one of those um i don't remember who it was with but where you're like okay i i think we're done where you can just tell that they're like looking for some angle and all the questions are weird but why would anyone hate you because you're kind of perfect it's good that you bring that up like just like it's like well it's true so i'm not sure what the problem is yeah it's like i like this i've got there's a lot of it's like it's like the shower clip of biden uh the other day when he called the the journalist was like on the way out did you see this clip a stupid [ __ ] like you know what do you think about inflation and biden just like in that moment was just like he lost it he was just like yeah great stupid son of a [ __ ] that's how i imagined nathan like breaking character in like one of these interviews so okay sam i have a question on this then like do you think that being so nice in all of this and and like everyone likes me it holds back my uh growth as an entrepreneur and you know uh internet so i want to be internet celebrity no because um a like you're happy and it's working so i think that's like the goal and b you actually have dropped it a couple times so you don't have to talk about this if you don't want to but basically you didn't like what sahil at gumroad did and you called them out and it was pretty uh it was pretty vicious and i knew that do you know this sean what did he call him out for dude he just like publicly kind of [ __ ] slapped sahil and like for one it was crazy so uh so i was around as sam was talking about i was around gumroad from the very beginning uh i think i was the first independent or at one point they told me i was the first independent seller to cross ten thousand dollars in sales on government so like from the very very beginning um and uh anyway so friends with tons of people there and like spent a lot of time at their office and all of that and a huge friend of sawhill's but at one point he like got burnt out on the company they had to offer to buy the company he didn't take it he laid everyone off instead like it wound down and and like ultimately failed but the thing is with a platform like that they don't like fail and disappear they just like fail when coast and still like the software still works and all that and then he came back and told this totally different story of like uh here's how i you know like vc is evil and i'm running the company like in this totally new way um here's how i run it in five hours a week with like two contractors and that was frustrating but i didn't say anything but then when they went and raised new money and didn't give any they they got all the vcs to write off their equity they got all of the team members to be like hey it's a failed company like give up your equity and all that as part of it and they went and raised a bunch of new money and didn't uh go back and give the original team members like that pissed me off because it was like i know exactly who built the software you know like because i sat next to them as we were talking about it you know at their office in san francisco and like i know they don't have any equity and i know that you didn't take care of them and now you're like telling this new story and everything so uh yeah i guess sam i do make some enemies on the internet and when you said that i was like well as i don't know sahil uh he seems like a nice guy from my limited interactions with him but i was like well if nathan's saying that it's probably true yeah and you know you could separate the person from like the decision i've made a bunch of bad decisions uh but i don't think i'm a bad guy and oh me too i've made a lot and yeah and so you know i i would separate the two like because he you know probably a nice guy i i don't know him super well either but um but you're right like you know the the way he kind of got twitter famous in a way was to come out and tell this story of like the kind of like it was like a fail story that worked it was like we were the hot thing we raised money we had all these expectations people bet on us it didn't work um and so now we're in this new mode and i've seen the light it was sort of like you know i got baptized and now i believe um that this business should be done this other way okay fair enough um and some people really liked that they thought it was very transparent all that good stuff but it was weird that like you know a year or two later it's like i'm raising new money at a hundred million dollar valuation it's like wait you're back on the that train like weren't you kind of saying like you know all the things that were wrong with that model and like yeah championing the the freedom that you were getting and the choose your own destiny and getting off the rat race like maybe i read it wrong maybe i was just skimming and i missed the point but like that did seem strange to me and then like you're saying nathan like it's kind of weird to kind of to do that whole thing in public when a whole bunch of people bet on you lost money on you and um and are not participating in the like you know future and so that would leave a bad taste in people's mouth i think so you know i think it's fair points um you know and i'm sure i'm sure he's got his side of the story about why it's not bad and why it's not that and all those things so you know fair enough but he's not here so i'm just going to say my side and it seems like that'll be the final word uh i mean tons of credit to sahil afterwards because he like he owned up to parts of it and we had a good conversation about it and he actually then when he launched his book um he actually included convertkit and the story in it which i was really surprised so uh as far as people who don't hold a grudge i think uh sahil's one not so like there's just one guy i always call my rival and uh i'm sure from his perspective he's either like who is this or he's like wait why are we rivals we we got a lot we got one just fine and in my head this is like somebody i met in uh when i was in college and um the guys got like a super ultra rich dad like billionaire dad and uh i always used to joke like if i ever played basketball there usually wasn't like another indian guy like playing basketball so if there ever was like the running joke and my group of friends in college was well sean we know who you're guarding like you have to guard him and you need to win your match up here like your honor is on the line basically like we need to know who's the better indian basketball player on the court right now it was just like this running joke and so that got extended once we i started a business with my college friends they were like well seems like this guy is like you know your rival and i played into it and we kind of made it a thing where the guy would be like you know hanging out with richard branson on his island and we were like just trying to create a chip on our shoulder underdog stories like you know i'd be sleeping on my air mattress that i was planning to return to target to like save money because our business wasn't doing any good and if you saw this other guy like you know sipping pina coladas with richard branson it just felt like oh those are the halves and we're the have-nots and so i was like manufacturing these little feuds or like um i remember we did a we when we bought bibo back we were going to relaunch it and i gave the scoop to this girl who was like really nice journalist to me um she was somebody i'd met she seemed really nice and i was like hey do you want this the story like i'll give you the story about like what we're gonna do and how it all played out she's like yeah great so we she comes over i do the interview it's like literally you know we're playing patty cake it's all good article comes out the next day and the headline is like just some vicious it's like remember bibo huh yeah that you know that flop is back again it was just like it was like oh my gosh it's like disgusting hurry as he told yeah if you like spinach go eat some of the stuff that came out of shawn's teeth it's still probably there so i felt so backstabbed you know not no love knife just straight knife and i remember just being like so i never had the interview where i walked away i had the opposite where i felt completely and i texted her i was like yo what the [ __ ] because actually the article was fine just the headline was completely brutal it was just making fun of us and saying like get a load of this [ __ ] schmuck and um and she's like sorry like the editor writes the headlines and he just thought that that's what would get more clicks like i don't have any say in that and i was like oh so [ __ ] you in your profession uh was like you know where i landed on that um i think that was my only feud actually my other one where i called uh what's her name uh the jake paul of journalism was probably the other one taylor lorenz yeah like i think that i actually think it's great fuel i mean like i joke to my wife i'm like i'm fueled on like carbonated water and like grudges like i think grudges i think are like the greatest fuel ever like isn't that like the whole thing about being like a chip on your shoulder like approaching what it is like crutches is like my macros yeah i'm just like yeah like i gotta make sure i get my rage in that day otherwise i just don't feel like myself it's like ari gold i just love firing people um so anyway i think it's good i think rage is great that's the key takeaway from this episode people listen sam you do need like a lloyd let me go manufacture some bridges somebody yeah every when we first met ben levy or i met him the first time you were like well you know sam's a little challenging i just had to give him a heads up don't take it personal if he kind of fires off ari gold is actually a great great analogy because there's no there's no um uh what's it called like there's no hate behind the words right like i'm yelling but i love you like it has nothing to do with how much i like you or how good i think you are i'm just yelling because i'm yelling and uh so i tried to give him the heads up but you were so zen uh this was post post exit sam is a completely different guy he's uh you know you're not already old anymore he'll come back in due time um dude nathan thanks for coming on happy uh happy you you're able to make it i uh i bailed on you last week sorry and i'm happy that we made it work this time yeah thanks for having me it's always fun you wanna know yeah yeah um okay so if people want to follow me online uh i'm i'm currently trying to grow my twitter audience so you should go follow me there uh i'm trying to see if i can go from i'm at fifty thousand [Laughter] you know i only want the most dedicated fans who are like really no i'm just kidding thanks for the advice uh sean add that to your ladder shove that in your ladder you know what we didn't discuss and i don't have time now but one time sean nathan renamed the company convertkit to something else and he didn't realize it but it meant like something like it was disrespectful to hindus hindi's hindi plural and it was disrespectful and he made this huge name change and they changed the company back to convertkit after like 24 hours wait what was it what was what was that okay i speak what is that i mean service but in sea culture it means like selfless service and like the highest form of worship yeah and so it's the whole thing like i'm doing it i'm doing a service for you i don't know i don't find that offensive that's not offensive yeah there were uh a lot of people who did find it offensive and so yeah if we're talking about we talk about mistakes turns out i'm not as easily offended i got in trouble so uh hindus didn't find it offensive and i actually had a lot of people who were like uh that's like thought that it was awesome or something like that um but yeah everyone who was from the sikh culture they were like sorry it yeah it had a much different meaning uh there so anyway that was a 500 000 mistake but uh i owned up to it so that's the whole thing for another by the way that the the convertkit good name the other thing like seven or whatever you said not a good name like so i think hindu maybe can that doesn't seem like the right name for an email yeah conversation is a great name that's such a good name well so maybe it was a 500 000 mistake that will turn out to be a multi-million dollar win do you do you still have the domain because we should just launch like a um prayer uh service or like you know like a philanthropy uh thing for india under that i have some indian startups that might want that name i do have the domain there's actually two startups one that went through y combinator and one other uh that uh have asked for it at one point but i paid 340 thousand dollars for the domain so i'm i'm kind of hanging on to it this is a four letter domain four letters i don't even know how to spell that word i spell that word s-e-v-a right yeah but um it sounds like a bottled water dude something that you're gonna like send emails from so i think smart move my uh i got in trouble this morning because i wrote so in the milk road edition that went out this morning uh one of the things we covered was like oh the fed the fed had this meeting about interest rates and how that's affecting like the markets and uh and i was like basically i put a picture up of the committee that meets the fed open market committee and it's basically like a bunch of old white people and i was like you know and today you know i had a bunch of different openers that i scrapped one was like here's a picture from a nursing home i visited recently oh wait no that's not right that's the fed open market committee and i scrapped that and i said something else and then i was like you know at today's elderly white people committee and i like i had a strikethrough and i was like no at the fed open market committee rural mcdonald's at like 7 a.m and people got mad at you it's like a seas candy and yeah people were like you know the skin color has nothing to do with it i was like yeah of course it's a joke and it has everything to do with my joke and like just the picture's funny and like wait i thought we could make fun of the fed with no repercussions like that there's like certain things that are really safe to punch at and uh the fed seems like one of the safest you know the fed you know the the senate like who's who's defending their honor i don't understand who are you is your mom on this is your grandma on this panel yeah some people got mad at me um i was like you should go ahead and unsubscribe because uh my filter is a lot looser than that dude nathan thank you this is awesome yeah thanks for having me we'll have to do it again sometime and we'll have to hang out in austin when you get this new property we'll come and do a workout on the you know on the ranch come on let's go sounds good challenge accepted grudge initiated [Music] you

google makes 95 of their revenue from one thing but they're constantly trying to launch all this other stuff i talked to this woman whose job it was to help manage the ceos of the projects and decide what's interesting and what's not and she told me that they have some products that would scale to 100 million in revenue in only a couple years and they would kill it and i was like why'd you kill it and they go well two reasons one the people who we get to run them they're oftentimes paid so much money that they don't give a and second they're like google is so big that even though a product makes a hundred million plus in revenue over the course of a few years which could be worth a couple billion dollars it's just not worth it to us we just have so much better ways to spend our time and i was flabbergasted it's pretty wild to think about that

the the opposite of what people think people think you should go learn some secrets theories that you don't know and then you need to like develop your own voice and like come up with original content it's like actually that's a really slow way to get better [Music] so i was saying i i have a lot to ask you about this document what did you say i said are you going to ask me about my fresh green smoothie maybe my green goddess salad or maybe the green can of mountain dew giant steak that the chef made you know what kind of life am i living here this is an incredible life um well i would say maybe like now is not the best time to eat a salad and a steak maybe like later it's like you literally are eating a steak right now yeah i took one bite right the countdown to recording was like five four three two one i was like i gotta get it in um before we really get into stuff um so did you see that picture that i shared of you when we first started recording yeah that was great so and i was kind of reflecting on it and the reason i was reflecting on it is the hustle like the the the newsletter the hustle has a daily podcast coming out and they've worked on it for like months when we started i mean you rented a studio at first but then it was you and i like i'm pretty sure we just used our iphone headphones and we were in that shitty like closet yeah we were in a club we were basically in a closet with on a table where we were so close together that any time i talked your mic picked it up anytime you dug my bank so it's like an awful awful recording you can see the in the photo you posted about like us recording i'm like hunched over i got my glasses on i didn't wear my contacts i'm wearing my jacket still because i just walked over from my office and just like we started recording instantaneously i'm looking at my phone you know like uh really wasn't you know you know some people are like you know you wear a suit you know act like act like you you're gonna be where you want to be or whatever uh i definitely wasn't doing that i was just sort of like uh whatever none of this video stuff matters all that matters is the audio let's just do that which wasn't entirely wrong but what what i was proud of was that when we did it like we really often times we would just use the iphone and just like an audio file and the uh like i said i'm recording this on an iphone are you you're using your iphone or using the fancy well we have fancy mics now but like there was one time where i remember like we literally like it was like a speaker phone and an iphone but the the hustle guys they've got this podcast coming out and they're doing it every day i'm and i'm going to pop on it sometimes i they're going to ask you to pop on it sometimes too but they're doing a daily podcast i think it's going to work it's so it's so much work though daily like about the news about what yeah they're doing it's called the hustle daily show so it's easy right and they're doing a podcast every single day it launches wednesday and um we were talking about i just left a meeting where i was helping them get it off the ground and i was like what i told them was it's gonna work right away i think so like when your episodes when it was just you came out it took off right away but then it goes down when like the when the novelty wears off and that's when you've got to like actually develop this skill and i would actually say sean i would say you started out pretty great but then and i would say i started out decently as well decent as well but then we like developed the skill and that's like when it really starts getting good and i'm like don't forget guys when you start doing this it's like a skill this isn't like some people like you were talented but you still have to like hone this in yeah and by the way the best way to do that is just to be a fan of other people's work uh because if you're a fan of other people's work you'll pick up on the little things that they do that um it's like man why do i love this i love this because blah blah blah and you're never gonna recreate that but if you see five examples then you start to realize what the bar is and where you need to be and so it's like you you talk about this with copywriting how do you become a better copywriter it's actually other people's work the opposite of what people think people think you should go learn some secrets theories that you don't know and then you need to like develop your own voice and like come up with original content it's like actually that's a really slow way to get better the way you get better is you do copy work which is you write other people's you literally hand write word for word what somebody who's writing you love what they do and uh you write that and i do this still i do it as a warm-up basically so if i'm gonna write something i'll first spend five ten minutes and actually i wanna one of the pieces i copy work is yours you have something that you have this post it's very hard to find because every time i want it it's so hard for me to go find it again so you need to like put this front and center somewhere which points but basically it starts with let's let me be perfectly clear you're reading this because i want you to yes that's a good one right yeah it's like i'm casting a spell but i'm not forcing you to do something you don't want to do you want to know what i'm talking about and you like write it like that and so and i know it because i've copywritten this same thing like a bunch of times and um and i just love that let me be perfectly clear let's be perfectly clear it's so good and then you're like you're reading this because i want you to every line is getting you to further down the slippery slope and you're like you're explaining what's going on uh so that one that one is brilliant i love that one that you do i have another one that's uh the scott adams one the day you became a better writer yeah he goes um in the first sentence is like the most important part of that whole thing right i forget the i forget it what was it do you remember i don't know ben pull that up but but basically this method is actually applicable to many things so if you want to learn uh you know how to play the guitar you can first learn all the scales and you can learn music theory and then you can try to write original songs but man that would be a really hard way to do it the better way is you take a song you like you figure out how to play those four chords and you're like okay so you play covers right yeah and you play a shitty cover initially then you get better and better then you might add your own twist to it and you go from there ben make that bigger i can't i can't uh i can't see it you know this is what is this screen for ants so this is written by the guy who created dilbert who's a beautiful writer i i can't read it from here what's that first i went from being a bad writer to a good writer after taking a one day course in quote-unquote business writing i couldn't believe how simple it was i'll tell you the matrix here so you don't have to waste a day in class it's great and then he references the first article and he goes by the way the first what's he say the first sentence is like the most important thing go re-read that sentence up that i wrote when we started this out i read i wrote and rewrote that dozens of times it makes you curious that's the key and then he goes write short sentences avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence readers aren't as smart as you'd think it goes on and on um but it's a short very short post but it's very good and um and so yeah whether you want to if you want to learn to cook first start with recipes nail those then do original creations if you want to learn to play music first start with covers then do this um and so like like for example i'm about to teach my power writing course again so i took like five months off and i'm gonna do it again at the end of uh end of this month um and in it i have one section which is just the habits you need to become a better writer and the first one is copywork and then i make them do copy work right there and i remember asking i was like i'm going to use 10 minutes of our course time for you to write this because i know if i just tell you to go do this you're not going to [ __ ] do it you're gonna feel like it's weird you're gonna say like okay i get the idea but like i'm not actually gonna go do that before i need to write i'm gonna give you one rep at doing this right now i say go right come back they come back and i was like what did it feel like and they're like they're like it's weird it's like i feel like my hands aren't my hands they're their hands it's like my my tongue isn't my tongue it's their tongue right like my voice like i can almost pick up their voice by the time i'm written the third paragraph it's like if i then switched and was writing my own stuff it'd be in that voice and it's like yeah that's exactly the point it's like it's a hack to getting your stuff to not be flat and boring or cumbersome and like not be stuck with writer's block where you just have an empty page that's intimidating you so for trends um they were doing this thing like a contest to see who could launch a product and i was like oh i'll play i'll do this and so i didn't use my twitter as a way to promote anything because that would have been a little unfair but i did use my facebook and basically i was like i'm going to create a copywork course i think i called it copy that or something nice and um it's just gumroad it was for 50 and i just gathered like my 12 favorite bits of copy and i made a pdf and i explained why each part is interesting and the person who receives one they receive one every 10 days and they have to write it by hand and they get commentary as to why it's cool and uh i think it's going to be good i i'm releasing it in like three days and i've been like spending all my time doing it that's amazing that's a great idea what's uh what's the url for that uh you you liked it so i i don't want to show the url yet no because that's an unfair advantage or whatever yeah it's an unfair advantage but if you go to my facebook uh you'll see but basically i tell the story about how here i'll send it to you about how ben franklin used to use copywork and it was one of the best ways to learn how to write but for some reason we don't do it anymore and i just did what you did where i talked about how you get to feel the texture of other people it's called uh i just i just call it how to write irresistible copy yeah i sent it to you and there's a lot of um it's like you know so when i made the power writing course i was like okay i'm literally going to only say you have 10 days my goal was i'm going to make you a like two times better at writing in 10 days that was the mission from the start and i was like i don't think it's that hard because most people they themselves feel like they suck at writing and they kind of do second writing and but like most things when you haven't tried to get great at something or you don't know how you how to get great you're actually not that far away a couple tweaks will get you double like twice as good or three times as good and then you know to become the best in the world yeah that's a whole lifetime of practice but you can double your skill in pretty much anything if the right guide gives you like the right couple things to do and copywriting uh copywork is one of those that i was like this is one of the central ones and people aren't going to believe me but it works and so um i yeah i devote one of my little sections to it in the course by the way about the course name otherwise they're gonna get mad at me for talking about the course and not telling people go go go do it so i'm teaching it in february i teach it myself with my bare hands i it's live on video it's recorded if you miss it uh and go to powerwritingcourse.com and so i think we have like uh 200 spots we opened it up yet like two days ago 100 people took it already and wow let's see if it fills up yeah how many people came to the first time also 200 people i did 160 the first 150 the first time and that was capped then the second time i did no cap and uh it was 350 students did it oh my god this time i think i'm going to shut it off after 200 um but i'm going to teach it yeah basically i'm going to teach it uh because i like the slightly smaller group sizes so i can just give a little more feedback because it takes a lot of work because after the thing you write your thing and then i go in slack and i'll give you like direct feedback on it and so that takes more time than actually teaching the course or coming up with the content is like going giving people real feedback so i don't do it for everybody but after every session i'll give like 15 20 students direct feedback and then so over the course of the 10 days you're gonna get it from me at one point dude that's sick uh yeah i know sarah took the class or did sarah take it or who some one of my someone i'm close with took it and they said they loved it and goggin the founder of maven said that it was one of the most loved courses yeah they actually have hooked me up so maven is uh really helping me out because they knew i was lazy i was like i'm probably never going to teach it again they're like why it was like one of the highest rated courses and i was like well it's just like it's work to like like what's the work i'm like well i gotta like send an email out to be like join it i was like i feel stupid asking so i'm just like you know i just don't want to do it um and like you already made all the content it's highly rated all you got to do is like send out two emails so they just sent it out on my behalf and i was like thank you all right i'll teach it then because i love actual teaching and look at the home page so if you go to maven.com you see sean and then right next to him you see sarah my wife how funny is that yeah does she like teaching it she did hers right yeah she dug it yeah she's doing it again yeah she will yeah i think that's the trick is to do it regularly because you just get better at teaching it um all right let's do some other stuff wait but before we do other stuff uh what's his name ryan is coming onto the pod so everyone ryan will be on in like 30 minutes ryan he's the founder of bolt and so basically ryan's pretty impressive dudes i invested in bolt he has built two projects that are worth over a billion dollars and he's under like the age of 28. and recently a bunch of people heard most people hadn't heard of bolt and then he went on twitter and started like basically he took he took shots at y combinator and stripe like two of the most beloved startup organizations and he basically was like they're the mob they're the mafia and he's like and why is he's not worth doing and here's why and so controversy you're picking a fight really works and so uh i want to talk to him about about that and see where this is i think he's gonna bring a couple ideas so so let's let's talk you want to talk about dan price well what's your crazy damn prize story well okay most people probably don't know this so so you i think you know uh because you wrote about it in 2015 which is way ahead of the curve so listen to that you explain this and then let me explain my piece let me explain how this how this happened so i'm reading so we have this document and sean was like writing in the document right before we started and he wrote crazy damn price story i don't know why that's that's our little secret we we we write the topic so you get the other person curious but you don't you don't fill in the details so they don't know what you're gonna say so the reaction's authentic yes so i don't know what you're gonna say but in 2015 i wrote this article and the headline said so dan price is the guy who kind of looks like jesus he's based out of portland i think he's the guy who famously said from now on everyone the minimum wage at our company is 70 000 a year i'm reducing my salary the headline to the article i wrote in 2015 which at the time and still has not gotten picked up a lot it says dan price the gravity payment ceo paying everyone seventy thousand dollars is full of [ __ ] turns out ninety percent of the damn price story is completely made up but he's making a fool of all of us and i and basically i like wrote about how there's like three things that are very weird that happened with the story and a lot of this by the way is opinion some of it's facts but there's a lot of uh allegations so so take that for what it's worth but uh a few things one prior to him raising everyone else's salary to seventy thousand dollars he was paying himself 1.1 million dollars and that's for a company that was only doing 16 million dollars in revenue well why is that weird well because uh he was being sued by his brother and his brother was suing him the brother was suing dan who's a co-founder the two brothers were founders was suing dan for pa dan was paying himself too much money and it's kind of like the brother had a profit share the brother was uh was not active full-time so he didn't take a salary or had a small salary he was there for the profits the funny thing was there's no profits because the brother is taking a humongous salary and reducing profits to like zero so that's why yeah well the the brother quit so dan goes oh well and i don't want to share the profit so just boost my salary and then immediately the brother sues dan and so he's like oh well maybe we should reduce my salary and everyone sally i'm gonna make this and second and worse he was accused of listening to this sentence dan price is accused of repeatedly waterboarding and beating his wife and on october 28th this was i think 2015 his ex-wife gave a ted talk where she talked about how dan was punching her in the stomach and slapping her in the face and she had to go lock herself in the car because she was afraid that he was gonna like kill her so like crazy stuff so anyway i this is allegations but like if it looks like a duck and quack like a duck it's a duck there's allegedly a duck yes there's just a few things and then here's another funny thing price said of himself i'm just so sick of the attention it just feels a lot like it she feels like such a big investment of yourself there's this episode of the office where michael scott was like these people wanted to talk to him about this uh thing going on dunder mifflin and he goes man i was amazed you know i was like i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but like the media was contacting me so i decided to call a radio station and i called this other radio station i did an interview and you know like it's just crazy that they're all coming to me that's like what dan's like he's like i'm sick of the attention why is everyone coming he runs ads promoting the story of the ceo who reduced his salary and everybody else in the company makes seventy thousand dollars minimum wage and he's like barefoot and even further you know the guy doesn't wear shoes he loves the earth and he loves the world and he says all ceos are too greedy um you know be like me and then his employees i don't know if you heard this part this is after your this is after 2015 so you probably didn't have this in your thing there's this video that goes viral of his employees gifting him a tesla because they're like dan you've sacrificed so much oh my god you haven't you have so much we're gonna give you this tesla so they all pitched in and bought him a tesla and he's like crying he's overwhelmed uh blah blah blah so they got fooled because basically so yeah he pays himself a high high salary brother gets mad brother whatever he ends up buying his brother out at a discount cuts his salary still takes the money as a profit like he still gets the profits from the company as the as the owner of the company but it's not a w-2 salary it's not a salary so it's actually even more tax advantageous it's just like you know zuck takes a one dollar salary because he gets paid in stock um you know it's crazy and then he and then he makes bank he does 50 000 speaking gigs doesn't share that with anybody he has a 500 000 book deal because of his like story about you know ceo greed and uh you know freaking waterboarded his wife i was like this is crazy like what what is going on um this is a crazy story to me and it just reminds me of like anytime somebody really goes out of their way to tell you how virtuous they are you can pretty much take it to the bank that they are they are overcompensating from for something that they are not as virtuous as uh as the effort that they're taking to tell you how virtuous they are if you're writing it's like fox news saying fair and balanced it's like dude like don't piss on my back and tell me it's raining like don't lie to me like just be you that's [Laughter] just like be honest like like so like this whole thing that his whole stick the wife thing is like if that's true that's obvious that's its own category and that's unforgivable but the whole uh pay thing it's like dude like it's kind of like it's kind of like lance armstrong a lot of people aren't mad that lance armstrong took the drugs they're mad that he was so cocky about it that he did a commercial saying what am i on i'm on my bike eight hours a day busting my ass what are you on and then he sued a guy who was accusing him of taking drugs it's like dude that was the part that was a little like when you went overboard like the statement is worse than the crime for yes the cover-up is worse than the crime uh yeah that's crazy um okay so i want to do a couple other random things uh i want to talk about this this business i heard about that i think is kind of amazing i don't know if you looked into it but it's called canna do you know what i'm talking about uh maybe tell me more all right so this guy uh david friedberg who's gotten really pop he went from like you know didn't have a twitter account to now very popular because he's on he's one of the four people on the all in podcast which is pretty popular podcast um you know if they're you know if we're not the best podcast in the world you know they're their second best type of thing you know they're a great podcast so basically it's chamath it's jason kalkanis it's david sacks and then it's this guy friedberg and pretty much everybody had heard everything in the tech world or heard of the other three nobody knew about freedberg and friedberg has been like the um the like you know the revelation he's actually you know my favorite one of the pod and many people's favorite one of the pod why is that well he's kind of like a science background and he's an engineer like scientist who goes into business and so the first business he built was called climate corporation and um it's ended up it was basically telling farmers about um whether it was like weather data and kind of like giving farmers uh information about what they should be doing with their crops and things like that so it was like a data company for farmers i i don't know a ton about it but i think that and and i think they raised a relatively small sum for the amount of which they sold for right so actually i should go back he was early google pre-ipo he was like uh one of larry page's favorite people the founder ceo of google at the time and he was working on special projects for them then he left he starts climate corporation ends up selling it to monsanto the big evil you know whatever company in the agriculture space um then he starts yeah for like a billion dollars then he starts um this company that's uh what's it called last night well metro mile so it's an insurance company and it was a pretty innovative idea it's like get in your car and instead of like if you don't drive your car much why should you pay the same amount for insurance as somebody who drives a ton right so it's like pay per mile insurance and even better it was like they installed a little thing in your car or whatever it could basically see do you speed a lot or not if you don't speed a lot you should pay less for insurance so it's like a dynamic form of insurance that was a cool idea ended up going public in a spack and then famously the spat kind of has crashed since then it's it's been obliterated it got bought by lemonade for you know like a third of what it went public for so you know marketing is is 209 it previous market cap was like 4 billion yeah so uh so ended up getting acquired you know whatever the public story wasn't great but you know built a company that ended up going you know generating hundreds of millions of dollars uh so so anyways another good win so now he's got a new company so he actually he has a he has like an incubator for himself called the production board and basically it's like not vc it's like google backed it for like a billion dollars or something crazy and then blackrock and a couple others backed it for so it's raised a ton of money and all it does is it builds its own companies in-house one of the companies that they just announced i think is really cool so anyways that's a bunch of backstory and by the way i think i got like a third of that wrong but whatever you get the general idea of who the guy is so his new company is pretty dope and it's this trend i've been trying to follow which is 3d printing but it's basically printing beverages at home so what does that mean they're going to give people a machine so you buy this machine and think of it like a printer and it sits in your kitchen and when you want to have a drink whether that's you want um you know like a lacroix you want sparkling water with lemon flavor you want a hot tea you want a white claw with alcohol in it you want a white wine whatever drink you want you push a button and it'll dispense that beverage for you and it does this because they basically realize and he tells the story it's pretty dope he tells a story that like um he was at a dinner and the scientist is there and the scientist is kind of educating him on this he's like you know almost every drink is all water right so juice is like 94 water uh coca-cola is like 95 water wine is like 95 water everything's like 90 plus percent water and and then you know it's like x percent sugar and alcohols and then like one percent is the flavoring that gives it the unique taste that makes it taste like iced tea to you um and it's only one percent of what's actually in the beverage and it's like so isn't it crazy that we like have factories that produce you know we we go we get we get all these like chemicals and water and whatever we put in the factory then we put it into bottles then we put the bottles on a truck we truck it to a store it sits on their shelf then you drive to that store you take it off that shelf you drive it home you put it on your shelf at home and it's in a bottled plastic thing that then goes into the you know recycling or the trash and wow that's a lot for like something that's basically water and we all have water in our own homes piped you know already through the water system so like why why instead of doing this central manufacturing and like kind of brutalizing the environment and having this high cost why can't i just add the flavoring at the end point at your home using the water that you already have and create these beverages on the fly and so after years of like r d and testing they've basically got it to the fact where here's what they do the machine basically takes your water and they can either make the water really cold really hot or carbonated and then it has three cartridges there's a sugar cartridge there's an alcohol cartridge and then there's the flavor cartridge and all you do is you just select what drink you want and it'll say okay we're going to put out like one microliter of you know of this assorbic acid because that's what gets you the soda taste and then we're going to add some sugar and then we've got no alcohol because it's a soda or if it's a white wine it's going to be like here's the alcohol a little bit of sugar and then here's the flavoring that's going to give it that you know the the the palette of of a white wine and so and the idea is that with those three cartridges you can make basically an infinite combination of drinks because one the flavor cartridge itself has like 85 different flavors inside of it that can be mixed and matched and so i think this is kind of amazing it's going to be like let's say you could pull this off now all of a sudden we're not buying bottled drinks everywhere we're just able to at our end point have any drink we want for any you know my mom wants tea my dad wants wine i want soda and my wife wants flavored water she we can all get that out of the same device for a few it's just like a it's like a better coke freestyle machine you know coke that's exactly the analysis i love it's the at-home mini freestyle that can do 10 10 times more than what the freestyle could do i used to go to the movie theater near my place in san francisco i would never see a movie but i would walk into the lobby just to get a coke from the freestyle machine because you could make coke zero cherry vanilla or coke zero orange vanilla and i loved it and it's the only place you could do that and so i tried to get one for my office and the terms were ridiculous it was something like a hundred dollars a month for life or like it's like a it's like a crazy like it's it's they make it challenging to get a freestyle machine and they are so cool and they are so good and so this is just like a home freestyle machine but for every drink ever right yeah cause you know like as kids we used to go to like the normal soda fountain that has like 10 spouts and it's like you do the rainbow you just put all of them in the cup and it's like oh that's how i want my drink right and freestyle took it one step further because you could be like i want orange i want like it's the long tail of flavors so you could be like i like black cherry mountain dew and i might be only 0.1 percent so like mountain dew can't afford to bottle that because they're like dude it's such a small market but with this it's like the long tail of flavors gets done and so the analogy is like it's like tv so back when we had three channels they could only program the most general stuff that the average consumer is going to want so if you're a fishing enthusiast and we only have three channels on tv it's not going to work for you but then you get cable and now you get you know hundreds of channels let's say so now there's a dedicated phishing channel but then let's say then youtube comes along and youtube's like no we can literally anybody can create from their own home and now we'll have every variation so you want only bass fishing in spanish because you're a spanish speaker well now there's a channel for you and um and so that's the same idea the way that we did it with content where once the means of production went to the home now you got every single supply demand like niche got filled uh that's going to happen now with beverages where every flavor is going to be done and even better you get the economic savings you get the environmental savings you get the flavor personalization right like start one of the reasons starbucks is so successful is because my wife can go in there and order a venti skinny you know latte half decaf with oat milk light ice and blah blah and with you know one pack of stevia and it's like her drink is her drink and starbucks is willing to do that whereas you go to you know normal coffee shop you can't get can't get that done so that's going to be at the home and even further now it also creates a business model for so like me and you we could basically say say sam loves root beer we could create my first million root beer all we do we don't have to find a manufacturer and a bottler and a whatever all we do is we just create a recipe it's a piece of software it's like it's like a piece of content you know it's a it's just like three variables and we could just send it to your device and you could print it out for you know 55 cents and we would get our share of the royalty from everybody who does that and so all of a sudden you're gonna see just like the rock made his own tequila instead of george clooney it'll that will go down to you don't need 100 million followers to do that you could now have 10 000 followers on instagram and create your own beverage and people could print it at home and you could get your share of that how cool first of all diet root beer is one of the best sodas of all time because it has no caffeine so you can drink it any hour of the day it's not sprite it sprites whack and it's diet no calories and it's like creamy it's the best the second point was it's not sprite well because like you could do i used to drink diet like seven up sometimes but like that's like some ratchet stuff but it's got it it's just that's kind of weak that's like a a refreshing i want like a hearty creamy thing so i used to drink a diet root beer a day but for some reason in san francisco i could only find it in the asian neighborhood so my office the craigslist office was in an asian neighborhood and so i've always wondered like do asian people love it they were um the vitamins grocery store always had the best selection of diet root beers they have like four different types uh anyway i love that gets a 23andme test just enough in me the second thing is we used to have this lit list of um companies that you should work at in order to like get rich that are growing i would put this on that list and what was the name of his uh people what was that tpb the production board and it's basically it's like the i think the theory is like we have to produce real things for the world to move to work and what if we could rethink the way that production happens in these different systems so okay how does quinoa get made how does how do beverages get made how does uh you know like uh this one fertilizer get made and if we can find a way to use new technologies to like improve the means of production those are all big industries i think that and they've got overall thesis lab generated protein or like lab generated meat he's a vegan for example so he's like you know he agreed with me which he said something that's pretty controversial he's like i think that the way people will look back on what we do with animals and see it as worse than slavery and then people got really mad at him for saying that and he's like no like just i meant it okay i'm not saying it's it is worse than human slavery i'm saying that the scale of mass murder that happens on an everyday basis there's no comparable to it i'm on board with that the other day i ordered uh i ate 15 hot wings and i was like i just ate seven and a half chickens [Music] you

my motivation here was to open people's eyes to what goes down in silicon valley where it's not all sunshine and rainbows it is very fierce and there's fierce competition and there's also games that are played with powerful institutions and you know groups of people who uh you know help each other out [Music] don't chickens have two wings but it's not their actual wing hey what's up ryan what's up sean sam what is it dude you can you can settle this for us uh so sam uh this is ryan he's the the founder of bolt and uh we're having it we're just going over this detail are chicken wings actually the chicken's wings or are they just like the ribs of the chicken i think they're the way what's a drumstick do you think they're the actual wigs i feel like they're not the winners they're like this is like this is like a such a marketing position of course they are like what's a drumstick isn't drumstick a leg powerful young ben ben look that up so you see if i'm right i think i think i'm right so we should we should switch gears uh okay so ryan's here i met ryan in uh where are we hanging out la okay i was in la i'm at this dinner and um and ryan's across the table from me and at this dinner everybody kind of like dressed up because it was at uh the dinner was at the owner of an nba team's house and um you know so most people are pretty dressed up i see this one guy who looks like i'm like is this a tick tock star like who's this guy he's got earrings he's got this like tie-dye shirt on he looked totally different than every other kind of like business schmuck at this thing and i was like oh what's up man like what's your i was like like i'm literally my head i was like this guy's definitely a tick tocker or a youtuber uh he's got this like charisma about him i feel like that's who he is and he's like no i'm ryan i you know i started uh payments company i said oh what is it bolt and i was like oh [ __ ] i know both that's amazing and we ended up becoming friends uh ended up investing in the company and you ended up getting twitter famous over the last few months my friend and i wanted to have you on to talk about a couple things that you've done some pretty impressive stuff at a young age i want to talk about i want to give people the background of that and then you currently have some spicy twitter [ __ ] going on i want to get your take on on some of those things um welcome to the show i don't know if you've ever listened but we have a very casual business show yeah it's a pleasure to be on sean i've been looking forward to doing this and i think we picked the perfect time and sam what do you know about ryan besides what i just told you so i was googling you so i i i saw your twitter come out of nowhere about a month and a half ago and sean told me all about bolt and he told me about this dinner that he had and so bolt is a payments company uh that is at like 11 or 14 billion dollars in market or valuation so it's a huge company what i know is that you look incredibly young and on your bio maybe on linkedin or something or maybe twitter it says that you've started two or three companies that are worth about a billion dollars including a bunch of crypto stuff and when i was googling you today one of the first images that comes up it's beautiful because you're tweeting about mobs and mafias your the forbes headline is meet the stanford bitcoin mafia and it was a picture of you and like three friends and so i know you've got your hands in a bunch of stuff so brian what's the what's your claim to fame so this is the part you don't have to be humble just give people the the reason why they should be listening who is this cat uh what have what have you done what's your claim to fame well my claim to fame is i think i've you know i operate pretty fearlessly and um i've you know done a lot of things that uh that i think i've told been told i shouldn't be doing so i think it's business i've been told by many people i shouldn't be doing that would never be possible and uh you know we've written the framework on culture on conscious.org people are like who are you to write about culture now i have close to 100 companies pledging that culture you've written books done four day work week so you know i think we're thinking differently myself and the whole bolt team and i'm very proud of that and so walk us through um the i don't want to go too far into what bolt is i'll give kind of like the tl dr on on i'll oversimplify it you might cringe a little bit as i oversimplify but basically um the way we pay for things online is uh you know some people shop at amazon and amazon says hey one click check out we got your stuff saved and then you have shopify shopify has a bunch of stores now shopify has shopify pay which says hey you've shopped at a shopify store before you can check out that way if you want apple's got apple pay they let you pay at some places and what you've done is you went to like you're like hey you know even though those those companies are huge they're monstrous the internet's a lot bigger than that there's a whole bunch of stores that aren't on shopify there's a whole bunch of platforms like uh pinterest uh where people go and they find products they love and they love to be able to check out and as somebody who owns an e-commerce store you i've felt this pain many many times which is you can look at how many people just drop off at the checkout because they don't want to type in their name their first name last name address credit card you know zip code blah blah every single time when they're on their phone and they're on the go and i just see like that's the biggest drop-off in our whole store and it's like [ __ ] what can i do about that like wouldn't it be amazing if there really was a way to just check out at any store have your information saved it would make a merchant like me more money because my drop-off would be lower it would make the consumer experience easier because i don't have to type in the same [ __ ] over and over and over again and it has this like network effect where the more stores who use something like bolt the more shoppers have a bolt account now every single store benefits because that account can be used on all these different stores amazon is gonna work on amazon and shopify is gonna work in shopify but the world is a lot bigger than that all right how did i do out of ten did i die did i get it what did i miss sean that was like pretty epic [Laughter] we need to put you in customer calls yeah there we go i'm down so um so that so you create bolt and you're saying at the beginning people told you don't do this or it can't be done what's an actual story that happened there where somebody kind of told you look look man it's not gonna work okay so i have a pretty extreme story i went to one of the you know tier one uh silicon valley firms someone who's a paypal led you know not paypal sorry of payments legend um not paypal mafia but a payments legend big firm big name and i went and i told them about what were what we're doing and they spent the entire conversation telling me why this couldn't be done and that you know they actually got mad during the conversation and then after the conversation they saw one of the people on our team because we were recruiting top people was that another company they were involved with spent three hours trying to convince that person not to join us and to join other portfolio companies and so it's amazing you know i think everybody coming from the payments space the og's they have real you know they've been in the sausage factory they see how hard it is um but i think there is a little resistance to the fact that there could be something this disruptive that's this obvious and uh we just you know decided to go ahead and do it what were you and i want to hear all about that but what were you doing before this before bolt uh sean mentioned i dropped out of school it's so a little bit about my background first job was bagging groceries that for three years and then i started going to the internet to make money started some websites online businesses ran a web development agency working for a lot of other customers so that's why i learned everything there is about e-commerce and then i was lucky to get into stanford i saw the stanford bitcoin group with some friends in early 2013 many of which have gone on to do amazing things and i dropped out of school in 2014 to focus entirely on crypto my crypto is going to change everything about payments i still believe but about a year in so mid-2015 i was like wait a second why does nobody solve this checkout problem if you create a checkout and all the users who go through your checkout enroll in shopper accounts you could create the most powerful important shopper network payment network on the planet and so like this is a site i couldn't unsee and i decided to go you know realize learn about the space the more i learned the more i realized this was an opportunity and so we started building and uh and yeah so that's that's that's the story did you did you did you me you dropped out before i mean you're probably what 21 22 you dropped out at a young age did you did you just like knock it out the park with crypto to the point where like money you you fix money's good you're good now you're gonna go and start things did it happen at that young of an age unfortunately it did not i had this mentality that i was going to build things in crypto not invest in it which was a very costly mentality i had like a little bit of crypto i mean you know but you you you didn't become you know few rich no no not at all um so i had to uh both had to make it i was couch surfing like i didn't have enough money to like even rent a place to stay so i was cow a friend texted me before this podcast and he said ask him like how well like uh uh be like well he already got really wealthy from bitcoin is that why he's like so brash now and so you've kind of just answered that question you weren't wore it and at bolt i started off at a 40k salary and for about five years it never got higher than 60k so i was living paycheck to paycheck i wanted every dollar to maximize bolts outcome and just recently i've sold a very tiny amount of shares um just to kind of pay for some expenses but up until about a month ago i hadn't sold a single share almost eight years into the journey what about your other businesses yeah you didn't sell any of those you also helped start eco right uh or now known as eco your buddy runs it i think uh who's also what's the name super like impressive as well yeah and uh i don't want to go too much into eco because your twitter stuff's frankly just more spicy right now but basically you kind of helped the what just with the vision of that or the the kind of the initial strategy of that yeah so i what i can take credit for is i helped build an awesome team of founders and inspire some of the ideas but they have really manifested eco into what it's come become today uh the founders there have drove amazing vision the ones who are on the ground every day and they've executed and so i've played a part in the journey but andy bromberg is one of the ceos i have the most respect for on the planet henry ryan sacks joey krug there have done uh miracle work cool and so let's talk about this twitter thing so you came out the other day and you you basically said look um you're like bolt uh you know we we've become successful now but it wasn't uh without kind of some some challenges and there's like the normal business challenges and then there's sort of the like the challenges of the powers that be and in silicon valley there's two kind of like very powerful and in in most people's minds you i think you picked a fight with people that very few people had bad things to say about y combinator and stripe right stripe is probably like the most beloved startup in silicon valley respected beloved whatever and uh nyc is also you know the most powerful sort of like a brand in you know it's like basically if you're gonna pick on a college you'd pick on either stanford or harvard if you were going for the top and uh and you basically told the story about them being the mafia and so i want you to kind of quickly uh can you quickly bullet point the what your argument was for people who aren't nerding out on twitter and aren't seeing it because this all the audience we have here is not gonna have seen it so bullet point that and then i got some questions for you yeah so the point is my motivation here was to open people's eyes to what goes down in silicon valley where it's not all sunshine and rainbows it is very fierce and there's fierce competition and there's also games that are played with powerful institutions and you know groups of people who uh you know help each other out and so if you're starting a company especially in payments you've likely failed there's you know the only ones that have been successful have been internationally um and we probably should have failed five times over with investors pulling out of term sheets when we were about to run out of money and so we i'd say bolt almost didn't exist because of the powers that be the powers that be and you know i think there are a lot of other companies that would have existed today if it wasn't for the powers that be and so you know now i don't blame these institutions but but well you're you're i i i don't know if you're doing this on purpose to be kind but you're kind of being vague is it possible that you like what does institution mean and are you able to like actually let's separate out right there's there's fair fair uh you know fair business game games which is like we're competing against somebody that's fair they can compete with us fiercely there's um investors just deciding uh this space is too competitive or stripes gonna win i've just got i'm just gonna back away right so perception thing that's kind of like nobody would say that that's unfair talk about the specifics of what you felt was unfair or where you know some some uh some there was some heavy-handedness to it yeah so when we would be pitching investors they'd get interested they'd say they want to invest and then they would talk to somebody at stripe someone related to stripe and either be told they can't invest or they shouldn't invest or somehow the conclusion was they were dissuaded from investing but how do you know that that's what many they might just come to you and say we're not hold me the stripe would always come up somehow in that conversation so many of them pull me directly have investors say directly i got a call by stripe and they told me i can't invest in you guys is that bad though i mean what if they if they were already an investor of stripe i i understand i have a conflict of interest right but you know stripe has like all the big names in silicon valley invested in them all right so they've intentionally put every single you know tier one firm on their cap table and they even stuffed them with small checks they're like everybody's on their cap table right and so you know from and then they say you're conflicted out right that's a competitor of ours you're our shareholder right exactly and i didn't even you know consider ourselves a direct competitor at the time but i think they're very guarded about anything in their periphery so i've heard the same story from companies you know doing card issuing i've heard the same stories from companies doing subscription payments and then striper brought their own product next so it's almost as if they have these feelers out anything that's tangential they make sure it doesn't get off the ground and then they go and build it um and so is there any is there any side of you so the way that you're phrasing it and i would like to figure out what what my opinion is i don't have an opinion is is like that's unethical but one maybe could argue and be like well that was just a savvy strategic move to like get everyone on board and you know that's just like that's just that's a that's fair is do you do you see that side of it at all or do you think that like the way they went about it their intentions were the intentions matter here i've never pulled a single investor you can't invest in somebody right and so to me like everything is fair competition and if someone wants to invest in a company tangential to me i tell them go for it we've even invested in tangential i invested in tangential i think you know innovation is good i have a very long-term perspective so when you're calling investigate you can't invest in this company like even if they're not on the striped cap table it's investors too that are not the striped cap table to me that's just not how i would do business and i also want found the next generation of founders to go into building within their eyes wide open because i invested eight years of my life into this business and not knowing about the games that go on right and so the most important thing i'm exposing here is if you're coming to silicon valley you have an idea you're quitting your job putting a lot on the line like get ready for war like it's it's it's serious and there will be people who do not want you to exist and you're gonna need to be ready to battle that and so one of the things you say is that which is they basically hurt our ability to fundraise by telling the first they they kind of played good good game theory right they they got every inve every big investor to get a little piece of stripe because every investor wants a piece of stripe and then they said cool now you're conflicted out of investing our competitors okay some might say that's that's shady i personally just i'm an investor in you right i'm a fan of yours i personally would just say okay there's nothing unethical about that you may not like it but that's competing and it's like a it's a strategy it's a harsh strategy okay fair enough in the same way that like i don't think it's cool that mark zuckerberg just copied stories or whatever i don't think that's like you don't get bonus points of respect from me but i also don't think you did anything illegal or crooked completely crooked right that's that's you copied something that was copyable okay fair enough the second thing you said is that they could that yc which has a huge stake in stripe um control they own hacker news and that on hacker news people would be posting about bolt it would get some play it would go up the ranks but that somehow there's some you know editorial shenanigans behind the scenes where all of a sudden the post about bolt would disappear or get deranked and then a post about stripe would be up higher and so you posted some examples of that now that's i think i think that's the summary of what you said uh as that was happening did you is that a suspicion or you're like i know that that's what happened pretty sure that's what happened um you know because we had some posts one in particular that you know i'd written catered to yc audience it was an unraveling of how we do fraud detection better and guarantee it with your payments which was radical and new at the time it had organically gotten to number one held there we had a ton of comments on it just like very active people very interested you can go read all my comments and then stripes post i don't know if it was there before it seems like they said it got posted technically before but anyway afterwards got to number one there started to rise and ours just started to fall and then disappeared and so i don't know if those editorial there's also this down vote functionality and so you can also just have a bunch of your employees go and downvote or have a bunch of your friends so you know whatever it is they're able to get us off of there pretty quickly the the guys who started stripe the carlson brothers i don't know them but they seem um from the outside like good dudes do you think that is that do you know him and is that is that a character characterization that you'd challenge yeah i mean that's exactly what i'm doing so you know what's they don't meet my standards for good dudes uh and so you know good dudes is not what you say publicly it's what you do privately and so yeah i i just think that like right now you're like a loose cannon and i love it and i find it incredibly refreshing because from the outside you've raised money from amazing people at a 14 billion evaluation you are like the guy right now and i'm just i think it's cool and i'm shocked but i think it's cool that you're that you've just said that i i think that that's i've never heard that before me and sam both have uh definitely like a rebellious streak in us and we've told some stories on the plot about situations where where we do kind of like not keep it muzzled uh and you know sometimes that works to our benefit sometimes there's some you know um collateral damage or some you know it's a blowback from it uh i gotta ask you news came out i don't know yesterday today day before you're stepping down to ceo of bolt okay uh did you get in trouble what happened here so stepping up into executive chairman i like it i like it nice [Laughter] you know that was actually the truth and you know it's but yeah the stepping up worked well on twitter and uh and i promoted module because this guy is like he schools me on execution every day of the week so he started off running tech and product they gave him col like sixty percent of company imports into and just like my it's not my superpower right my superpower is it's creativity it's vision it's culture it's landing epic deals for the company so now i get to spend 100 of my time on that so this is something i've yeah but the timing is weird right everyone a lot of people online even though it's not true they say ryan got fired because of what he said well our you know this is this is the start of our fiscal year and basically january 31st starts february 1st and so this was the timing we had planned on for a while and so then i had some people saying you don't think we should wait people are going to think it's related to the tweets or whatever and i used to have fear about those types of things in the past and i think this recent episode has just locked me into my fearlessness even more i'm like eff it like let's just do it and as everyone's gonna gossip and you know interpret in their own way and i actually think that's great right you're crazy i like it yeah i respect that and also um i respect the move not the the ceo part right great that's that's fine i don't know i don't know anything about that but uh for the for the content that you're putting out so um we've talked before about about how to pick a fight in fact there's a there's a passage from a book called rework called pick a fight it's a marketing strategy and it's like a two-page thing and i remember earlier on the pod i literally read it word for word because i was like this is a great idea and i think this is when um the guys from 37 signals were picking a fight with apple uh and saying you know this is not right or fortnite you know epic games from fortnight was picking a fight with apple and um and we talked about you know there's a there's an art to doing this like first you know you can't just completely make something up right you gotta have actual reason to pick a fight but then you want to pick a fight not when you're punching down you want to punch up at you know the the whoever is they sort of like the power um and when you do that you're going to get this groundswell of a attention be support and see other stories will come out of the woodwork that'll make you seem even more credible and um and you get your name out there so like you know i don't know how many people knew about bolt before this because it's like okay you know check out technology is not the most like in your face you know it's not snapchat it's not like a pup like like a product everybody uses um but a lot more people know about it now and so how conscious were you i mean how strategic was it that you were you're thinking you know what like i think if we come out with this story yes i'll be helping people understand how the game is played but i think this will be good for bolt too yeah i mean i i think doing what you believe to be right will always pan out in the end and so i think this was i i stand by its decision i think it's great for both it shows the world who we are as a company it shows that we're going to stand up for what's right no matter how controversial that may be um we're going to stand up to the big guys which is literally what our entire product is about and what i wrote to my team you know when i was doing this i said just because our company is worth billions of dollars you know i'm not going to become a sellout founder like it's worth way more financially for me to go become buddies with all these guys right but every cell in my body my but my spirit won't let me do that and so for me it was a way of telling the world who i am as a leader and i'm trying to you know set an example of fearless leadership for the next generation of founders because i think we lack it like i can't point to too many leaders in this country who are truly fearless who stand up for what they believe in and i think a lot of leadership is fear-based and uh i think we have to kill that i i agree with you i i'm entirely on board with you um i think the i don't i don't actually think this is my stance but i in fact it's not my stance but at first it was but it's changed a bit and that's that like i don't know if what you're saying is necessarily true and i saw a lot of people who used to have your position where they're the underdogs like sam altman and gary tan they're not anymore now they're like the man you know the folks in charge but and they're like this guy ryan is lying he's false he's just full of it and so it's like really hard to take a side right now because of this he said she said even though i i totally agree with you that they are this like cool kid group and it's always fun to stick it to that cool kid honestly the things you said that they did this is like actually credit to you the things that you said that they did are not even that bad like he said she said doesn't even really matter because it's like if they did it okay even if they did it it's not the worst thing in the world uh if they didn't do it nobody's gonna know how to prove it kind of doesn't really matter i think you pointed out the overall power dynamic and that's what was important and then you just like got your story out there about who you are your bolt what your point of view is whether people agree with you or not that's their choice but uh but i think it's actually it actually emphasizes how brilliant the the tactic was that it's not even like the most scandalous you know theranose does this work is it a giant fraud is it deception at the highest levels no it's not even if the accusation is true it's not but it got so much play because of a you're a good writer and b um everybody is so afraid to say a word against them like i got one of my my most viral tweets was that i came out and said the clubhouse is gonna fail and um here's why i think here's how i think it goes down and uh and it's because at the time clubhouse was the darling every vc was fighting to get into the deal everybody was on clubhouse every night talking about how great clubhouse is that was the only topic they knew what to talk about and that's why it faded quickly because if you go on the product all you can talk about is the product it's going to fail um and and so and i got privately i got a bunch of messages from high profile people who are like dude i could nev i can't sorry i can't retweet this to like show support for this just because of you know politics but dude i totally agree with you i like or like i'm glad somebody [ __ ] said it i don't believe in the [ __ ] at all uh i had one person you know these are all blue check marks do people must be smoking crack if they think that this thing's gonna work and so did you get like the the dm back channel support of people who are like look i can't come out and i don't want to get yc on my bad side but like dude you're so right hundreds you know exactly if i if i was if i had any nervousness about doing it beforehand the outpouring that i got afterwards just gave me all the conviction in the world that this was the right thing to do because hundreds of founders reached out to me thanking me many of them sharing their stories with me about what encounters they've had um and uh you know is this stuff is happening this stuff is rampant and so yeah i had all of those messages all you were missing you needed a movement people could uh could rally behind a hashtag yc has done this to me also the problem is why is everyone so afraid right well why are you asking that question you know the answer right you already said the answer which is you'd be significantly more financially successful if you just were to shut up and so that's why i asked you that question are you already very financially successful on paper just saw bolt you're very you're set uh that's on paper but that's why i was asking do you have this like crazy bitcoin stash do you did you have this other stuff i think even in this like tiny version of the interview you've actually heard four or five examples like dropped out of stanford uh that takes some guts to do that when you don't have like something else that's working amazing yeah but that's what i was asking i dropped out just a note to focus on bitcoin when bitcoin was nothing at that time that's fearlessness start payments company to compete with uh you know like one in one of the most like vicious fields uh where everybody tells you everybody everybody who's smart that you respect tells you that this ain't gonna work fearless number two going on the four day basically saying we're going to only do for four day work weeks because i believe in xyz in terms of company culture coming out against yc right so that's actually like several uh of these kind of like you know it's like when i invest in something i've looked for like a breadcrumb trail it's like oh actually i see a trail of this person doing you know really bold things or uh you know clever things or packing different systems i think they're the next thing is just going to be more of that and so you know that's i think that's pretty cool i wanted to to switch gears a little bit and ask you um you uh you are an idea guy in fact and when we were uh driving home from the dinner you were telling me some different like i was like how did you get the idea for bolt how did you get the idea for eco and i just kind of got that got the sense that you're an idea guy but you're fully co you know you've been fully locked in for eight years doing one idea so i want you to get out that little note sheet of uh other opportunities other things that you see that you don't have the time to do or the energy to do or the interest in doing but you think that these are opportunities that exist did you bring any ideas for me i brought some okay oh fire them off and we will we will react to them so you give us the quick pitch and we'll read it okay this is a big one i think a lot of people are going to do it if they hear this so i hope they do i think someone needs to start an investment bank for early stage companies where they help okay introduce you to a bunch of investors you know they sanity check your deck of materials they blast off a bunch of intros which is 99.9 of the value that yc has right and they don't even do that they don't even send personal intros you're one of 400 companies right so now you're you know the company that's being introduced you're a serial number literally and so um somebody needs to do so that's what i do personally i've probably done that for 200 companies half the size of a yc batch i've done this for personally so for founders it doesn't take very much time you know if you have the contact list if those people trust you right you can do it with one email and then a bunch of follow-up intros if the investors are interested and you know maybe half an hour 60 minutes with the founder making sure their materials are good giving them some feedback so i think there needs to be an investment bank for all stages of company building that's actually a really good idea how would you uh where would you what would be the business model for it so would you take a percentage of the raise would you take equity would you take a referral fee from the vcs who want this deal flow yeah i mean you take far less than seven percent of the company you maybe take a certain percent of the amount raised right and then maybe a little equity so that's what i do for earlier stages i take you know anywhere from a few percent to high single digit percent of of the capital raised and then i would take a little bit of equity and that's you do this ryan does i do this how much how how how much money have you raised for other companies a ton of money i mean i don't know what that means a hundred million or a billion or 10 million one company can be yeah i mean through intros that i've made hundreds of millions of dollars maybe upwards and they've given you a percentage of that account i know i don't take a percentage of capital raised so i used to i sometimes do this voluntarily for free if i like a founder i don't take anything and then for some i take a little bit in advisor shares it's usually less than a percent it's usually less than half exactly it's actually a great idea this is actually a great idea yeah i think it's a good idea too but here's the thing so i used to run this conference business and it was fun and everything but the crappy part was the more successful the conference got meaning the more and i mean you go you either do more events or you have more people come or you charge more money but me the more people who came and the more successful my event got the worse it got and it sucked and so would this if you were doing this would this be like that where the bigger it got the less your like oh man he promotes everything or this brand promotes everything you know what i mean yeah totally you have to be picky with who you know who you work with right you can't work with 400 companies every quarter and um so sure and and a company could do this you could start your own firm could team up with people you can do it as an individual founder you can do this um so i think there's many ways to skin this cat and many different models here so this is just a seed of a thought how did you build that reputation as both a the guy who knows the investors and the investors trust and b the guy that gets his fingers in the has his fingers on the pulse of early stage companies so much so that you're helping them raise money well the secret that i'd share with any investors is treat founders really well and they'll refer other founders right and so some do that early on then they have a brand and then they you know form an ego right and they forget how that brand was generated in the first place and so the the firm that continues with that ethos and holds onto that ethos forever is going to build one of the greatest next generation firms there is and so i i developed a reputation from founders for being somebody they could call about literally anything that they don't have to mince their words that they could trust that has their back completely um and so you know my only wishes i had more time uh which that's kind of the challenge but i every ounce of available time i've tried to dedicate to the next generation and uh it's you know it's the most rewarding thing i could possibly do i like it so let's give i like that idea i think that's a good one i've i've said this for a while which is that uh like venture investing is going into like couple big categories i think i think there's like the big brands that are like you know their their stamp of approval means like a lot for you whether they're good or bad investors don't really matter they're like the harvard stanfords of the world that's sequoia yc andreessen whoever else uh benchmark whatever and then there's niche specialists that are like oh i know robotics better than anybody and so i'm gonna see all the robotics companies i'm gonna help them and even if they get a sequoia to invest in them they'll also want the robotics expert in the deal and then the last one is basically like venture services which is can you serve the founder in some way so if you could help them raise their next round i think that's a smart way to basically get yourself into the right companies as long as you're as long as your filter is pretty good uh all right what else you got give us another idea well i think daos are going to change the world so um and continuation of of the spirit of investing in vcs there need to be more vc dows where you invest in things as a dao and why is a vc dow better than a normal you know either individually investing or starting a traditional fund why is it vc doubt better because it relies on the collective intelligence of a group i think it's transparent in terms of how it makes decisions i think you can raise capital uh more publicly and i think your actions are more kind of on a public record um so you know and frankly the best reason is i think if you're up and coming aspiring investor or vc it's way easier because you don't have to spend five years building relationships with lps you can start a public track record investing within your dow and that track record will you know talk for itself and attract more and more capital right what have you have you heard of orange dow no what is orange tao so orange dow is basically is what ryan's describing uh but against you know his uh his enemy uh of the month which is uh yc so basically what it is is it's a dao which means it's like a people don't know it's a decentralized autonomous organization basically in the crypto it's the crypto version of a company and um so what it is is basically they made it where only a yc alumni can and enter and only yc companies can get funded so it's a it's an organization whose mission is to fund yc companies and the all of the investors are yc alumni so basically it started off with like 10 or 20. now there's a thousand yc alumni that are in this they provide the capital they also provide the deal flow and the diligence and the filtering and whatever else and then they fund yc companies and um and so if you're a co for a yc company you could take money from orange dow in addition to these other traditional funds and with it you're getting these thousand people and the i think the dow votes on the deal so so somebody proposes i think we should vote i think we should invest in this company and then the dow holds a vote and it'll come back you know 70 percent say yes 30 say no let's invest and it's like a group group investment fund like that so i actually i like y combinator i think that the like the paul graham i love reading paul graham's work i like a lot of that guys but when you're describing this sean i understand i am also frustrated i'm like oh so the rich get richer even more and more like it's just a it's just a it's a circle jerk that that is never ending and i that frustrates me i don't want to i feel like i guess it's definitely part envy of like well i'm not in that crowd therefore i miss out and it's also part like david vs goliath type of thing yeah i can't stand clubs um and so it's yeah i have that same feeling sam it just something about it doesn't feel right and even if i was inside of it you know i've had the opportunity to join a lot of these clubs and i won't do it because you it's also in your self-interest not to do it you know i could have obviously gotten the benefits of them but you know now look at where i am like i'm i'm free to do what i want um and to speak up how i want and i don't owe any favors to anybody and so people but you are are you free though why why are you free to do this because because he's not in a tribe he didn't he didn't basically go into a tribe which has certain like rules yeah but you've got he has 600 employees who he doesn't want to completely screw over you know like some if something bad happens to ryan that could negatively impact some of his people he's got some investors i mean i don't i have accountability maybe you're single though to my employees and my shareholders right to make make them successful and better off and i think that's enough like i don't need i don't have all these other groups that i'm accountable to in addition to that that you know basically makes impossible to say anything um and so i i i consider myself fairly free where were you raised miami florida and what did your parents do for work my mom was worked a local secretarial job my dad at a small business so i grew up very middle class i went to you know very lucky to get into stanford on you know almost entirely financial aid so grew up without much money went to a big public high school in miami 4 000 kids grew up in a very diverse environment so i got into break dancing and stuff like that so when i came to silicon valley and stanford it was like the biggest culture shock ever because miami and silicon valley it's like it couldn't be more opposite not anymore that's true [Laughter] all right did you have any other ideas you wanted to share with the uh the audience man i so here's my general theme is and i'll reference bolt for a second then i'll talk about it broadly everything's getting decentralized so do you think about commerce amazon was phase one right network effects economies of scale data everything but on one domain amazon.com and then phase two is you have shopify which is all of that power network effects economies of scale tech scale but on one end-to-end enclosed platform renzo both is the network effect and the data and the tech economies of scale in a fully decentralized way completely unbundled completely headless completely tech stack agnostic and that's why we're such a powerful force for commerce right that's why modu who's our new ceo he centralized commerce to amazon for eight years when all the logistics came to us because he saw it getting decentralized and thinks we have the best approach to decentralizing commerce so i think every industry is getting decentralized i think purchasing you're gonna see a tidal wave of purchasing uh platforms that help you purchase from your neighbors purchase food locally i think the consciousness of our society is raising i think we want to buy and purchase things that are good for society that are sustainable that are recycled more than things that are flashy you know i think more people are going to start wearing t-shirts and so i know it wasn't a specific idea but those are those how i think about things and with your with this whole new like with you kind of coming out and doing this twitter thing and accusing these people it it like a a smart move and you seem like you definitely are incredibly smart is like you know i'm mad at that this system exists and it just so happens i'm working on a solution um is that what you've got up your sleeve just might be uh so what are you gonna do to to be announced um i've been working on ideas for a while i think there are much better systems that could be created if you think creatively about incentive alignment and i have confidence that you know better systems will be created not just by myself but for others who may see this as an opportunity to go build well you realize i agree with what you're i think what you're doing is smart but like if i was a hater if i was sam altman or whoever's like disagrees with you i would say oh well he's talking [ __ ] because he's launching a competitor and so what what percentage what motiv how are they each playing into this of like i genuinely feel this way and also i i have something up my sleeve i wouldn't be doing this if i wasn't so distraught with how they operate so you know if they were like a bastion of positivity good advice um and you know if they were super pro founder i wouldn't be doing this but i fundamentally do not think they are and so you know and they being y combinator and are you are you happy right now or do you have like a nervous energy in the morning because of what's going on i mean like i know sometimes when i do something that i like i'm happy that i did i wake up in the morning i'm like man i'm getting a lot of hate though like this type of energy just bothers me where's your energy right now like shawn's thing about clubhouse it kind of it wasn't like a career maker but like it wasn't that far from that but like he was getting a ton of hate and like i i don't know i didn't ask him but maybe there was some nervous energy in the morning i didn't like how much i started looking at my mentions that next 24-48 hours because i was like oh man like that's two days of my life i kind of let my main focus be what are people's reactions to this it was very hard to look away from that for me personally and i'm pretty like strong-minded about this sort of thing and very like uh i treated this out the other day i want my attention to be very expensive but i know once you get you know 20 million impressions on some tweet and you're getting 50 000 you know replies or whatever or the heart likes or whatever you know that's a flood of stuff you can go look at about people talking about me people saying things to me what are they saying people hating me do i need to defend myself it it was a bit of a distraction for me yeah so where's your energy right now are you nervous are you happy are you uptight where are you well i'd be lying if i said i don't care what people think i mean i obviously do in fact i'm doing this because i care people think so much that i want the right you know i want my opinions out there in the world and so you know people can update how they think about these things and uh i'd say i'm fair with it pretty well like the yoga and meditate every day every morning and i stay pretty calm and grounded and um you know i think that uh i feel more uh more empowered than ever just like i've gotten so much love the last few days it's been you know 95 love and then it's all the people i expected to blast on the hate who came out of the woodworks right it was like sequoia vc uh what you know paul sam y.c um and so that was unexpected i was actually kind of surprised at how just like crazy their messages were and how hostile they were like you know generally older like i think they'd be wiser but what what did they say or they say like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna [ __ ] you up are they gonna fight you or what do they say i mean like what would they say um paul nitpicked on a tweet of mine about strike publishing which basically said because i focused on that that this is mania um you know i was manic or something like that and then sam like just come like said something and then he like corrected my spelling which is like you know what someone is yeah i saw that why he he well not even your spelling he's a y combinator it's two words not one right yeah yeah but most most arrogant the most arrogant that's like i thought it proved my point right it's like that's what you do in middle school you know and then like they might as well have just said i know you are but what am i yeah exactly and then sean was just like you know called it like use just horrifying words and just you know this this guy the god the guy from sequoia he basically was like uh this you know he's making it sound like everybody was against them but the truth was their numbers just went yeah yeah he started commenting on my metrics like just like you know it's the only thing you know he could point like first of all vc's aren't supposed to comment on metrics second off what he said was ablated and lie about our metrics and so another just complete low blow and so everybody who messaged me was like all of those comments validated what you were saying like these are the people you're putting on your cap table imagine when you'd have a disagreement with them as a founder how they're going to treat you you um i actually think this is going to be a net net win for you i think that like there's definitely fear if i was you of like man is anyone going to work with me again but i think like being a good natured loose cannon is actually a typically a loose cannon i like a good name yeah because intentions matter intentions matter a lot so like if you're a lose cannon but you just want to hurt people that's one thing if you're a lose cannon and you generally want to help that's another thing that's lovable so i actually think this is going to be a big benefit for you do you um are you single do you live alone or do you have a girlfriend or whatever you're into um what are they saying um well i have people close with and uh like everyone's super supportive they're like dude you're doing what no one else but everyone was afraid of doing and i find if you're doing things that other people are afraid to do you're generally in the right so you know it's a for me that's a marker of like i'm on the right track um and yeah they're very supportive have you read the book 48 laws of power i haven't but i want to i heard it's epic you are doing it so maybe you should go read it and try to get it all done pretty soon because you are in the middle of a lot of like different strategies that the author discussed you're saying all right i'll go pick it up yeah and the author his name is robert green he's got another one called the 33 strategies of war of which you are also doing some of that but this is very interesting that you're like involved in this what do you read on a what have you read that's made an influence on this whole process of yours well i read a lot of spiritual texts and that has given me the fearlessness to make first principle decisions because when you're grounded in spiritual reasoning you're not grounded in mainstream reasoning and so that drove conscious culture that you're a four-day work week i'm like why are we working people to death that's not healthy our health spiritually is very important sustainability it's important spiritual concept we have to push four-day work week and you know monks uh certain monks the more uh higher on the spec on you know wiser they are more ascended they are the longer their sleeves and people are like oh wow it's because they're more docile and it's not the case it's because they're actually you know more combative when they see something wrong in the world and so for me like i've found that kind of the further i've gone and kind of healing myself and healing those around me and going inward the more fearlessness i've had externally and this is one manifestation of that you are so strange it is awesome you are so cool i i've become a fan sean i understand what you what you saw in this guy when you had dinner with him yeah exactly um dude thanks thanks for coming on 28 right 29. 27. you are the weirdest 27 year old i've met that is what a unique what a unique perspective it just you're interesting tbd if if if this battle i hope i hope you win this battle but like you're definitely going to win some big war that's for sure we're looking forward to it fight the war cool let's go all right so people people should go follow you on on twitter i think that's the best spot uh what's your handle it's like king ryan or the ryan king the ryan king why why is that your name i think it's fitting oh my gosh this is awesome okay there's a great meme i don't know if you saw it but you posted another you posted the thread about the mob and the yc mafia then he puts another friend why why she isn't worth it and like one of the first replies i saw was this meme of like this wife asleep and the husband's like like reaching over to her and he goes honey wake up the bolt guy did another thread and i thought it was so funny so people should follow you that handle actually my grandparents always used to call me the ryan king so call me that growing up and i'll just like oh it's a great handle let's go for it i love it dude thanks for coming on appreciate it and uh good luck with all the uh old stuff thanks guys thanks sam sean such a pleasure see ya see ya all right ryan just left all right what'd you think that guy's so like let's separate this current like do i think he's right or wrong i i i don't i haven't investigated i think he's right maybe but i've been i don't hold that that strongly but as a person this guy is a killer i'm team ryan uh just in life this guy is so unique unique yeah he uh he's a very unique guy he's got a very unique style of speaking um yes like i i usually have a bias against people who speak slowly talk so slow but i loved it and so um and i've noticed that about myself that i'll like i'll instantly kind of okay this person's talking slowly uh if they don't like have something super interesting to say right away i find myself tuning out but when i met ryan he was talking really slowly but that he would say one thing that would just grip me and i'd be like wait what and then he would say the next then it would like be another minute and he'd get me with another one and another one i was like wait i think this guy might be one of the more i was like how old are you he's like i'm i think i bet him when he's 26 or 27 and i was like you're one of the weirdest and you said it perfectly you you are the strangest 27 year old i've ever met and it's awesome and that was my exact takeaway and then i was like i was leaving the dinner and i was like um you want to just hang more you want to how about i drive here where are you going and he's like oh it'd be great and it canceled his uber and hopped in the car and i just drove him around we just talked some more because i found him to just be a very uh interesting person and um you know i like the stuff that he stands for um which is great in our text group ahead of this people were saying oh yeah you know he probably has sold a ton of secondary he probably made all this money on bitcoin and maybe that's one of the reasons why he's able to kind of be this like loose cannon say whatever he wants he said that that's not true yeah i don't think that that's true i don't think he's a liar i mean but i obviously i'm sure he's doing fine right bolt's a 14 billion dollar company now uh i think he knows that that's right he's gonna get fired and his equity will still be there for him you know that's okay like that wouldn't be you know i think that that's the safety net but like i had said in the thing he's got a track record of just kind of doing things his own way so i'm not really surprised and i also think he didn't say anything bad and all i think actually it's a whole bunch about nothing he did say something bad on the pod though he said i am saying that the stripe brothers are bad uh i said they're good dudes and he goes no i don't think they're good i don't think they're good yeah but that's i don't think that's that bad you're allowed to say i you know i don't think these are these are good dudes i think that's bad man i think that's bad i think that that that is a it's a very simple word bad and good but like what's it's like to say something i don't think he's i don't think this person's a good person that's a really strong thing to say i feel like we say stronger than that every episode about people we know half as much about but like i text you that all the time i'm like hey this person messaged me i might work with them on x y z are they a good person right and if the answer is yes that's it right if the answer is no that's it as well now i would say i think the things that he said that they did i don't think are that bad at all and again i'm an investor in bolt i like ryan or friends so you know like i'm i'm not agreeing with him that they're that bad even if they did it but that's okay like he he's totally allowed to think that those are [ __ ] up things uh i think that those are pretty much fair play uh but i think it's really funny the way that people reacted to it and i think it's really good for him and good for their brand the way people reacted to it so good on him for for uh using them in a way to build the brand of what he's doing and also put his stake in the ground and say this is what i think is right and wrong i think they did wrong uh you know he's fair to say that even if my steak would have been 10 feet over to the left i i this guy's interesting that was a good find so i don't know where in the episode this little segment's gonna go in the beginning in the end but that's what we think about that guy that guy was fascinating i could talk to him for a long time yeah i'm older than him but i would like look up to him and i think that in his like you know when he was on here i think he was you know trying to do a good job kind of representing what he stands for like i think most people do if you go i think most people's default if i get invited onto a podcast i'm gonna go on i'm gonna try to like you know say all the right things so i think he was definitely doing a little bit of say the right things it stuff but actually having talked to him in private he actually was very similar where he's like you know i believe in this i think it's going to be awesome i think we're going to win and i'd be like yeah but like you know we're just shooting this is late night dinner over two drinks like but he was just like i said what i said and i meant what i said you know like i think this is awesome i think i'm you know this is the best i think this is totally gonna work i think blah blah so like i think he has a very uh singular mindedness about what he believes in and i think that's cool to uh to to interact with because i think most people a don't believe anything b when they believe they'll hedge uh or c they'll kind of be wishy-washy about it or they believe when the lights are on and then when the lights are not on they're you know why are you applying for a job i thought you just said this is the company that's going to win oh yeah yeah just in case you know like there's a wishy-washy to a lot of people i've he has zero wishy-washiness so uh you know for better for women and i i'm upset at myself i judged him as being far different just by looking off his profile picture uh would you think he was not just that he was this like i thought he was what people accused me of being of this like blonde hair white bro who had everything in life handed to them who um is going to be kind of um maybe not as intellectual kind of a uh an alpha right you know like this this stereotype that it's not an insult necessarily but i wouldn't be proud of that i just think i'm just like a good looking strong muscular successful guy and i just feel like it's unfair well i'm not talking about myself but like with him i'm like well because he went to stanford he dropped out of stanford was in bitcoin forever so it was like crazy rich at a young age he said he's from miami so in my head i'm like yeah oh okay yeah this is like the this is this thing that you're calling life is a game for you and in reality he was incredibly intellectual very intriguing i believe him that he that like i understand that you can be very wealthy on paper but like he hasn't sold a lot of stuff so like that's an interesting perspective so i thought he was cool different than what i thought it was gonna be i enjoyed it yeah uh cool let us know what you think if you want us to do kind of more of these or less of these uh you can tweet at us and uh you know we take it into consideration we don't necessarily listen but we we like to know what you think and then we may or may not do it [Music] you

Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) share one of their most out-there ideas: Buying Michal Jordan's childhood home and turning it into a museum.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
sean put something on here that i actually think i was telling uh a friend as i was researching i actually think that this is one of the better ideas that we and you you've ever come up with the michael jordan thing all right yeah you want me to explain it okay so um i've been looking at this house for a long time michael jordan's house has been for sale for like a decade and it hasn't sold and this is his house uh kind of like you know in illinois near chicago where you know michael jordan was on the bulls and he had this 56 000 square foot home in highland park and so this thing originally he put it up for sale and like i don't know nine years ago for 30 million 29 million dollars and now it's you know the price has been cut in half and the thing is still not selling and if you look at the photos you can just go it's like on zillow so you can go look at the photos he's got like an indoor basketball court you know the gate leading up to the driveway has his big 23 number like embossed in it he's got you know everything you would want like huge you know closets because he's got you know all his air jordans or whatever and so his house is it's pretty unbelievable right there's there's all kinds of um epic [ __ ] here but it's not selling and it's not selling for i think a couple reasons it's like you know it's very custom to michael jordan um like it just it's like it was custom made in many senses so you know that other rich people don't necessarily want to live in a house that's like made for another dude um it's also you know it's very expensive for the area the property taxes are really expensive all that stuff but i was thinking okay the price is now cut in half now it's now it's a 13 million dollar house or a 12 you know 13 million home that you could buy 13 14 and now it's in range where maybe there's something fun you could do with it now you might be getting a value buy so i was thinking all right there's a bunch of people obviously that are basketball fans that love michael jordan um there's a bunch of you know new ways to crowdfund that we've been talking about nfts or uh kickstarter or different different crowdfunding platforms so the question is should we buy michael jordan's house should we start a crowdfunding campaign and buy michael jordan's house so if you could get 5 000 people to each put in 2 500 then you can own a fractional share of michael jordan's house uh you could you you could own a piece of of this history and we could just buy it out take it off the market um and we could own this thing and then the question is like what do you do with it um and so i wanted to brainstorm with you a should we buy michael jordan's house and b what could we do with it if we did buy it what do you think so the whole nft thing i wouldn't do that i think that i think you've had two ideas here one is to buy his house and two is to end do the nft thing uh one of those ideas is great i think the other one is over complicating it i would 100 buy it and the reason why i think it's such a great idea is immediately after you seeing you write this my thought right away went to graceland you know what graceland is no that's funny that you don't know what that is it's because it's such a big deal in my family or elvis is at least so graceland is elvis presley's house uh it's in memphis it's in downtown memphis it's actually in a pretty crappy neighborhood now or the neighborhood is not nice and it's like kind of gross but it's just like a cutesy thing to do if you visit memphis and i went and did research on it and so around 600 000 people a year go to graceland which brings in something like where i have the numbers here okay so graceland just in attendance uh just in ticket sales brings in 21 million dollars so it's yeah pretty wild just on tickets 600 000 visitors a year uh 36 a ticket right yes and i got interested in this so i thought what are the most visited homes in america so i came up with a few and i want to fill you in on them so the white house doesn't count because you can just you i think you can get a tour but you could also just walk outside of it but graceland six hundred thousand the second one i'm you guys are gonna make fun of me i don't know how to pronounce this what is it monticello i think so okay monticello that's uh thomas jefferson's house and so the interesting thing about this place as well as a few other i'm going to mention is that they're non-profits which means all of their numbers are public and so uh the revenue for monticello which includes a ton of investment revenue was around 200 million dollars in 2010 but around uh 8 million 7 million came just from ticket sales so 8 million a year in ticket sales which is crazy and they have around 500 000 people another uh most visited home is never uh like homes that people drive by neverland ranch people don't go there but the other another great one is mount vernon which is uh i think uh what's our first president george washington's house uh and they do in in in uh food sales alone this is crazy just in food seventeen million dollars a year wow is that crazy it's a whole insane the whole operations and then they do 15 million dollars a year in admission sales and in total they do about 51 million dollars a year in total income which includes 10 million from contributions is that crazy that no that's absolutely insane so let me ask you these okay so this all of a sudden this starts to get really interesting right because i think michael jordan is on par with elvis and you know thomas jefferson michael jordan's got tj beat by a long shot so you know mj over tj i think is is part of the the slogan that we have when we when we buy this thing but um if they're doing this much in traffic i got to know is there something else meaning like are these in really hot like popular areas uh where there's already just a lot of tourists or something like that and this is just a pit stop because you know michael jordan's house is in a neighborhood you'd have to only be going to go to this place i looked up michael jordan's address guess how far away it is from chicago airport one of the most popular airports in the world i'm gonna guess 45 minutes 20 minutes it's 20 minutes away okay so it's at like have you been in memphis memphis is like there's not that much going on in memphis and all these people are going to memphis um people are chicago's what the fifth most populous city in america or maybe third something like that something is interesting here so what i would do is i wouldn't do the nft thing i would raise uh two or three million dollars from a bunch of rich people um or i would try to use my own money if i had two or three million dollars that i wanted to spend on this and i would buy it and then it would probably cost a fair bit of money to get it set up it would probably cost a lot of money another many more millions but then you'd have to convince collectors to lend you the stuff and you create a michael jordan museum yes and that's how you do this and the companies that we've just mentioned graceland monticello and um mount vernon so those obviously those folks lived in the 1700s or probably died in the 1800s so they've been around those properties have been around as tourist destinations for a hundred plus years but they've done 50 million revenue which is a [ __ ] ton but even if you've just um two or three million dollars in revenue and you could do that and adjust for inflation for 50 plus years kind of like graceland has done it for 60 years that's incredibly fascinating right yeah i'm with you so so i think you you know you're [ __ ] on the nft thing a little bit but it's not about nft what i'm saying is crowdfunding um so i think that there's a benefit to crowdfunding which is that crowdfunding is a way to make the story more viral um it is a it's a more pr worthy story that uh you know people from the internet people from reddit whoever got together and bought michael jordan's home off the market for for 15 million dollars they raised 15 million dollars and bought the house versus a rich guy went to his rich friends and raised some money the second thing is those become you know your evangelist to spread the word and to come make the uh the pilgrimage to go see michael jordan's house and i think you could do two or three things with it i think you could make it a museum that's like a modern museum that we've been talking about like the museum of ice cream or something like that where the tour is very heavy um photo based and so you're you know you're going through and it's all these different photo exhibits of you know you in michael jordan's bed and you know wearing you know a pair of his air jordans or standing in a pair of giant air jordans or something like that and you make it like a museum of ice cream where you're going to walk out with you know 10 photos that are instagram worthy at the end of it i also think give give people background on an ice cream museum yeah you can pull the latest numbers but i think these guys uh raised it like a 100 million dollar plus valuation and if you if you ever go to one they're pretty cool it's you know it's not the most amazing thing i honestly i was a little bit disappointed but the photos do turn out cool it's a museum that you walk through uh so it's like a guided path and you go through maybe like 13 different rooms and every room is something cool and you get a little you know you get an ice cream cone of some flavor and then you can take photos next to some like exhibit that they've set up and the idea is not for you to look at the art like a traditional museum but for you to like take a photo in the art uh and post it on instagram and that's their marketing that's the free marketing that they get and so museum of ice cream oh yeah here everybody has it they raised 40 million they raised a 40 million dollar series a at a 200 million dollar valuation last year and um and i think this could be bigger i think this could be much much bigger as a brand um the other thing the other thing that you could do is uh sports cards are having this incredible boom right now and i think what you could do is you could have certain collectors put their collection um in in the house the house could be basically the vault to store some of the most rare memorabilia in the sports world sign basketball shoes and sports cards and that could be part of the museum and you you basically store it and you you store it for some of these collectors so i think i think there's a bunch of stuff you could do to make this work but the idea is like can you buy this thing for 13 million put another four or five million into um you know getting it all set up and then could you make five million dollars a year could you make 10 million dollars a year like you're saying these other guys do um as a pilgrimage for you know tourists going to chicago and basketball junkies i think the answer is definitely yes and i think it's so interesting um i found a i found another example of one and it's called the um it's called the national trust for historic preservation and it's a non-profit and all they do is buy um historical buildings and their historic i looked at their numbers they've been doing like 50 or 60 million in revenue for years and i'm still trying to figure out how to entirely read uh nonprofit statements but they have a buy a line item that's revenue less expenses which i guess that just means prop i mean i don't know how they define yeah i don't know how they define either of those but it was 26 million and it's been doing that for years is that nuts so i like this idea i like this idea a lot and i kind of want to dig a little further into how these um homes home museums work because i think this is pretty interesting the other good thing about this by the way is that the basketball hall of fame sucks nobody cares about it nobody goes to visit it all the other sports like you know canton for football these are like tourist destinations you know tons of people go there every year it's really cool and the basketball one is known to be super lame because they let way too many people in and um and it's not like it's not a thing that basketball fans really care to go do can i give you two more examples that we what we could consider doing instead of even doing a museum maybe this is even simpler yeah so i'm staying at my friend jack's house it's a badass house um five doors down or ten doors down something like that nearby is what's they call it the obama house and when obama was in office from uh when was he in office oh the oh the second the second term um or whatever it was he would stay at this house down here and the owners let them stay i think for a massive discount now it's like it has its own wikipedia page and it's called like the obama house and it sold 10 years ago for 7 million after he had already stayed there which sorry 7 million i said i say seven for seven million which is a lot of money but they rent it out right now on airbnb for six thousand dollars a night or if it's booked all the way up 180k a month and it's branded as the obama house i think that you could absolutely crush it with a jordan airbnb house would you and a group of friends be willing to pull together three thousand dollars a day to stay there maybe i think the way you'd have to do it is you'd have to make it like a vegas alternative for bachelor parties and stuff like that birthdays it's like what is the man cave man dream vacation it's like dude we're going to go stay in michael jordan's house 14 of us are going um and it comes with like all the amenities and you know all that stuff this is where you go this is where you want to go if you want to live like the sports fans dream i think you could do that i do like the museum one better what was the second idea you had you said you had two oh what wasn't the second i guess it was more so uh just another example the fresh prince of bel air house um it's it's kind of interesting but do you remember living in san francisco how there's like the what's it called the painted ladies which is the whole the full house house and then there's the missed out firehouse um i would just want to buy all these and turn them all into twitter so i lived a block away from the uh from the full house house and uh literally 24 7 there is somebody standing outside of that house during the daytime uh taking a photo of it so there's just a constant and it's not like it's not like a huge line of people but there's always like four people standing outside taking a photo in front of the full house house every single day for the whole year it's kind of crazy and then it just sold actually and it sold at basically like i think 1.5 or 2x the market rate in that area so um they got basically like a double premium because it is the full househouse which i think is you know kind of interesting um but okay i think we should uh i think we should buy michael jordan's house i think we should crowdfund uh i think we should crowdfund five thousand people together we should own this thing or we could go to rally road and we could say hey rally let's put michael jordan's house on rally and uh you know let's sell this baby out i think if five thousand right now with if you go on rally roads you'll get two thousand or three thousand people buying a fractional share of you know a pair of jordans or a signed autograph or a signed rookie card or something like that [ __ ] all that let's own the guy's house so i think you could easily get 5000 people on rally road to buy a fractional share of michael jordan's house i'm surprised they don't already do this if they're listening to this uh you know go go for it just give us credit and give me a share of the house i actually think that they wouldn't do that because how do you liquidate that it's been on the market for 20 or how long 10 years no one is obviously no one's buying it so like how do you get liquidity from that after seven years i don't think you don't i think the game here right the point of rally is that they take things that are not assets and they make them not liquid assets they make them liquid assets so because you can own a fractional share now there's liquidity any one person who owns a piece of michael jordan's house can swap it for anybody else who wants to own a piece of it so you don't need a 15 million dollar buyer because you can sell them in blocks of a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars and so when you bring that price point down there's people who want to own a piece of the a piece of the art a piece of the asset which is how they do like you know they'll sell um you know a harry potter first edition signed you know set of books and uh you know instead of selling it for 25 000 they'll get you know 2 000 investors to each put in whatever whatever the math comes out to 150 bucks to go buy uh you know to own a piece of that thing so they introduce liquidity by making it fractionally owned yes but there's still no cash flow you have to create an operation around this cash flow and there's no cash flow in a basketball card there's no cash flow and air jordans there's no cash flow and harry potter first asian investor willing to buy it no dude you're still thinking like the old world you haven't seen what's going on in raleigh you're staying with jack smith you should go ask jack smith about how this stuff works uh he's the one who who taught me and he's one of the biggest investors in this stuff he's not buying it for cash flow um you know he's buying it because yeah there are there is another there is another collector and when you make it fractional now way more people can get in on collecting it versus just the rich deep pocketed people who could buy the whole asset 100 percent yeah bro but who lik who liquidates it after a handful of years on rally road uh someone actually buys the car after a few years very rarely occasionally somebody comes and offers to buy out the whole the whole lot um and then they put it to a vote i don't know if you've seen this but like you know let's say a box of pokemon cards went on there uh like a super rare pokemon card set they i don't know what the ip what the ipo was but on rally the ipod let's pretend it was 50 000 and then what happened is a is a big you know asian investor came in and said we'll buy this thing out for 85 000 now so you'll all get a profit but we want to own this thing and they put it to the vote of all the share owners and they said no they said we're going to hold it we think it's going to go up so they voted no they voted to keep it uh so they're not all trying to liquidate um soon you know some some people who are buy and hold investors will want to own these assets for a long time because they think hey you know if i just hold this now you know what's michael jordan going to be what's michael jordan's fame going to be 20 years from now if michael jordan passes away how much is it going to be worth and there's people who are in it for the long term so i think there's i think the collectibles thing is a little bit different than i think about it differently than you do i would say you basically need jordan to have like a tragic accident or like for example dance came out so so the last dance is ten part documentary that came out on netflix and espn um you know millions and millions of people watch this thing and jordan's brand you could see all the price of jordans went up jordan's like brand visibility and brand sentiment went up because this documentary came out he's still alive it wasn't a tragic event but somebody told the jordan story to the the younger generation who own you know grew up where you know they were two years old when jordan was at his prime and so jordan brand got stronger with the last dance coming out and i think that's just going to continue you know over time because he's got all these different you know the legacy becomes bigger than the person itself [Music] you

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right i have to tell you about something interesting ben cue the music [Music] [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars all right billy of the week this person is not a billy but they're incredibly fascinating to me so i have been getting just targeted on youtube like crazy not from ads but for like things you also should watch because my first million there's this guy named alex hermozy have you seen this person yes dude this guy's all over my tick tock feed i see this buff [ __ ] in every tick tock every other swipe is this guy so who is this guy what's his story i will tell you he looks like an 80s cop had a baby with arnold schwarzenegger he's like mustache great mustache and just huge jacked like he looks like a good looking dude and very fascinating look he like right when you see him he stands out ben's pulling up a picture of him yeah i mean he's yoked and i've been getting these youtube videos from him everywhere like learn from me a guy who has a business that's doing nearly 100 million dollars a year in revenue and i'm like what this guy looks like he's 30 years old and i think he's 31. so let me tell you about this guy and let me preface this by saying i think this guy's legit but it's so it's almost too good to be true and so i'm like i wonder what the truth is right so and all right so his name's alex so basically he started out um when he was like 22 23 he opened up a gym he scaled that gym to three gyms still wasn't that good of a business met some folks at click funnels click funnels is a little bit multi-level marketing incredibly uh it's an incredibly just internet marketing i wouldn't say multi-level um it probably attract but it's it's it's it's it's the cousin of it uh you know they all go to the same family thanksgiving together yeah they're all they're all they all go to the same uh mormon church up in utah i would guarantee you that they let's just say they all know how to run a call center and so anyway he like learns about that guy learns about copywriting and then he meets one of the guys at the company and he says wait a minute you're opening gyms that's a horrible idea don't open gyms he was like your gym's good he goes yeah they're really successful but like the best gym isn't that successful and they said to him dude teach people how to open up a gym so he creates this thing called gym launch and gym launch is basically like a course that costs around 20k i saw somewhere that it was 16k then i heard somewhere else it was 20k so let's just say 16 to 20 thousand dollars and it's like a course but they like hold your hand and you meet with them like a mastermind it's a course that teaches gym owners how to improve their gym and well on top of that according to the website it's financial freedom okay sorry it's financial it's financial freedom and he's running these great ads and he's got really good copywriting and he's getting these people to um he he's getting his people to uh uh improve their gym whatever hold on can you go up to that founders section on the website what does that say we slept on the floor what does that say i want to read this that's what he says this story is he was like i was living in the gym because i didn't have any money gotcha okay gotcha so yeah i was a former gym owner who slept on the floor of his gym when it when it was full i couldn't acquire serve and retain enough customers over the next three years i became a spun or he became a sponge he experimented blah blah blah became great now he has gym launch okay go ahead okay and then from gym launch he launched another company called prestigelab so once he gets the gym owners coming to him he says hey like buy these supplements too like you should sell supplements at your at your gym we did all the work and we know which ones sell best and we're making them you can just go ahead and buy it from us then he starts this third company that says all right yeah two smart moves yeah then he starts a third company says okay you've got a gym one of the things that i told you was that you need more leads i'm going to create a lead company which i don't entirely understand what that means but it's kind of like a marketing company and somehow they send they maybe they set up your yelp and set up your google adsense they just they what they do is you search uh you know gym santa like gym near me san jose and then they're gonna they know that the gym owner is not buying that top click on google and they're gonna buy that they're gonna create a search engine they're gonna let you say put in your zip code we'll find a gym near you what's your email and then they'll pass the gym owner your email or your phone number and say you know pay us per person who's interested in a gym near you and so collectively these businesses these three things that i said are doing in the world of according to his videos and my research 70 to 80 million dollars a year in fact he just sold uh one of the businesses the gym launch and supplement business combined he sold 66 percent of it for 46 million dollars and in one of his talks he says over the last five years both through the sale of the company as well as dividends i've paid myself 72 million dollars and i thought that is nuts that is crazy that is crazy volume yeah and this like kind of blew my mind but there's another business so his wife has a business right or him and his wife they have another business like acquisitions i don't know man this is one of those guys that's just like prolific he's got a book on amazon he's done all this he's like steve bartlett whoever you're talking about he just like has his hands in so much [ __ ] i don't know how they have something called acquisition.com i was looking at this the other day because i saw a video on tic tac and i was like what's up with this is this real i was literally like it's so funny you did the research on this because i had jotted this down as like dig in find out and so what acquisition.com is basically like uh it says do you want to scale your business um you know i will three x the business uh uh three extra profits of a of 100 businesses that are doing what between one and 10 million ebitda per year that are service-based businesses um over the next five years if you want help scaling your company without giving up a majority interest click the purple button below and uh and then yeah it basically says the same kind of story that you were saying before and it's like how do you want to you want to learn from us here's my course here's my book here's my podcast here's my here's my uh like you know my link to join my accelerator or whatever but this i don't know if he's selling a course on acquisition.com or if he's just trying to get leads on small businesses he could buy because he bought one business and that's a photography business and i listed the name of it it's called like uh something fair um i'll find it but oh here it is scroll down to the bottom and chat you see fairies yeah enchanted fairs f a i uh and fairies sorry enchanted fairies uh that's like a photography business he bought is that crazy though i mean so this is like a pretty wild uh enterprise yeah and he um he actually has some pretty good stuff like i sent i because i sent to my team like i sent like i don't know 20 tick tocks out a day but to three people it's like this is the per okay so like i have my friend who i'm like i can send offensive funny things and actually you're in this bucket too or you're one of the few people that like i can send something that's like cancel-worthy if you think this is funny i can send it to you and i can send it to my brother-in-law that's what i do i send it to both of those people like i'll tell you what this is bad but it was like there's this twitter account i follow that's like a like a meme accounting like 200 000 followers and he tweeted out he goes men's mental health is not important you follow up tweet he goes he goes just get more that was his tweet and i'm like i know it's like a fart joke it's like i shouldn't think this is funny but it cracked me up because it's so anti my silicon valley timeline which is just like so super progressive everything matters everything is justice for everybody like it's nice to just hear like where i'm from in houston like i went to like a pretty like ghetto school growing up and like the sense of humor that's like from that it just like hits home for me potty jokes yeah just like you know it's just like it's like you don't bring you don't bring your pronouns to the hood type of thing and so there's this like good humor that i just find really funny anyway so so you and this guy that's like my inappropriate jokes and there's like you know i'll send my wife or my sister just like kind of like ah that's funny kid stuff mom stuff whatever and then there's like little business or marketing hack tactics that like i think are actually pretty interesting so this guy alex to me uh one of the reasons i suspected he's legit is because his advice is actually pretty legit yeah um and he's not just saying general like motivational quotes so for example you say something like uh he's like little sales thing that helps and these are tick tocks right there's like 10 seconds you don't have to like invest much in it it's like he's like little sales trick that kind of helps me getting somebody to say yes is hard it's like a commitment so if i'm like so would you like to to sign up it's like uh let me think about it let me get back to you that's like on like what you'll get frequently he's like i'll ask a no commitment so i'll say you know um if we're able to work out the details would you be opposed to actually signing up with us and they're like no i'm not opposed to that like no i'm not against it and actually this is something that when i heard it i was like oh actually i've kind of like accidentally done this a couple times and you know that's a good point there's something there in the psychology cool noted and like i'll pick up these little things from him and like five other people that are like you know in this copywriting sales persuasion world then i just think those are interesting to me so i actually think this guy's uh legit for that reason even though like people look down on like lead gen they look down on course businesses like there's a stigma around course businesses which is like oh you probably couldn't do it that's why you're selling courses let me change let me clarify how i feel i think he's legit and he seems like a decent guy and he for sure seems like a smart guy i don't know i don't know him well but he seemed like a really nice guy but he's in a shady industry not a shady industry he's in an industry with a lot of shady people not that he's shady but supplements and like selling this type of stuff his courses yeah yeah not of course he i don't know if he's shitty i'm just saying there are shady people and also it's a twenty thousand dollar course and i frankly don't think i've got the hutzpah to sell that to someone on the phone yeah uh like it's that's really bold and frankly i find it to be challenging so i wouldn't say that i think he's shady i'm just saying that like that world has a lot of players who are yeah yeah yeah i'm with you yeah i don't think you said anything naked i think we were actually quite complimentary towards him but um okay i like that [Music] you

Sam Parr (@TheSamParr) and Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) discuss the surprising economics of vending machines and how some people are making millions from them.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I see vending machines on our thing and I I think that a vending machine business is probably the most predictable simple understandable guaranteed type of business you could do is that what you're going to yes so these uh two folks came to me and they pitched this idea they're raising money for it it's a vending machine business uh for it basically is mostly female products so tampons and stuff in uh bathrooms and oddly enough I had another guy email me a deck about a vending machine business and I'm not going to do that one but this first one was kind of intriguing they've got some traction they're making money it's kind of intriguing and I started doing some research and I tweeted out who knows everything about who's the person need talked about vending machine it got a ton of traction for some reason I think guess a lot of people are interested in in this this guy named Quinn Miller reached out to me and I did a call with him this morning very fascinating he worked and I and I just want to bring this up because this is the exact opposite of what we were just talking about but it's oddly as compelling and as interesting even though it's the two totally different uh parts of the world so guy he's 27 he worked in software sales he quit about a year ago to start this business he's got a vending machine business and he gave me all his numbers and he said I could reveal it so he's about 10 months into the thing he's currently doing $155,000 in monthly revenue and he's doing that across 27 machines his startup costs were $600 $500 or $400 to buy a machine and $200 to fix it and move it to the place where it had to go by the way this is our weekly Blue Collar side hustle this is the perfect Blue Collar side hustle yeah so on the 15,000 in Revenue 65% is profit so he's doing around uh 97 $9,800 a month in profit so far total investment into the biz so far after he already bought his first machine has been $50,000 time involvement per week relatively High 20 hours a week because he's actually delivering all the stuff I asked him all about it I was like how does this work because the reason I reached out to this guy was I was like hey uh there's this like tampon startup it kind of looks interesting what's your tampon vending machine startup what's your opinion he goes yeah I mean I obviously don't know anything about that like too much but basically my opinion is the world uh he goes America runs on coke and Monster Energy drink and I was like what do you mean he goes let me let me explain so I put these vending machines love that I so let's slow down so so the guy basically buys vending machines like you and I are used to just a snack vending machine nothing nothing Innovative there well he does one quote Innovative thing um he puts a he installs a credit card machine on him for about 250 bucks you can get a credit card machine get he's a vending machine he says all right people aren't carrying quarter so I'm going to take cards he puts them uh he puts them so he buys each machine you said for five 500 bucks that the first one was 500 he has 27 machines uh with 50k so whatever that math is so what's that 2K a machine roughly yeah okay so he buys a th000 to $2,000 machine he puts it in places like what Office Buildings apartment yeah so he Co calls uh lower income hotels uh motels Assisted Living places and and and uh low income apartments so sorry low income apartments Dash or comma motels comma Assisted Living places okay great and and so he he goes and he basically says hey put this here and he there's a revenue split or he pays rent how does that work so most of these businesses the way that they work is they give 10% to 20% to the real estate folk right uh this guy he goes I actually and because I sold software I'm pretty good at sales and I do what's called a value sale and he goes basically I say look your tenants are are if I just improve your tenant experience by just a small percent maybe you're going to make more money because someone will want to stay or want to rent here he gives them nothing he gives them nothing so he keeps and so he's got a bunch of machines in like 10 different locations and he just cold calls him and then it's so unsophisticated where does he get his stuff Costco so he buys a can of Coke from Costco for 33 cents and he charges a dollar for it right uh it's very simple uh not complicated At All by the way my grandfather used to have a vending machine so this was probably the first business I ever encountered was I think I was probably 5 years old and my parents you know they worked so my dad would work in an office building and he needed me to be babysat but then like you know old people also kind of need babysitting so my dad went for a two for one he basically bought or rented out a a little like kind of like a corner store inside like like a little Deli inside of the uh office building and um and then my my grandfather ran it and we used to go like work to register at the age of you know seven um and he was like baby baby he basically he occupied his Grand grandparents and his kids without having to like do any pay for any like caretakers in fact it made a little bit of money and then my grandfather had this vending machine that we used to go and do this exact refill we would go to Costco buy the cokes put it in he would collect a bag of like change and then we would like go to the bank and like exchanged the change and I remember being like what is this he had one vending machine as his business it's sounds awesome and I asked the guy uh by the way this guy's name is Quinn Miller I'll give him a shout out Quinn Miller I asked him I go how big can this get he goes look I'm not trying to be offensive or anything but the operators of these businesses typically are pretty hillbilly um and so they're pretty unsophisticated which doesn't mean they're dumb they're just not sophisticated in terms of like technology or anything like that and they like just want a low-key easy life he goes but I met a guy in Palm Springs who had about 1,600 machines and he was making anywhere from five to 10 million in Revenue with about half in profit right and I was like wow that's pretty amazing how else can it get big like what else is big and he said that there's a company called canteen and I looked it up I I I think it's public uh but they do like 15 billion in sales of this and they're the largest vending machine company in America they operate them yeah and they do distribution so the thing is is like what this guy does uh Quinn he he finds he finds his route so he finds a route so he's like all right if I go from destination A to B it's a straight line I'll do everything in between and so I try to find locations on the way so one truck can do all of it in a in an easy short amount of time and he's like I'm very spe specific about where I choose and that's where you make a lot of money is you can be very efficient with your time and so basically that's what he does and he said this company canteen just does that on a huge scale and they're ultimately at the end of the day a logistics company uh and a bit of a supply chain company but at this point Quinn told me he was like I rented a small warehouse now because I'm getting so much freaking Coke he goes the reason I like doing that and and so back to tampons he goes you have to like look at what the repeat purchase rate is he goes if I go to like a lower income area these folks love Coke and love Monster to the point that one guy will drink five Cokes a day I'm getting $5 from them you have to ask yourself can you get that for uh tampons or or other products and he goes in fact a lot of the vending guys once they move from Coke and Monster Energy they're starting to go what's into what's called honesty market so basically at a Wei work you know how they like you swipe your credit card and you only take one sandwich for $8 yeah he's like that's where the money is right now huh that's interesting and um yeah so it's almost like there's whales for the vending machine it's not like everybody buys one every three days it's like one guy drinks nine Cokes a day um or you know four red bulls you know a week and that's where you make your money is on the like 10% of the of the residents who buy like 90% of the goods or something like that probably yeah this guy was interesting man he's only 27 he's the he lives in San Diego worked in Tech sales he told me that um he goes like basically I'm a pretty he goes I'm pretty I was pretty good at selling software um I'm not the best but I'm pretty good and this industry that I went into they're just kind of not that great at that many stuff and I could out sell relatively easily I could kind of outwork relatively easily and so anyway fascinating story [Music]

Shaan Puri (@ShaanVP) and Sam Par (@TheSamParr) talk about billionaire Sam Bankman and his surprising rise from obscurity to tens of billions of dollars.

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
this one is very interesting have you ever heard of this guy before don't don't google i want to tell you the story so don't don't google this guy all right let me tell you the story i'm just i i google them i'm just thinking oh wow okay yeah uh young guy young guy 29 years old i don't know name is wow sam bankman freed i think it's the way you say his name and uh when you if you heard him talk like i actually want you to listen to a youtube video for a second because he sounds like you know an absolute dweeb and i loved it i was like oh this guy sounds like he would be a self-made billionaire by the age of 29 because he sounds like a genius he sounds like a tech genius have you brought this person up to me before no i just discovered him like two days ago okay so what's this guy's story so this guy you know i'll just come sam for short but uh so this guy's sam he's a he he's a young guy he's very smart um he takes a job as kind of like a hedge fund trader or something like that with a group called jane street i guess and uh i don't know forget these details they don't really matter guys got a job in finance and um he leaves and he starts something called alameda research and it's called alameda research because he needed it to sound as legit as possible and not like what it actually was so what was it so what this guy did was he was into crypto and there was this known thing in crypto where as crypto was getting popular this is around 2017 when the first big run-up happened and bitcoin went you know from three thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars and it crashed later but during that time 2016 2017-2018 bitcoin was emerging and there was this as any new thing there's these like kind of uh it's like the wild wild west a little bit and so there was this thing where in the u.s the price of bitcoin was let's say ten thousand dollars of bitcoin and in other countries where um the exchanges weren't built or the com the country had some regulations or whatever there was like a premium for bitcoin there was more demand than there was bitcoin available to buy in those countries uh because you need like let's say like in korea there was a famous uh thing called the kimchi the kimchi premium and the kimchi premium was that in korea there wasn't uh kimchi like the uh like the the food so this was known as the kimchi premium and basically it was like uh whatever bitcoin was selling for here let's say it was ten thousand dollars in korea it was trading for fifteen thousand dollars because it was that big it was about 50 premium and it fluctuated obviously and i think 30 was kind of like the average of the kimchi premium over time so everybody wanted this so everybody you know any smart person saw oh wow there's an arbitrage what if i could just buy it in the u.s for 10 grand and immediately sell it in korea for 15 grand or for 30 you know 13 grand and so you had this like ability to flip it and so a whole bunch of people were trying to do this but there was all these problems right like well the reason you know the reason wasn't the reason there was this premium is because it was hard to buy bitcoin in korea so one idea was you buy it in the us off the us exchange you go to korea and you sell it but you're gonna sell it for in the korean you know wan which is like the local currency but now you need to like for the for the arbitrage to continue you have to convert the korean wan back to dollars to go buy more go buy more bitcoin in the u.s the problem was you can't convert the korean wand back to dollars easily because the government was very like tight fisted regulations you couldn't funnel large amounts of money from the korean wand back to dollars very very easily so a whole bunch of people were trying to get this like pinata of money and they couldn't crack it and what this guy did was he was like okay the kimchi premium he went for the japan premium which was far less appealing it was only 10 but he's like still if i can if i could trade a us bitcoin for 10 more in japan every day i'm making 10 compounding daily and so he went through this like odyssey where for like a year all he's doing is setting up this trade so he like for actually by the way first when he was trying to figure out could i capture the kimchi premium he was like doing calculations like if i filled up if i charted a private plane and i filled it up with a hundred people and i flew you know they buy bitcoin in the us i flew them all to korea and then they you know sell it there and then i could each one of them could convert some amount of that money and i could fly them back and every day i could fly this plane back and forth between us and korea like could i make it work and he was like i don't think it works so wait so you had to be there physically it's not that you had to be there physically you have to do all like all legs of the transaction so you have to be able to buy in korea or like sell your bitcoin in korea at the premium but now you have korean won now you need to convert that to dollars and so how do you do that you need to convert it there but there's caps they won't let you convert it because the way he described it is like look he's like what i wanted to do essentially was to be you know selling five million dollars of bitcoin for the local currency and converting five million of local currency back to us dollars every day it's like if you if you just go to like go to korea go to japan go to wherever and you say hey i'd like to it's like a one-way flow of money i have five million dollars of your local currency i'd like to convert it to dollars and exit the country um and they're like okay but where are you getting all this money and why are you doing such a large amount like what is this yeah he's like you know if you if you go to bank school 101 that's like money laundering that's what money laundering looks like that that is what money laundering that is exactly what money laundering looks like so he's like even though i'm not money laundering i'm buying and selling a good that's differently priced in different regions to them on the ground to the bank on the ground where i need to do these conversions it's shady it's too shady they won't let me do it so he spends like a year of his life where he's like goes to japan now he's got to find uh he's got to do each each one of these was hard so anyways then the net end of this story is this guy's arbitraging 25 million dollars a day of of this currency he's making a 10 compounding uh you know margin every single day and this guy you know in the three years basically he's become a self-made billionaire he's worth 10 billion dollars now which is a combination of the money he made from the arbitrage trade as well as he then created his own exchange um and like you know so he has a trading company that's you know has made hundreds of millions of dollars on this arbitrage and then he built he used that to create an exchange which is worth billions of dollars on paper so anyways this guy's worth 10 billion dollars he and his because uh the currency is called ftx right that's his exchange his exchange called fps sorry sorry exchange and uh that is is that basically an alternative to basically a more higher end it's a more sophisticated coinbase where you can do like derivatives trades option trades on all different types of courses internationally and that's like and that's like a proper company it's a proper company with like so follow me on research made hundreds of millions of dollars in the span of a few months just doing this one trade over and over again every day so i'm going to describe a couple things but he got on people's radar because he was the biggest donor to joe biden this year in the campaign he wrote a he wrote like a five million dollar check at the last hour like at the 11th hour that let joe do like you know as part of this like you know last minute blitz they did on tv ads in all the swing states uh because this is kind of interesting this guy's like very uh his whole business philosophy is this thing called effective altruism which is basically like go be a greedy capitalist go try to make as much money as you can and your goal is to give at least half of it away while you're doing it so he's got like it's not like a philanthropist giving away one percent of his money or 10 of his money as a tie his goal is giving away like 50 of his liquid liquid like net worth you know like that he makes every year that's his like kind of like his mindset where did he get the money to start this so he started it with a very small amount of money and it just compounded very quickly because he's basically like getting 10 extra every day so i i don't know exactly where he got the initial seed capital or how big it was he hasn't specified that but he did say at the max they were doing 25 million a day on the trade which is basically like a 2.5 million like you know like profit per day uh that they were making on the trade and so he describes that okay so what he's like basically if you want to do this you have to like break it down into small chunks he's like okay so i need on one side i need to be able to go buy a ton of bitcoin in the u.s so how do i get uh exchange in the u.s that's going to give me really high limits even though i'm this dorky kid who's got no track record and i have no like collateral or brand name and so he's like finds a way to solve that problem of like being able to buy 25 million dollars of bitcoin in the u.s then he had to like go to japan and he had to be able to sell a huge amount of bitcoin there then he had to be able to convert it from the japanese yen or whatever to us dollars and he had to do that all in the same day and wire transfer it all back to the us to buy it again the next day to buy the full max amount again the next day so he's just just like the money every day and so he described like they would just the way that the timing worked it was always in the last hour of the banking day that he would be trying to get all the wire transfers done to get the money back to the u.s so that they could execute tomorrow's trade and any day that they could what does this sound like you said he sounds crazy like i'm looking at pictures oh my god he sounds extremely genuine humble high-pitched voice kind of like just a nerdy guy um who was like he accounted for about 10 of all the bitcoin trading himself his alameda research during that time period i believe which is just like insane because he was moving so much money dude i love these people i love i love freaks [Music] you
